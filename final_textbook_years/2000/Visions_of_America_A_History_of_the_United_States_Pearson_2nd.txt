hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 on the morning of september 11 2001 19 young arab men boarded four planes on the east coast.
all belonged to the islamic extremist organization known as al qaeda.
within half an hour after take off they stormed the cockpits of their planes with box cutters and mace killed the american pilots and installed their own pilots who had each received flight instruction in private american aviation schools to fly the planes into predetermined targets.
at 8 46 a m the first plane plowed into the north tower of the world trade center in new york city an internationally recognized landmark that symbolized american dominance over the world economy.
seventeen minutes later a second plane hit the south tower.
the nation now understood that what had first looked like a tragic accident was actually a coordinated attack against the united states.
a third plane crashed into the pentagon headquarters of the u s department of defense in virginia the building most closely associated with u s military might in the eyes of the world.
meanwhile passengers in the fourth hijacked plane reached the cockpit and prevented the terrorists from flying the plane into the capitol a worldwide symbol of democratic government.
this plane instead crashed into a pennsylvania field.
the blazing world trade center towers quickly crumbled with the office workers and firefighters still inside the buildings as onlookers ran for cover.
the skeletal ruins and mountains of debris became the burial site for thousands.
one onlooker echoed the nations sense of disbelief this is america.
how can it happen in america.
how the 9 11 attacks as they came to be known reshaped the ongoing debate about americas role in the world and the best way to protect american citizens.
only 20 years earlier americans had savored their victory in the cold war as communist governments in eastern europe and the soviet union collapsed.
when the cold war ended americans believed that their nation would take the lead in creating a new world order even as they disputed how best to spread democracy protect the u s economy and flex the nations military muscle.
enjoying prosperity for most of the 1990s the country paid little attention to the new threat that loomed before the worlds sole remaining superpower terrorist strikes by antiamerican islamist extremists such as al qaeda.
political debate instead centered on whether the liberal or conservative vision of government would prevail at home.
after 9 11 president george w bush moved with resolve to restore the image of america as a powerful and triumphant nation.
he led the country into two wars the first in afghanistan the second far more controversial in iraq.
in 2008 americans provided a different sort of history making moment by electing the first african american president of the united states.
by then the worst financial crisis since the great depression posed an additional challenge for the nation.
none of us will ever forget this day yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world president george w bush speaking to the nation on the evening of september 11 2001 chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 a moment rich with promise on his inauguration day in 1989 george h w bush announced that he had become president at a moment rich with promise the fall of communism throughout eastern europe and the soviet union within the next two years seemed to confirm this judgment.
however the end of the cold war did not mean peace the united states immediately fought two short wars in panama and the persian gulf.
conflict also arose at home as a huge federal deficit and simmering racial tensions that occasionally exploded into violence left some feeling that americas promise lay unfulfilled.
the election of 1988 the son of a former connecticut senator george h w bush served as a congressman ambassador central intelligence agency cia director and vice president before becoming the republican candidate for president in 1988.
in this sense the decorated world war ii pilot and former oilman was the ultimate insider a man familiar with the corridors of power in washington and the exclusive private clubs where financial deals were negotiated.
a moderate republican with a patrician style bush never projected the same charisma or the passion for conservative causes that had drawn voters to ronald reagan the man he hoped to follow as president.
bushs campaign had to overcome these obstacles when he faced massachusetts democratic governor michael dukakis in the presidential contest.
when dukakis proposed increased spending on health care education and housing the bush team ridiculed the democrat as a big spending liberal and began calling him the governor of taxachusetts in his stump speeches bush also tapped into white peoples fears of so called black criminality by frequently mentioning willie horton an african american prisoner who had taken advantage of a weekend furlough program in massachusetts and gone on a crime rampage that included raping a white woman.
adding to his woes dukakis made critical missteps including one ill advised photo op during which he donned an oversized helmet and military jumpsuit to ride a tank 29 1.
most americans felt that the photo made dukakis look ridiculous not presidential.
by election day bush had defined dukakis as someone who would raise taxes and let criminals out of jail and was a failed photo op seeking to appear like a commander in chief 1988 democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis was instead ridiculed for riding around in a tank in a suit and tie.
how did george h w bush prevail in the 1988 presidential election.
read the document george h w bush inaugural address 1989 moment rich with promise unprepared to be commander in chief.
he defeated dukakis 426 to 111 in the electoral college capturing 53 percent of the popular vote.
popular revolts against communism when bush became the 41st president of the united states in 1989 the former director of the cia remained suspicious about soviet premier mikhail gorbachevs true motives for instituting internal reforms and reaching out to the united states see chapter 28.
officials worried that gorbachev was attempting to kill us with kindness according to national security advisor brent scowcroft.
gorbachev was equally distrustful of bush and his inner circle these people were brought up in the years of the cold war and still do not have any foreign policy alternative caught off guard by the quick demise of communism in eastern europe within a year bush had changed his mind about gorbachev by 180 degrees in the first sign of the upheaval to come communist hungary decided to take down the barbed wire fence between it and democratic austria in may 1989.
the east german government watched in dismay as thousands of its citizens drove to the hungarian austrian border and then walked across to defect to the west.
turning to moscow for help east germany received a surprising reply we cant do anything about it a similarly uncharacteristic soviet reaction greeted news that candidates from the democratic polish workers union solidarity had won control of polands new bicameral parliament forming the first democratic government in postwar eastern europe.
this is entirely a matter to be decided by poland a soviet official announced.
soviet hungarian and polish leaders lifted restrictions on speech voting and economic activity to save their communist regimes unleashing a tide of popular revolt against communist rule that soon overwhelmed them.
perhaps nowhere did the fall of communism come faster and more unexpectedly than in east germany.
on november 9 1989 a botched news conference by a harried east german official triggered the destruction of the berlin wall.
instead of announcing a relaxation in rules governing travel between east and west berlin a confused east german official mistakenly told the press that starting immediately east germans could freely leave through any of the border crossings electrified by the news that the wall was open thousands of people gathered at armed crossing points places where over 175 east germans had been shot trying to cross over the last 28 years see chapter 24.
when confused guards opened the gates streams of east germans poured across and joined with west germans to rejoice atop the berlin wall.
images as history the fall of the berlin wall page 878 examines the media images that shaped americans reactions to this event.
further evidence of televisions power to mold history came in the following days as thousands of east berliners headed for downtown department stores in west berlin.
concrete walls had not prevented east berliners from viewing american sitcoms dubbed in german showing the abundance of goods available in the west.
television stoked desires for worksaving gadgets well stocked pantries attractive surroundings and a touch of luxury one reporter contended helped bring the berlin wall down.
gorbachevs refusal to intervene with armed force was also critical.
within a year east and west germany had reunified into one democratic nation an american goal since the cold war began in the late 1940s.
by the end of 1989 the soviet union no longer dominated eastern europe losing territory that it had controlled since the end of world war ii.
one by one the individual states that formed the soviet union also demanded their independence secession movements that gorbachev tried to squash with economic embargos and occasionally troops.
desperate to stop the hemorrhaging hard line communist insiders orchestrated a coup attempt in august 1990.
they put president gorbachev under house arrest in his vacation home and ringed the soviet parliament in moscow with troops and tanks.
hesitating the coup leaders lost the militarys support and the overthrow attempt failed.
with the populace now demanding economic reforms and communist party officials blaming gorbachev for losing control he resigned as head of the communist party on august 24 1990.
five days later the soviet communist party itself was dissolved.
by december 25 1991 he was also no longer president as the soviet union ceased to exist and all its member states including russia became independent nations.
after decades of trying to contain weaken and defeat the soviet union the united states declared victory in the cold war.
the soviet union did not simply lose the cold war the western democracies won bush announced.
what role did ordinary citizens play in ending communism in east germany and the soviet union.
chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 images as history the fall of the berlin wall photographs of berlin had already punctuated key moments in the cold war for americans including images of the 1948 1949 berlin airlift and the walls construction in 1961 to prevent east berliners from defecting to west berlin see chapter 24.
presidents john f kennedy and ronald reagan had made welldocumented pilgrimages to the site where they publicly denounced the berlin wall as a symbol of communist oppression.
now from the comfort of their living rooms tv viewing americans watched as east and west berliners climbed atop the wall throughout the night on november 9 1989 to demand the reunification of their divided city.
the fall of communism in europe reinforced american faith in the superiority of capitalism over communism but some commentators urged the united states to undertake economic reforms at home to ensure that capitalism operated more fairly.
what competing views do this photograph and political cartoon offer americans about the importance of the berlin wall falling.
what counter arguments could critics offer.
what symbolic importance did the fall of the berlin wall have.
after the evening celebrations east german guards reclaimed the top of the wall and impassively watched german civilians attack the graffitiladen western side of the wall with chisels and hammers.
president bush told the press that he had no desire to dance on the wall worried that any gloating might goad gorbachev into sealing up the wall or prompt soviet hardliners to overthrow gorbachev.
both reporters and ordinary people brought cameras to document this historic moment.
the image of one man destroying the wall piece by piece with his hammer resonated with americans it symbolized the ability of common people to make history and their desire to collect pieces of the wall as souvenirs.
attacking the berlin wall with a hammer would the fall of communism usher in a better world.
many americans believed so but cartoonist pat oliphant offered a competing view by implying that free market capitalism did not always benefit everyone equally.
the befuddlement of the hungry homeless man dressed in rags suggests that there is no we in the united states rich and poor view events like the fall of the berlin wall differently.
pat oliphant questions the triumph of capitalism over communism many americans celebrated the fall of the berlin wall as a triumph of the nations democratic capitalist vision over a competing autocratic anti capitalist communist one.
in the 1980s the number of homeless people living and begging on the streets grew to a level not seen in urban america since the progressive era.
view the closer look images as history the fall of the berlin wall moment rich with promise the u s battle against communism was not over however.
on the other side of the world the chinese communist regime made different choices when faced with a popular revolt.
in april 1989 university students occupied tiananmen square in central beijing to protest the removal of a high ranking communist official who had called for economic and political reforms.
behind closed doors chinese communist officials debated whether to end the demonstrations with troops or adopt a gorbachev like approach and accommodate some of the students demands.
on the morning of june 4 tanks appeared in tiananmen square signaling that discussion within the inner circle had ended.
troops shot hundreds as they cleared the area of protesters.
two days later a lone man walking down the deserted avenue of eternal peace made a solitary gesture of defiance by standing steadfast in the middle of the street as 17 tanks approached.
when the lead tank swerved right to avoid hitting him the man stepped right.
when it swerved left he stepped left.
finally the tanks stopped and the man jumped onto the first one shouting to its driver why are you here.
my city is in chaos because of you associated press photographer jeff widener captured this encounter in an award winning photo seen on newspaper front pages around the globe 29 2.
americans hailed tank man as he became known for his inspirational defense of peace and human rights.
no one in china however except for the bystanders who whisked him away and the chinese authorities who probably executed him ever knew of this encounter.
as the economic relationship between the united states and china changed chinas violent suppression of democracy movements provoked competing visions over how to proceed.
in 1900 america wanted to sell china goods by 1990 american companies increasingly outsourced manufacturing jobs to china using cheap chinese labor to satiate american consumers demands for affordable goods.
some critics argued that by helping the chinese government improve the standard of living for ordinary citizens americans were also bolstering the autocratic communist regime.
others countered that recent events in eastern europe demonstrated that exposing chinese citizens to western values and goods would sow the seeds for an eventual democratic and capitalist revolution.
a third faction worried that a prosperous and industrially strong china might replace the united states as the worlds strongest power.
29 2 standing up for democracy in china 1989 two days after the chinese military brutally suppressed a popular rebellion in tiananmen square a lone man stopped army tanks in their tracks the world cheered his courageous stand.
why did popular uprisings against communism in europe and china have different outcomes.

the growing trade deficit with china the united states bought more than it sold was only one economic issue troubling americans during the bush years.
read my lips no new taxes bush had proclaimed during the 1988 campaign.
once in office however he reneged on his pledge by raising income taxes.
faced with the largest deficit in american history the result of increased defense spending during the reagan years without any corresponding tax increases and bushs own decision to bail out the failing savings and loan industry in 1989 see chapter 28 he saw no other option.
his decision angered many conservative republicans and some never forgave him.
read my lips i lied ran one new york post headline.
the combination of a huge deficit and an unfriendly democratic majority in congress discouraged bush from proposing dramatic new domestic initiatives.
a revolution of sorts nonetheless occurred when bush signed the americans with disabilities act a 1990 civil rights law that prohibited discrimination against the disabled in employment public accommodations and telecommunications.
the disabled gained unprecedented freedom of movement as legally required elevators ramps and sloped curbs became commonplace.
which gender and racial issues dominated the headlines in the early 1990s.
during the campaign bush had courted the conservative wing of the republican party by promising to appoint like minded judges.
he fulfilled this pledge by nominating a conservative african american judge clarence thomas to the supreme court when thurgood marshall the courts first african american justice retired.
controversy erupted when anita hill a former colleague accused thomas of sexual harassment and thomas responded by calling the televised confirmation hearings a high tech lynching the senate ultimately confirmed thomas by a narrow majority in 1991.
with workplace sexual harassment front page news an unprecedented number of women won congressional seats in the 1992 elections including the first female african american senator carol mosley braun a democrat from illinois.
while the thomas hearings exposed gender discord the 1991 los angeles riots brought simmering racial and ethnic tensions to the surface.
in march a 78 mile car chase along los angeles freeways ended with white police brutally beating rodney king an african american when he resisted arrest for speeding.
a nearby resident captured the incident on film but americans differed on what the video revealed 29 3.
most blacks and some sympathetic whites saw a poorly trained and racist police force that harassed blacks echoing complaints that had set off the watts riots in 1965 see chapter 27.

television networks continuously aired footage of black youths assaulting a white truck driver but paid little attention to the asian american owned stores that blacks and latinos ransacked as payback for allegedly having refused to serve or hire young men of color.
yemen arab republic yemen bush did not propose any new initiatives to address gender racial or ethnic inequities his real interest lay in foreign affairs.
as he contemplated the new role that the united states should assume in a post cold war world bush moved to address a festering problem close to home.
his administration felt particularly uneasy about returning the panama canal in 2000 see chapter 28 to a panamanian dictator who ruthlessly suppressed political opponents and oversaw lucrative drug trafficking schemes.
in december 1989 bush launched operation just cause the largest american military campaign since the vietnam war to remove manuel noriega from power.
the panamanian invasion continued the nations long tradition of maintaining central america as a u s sphere of influence.

bush faced the severest test of his administration when iraqi dictator saddam hussein whose nations oil fields supplied 11 percent of global oil exports invaded the neighboring nation of kuwait a small country that provided 9 percent of the worlds oil on august 2 1990 29 4.
the 1979 carter doctrine see chapter 28 had already established the oil rich persian gulf as a region vital to national economic and strategic interests.
throughout the 1980s iranian financed terrorist attacks and hostage crises in lebanon convinced the u s government that the fundamentalist islamic government in iran not iraq posed the major threat in the persian gulf.
during the eightyear iraq iran war the united states supplied iraq with weapons and intelligence.
oil rich arab nations including saudi arabia and kuwait had also lent iraq billions of dollars to prevent iranian revolutionary religious fervor from spreading to their kingdoms.
when the war ended inconclusively in 1988 after nearly one million combatant deaths saddam demanded that arab nations forgive iraqs debt.
he harbored particular animosity against 29 4 america and the middle east 1980 2003 the united states fought two major wars against iraq one in 1991 and the other beginning in 2003.
what problems did the united states face in the middle east from 1980 2003.
chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 kuwait which he accused of exporting too much oil and depressing world oil prices thereby hurting the iraqi financial recovery from the war.
when kuwait refused his demands saddam declared that kuwait had historically been part of iraq and invaded.
after the iraqi army easily overran kuwait president bush rushed american troops and ships to saudi arabia.
operation desert shield the president assured the public was solely a defensive measure to prevent iraq from attacking saudi arabia.
after saddam announced that he was annexing kuwait bush began to question whether a purely defensive strategy was enough.
now in control of 20 percent of the worlds oil overnight iraq became a major rival of saudi arabia which had 26 percent of global oil supplies.
with the president now contemplating war general colin powell chair of the joint chiefs of staff urged bush to follow the rules of military engagement established in the reagan years.
the powell doctrine asserted that america should go to war only as a last resort when the president had full support from the nation and the international community could employ overwhelming military force to win without serious loss of american life and had a clear exit strategy.
to amass overwhelming military strength bush sent secretary of state james baker on a diplomatic tour to build an international coalition that eventually included 34 nations.
bush secured a united nations un resolution authorizing military action if saddam did not withdraw by january 15 1991.
with saudi arabia agreeing to serve as the staging ground for the invasion nearly 500 000 u s troops and 65 warships made their way to the persian gulf.
the powell doctrine called for more than overwhelming force it also required enthusiastic support from the american people for an overseas military campaign.
bush faced stiff opposition from congressional democrats who argued that the president a former texas oilman was primarily interested in protecting the lucrative profits of his former oil business associates who imported oil from the persian gulf.
instead of war democrats promoted a competing vision that relied on economic sanctions to force hussein to withdraw.
bush countered that husseins atrocities against his own people notably his 1988 poison gas attacks against kurdish villagers in northern iraq made him worse than hitler echoing bushs claim this political cartoon 29 5 showed saddam holding a paper labeled kuwait takeover as he looked into the mirror and asked adolf hitlers smiling reflection howm i doing bush a decorated world war ii veteran reminded americans that the worlds failure to act when hitler began his expansionist drive in 1938 had led to world war ii.
if an emboldened saddam next attacked saudi arabia he would control nearly half of the worlds oil reserves.
bush also claimed that saddam was actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons and if he succeeded he would be unstoppable.
these arguments did not sway democrats.
with a vote split mostly along partisan lines congress voted to authorize war according to the terms spelled out in the un resolution.
when the un deadline for withdrawal passed the american led un coalition attacked iraq the next day.
once the fighting started public debate ceased and americans rallied around the flag.
the persian gulf war unfolded in two phases.
in the 29 5 mirror mirror on the wall howm i doing first phase u s forces bombed this 1990 political cartoon supported president george h w bushs iraqi installations in kuwait claim that iraqi dictator saddam hussein was a modern day hitler.
how did the powell doctrine influence bushs preparations for war against iraq in 1991.
read the document george bush allied military action in the persian gulf 1991 moment rich with promise and major cities in iraq for 39 days.
in kuwait the massive bombing terrified many poorly trained occupying iraqi soldiers and nearly one quarter of the 400 000 man force deserted.
a news team from the cable television news network cnn stayed in baghdad the capital of iraq throughout the bombing and each night americans watched their own nations missiles streak across the sky and explode.
the bombing destroyed iraqs power grid water treatment plants radio and television stations and roads hampering its military activities but also leaving civilians without power or clean water.
with iraqi defenses in shambles from the air attacks the wars second phase began when ground troops attacked the iraqi forces occupying kuwait on february 23 1991.
general norman schwarzkopf led coalition forces during operation desert storm a massive assault that soundly defeated the iraqi army within four days pushing it out of kuwait.
when american soldiers crossed into iraq bush abruptly halted the fighting.
the war had lasted a total of 42 days.
the war beyond its original goal bushs approval ratings soared to 89 percent.
the un peace agreement prohibited saddam from rearming or acquiring nuclear weapons restrictions enforced by un inspectors who stayed in iraq until 1998.
the establishment of no fly zones over shiite and kurdish areas stopped saddam and his sunni dominated government from launching aerial attacks against these minorities within his own nation.
the un also instituted an oil embargo to prevent him from acquiring funds to reconstitute his nuclear weapons program.
critics charged that the embargo led to widespread food and medicine shortages among the civilian population and failed to prevent iraq from rearming.
instead of caring for his people saddam used the nations meager cash flow to continue his lavish lifestyle and secured funds to amass a large arsenal of conventional weapons by illegally smuggling oil through jordan turkey syria and egypt.
when the un initiated a foodfor oil program in 1996 that allowed saddam to export some oil legally if he used the profits by god weve kicked the vietnam syndrome once and for all an exultant president george h w bush at the end of the persian gulf war 1991 american forces bush declared had met their goal of ending saddams occupation of kuwait and had no intention of conquering iraq.
the united states would henceforth rely on sanctions to curb saddam returning to the strategy of containment that had succeeded against the soviet union to win the cold war.
neoconservatives embraced a competing vision.
they viewed the war as an opportunity to remove saddam from power.
bush advisors including secretary of defense dick cheney however saw no advantage to staying in iraq.
they argued that it would be difficult if not impossible to bring together the nations three different ethnic and religious groups sunnis shiites and kurds each of which inhabited distinct regions to form a democratic government.
abiding by the powell doctrines emphasis on a clear exit strategy bush wanted to avoid a long protracted war that could become a vietnam like quagmire.
having suffered relatively few casualties 148 battlefield deaths and avoided widening for humanitarian purposes civilian conditions improved slightly.
victory in the persian gulf war along with the end of the cold war led to a revaluation of american foreign policy goals.
after defeating iraq bush announced that the united states would build a new world order which he defined as playing an active global peacekeeping role dedicated to spreading democracy and prosperity.
some of his defense advisors encouraged the president to go even further to protect american dominance.
in 1992 cheney and his neoconservative aide paul wolfowitz asserted that the united states needed to respond immediately and preemptively to any foreign nation that challenged american military superiority or attempted to overturn the established political and economic order bush never publicly embraced these neoconservative principles but his son george w bush the 43rd president of the united states proved more receptive to these ideas.
what vision of american world leadership did neoconservatives promote.
chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 contested visions of government the reagan years had redefined the american political landscape shifting the political center away from new deal and great society liberal assumptions that government could be a positive force in citizens lives.
to succeed in this changed political climate a new breed of democratic politician was needed socially liberal but fiscally conservative.
the most successful and most controversial new democrat was william bill jefferson clinton who defeated george h w bush in the 1992 presidential election and won reelection in 1996 against kansas senator bob dole.
when republican george w bush won the presidency in the heavily disputed 2000 election he restored the conservative vision of low taxes and limited regulation that the political right had long championed.
clintons new democrats clinton was relatively unknown when the 1992 presidential campaign began.
while governor of arkansas at just 44 years of age clinton had chaired the democratic leadership council a group committed to shifting the democratic party to the political center by accepting market based solutions to social problems and ending deficit spending.
exuding boundless energy and a vast knowledge of government clintons magnetic personality and compassionate nature soon won him a dedicated following.
i feel your pain became his mantra as he bear hugged voters on the campaign trail.
clinton one commentator noted cultivated the image of the president as the guy next door who struggles like the rest of us with his weight his marriage and his golf game worried about the nations finances third party candidate ross perot a self made texas billionaire entered the race and focused almost exclusively on how the federal deficit had ballooned under bush.
winning 19 percent of the popular vote perot registered the best third party showing since theodore roosevelts run as the progressive party candidate in 1912.
clinton defeated bush in the electoral college 370 to 168 but only 43 percent of the electorate voted for him.
widely praised for his political skills clinton nonetheless stumbled badly during his first few weeks in office when he tried and failed to fulfill a campaign pledge to lift the ban against gays in the military.
proponents viewed the issue as a straightforward question of protecting civil rights opponents countered that ignoring heterosexual soldiers objections to serving alongside gay soldiers would undermine military discipline and hurt recruitment.
how did clintons centrist vision affect his policy decisions.
clinton pleased no one with his compromise.
rather than lift the ban he instituted a policy of dont ask dont tell which allowed closeted homosexuals and lesbians gays who kept their sexual preferences hidden to serve in the military.
clintons domestic agenda was ambitious including a comprehensive plan to provide all americans with health care.
he delegated this major policy initiative to hillary rodham clinton his wife an attorney with extensive experience in public service.
republicans successfully attacked the plan as socialized medicine that would deprive americans of the freedom to choose their healthcare providers.
the plan failed to win congressional approval.
clinton achieved a more modest victory with his tax proposals.
overcoming republican opposition he passed an economic stimulus package that offered tax incentives for job creation and increased taxes for large corporations and wealthy americans reversing reagans decision to lower taxes on the richest citizens.
clinton also addressed economic problems caused by the recent globalization of the american economy.
as late as 1970 most u s businesses manufactured strictly for the american market and few stores stocked items made overseas.
by the early 1980s the united states exported and imported more goods than ever before.
exports rose from 43 billion in 1970 to 178 billion in 2000 while imports surged from 40 billion to 519 billion in 2000 all figures adjusted for inflation.
importing more than it exported the nation questioned whether this trade deficit hurt or helped the overall economy.
american companies selling products at home now faced stiff competition from foreign manufacturers while u s companies shifted production to places like china and mexico where watch the video bill clinton sells himself to america presidential campaign ad 1992 contested visions of government workers earned less.
globalization however also lowered costs for consumers and gave them a greater selection of products.
clinton helped accelerate the trend toward globalization when he broke with organized labor to back the 1992 north american free trade agreement nafta a treaty that lifted trade barriers among the united states mexico and canada.
labor unions opposed nafta because they feared that it would encourage u s factories to relocate to mexico resulting in fewer jobs for american workers.
american businesspeople liked nafta because it prohibited mexican companies from manufacturing knock offs of american products such as films drugs and clothing essentially protecting their overseas and domestic markets by stopping the flow of counterfeit goods.
clintons emphasis on free trade reflected his desire to move the democratic party to the political center but his republican opponents cited his failed healthcare initiative as evidence that he subscribed to the same 1960s liberal vision that had spurred the creation of the great society see chapter 27.
in the 1994 midterm elections georgia congressman newt gingrich mobilized the new right see chapter 28 with his call to end the corrupt liberal welfare state the republicans captured both the house and the senate for the first time since 1952.
gingrichs manifesto the contract with america envisioned smaller government less regulation term limits for members of congress welfare reform and adding a balanced budget amendment to the constitution.
little of this ambitious agenda was enacted partly because clinton stole some of gingrichs thunder by undertaking his own program of welfare reform.
modifying legislation passed during the new deal he joined with republicans and conservative democrats in congress to reduce the time that families mostly single mothers with dependent children could receive financial assistance.
clinton also tried to appeal to fiscal conservatives by balancing the federal budget for the first time in 30 years.
clinton used his superior political skills not only to weaken the republican resurgence but also to survive the scandals that plagued his presidency.
in 1994 a special federal prosecutor kenneth starr began investigating charges that the president had read the document articles of impeachment against william jefferson clinton participated in a fraudulent land deal during his tenure as arkansas attorney general.
during his investigation starr learned that president clinton had engaged in a sexual relationship with a white house intern named monica lewinsky.
clinton was not the first president to have extramarital dalliances but when giving testimony under oath on an unrelated matter he denied the affair.
seven months later the president publicly acknowledged that he had lied as seen in this new york daily news headline reporting his televised address to the nation 29 6.
republicans argued that clintons failure to tell the truth warranted impeachment.
in 1998 the republicancontrolled house of representatives completed the first stage of impeachment by voting that the president had lied under oath and obstructed justice.
the senate now had to decide whether these infractions met the constitutional test of high crimes and misdemeanors needed to remove a president from office.
ten republican senators joined with democrats in defeating the first charge of perjury by a vote of 55 to 45.
the second charge of obstructing justice resulted in a 50 to 50 tie.
neither charge obtained the requisite two thirds vote required to remove clinton from the white house.
clinton survived impeachment by cultivating the same everyman appeal that won him the presidency.
the essence of clintons success has been to persuade america that this scandal is about human weakness not crime and that at its core is not a string of felonies but a sin familiar to all adultery lamented conservative commentator patrick buchanan.

the battle now moved to the supreme court where conservative justices accepted the republican argument that the different standards used by inspectors to include or reject ballots violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
as the map 29 8 shows although gore won the national popular vote by winning florida bush had the 271 electoral votes to win the election.

in 1996 congress passed the defense of marriage act doma a law that defined marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman.
under this statute states that banned same sex marriages did not have to accept legal marriages performed in other states if a gay couple moved to their jurisdiction.
in 2011 only massachusetts connecticut vermont new hampshire iowa washington d c and new york allowed same sex marriages.
nine other states authorized civil unions between same sex partners that granted them rights similar to those accorded married couples.
most of the remaining states either through referendum or stature prohibited same sex marriage.
but after lower federal courts ruled doma unconstitutional the justice department stopped defending legal challenges to it in 2011.
this opened up the possibility that all states would be required to recognize samesex marriages performed elsewhere.

faced with a labor shortage of able bodied workers the nation turned as it had in the past to immigrants to fill available jobs.
what competing visions emerged over same sex marriage.
a wave of immigration the massive wave of immigration that began after congress eliminated national quotas in 1965 initiated another important social transformation.
between 1931 and 1965 around five million immigrants came to the united states.
these numbers skyrocketed to 4 5 million in the 1970s 7 3 million in the 1980s and 9 1 million in the 1990s.
hundreds of thousands more entered the country illegally.
most of these immigrants came from asia africa and latin america only two million europeans settled in the united states between 1980 and 2000.
some americans satirically referred to the exploding hispanic immigrant population in the southwest as the reconquista or reconquest of territory that mexico had lost to the united states after the mexican american war of 1848 see chapter 11.
overall the united states attracted twice as many immigrants as all of the other nations in the world combined.
competing claims about the economic benefits of immigration emerged a debate explored more fully in competing visions the economic costs of immigration.
the new right also feared dire cultural consequences as the nation fragmented into permanent ethnic enclaves.
if america is to survive as one nation one people we need to call a time out on immigration to assimilate the tens of millions who have lately arrived exhorted patrick buchanan.
to protect the nations cultural cohesion these right leaning critics organized campaigns to make english the nations official language.
both democrats and republicans worried that immigrants who were willing to work for less took jobs away from native born workers.
critics especially denounced illegal immigration arguing that people who sneaked across the border often violated other laws as well.
illegal immigrants sent their transforming daily life competing visions the economic costs of immigration to this day americans continue to disagree about the economic costs of immigration.
in the following passage harvard economist george j borjas paints a pessimistic economic portrait.
tamar jacoby disputes his claim that three decades of high immigration have hurt the u s economy.
what factors does each emphasize to make a case.
george j borjas suggested that immigration affected socioeconomic groups differently in his 1996 article the new economics of immigration affluent americans gain poor americans lose new research has established a number of points.
the relative skills of successive immigrant waves have declined over much of the postwar period.
in 1970 for example the latest immigrant arrivals on average had 0 4 fewer years of schooling and earned 17 percent less than natives.
by 1990 the most recently arrived immigrants had 1 3 fewer years of schooling and earned 32 percent less than natives the large scale migration of less skilled workers has done harm to the economic opportunities of less skilled natives.
immigration may account for perhaps a third of the recent decline in the relative wages of less educated native workers the increasing welfare dependency in the immigrant population suggests that immigration may create a substantial fiscal burden on the most affected localities and states there exists a strong correlation between the skills of immigrants and the skills of their american born children so that the huge skill differentials observed among todays foreign born groups will almost certainly become tomorrows differences among american born ethnic groups.
in effect immigration has set the stage for sizable ethnic differences in skills and socioeconomic outcomes which are sure to be the focus of intense attention in the next century current immigration redistributes wealth from unskilled workers whose wages are lowered by immigrants to skilled workers and owners of companies that buy immigrants services and from taxpayers who bear the burden of paying for the social services used by immigrants to consumers who use the goods and services produced by immigrants immigration changes how the economic pie is sliced up the harmful effects of immigration will not go away simply because some people do not wish to see them.
view the closer look competing visions the economic costs of immigration in her 2002 article too many immigrants tamar jacoby argued that large scale immigration benefited the united states economically.
the most commonly heard complaint about foreign workers is that they take jobs from americans.
not only is this assertion untrue nobody has found real evidence to support it but cities and states with the largest immigrant populations new york los angeles and others boast far faster economic growth and lower unemployment than cities and states that do not attract immigrants.
in many places the presence of immigrants seems to reduce unemployment even among native born blacks probably because of the way immigrants stimulate economic growth even if borjas is right that a native born black worker may take home 300 less a year as a result of immigration this is a fairly small amount of money in the overall scheme of things.
more to the point globalization would have much the same effect on wages immigrants or no immigrants what about the costs imposed by immigrants especially by their use of government services.
it is true that many immigrants though far from all are poorer than nativeborn americans and thus pay less in taxes.
it is also true that one small segment of the immigrant population refugees tends to be heavily dependent on welfare.
as a result states with large immigrant populations often face chronic fiscal problems but if we shift the lens to the federal level and include the taxes that immigrants remit to the irs the calculation comes out very differently immigrants pay in more than they take out 28 million immigrants form but a small part of the 12 trillion u s economy and most of the fiscal costs and benefits associated with them are relatively modest.
besides fiscal calculations are only a small part of the larger economic picture.
how do we measure the energy immigrants bring the pluck and grit and willingness to improvise and innovate.
not only are immigrants by and large harder working than the native born they generally fill economic niches that would otherwise go wanting.
are contemporary concerns about immigration similar or different from objections made earlier in the twentieth century.
chapter 29 29 10 competing views on immigration americans continue to debate whether immigrants are a burden or an asset.
building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 children to school and received health care in hospitals all at taxpayer expense they charged.
unions and their supporters complained that undocumented workers could not join labor unions making it more difficult to organize labor to improve working conditions and wages.
champions of immigration mostly from the political left pointed to the nations past success in assimilating immigrants and argued that immigrants took the low paying jobs such as busboys gardeners and nannies that few americans wanted.
countering claims that new immigrants failed to assimilate advocates of immigration noted the high rate of interethnic marriages among second generation immigrants.
they also viewed complaints about multiculturalism as a racist attempt to protect the united states as a primarily white society.
the different meanings attached to the word benefits in this political cartoon by brian fairrington 29 10 encapsulated the debate over whether immigrants drained the economy by seeking taxpayer funded social services or contributed to overall prosperity by working for very little.
climate change the computer revolution and shifting demographics were not the only factors changing american daily life.
scientists worried that accelerated climate change threatened to reshape the physical space that americans inhabited and urged the nation to reverse human induced environmental damage.
they entreated americans to switch from gas guzzling cars like sport utility vehicles suvs to automobiles that burned little or no fossil fuels.
americans 4 5 percent of the global population drove 24 percent of the worlds 590 million cars.
ingrained driving habits however were hard to change.
environmental scientists claimed that average temperatures had risen 1 8 degrees fahrenheit over the last 100 years a phenomenon called global warming.
they attributed this climate shift to the widespread burning of fossil fuels coal and oil that pumped carbon dioxide into the air.
carbon dioxide was one of several greenhouse gases that trapped the suns heat in the earths atmosphere.
while the suns rays were essential to human life environmentalists blamed the rapidly rising levels of greenhouse gases for global warming.
this 2007 world map 29 11 shows which nations emitted the greatest amounts of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels.
the united states china russia india and japan head the list.
developing nations in africa with few cars or heavy industry emitted relatively little carbon dioxide.
besides emitting more total greenhouse gases than most other nations the united states ranked tenth in the amount of greenhouse emissions per person.
why did global warming matter.
the quickerthan normal melting of the arctic ice cap environmentalists warned was causing sea levels to rise.
if unchecked rising waters would soon wash over sea level lands throughout the world including the mississippi delta in the united states.
scientists also speculated that global warming affected rainfall patterns and storms increasing droughts wildfires and hurricanes.
not everyone in the united states accepted these dire predictions.
some americans questioned the scientific evidence linking climate change to human activity.
fluctuations in the earths average temperature had occurred before they argued disputing the claim that permanent or catastrophic change in the atmosphere was underway.
in 1997 the united states signed the kyoto protocol an international agreement that set targets for reducing greenhouse emissions in industrial nations.
in 2001 however president george w bush argued that the agreement was flawed because it exempted china and relied on governmental controls not market incentives to develop green technology.
the united states subsequently became the only nation besides australia to sign but not ratify the treaty.

enjoying low gas prices few americans felt compelled to invest time or money into developing green technology.
national security concerns proved more effective in motivating the nation to re examine its energy policy.
the united states imported 65 percent of its oil with canada providing the largest share.
after 9 11 a consensus emerged that the ongoing american presence in the middle east which provided 11 percent of the oil americans consumed bred resentment among arab populations that helped islamist terrorists recruit members.
republicans and democrats however disagreed over how to wean the nation off its dependence on foreign oil.
the bush administration championed bolstering oil production at home by lifting restrictions on drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge a nationally protected wilderness in alaska.
this proposal enraged environmentalists and democrats who worried that drilling accidents could contaminate this pristine area.
they also feared losing valuable time in the battle against global warming by continuing rather than ending fossil fuel consumption.

ethnic cleansing in eastern europe and africa raised additional questions of how much responsibility america should assume to prevent massacres worldwide.
when islamic terrorists attacked u s targets overseas and at home competing visions also arose over how to defend the nation from this new threat.
ethnic cleansing and terrorism in the 1990s the nation faced a new foreign policy dilemma when or whether to intercede on humanitarian grounds to stop massacres in parts of the world strategically unimportant to the united states.
in 1992 images of a civil war induced famine in somalia a country in east africa flooded american airwaves and newspapers.
this image of a somali woman and her starving child 29 12 echoed the madonna and child compositions used 29 12 and 29 13 competing views of civil turmoil in somalia 1992 and 1993 photographs like this one of a starving somali woman and child prompted americans to demand that the united states send troops to end the civil war responsible for the famine.
a year later angered by a photograph of somali rebels dragging the corpse of an american soldier through the streets americans called for the return of u s troops.
both images encouraged americans to view african nations as dysfunctional places where famine and fighting were endemic.
how did media coverage influence american views of africa.
by jacob riis during the gilded age see chapter 17 and dorothea lange during the depression see chapter 22 to rally popular support for aiding the poor.
president george h w bush responded to the public outcry by sending u s troops to help un peacekeepers restore order aid that incoming president bill clinton continued.
public opinion shifted dramatically in 1993 however when news cameras captured the image of cheering somalis dragging the corpse of an american soldier through the streets of mogadishu the capital city of somalia after rebel somali warlords downed a u s helicopter 29 13.
the new threats in the post cold war world public now demanded an immediate withdrawal and clinton complied.
the un also withdrew its troops and years of anarchy in somalia followed.
reluctant to jeopardize american soldiers lives again clinton proceeded cautiously in april 1994 when hutus the majority ethnic group in rwanda a nation in central africa unleashed a 100 day genocidal rampage that killed 800 000 tutsis a minority ethic group.
this time clinton came under attack for failing to intervene decisively with force.
the photo of somalis desecrating the corpse of an american soldier had other repercussions.
osama bin laden the saudi exile who headed al qaeda a fundamentalist islamic terrorist organization concluded that terrorist attacks against the united states would work because americans had no stomach for casualties.
one american pilot was dragged in the streets of mogadishu and you left.
the extent of your impotence and weaknesses became very clear he jeered in 1996.
such pronouncements caused paul watson the photojournalist who took the pulitzer prize winning image to conclude that the storm of outrage over his photo taught terrorists that they could rely on publicity in the western media to amplify the impact of their terrorist attacks.
during his first years in office clinton also had to respond to ethnic cleansing the intentional mass killing of one ethnic group by another in the balkans a mountainous region of southeastern europe.
when communist yugoslavia dissolved in 1991 ethnic and religious differences provoked a civil war among croatia bosnia and serbia all former parts of yugoslavia.
clinton resisted intervening until july 1995 when serbian forces forced 25 000 bosnian muslim women and children to leave the town of srebrenica and murdered the 7 500 muslim men and boys who remained behind.
the united states participated in nato air strikes of serbian military positions and helped broker the 1995 dayton peace accords which settled disputed territorial boundaries and placed nato troops including americans on the ground as peacekeepers.
preoccupied with humanitarian tragedies overseas americans paid less attention in the early 1990s to signs that the terrorist threat was moving closer to home.
many arabs saw the united states and israel as one blaming both for taking away land that belonged to the palestinians.
overseas hostagetakings and plane hijackings in the 1970s and 1980s kept the arab israeli conflict in the news.
in 1993 kuwaiti and iraqi born terrorists exploded a massive car bomb in the parking garage of the world trade center two towering skyscrapers in the heart of new york citys financial district that housed governmental agencies and companies involved in foreign trade.
the explosion killed six people and created a six story hole in the ground.

but al qaeda which maintained training bases in afghanistan resolved to try again.
determined to launch a jihad or holy war against western nonbelievers bin laden relied on his familys fortune and donations from saudi arabians to construct a clandestine terrorist network that recruited disciples from the middle east asia and africa.
not all terrorist threats during this period originated overseas.
on april 19 1995 timothy mcveigh parked a rental truck filled with explosives in front of a federal building in oklahoma city.
the blast killed 168 people including many children in a day care center and wounded 800.
mcveigh and his accomplice terry nichols viewed the attack as payback for the federal governments recent assaults against private paramilitary groups and their rural compounds filled with caches of weapons.
militia supporters like mcveigh rejected any legal restriction on their second amendment right to bear arms citing gun laws as just one example of government tyranny.
the bombing remained the deadliest terrorist attack against american civilians until 9 11.
meanwhile al qaeda attacked u s targets overseas.

it is more important for muslims to kill americans than other infidels bin laden declared.
this pronouncement was more than rhetoric.
in august 1998 al qaeda terrorists bombed the u s embassies in nairobi the capital of kenya and dar es salaam a city in tanzania.
clinton ordered an immediate retaliatory attack and tomahawk cruise missiles rained down on eight al qaeda training camps in afghanistan and on a pharmaceutical plant in sudan which was thought to have supplied bin laden with chemical weapons.
his advisors presented clinton with competing views over the next possible step.
his antiterrorist advisor recommended continuing the bombing until the taliban afghanistans fundamentalist islamic why did foreign and domestic terrorists attack americans.

pentagon officials opposed sustained bombing worried that mounting civilian casualties would inflame anti american sentiments throughout the middle east.
assassinating bin laden others argued would turn him into a martyr whose death fundamentalists would certainly avenge.
faced with these conflicting views clinton chose to rely on the cia to thwart terrorist attacks against u s targets overseas.

9 11 on the morning of september 11 2001 in an attack that became known as 9 11 19 terrorists operating from al qaeda cells inside the united states hijacked four planes.
the terrorists from saudi arabia egypt lebanon and the united arab emirates flew two planes into the world trade center towers and a third into the pentagon.
the fourth plane crashed in shanksville pennsylvania after the passengers seized control of the cockpit thwarting the terrorist plan to fly it into the capitol.
on this day of terror americans watched in horror as the world trade center towers crumbled causing rescue workers victims and onlookers to run for safety as the massive structures collapsed in a heap 29 14.
a total of 2 973 people died in the attacks.
president bush immediately announced that we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them he issued an ultimatum to afghanistans taliban government turn over al qaeda members living there including bin laden or face invasion.
the taliban refused.
receiving overwhelming support from congress the american people and most foreign nations the united states attacked afghanistan on october 7 2001.
u s forces first bombed al qaeda training camps and arms depots and then joined with the northern alliance an afghan rebel group to drive the taliban from power.
the two month conflict failed however to capture bin laden who had likely escaped into the mountains of neighboring pakistan with help from pakistani sympathizers.
most americans had supported the invasion but many grew uneasy about how the bush administration was conducting the war.
these critics accused bush of condoning torture by allowing cia agents to use water boarding an interrogation tactic that simulated drowning to try to extract information from captured al qaeda suspects held prisoner at the u s naval base in guantnamo bay in cuba.
the decision to incarcerate captured prisoners indefinitely at guantnamo bay denying them the right to a fair trial also aroused controversy.
read the document george bush address to congress september 20 2001 new threats in the post cold war world responding to criticism that the nations security agencies had failed to prevent the 9 11 attack the president created the department of homeland security a new umbrella organization that housed the nations intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies.
he also secured congressional approval for the 2001 patriot act which expanded the governments investigative and police powers.
critics soon attacked the law as an unconstitutional assault on civil liberties.
this 2002 political cartoon by pulitzer prize winner clay bennett 29 15 exposed a familiar wartime dilemma how to protect the nation against enemy agents operating on american soil while simultaneously safeguarding the privacy rights of americans.
in the cartoon determined federal workers remove planks from a couples home to build a security fence exposing their personal lives to public scrutiny.
in the weeks after the 9 11 attacks the fbi arrested hundreds of arabs and muslims in an effort to destroy any remaining al qaeda cells in the united states.
acting hastily and often on flimsy evidence the fbi caught innocent people in its dragnet and some spent months in jail before being released.
scores of arab americans like japanese americans in world war ii hung american flags outside their businesses to counter suspicions that all muslims were terrorists.
in 2007 a federal court overturned the sections of the patriot act that made it easier for the government to secure search warrants as well as internet and phone records.
29 15 security versus privacy this cartoon suggests that invading the privacy of americans under the guise of increasing security worsened rather than improved their lives.
the iraq war americas war on terror soon spread to iraq.
containing saddam husseins ambition to acquire weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological weapons had been an ongoing goal since the end of the 1991 persian gulf war.
in 1998 the un halted its weapons inspection program after iraq refused to continue cooperating.
president clinton subsequently authorized operation desert fox a four day how do governmental efforts to prevent internal enemy attacks after 9 11 compare to those during world wars i and ii.
chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 bombing campaign in december 1998 against 100 iraqi military targets to destroy any weapons saddam was hiding.
neoconservatives publicly urged clinton to make removing saddam a goal of american foreign policy.
they had the chance to advance their views more forcefully once bush appointed neoconservatives to key defenserelated positions including secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz.
this core of key neoconservative defense policy advisors included vice president dick cheney.
reversing his previous stand when he had counseled the first president bush to stop the persian gulf war without attacking baghdad cheney along with others urged the president to attack iraq while public concern about national security remained high.
do we wait and hope he doesnt do what we know he is capable of which is distributing weapons of mass destruction to anonymous terrorists or do we take preemptive action asked neoconservative richard perle chairman of the defense policy board.
these advisors championed preemptive war the doctrine that the united states should use force to remove hostile regimes before they could pose a serious threat.
our security will require all americans to be forward looking and resolute to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives president george w bush announcing a shift in foreign policy from containment to preemption 2002 state department officials especially secretary of state colin powell disagreed.
they offered a competing vision that relied on the same cold war era containment policies that had eventually toppled the soviet union.
those urging restraint worried that a hostile fundamentalist islamic government might replace saddams secular regime fueling rather than dampening the terrorist threat against the united states.
better the devil we know than the one we dont one high ranking intelligence official reasoned.
choices and consequences launching a preemptive war examines what debates occurred within the bush administration over going to war against iraq in 2003.
the options before bush as he made his decision to attack iraq.
having privately resolved to topple saddam hussein bush began laying the groundwork for sending american troops into iraq.
in september 2002 his administration announced a new national security strategy.
the bush doctrine established the unilateral right to attack nations that harbored terrorists to launch preemptive military strikes to prevent future attacks on the united states and to replace autocratic governments with democratically elected ones.
the inclusion of preemptive war was new but other parts of the bush doctrine reiterated key principles announced by bushs father when he defined a new post cold war direction for american foreign policy in 1992.
neoconservative paul wolfowitz played a key role in both administrations devising a foreign policy that aggressively protected americas singular status as the worlds strongest military power.
in building his case for war the president repeatedly claimed that saddam hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to terrorist organizations including al qaeda.
by the summer of 2002 this rhetoric had convinced 54 percent of the american public of the falsehood that saddam was responsible for the 9 11 attacks.
to win support in the international community and at home bush sought both a un resolution demanding that iraq readmit weapons inspectors and a congressional joint resolution authorizing the use of force to enforce un mandates and remove the continuing threat that saddam posed.
in arguing for war the administration pointed to secret correspondence between iraq and niger provided by italian intelligence agents indicating that between 1999 and 2001 saddam had made overtures to buy uranium oxide material used to build a nuclear bomb from niger.
some cia agents including the envoy sent to niger to investigate privately doubted that saddam had tried to buy uranium from niger.
this charge however convinced wavering democrats to support the war.
when the international atomic energy agency announced that these incriminating letters were indeed forgeries antiwar advocates charged that bush had deliberately misled the country to build his case for war.
the iraq war followed the same pattern as the 1991 persian gulf war intense bombing followed by a ground invasion.
the bombing campaign began on march 19 2003 and within three weeks read the document george w bush national security strategy of the united states of america 2002 new threats in the post cold war world choices and consequences launching a preemptive war in 2002 the bush administration feared that iraqi dictator saddam hussein had acquired or was on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons and was developing chemical and biological weapons.
president bush worried that once hussein acquired a sizeable arsenal he would use it against his neighbors including israel and help terrorists attack the united states.
his advisors gave bush three options about how to proceed.
choices launch a preemptive war to remove saddam from power.
work through the un to impose economic sanctions and send weapons inspectors to iraq.
support iraqi exiles plan to organize a coup that might trigger a mass uprising.
decision in february 2002 bush decided to fight.
he announced that saddam harbored weapons of mass destruction and had aided al qaeda.
he made a half hearted effort to work with the un to reconstitute the weapons inspection program halted in 1998 and secured support from a handful of potential allies if the united states went to war.
announcing that saddam had refused to cooperate adequately with un weapons inspectors the united states attacked iraq on march 19 2003.
consequences active combat lasted three weeks and toppled saddam.
no weapons of mass destruction were found.
iraq elected a democratic government that struggled to contain ethnic and religious strife.
u s forces came under daily attack until a surge of troops in 2008 weakened rebel insurgencies.
looking for a coherent iraq policy jack ohman the oregonian 2002 continuing controversies was the iraq war justified.
supporters of bushs policies argued that removing saddam benefited the iraqi people and the world.
building a stable democratic and militarily weakened iraq was necessary to protect american interests in the strategically and economically important persian gulf.
the 9 11 attacks demonstrated that the united states must act aggressively and preemptively overseas to prevent future strikes on its own soil.
critics argued that bush misled the american people by making false claims that saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties to al qaeda.
the war made america less secure by fanning antiamerican sentiments in the middle east that helped al qaeda recruit and diverted resources from the war in afghanistan where al qaeda was regrouping.
preemptive war set a dangerous precedent that lowered the threshold for going to war to simply feeling threatened by another nation.
what justifications and criticisms did the doctrine of preventative war arouse.
chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 american troops were in baghdad.
on april 10 2003 usa today was one of many newspapers and television newscasts 29 16 showing an iraqi crowd enlisting the aid of u s marines to pull down a huge statue of saddam.
the toppling of saddam husseins statue in baghdad will be recorded alongside the fall of the berlin wall as one of the great moments of liberty bush proclaimed.
although the event was initially seen as emblematic of iraqi celebration over the fall of saddam subsequent reports suggested that american army personnel had staged the event in a square across from the hotel housing international journalists to create a positive iconic image of the war similar to the world war ii image of u s marines raising the flag on iwo jima see chapter 23.
the controversy surrounding the picture mirrored americans debate over whether the war was based on lies or was as bush and his supporters maintained spreading democracy to the middle east.
after active combat operations ceased american troops faced a host of problems that kept them in iraq.
widespread looting greeted the fall of saddam hussein who eluded capture until december 13 2003.
he was held in prison then put on trial and executed on december 30 2006.
restoring law and order and creating a new democratic government proved difficult as sunnis shiites and kurds divided along ethnic and religious lines.
american soldiers caught up in the emerging civil war provided inviting targets for suicide bombers while iran and alqaeda penetrated iraq to expand their influence in the region.
controversy over the war continued at home especially when scandalous photographs taken by soldiers at the american run abu ghraib prison circulated in the mainstream media and on the internet in 2004.
while interrogating prisoners u s guards had taken photos of prisoners forced into humiliating sexual positions and being threatened with dogs.
other photos showed smiling american soldiers standing beside beaten and bloody corpses.
as with the 1968 my lai massacre in vietnam see chapter 26 americans held strong competing visions on what they felt the photos represented.
some saw rogue soldiers acting on their own others blamed the president for authorizing brutal interrogating techniques on suspected terrorists.
another group sidestepped the moral question and instead debated whether torture produced valuable information or simply encouraged suspects to say what interrogators 29 16 baghdad falls april 10 2003 wanted to hear.
initial news reports spoke of jubilant crowds cheering as u s marines helped them pull down a statue of saddam hussein but later reports suggested that the army had staged the incident.
what accomplishments and setbacks did the united states experience in the iraq war.
new threats in the post cold war world the election of 2008 in 2004 bush won reelection against democratic challenger massachusetts senator john kerry a vietnam war veteran whose record both as a decorated officer and peace activist came under republican attack during the campaign.
despite the growing unpopularity of the war in iraq the fresh memories of 9 11 bolstered bushs argument that only he could adequately protect the nation against terrorism.
in a close election bush won the popular vote by only 3 percent and captured the electoral college 286 to 252.
by 2008 however the presidents approval rates had sunk to historic lows only truman and nixon had polled lower.
these lows reflected the nations unease with its seemingly permanent presence in iraq and recoil at the white houses initial failure to react when hurricane katrina devastated new orleans predominantly black neighborhoods in 2005.
in the 2008 presidential contest democratic and republican candidates both repudiated the bush administration and ran campaigns that promised change.
the election soon assumed historic dimensions when hillary rodham clinton the former first lady and now a senator from new york announced her candidacy.
clinton had a long record of public service dedicated to healthcare issues but her initial support for the war in iraq angered antiwar democrats.
firstterm illinois senator barack obama the 47 year old son of a white woman from kansas and an african father astutely campaigned on his own consistent opposition to the war.
when the crowded democratic field narrowed to clinton and obama the 2008 election was guaranteed to make history.
for the first time either a woman or an african american would head the national democratic ticket.
at the end of a bruising primary battle obama prevailed to become the democratic nominee.
in the general election obama faced republican john mccain a former navy pilot whom the communist vietnamese had held captive for six years during the vietnam war.
the 72 year old senator from arizona had a reputation as a maverick for occasionally breaking ranks with fellow republicans.
hoping to make some history of his own and perhaps woo clinton supporters mccain selected alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate only the second time that a woman had received this honor.
obama pledged to end the war in iraq quickly and roll back the bush era tax cuts for the wealthy while mccain supported both.
debate over the iraq war watch the video video lecture the historical significance of the 2008 election faded when a cascade of bank and insurance company failures sent the stock market into a tailspin.
in the midst of the crisis economists offered the following explanation for the downturn that future investigations may or may not confirm.
during the last five years as housing prices rose dramatically and congress deregulated the banking and financial industries banks had made numerous risky loans that let people purchase homes they could not afford and wall street brokers had invested heavily in mortgage backed securities.
when housing prices started declining in summer 2007 the dominos began to fall.
bank foreclosures on people who could not pay their mortgages increased and even more ominously the declining value of mortgage backed securities threatened to bankrupt leading wall street firms wiping out many americans retirement investments.
to stabilize the mortgage market the government took over two leading lenders freddie mac and fannie mae.
treasury secretary henry paulson refused to intervene when lehman brothers a major investment firm went bankrupt in september 2008.
this bankruptcy shocked the financial sector.
credit markets froze as banks stopped lending and investors began moving money from stocks and bonds to u s treasury notes.
by mid september the bush administration decided that an infusion of 700 billion was needed to unfreeze the credit markets and stop the stock markets freefall.
enraged house republicans revolted.
in their view the government bail out used taxpayer money to reward bad behavior.
many democrats accepted the competing view that the government would recoup this money when the economy and value of these investments improved.
congress eventually authorized the funds which paulson used to infuse capital directly into banks rather than buying low valued assets.
what happened to this money became a major political question still unanswered.
obama was a captivating orator who drew thousands to his rallies.
even hillary clinton campaigned for him.
obama drew enthusiastic support from whites and blacks young and old hispanic and asian.
i t is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain barack obama accepting the 2008 presidential democratic nomination what factors led to the economic downturn in 2008.
chapter 29 building a new world order the united states 1989 2011 29 17 obamanania almost overnight barack obama became an american icon a boon to washington d c area gift shops selling souvenirs to the 2 million people who braved freezing temperatures to see obama inaugurated as the nations 44th president on january 20 2009.
exuding confidence calm and charm obama amassed an inspired following who put his likeness on posters vans t shirts bridges boats and even tattoos.
the image of obama on the souvenir mugs in this photo 29 17 came from an iconic poster by artist shepard fairey.
the mugs paired obamas silhouette with the campaigns catchphrase change we can believe in by contrast faireys poster carried the single word hope a message that detractors modified into nope on their own tee shirts and bumper stickers.
an intensely disciplined candidate obama stuck to a clear message of economic reform.
the mccain campaign was more erratic one day highlighting economics the next portraying obama as the heir to sixties era radicalism.
thanks to support from swing voters those without strong ideological convictions momentum for obama built throughout the fall.
on november 4 2008 he became the first african american president of the united states by winning a decisive victory 365 to 173 electoral votes and 53 percent of the popular vote.
troubled times obamas emphasis on change during the campaign raised liberals expectations that he would move quickly to regulate wall street enact universal health care end the ban on gays in the military and how did past civil rights activism help make obamas election possible.
withdraw from iraq and afghanistan.
conservatives however adamantly opposed enlarging the role and cost of government.
within this highly contentious partisan environment obama found himself under attack from the right and left.
the economic crisis posed the most immediate challenge for obama.
with the democrats controlling both the house and senate he quickly secured passage of a massive government spending bill to stimulate the economy.
republicans including many who had supported bushs deficit spending vehemently opposed increasing the national debt.
when the economy failed to rebound quickly two competing views on the stimulus spending emerged.
the obama administration asserted that the infusion of government money prevented another great depression by staving off the collapse of the nations financial institutions and averting massive layoffs.
republicans countered that ineffective government interference stymied the recovery leaving taxpayers with a bill that would take generations to pay off.
liberals urged obama to hold wall street accountable for the misdeeds that caused the economic meltdown and congress did strengthen regulatory oversight of financial institutions.
americans increasingly however directed their anger over the ongoing economic crisis at washington.
concerns about the escalating debt and federal power energized watch the video video lecture the connection between obama and lincoln new threats in the post cold war world grassroots conservatives who used social networking media to draw crowds to their initial demonstrations.
the spectacular rise of the tea party movement had begun named to evoke the revolutionary spirit of the 1774 boston tea party.
support from conservative television pundits and high profile politicians like sarah palin also fueled the movements growth.
by actively opposing the presidents health insurance reform initiative the tea party solidified its influence within republican circles.
in pushing for health care reform obama hoped to succeed where truman and clinton had failed.
j r roses 2009 political cartoon aptly captured the political divide that characterized this rancorous debate 29 18.
to marshal support obama cited the many uninsured 16 percent of the population or 47 million people rising health care and insurance costs and troubling industry practices such as lifetime limits on coverage.
opting for a reform of private health insurance practices rather than the single payer government run system liberals favored obama angered his base and did little to assuage conservatives.
health insurance reform legislation passed in 2010 without receiving a single republican vote amid liberal criticism that the law did too little.
the laws requirement that all americans purchase health insurance became a flashpoint for conservatives and independents worried about intrusive governmental power.
states immediately challenged the constitutionality of this mandate.
the mixed rulings in federal district courts suggested that the supreme court would ultimately determine whether obamas attempt to establish universal healthcare would prevail.
sweeping republican victories in the 2010 mid term elections included tea party candidates who vowed to curb the power of government by repealing the healthcare law cutting the federal budget and making bush era tax cuts permanent.
focused on fiscal issues tea party activists had less interest in championing conservatives traditional social and cultural agenda.
instead of rallying supporters to reverse the 2010 repeal of the militarys dont ask dont tell policy that prevented gay servicemen from openly acknowledging their sexual orientation the tea party used its influence within the republican party to demand a permanent reduction in the size and scope of the federal budget.
liberal disenchantment with obama stemmed mainly from his foreign policy decisions especially escalating the war in afghanistan and continued operation of the guantanamo bay prison.
obama prohibited the use of water boarding but reaffirmed the bush era policy of holding prisoners indefinitely without charges.
sending an additional 30 000 troops to afghanistan in october 2009 obama tried to reassure his liberal base by setting a tentative withdrawal date of 2014 from afghanistan.
obama satisfied americans of all political persuasions when he announced on may 2 2011 that u s special forces had tracked down and killed osama bin laden in his pakistani hideout.
documents recovered during the raid provided crucial intelligence that allowed obama to claim that the united states for the moment had the upper hand in the war on terror.
he also moved decisively to draw down forces in iraq.
an influx of u s troops in 2008 had reduced insurgent attacks both improving the publics views of the iraq war and strengthening obamas claim that the war had been won.
in october 2011 obama announced that the u s military would leave iraq by years end.
after nearly nine years americas war in iraq will be over he announced a decision supported by 75 of americans.
a vigorous debate.
during the yearlong debate over health insurance reform democrats and republicans articulated competing visions of the role that the federal government should play in american society.
