1460 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present americas changing population as the twenty first century dawned the united states began experiencing dramatic social changes.
in 2015 the countrys population surpassed 322 million more than 80 percent of whom lived in cities or suburbs.
even more important the nations racial and ethnic composition was changing rapidly.
in 1980 the population was 80 percent white.
by 2015 that percentage had fallen below 63 percent.
in 2005 hispanics became the nations largest minority group.
in 1980 hispanics were 6 percent in 2015 that number had tripled to 18 percent and was growing rapidly.
more than 56 million americans were hispanic in origin and a third of them were under the age of eighteen.
african americans were at 13 percent asians about 8 percent and native americans 1 percent.
the rate of increase among those four groups was twice what it had been during the 1980s.
yet the fastest growing group in the nation were the nearly 10 million who described themselves as multiracial representing more than 3 percent of the entire population.
the primary cause of this dramatic change in the nations ethnic mix was a surge of immigration.
in 2015 the united states had more foreign born residents than ever before more than 45 million 11 million of whom were undocumented immigrants formerly classified as illegal aliens.
in the first decade of the twenty first century the united states became home to more than twice as many immigrants as all other countries combined.
for the first time the majority of immigrants came not from europe but from other parts of the world asia latin america and africa.
mexicans made up the largest share of hispanics followed by puerto ricans and cubans.
asian americans increased their numbers at a faster rate than any other ethnic group largely because of a surge in chinese immigrants.
the nations changing ethnic composition has had an increasingly significant impact on social life.
in 1980 hispanic americans lived mainly in five states california arizona new mexico texas and florida.
by 2014 every state had a rapidly growing hispanic population.
demographers projected that by 2044 whites would become a minority in the united states.
immigration also is having potent political effects as almost 1 million hispanics reach voting age each year.
hispanics are usually catholic and tend to vote democratic.
in 1980 there were six hispanic americans serving in the u s congress.
by 2010 there were more than five times as many.
in 1992 hispanics constituted only 2 percent of american voters by 2014 they were 10 percent.
americas changing population 1461 over the quota under the radar large numbers of chinese risked their lives to gain entry to the united states during the late twentieth century.
a freighter carrying undocumented immigrants ran aground near rockaway beach new york in june 1993 forcing its undocumented passengers to swim ashore.
only 23 percent of baby boomers born during and after the second world war consider the surge in american diversity a change for the better they worry that hispanics will always be a race apart from m ainstream american culture a permanent underclass of people tied closely to their ancestral homelands.
yet such concerns are countered by growing evidence that hispanics are integrating themselves into american society and embracing its ideals.
high school graduation and college enrollment rates among hispanics are rising teen pregnancy is falling and more and more are learning english.
in recent years more than a quarter of hispanic marriages have involved a non hispanic partner.
far from being a disaster the growing hispanic population is providing the nation with a surge of youthful energy and vitality and demonstrating such traditional american attributes as self reliance rugged individualism thrift close family ties strong religious beliefs disproportionate participation in the military and an ethic of hard work.
1462 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present the clinton presidency bill clinton arrived at the white house in 1993 with an almost legendary combination of strengths and weaknesses.
at forty six years old he was the third youngest president in history only slightly older than john kennedy and theodore roosevelt.
like ronald reagan clinton charmed people and his speeches inspired them.
he was shrewdly smart full of energy resilient persistent and a self described policy wonk who loved debating the fine points of new legislative ideas.
clinton resembled jimmy carter in his determination to be a centrist democrat who reached out to w orking and m iddle class voters who no longer trusted liberals to take their tax money and spend it with discipline yet while graced with charm and a common touch with voters as well as a commitment to fulfilling his campaign pledges clinton was also prone to self absorption self deception and self inflicted wounds.
a sucker for flattery with a compulsion to please and to be loved he often seemed to decide his stances on issues by finding out what others believed by studying the results of focus group interviews and public opinion surveys.
a creature of both inspired leadership abilities and unruly passions he at times seemed less a president than a flawed good ol boy capable of self righteous sleaziness and shameless misbehavior he would dismiss his impeachment as just a political deal.
in sum clinton was a bundle of warring impulses whose faults often confounded his talents.
yet he displayed legendary energy and slick resilience.
his nickname was the comeback kid he thrived amid storms.
one of his advisers predicted that clinton would make every mistake possible but he will only make it once like jimmy carter clintons career as a governor did not prepare him well for some of his presidential duties.
his inexperience in international affairs and congressional maneuvering led to several missteps in his first year as president.
like george h w bush before him he reneged on several campaign promises.
in a bruising battle with congress he was forced to abandon his proposed m iddle class tax cut to keep another campaign promise to reduce the federal deficit.
then he dropped his promise to allow gays to serve openly in the armed forces after military commanders expressed strong opposition.
he later announced an ambiguous policy that came to be known as dont ask dont tell dadt which allowed gays lesbians and bisexuals to serve in the military but only if they kept their sexual orientation secret.
i got the worst of both worlds clinton later confessed.
i lost the fight and the gay community was highly critical of me for the compromise in his first two weeks in office his approval rating dropped 20 percent.
throughout his presidency however he displayed a remarkable ability to manage crises and rebound from adversity.
the clinton presidency 1463 the economy as a candidate bill clinton had pledged to reduce the federal deficit without damaging the economy or hurting the nations most vulnerable people.
to this end he proposed 241 billion in higher taxes for corporations and for the wealthiest individuals the top income tax rate rising from 33 to 39 6 percent over four years and 255 billion in spending cuts over the same period.
the hotly contested bill passed the democratic nafta protesters protesters going to controlled congress by the slimmest a rally against nafta the controversial of margins 218 to 216 in the house free trade agreement for north america.
and 51 to 50 in the senate with vice president al gore providing the tie breaking vote.
in the end t he deficit reduction effort worked as planned.
it led to lower interest rates which along with low energy prices helped spur dramatic economic growth.
equally difficult was gaining congressional approval of the north american free trade agreement nafta which the bush administration had negotiated with canada and mexico.
clinton urged approval of nafta which would make north america the largest free trade zone in the world.
opponents favored tariffs to discourage the importation of cheaper foreign products especially from mexico.
yet clinton prevailed with solid republican support while losing a sizable minority of democrats mostly labor unionists and southerners who feared that textile mills would lose business and millions of jobs to cheap labor c ountries as they did.
health care reform clintons primary public policy initiative was an ambitious plan to overhaul the nations h ealth care system.
if i dont get health care he declared ill wish i didnt run for president public support for government administered health insurance had spread as annual medical costs skyrocketed and some 37 million americans most of them poor or unemployed went without it.
the clinton administration argued that providing medical insurance to everyone regardless of income would reduce the costs of health care to the nation as a whole but critics questioned the savings as well as the ability of the federal government to manage such a huge program.
the grand plan known as the health security act called for large corporations to pay for most of the 1464 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present medical insurance expenses of their employees and required small businesses to form health alliances so that they too could provide subsidized health insurance to their workers.
by the summer of 1994 clintons 1 364 page h ealth insurance plan developed by a task force headed by the first lady hillary rodham clinton was doomed in part because the president opposed any changes and in part because the report was impossibly complicated.
strenuously opposed by republicans and health care interest groups especially the pharmaceutical and insurance industries clintons prized bill was voted down by congress in august 1994 landslide republican victory the health care bill disaster influenced the 1994 midterm elections.
in the most stunning congressional victory of the twentieth century the republicans captured both houses of congress and won 32 governorships including the largest states of california new york and texas where george w bush the son of the former president and a future president himself won handily.
the republican victory was led by a combative georgia conservative named newton newt leroy gingrich.
in early 1995 he became the first republican speaker of the house in forty two years.
gingrich a former history professor with a lust for controversy and an unruly ego was a superb tactician who had helped mobilize religious and social conservatives associated with the christian coalition.
the christian coalition organized by television evangelist pat robertson in 1989 to replace jerry falwells moral majority which had disbanded that year was pro school prayer a nti abortion a nti feminist and anti gay rights.
in addition to celebrating traditional family values it urged politicians to radically downsize government.
ralph reed a born again christian political activist who would head the christian coalition declared that christians needed to take back this country in many respects the religious right took control of the political and social landscape in the nineties.
in 1994 gingrich and his fellow republicans rallied conservative voters by promising a contract with america a pledge to dismantle the corrupt liberal welfare state created by democrats.
the ten point anti big government contract promised a smaller federal government by reducing the regulation of businesses environmental protections requiring term limits for members of congress slashing social welfare programs and passing a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced annual federal budget.
as texan tom delay a leading house republican explained youve got to understand we are the clinton presidency 1465 i deologues.
we have an agenda.
we have a philosophy yet the m uch trumpeted contract with america quickly fizzled.
the conservatives pushed too hard and too fast realizing too late that their slim majority in congress could not launch a revolution.
they were able to pass only four minor elements of their contract gingrichs heavy handed methods newt gingrich joined by 160 of his fellow house republicans gingrich contributed to the disintegration of promotes the contract with america in the contract with america.
repub april 1995 lican senator bob dole said gingrich was a o ne man band who rarely took advice he was too ambitious too abrasive too divisive.
when clinton refused to go along with republican demands for a balanced budget pledge gingrich twice shut down the federal government during the fall of 1995.
the tactic backfired.
by 1996 republicans abandoned the contract with america in part because gingrich had higher negative r atings in public surveys than the president.
the supreme court and race the conservative mood also revealed itself in supreme court rulings that undermined a ffirmative action programs which gave african american students special consideration in college admissions and financial aid awards.
between 1970 and 1977 african american enrollment in colleges and universities doubled even as white students and their parents complained about reverse discrimination in 1996 two major rulings affected affirmative action in college a dmissions.
in hopwood v texas a federal court ruled that race could not be used as a consideration for admission.
later that year california voters passed proposition 209 also known as the california civil rights initiative or ccri which ruled out preferential treatment affirmative action in government hiring government contracting and public schools based on race sex ethni city or national origin.
similar complaints were directed against affirmative action programs that awarded government contracts to m inority owned businesses.
in 1995 the court in adarand constructors v pea declared that affirmative action programs had to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling national interest the implication of such vague language was clear the court had come to share the growing public suspicion of the value 1466 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present and legitimacy of programs designed to benefit a particular race gender or ethnic group.
legislative breakthrough after the surprising 1994 republican takeover of congress bill clinton shrewdly resolved to save his presidency by reinforcing his claim that he was a centrist he co opted much of the energy of the conservative movement by announcing that the era of big government is over and by reforming the federal system of welfare payments to the poor created during the 1930s under the new deal.
late in the summer of 1996 the republican congress passed a comprehensive welfare reform measure that clinton signed after some revisions.
the personal responsibility and work opportunity act of 1996 prwoa illustrated clintons efforts to move the democratic party away from the liberalism it had promoted since the 1930s.
prwoa abolished the aid to families with dependent children afdc program which provided poor families with almost 8 000 a year and replaced it with the temporary assistance for needy families program which limited the duration of welfare payments to two years in an effort to encourage unemployed people to get self supporting jobs.
liberal democrats bitterly criticized clintons welfare reform deal.
yet the new approach to supporting the poor was a statistical success.
both the number of welfare recipients and poverty rates declined during the late nineties leading the editors of the l eft leaning new republic to report that the prwoa had worked much as its designers had hoped the 1996 campaign the republican takeover of congress in 1994 gave the party hope that they could prevent president clintons reelection.
after clinching the republican presidential nomination in 1996 senate majority leader bob dole resigned his seat to devote his attention to the campaign.
clinton however maintained a large lead in the polls.
with an improving economy and no major f oreign policy crises cultural and personal issues surged into prominence.
concern about doles age seventy three and his gruff public personality as well as tensions between economic conservatives and social conservatives over volatile issues such as abortion and gun control hampered doles efforts to generate widespread support especially among independent voters.
clinton was able to frame the election as a stark choice between doles desire to build a bridge to the past and clintons promise to build a bridge to the future.
on november 5 1996 clinton won a second term with an electoral vote victory of 379 to 159 and 49 percent of the popular vote.
dole received 41 percent of the popular vote and third party candidate ross perot got 8 percent.
the clinton presidency 1467 the new economy bill clintons presidency benefited from a prolonged period of unprecedented economic prosperity.
during his last three years in office 1998 2000 the federal government generated unheard of budget surpluses.
what came to be called the new economy featured h igh flying electronics computer software telecommunications cellular phones cable tv etc.
and e commerce internet firms called dot com companies.
these dynamic tech enterprises helped the economy set records in every area low inflation low unemployment corporate profits and personal fortunes.
the stock market value of u s companies nearly tripled and people began to claim that the new economy defied the b oom and bust cycles of the previous hundred years.
alan greenspan the federal reserve board chairman suggested that we have moved beyond history into an economy that seemed only to grow.
he would be proven wrong.
globalization another major feature of the new economy was g lobalization.
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the soviet union opened many new opportunities for u s companies in international trade.
in addition new globe spanning communication technologies and massive new container carrying ships and cargo jets shortened time and distance enabling united states based multinational companies to conduct more business abroad.
bill clinton accelerated the process of globalization.
the global economy he said is giving more of our own people and billions around the world the chance to work and live and raise their families with dignity he especially welcomed the world wide web which opened the internet to everyone and by doing so greatly accelerated u s dominance of the international economy.
by 2000 more than a third of the production of u s multinational companies was occurring abroad compared with only 9 percent in 1980.
in 1970 there were 7 000 american multinational companies by 2000 the number had soared to 63 000.
many u s multinational companies pursued controversial outsourcing strategies by which they moved their production offshore to nations such as mexico and china to take advantage of lower labor costs and fewer workplace and environmental regulations.
at the same time many european and asian companies especially automobile manufacturers built large plants in the united states to reduce the shipping expenses required to get their products to american markets.
the u s economy had become internationalized to such an extent that global concerns exercised an e ver increasing influence on domestic and foreign policies.
1468 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present foreign policy in the nineties unlike george h w bush bill clinton had little interest in global politics.
untrained and inexperienced in international relations he had to focus on creating opportunities around the world for u s business expansion.
yet as international analyst leslie gelb cautioned the new president a foreign economic policy is not a foreign policy and it is not a national security strategy events soon forced clinton to intervene to help nations in crisis.
haiti in 1990 the politically unstable caribbean island nation of haiti the hemispheres poorest country had installed its first democratically elected president a popular catholic priest named jean bertrand aristide.
when haitian army officers ousted aristide the following year he and thousands of his supporters took up exile in america most of them settling in south florida which upset many floridians.
in 1994 president clinton announced his intention to restore aristide to power in part to return the exiled boat people to their homeland.
with drawn out negotiations leading nowhere clinton asked in july for a un resolution authorizing military intervention in haiti.
at that juncture former president jimmy carter volunteered to help negotiate a last minute settlement and he convinced the military leaders to relinquish their control of the government and leave the nation.
clinton sent 20 000 u s troops to ensure a peaceful transfer of power.
aristide returned to haiti on october 15 and on march 31 1995 the u s peacekeeping troops left as a un force commanded by an american general took over.
but neither aristide nor his successors were able to generate prosperity or stability.
the middle east president clinton continued george h w bushs policy of orchestrating patient negotiations between the arabs and the israelis.
a new development was the inclusion of the palestinian liberation organization plo.
in 1993 secret talks between israeli and palestinian representatives resulted in a draft agreement between israel and the plo that provided for the restoration of palestinian self rule in the occupied gaza strip and in jericho on the west bank in a land for peace exchange as outlined in united nations security council resolutions.
a formal signing occurred at the white house on september 13 1993.
with clinton presiding israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin and plo leader yasir arafat exchanged handshakes and their foreign ministers signed the agreement.
the middle east peace process suffered a terrible blow in early november 1995 however when rabin was assassinated by an israeli zealot who the clinton presidency 1469 clinton and the middle east president clinton presides as israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin left and plo leader yasir arafat right agree to a pathbreaking peace accord between israel and the palestinians september 1993 resented the efforts to negotiate with the palestinians.
some observers feared that the assassin had killed the peace process as well when seven months later conservative hard liner benjamin netanyahu narrowly defeated the united states backed shimon peres in the israeli national elections.
yet in october 1998 clinton brought arafat netanyahu and king hussein of jordan together at a conference in maryland where they reached an agreement.
under the wye river accords israel agreed to surrender land in return for security guarantees by the palestinians.
the balkans clinton also felt compelled to address turmoil in the eastern european nations now free from soviet domination.
in 1991 yugoslavia had disintegrated into ethnic warfare as four of its six multiethnic republics declared their independence.
serb minorities backed by the new republic of serbia stirred up civil wars in neighboring croatia and bosnia.
in bosnia the conflict involved systematic efforts to eliminate muslims.
clinton decided that the situation was intolerable because the massacres of tens of thousands of people tore at the very fabric of human decency.
he ordered food and m edical supplies sent to besieged bosnian muslims and dispatched warplanes to stop the massacres.
in 1995 u s negotiators finally persuaded the foreign ministers of croatia bosnia and yugoslavia by then a loose federation of the republics of s erbia and montenegro to agree to a comprehensive peace plan.
bosnia would remain 1470 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present a single nation but would be divided into two states a muslim croat federation controlling 51 percent of the t erritory and a bosnian serb republic controlling the rest.
basic human rights would be restored and free elections would be held.
to enforce the agreement 60 000 nato peacekeeping troops were dispatched to bosnia.
in 1998 the balkan tinderbox flared up again this time in the yugoslav mcrubble pro miloevic residents province of kosovo which had long of belgrade yugoslavia destroy the been considered sacred ground by storefront of a mcdonalds restaurant christian serbs although 90 percent in 1999 to protest nato and the united states airstrikes on their homeland.
of the 2 million kosovars were in fact albanian muslims.
in 1998 yugoslav president slobodan miloevi began a program of ethnic cleansing whereby yugoslav forces burned albanian villages murdered men raped women and displaced hundreds of thousands of muslim kosovars.
on march 24 1999 nato relying heavily upon u s military resources and leadership launched air strikes against yugoslavian military targets.
after seventy two days of bombardment miloevi sued for peace on natos terms in part because his russian allies had finally abandoned him.
an agreement was reached on june 3 1999 and clinton pledged extensive u s aid to help the yugoslavs rebuild.
the scandal machine for a time clintons preoccupation with foreign crises helped deflect attention from a growing number of investigations into his personal conduct.
during his first term he was dogged by old charges about investments he and his wife had made in whitewater a planned resort development in arkansas.
the project turned out to be a fraud and a failure and the clintons were accused of conspiring with the developer although they lost 40 000 in the enterprise.
in 1994 kenneth starr a sanctimonious former judge and a conservative republican was appointed to investigate the whitewater case.
starr did not uncover any evidence that the clintons were directly involved in the whitewater fraud but in the course of another investigation he happened upon evidence of a white house sex scandal.
for years rumors had cir the clinton presidency 1471 culated about the presidents dalliances with women.
james carville clintons political consultant once asked clinton about his sexual risk taking.
well clinton replied they havent caught me he spoke too soon.
monicagate between 1995 and 1997 clinton had engaged in a sexual affair with a t wenty two year old white house intern monica lewinsky.
more disturbing he had pressed her to lie about their relationship even under oath.
the news devastated the first family and staggered the white house staff.
clintons press secretary dee dee myers could not believe that her boss would risk his presidency for something so frivolous so reckless so small clinton initially denied the charges telling the nation in late january 1998 that i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky yet the scandal would not disappear.
for the next thirteen months the media circus surrounding the monicagate or zippergate affair captured public attention.
after the watergate affair in 1973 1974 journalists have loved to attach the suffix gate to scandals.
other women stepped forward to claim that clinton had engaged in improper relations with them over the years charges that the president denied.
the first lady hillary clinton grimly stood by her husband amid his self inflicted agony declaring that the sexual rumors were the result of a vast right wing conspiracy to bring him down.
with the economy booming clintons public approval ratings actually rose during 1998.
in august however the scandal revived when lewinsky agreed to provide a federal grand jury with a detailed account of her relationship with the president.
soon thereafter clinton became the first president to testify before a grand jury.
on august 17 the self pitying defiant president admitted having had inappropriate intimate physical contact with lewinsky that was wrong he also acknowledged that he had misled the american people.
in his eagerness to keep himself in office however he insisted that he had done nothing illegal.
public reaction was mixed.
a majority expressed sympathy for the president because of his public humiliation and because the lewinsky affair was a private act of consensual sex.
others however were eager to see the president resign or be impeached.
triumphant republicans were convinced they could impeach the president.
the impeachment of clinton on september 9 1998 enneth starr the special prosecutor submitted to congress t hirty six boxes k of documents that included a disturbingly graphic account of the presidents white house encounters with lewinsky.
the report claimed that there was substantial and creditable evidence of presidential wrongdoing perjury 1472 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present obstructing justice and abusing his presidential powers.
the starr report prompted the republican dominated house of representatives on october 8 to begin a wide ranging impeachment inquiry and led bill clinton to claim that he was the victim of a rogue prosecutor run amok.
starr is evil the president charged.
when this thing is over theres only going to be one of us left standing.
and its going to be me on december 19 1998 william jefferson clinton was impeached charged with high crimes and misdemeanors by the house of representatives.
the house officially approved two articles of impeachment charging clinton with lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice.
he was the first elected president to be impeached.
andrew johnson was not elected he became president upon the assassination of abraham lincoln.
house speaker newt gingrich who been had censured officially condemned by his republican colleagues in 1997 for several serious violations of house rules led the effort to impeach the president even though he himself was at the time secretly engaged in a six year long affair with a congressional staff member.
gingrich resigned as speaker in november 1998 and left both the house and his wife escaping with his new wife from politics altogether.
journalists began calling clintons senate trial the soap opera impeachment after gingrichs successor as speaker robert livingston of louisiana suddenly resigned from congress in late december after admitting that he too had engaged in adulterous affairs.
the impeachment trial began on january 7 1999.
five weeks later on february 12 a majority of senators by a 55 45 vote decided that clintons adultery and lies were not the high crimes and misdemeanors required to remove a president from office.
the president was a cquitted much to the regret of many republicans.
the situation called to mind an old texas saying we tried to hang him but the rope broke arthur schlesinger jr the distinguished scholar of the presidency called the clinton lewinsky affair the weirdest episode in our political history though the impeachment effort failed clintons final eighteen months in office were stained and distracted by the scandal and many americans were exhausted by the partisan drama and disenchanted with politics and politicians.
clintons last two years in office were anticlimactic.
assessing the clinton presidency for all of his faults bill clinton was the most compelling figure of his political generation.
both loved and hated he presided over an unprecedented period of prosperity 115 consecutive months of economic growth and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years generated unheard of federal budget surpluses and passed a a chaotic start to a new century 1473 impeachment representative edward pease a member of the house judiciary committee covers his face during the vote on the third of four articles of impeachment charging president clinton with high crimes and misdemeanors in december 1998.
elfare reform measure with support from both parties.
in the process he w revitalized the democratic party by moving it from the left to the vital center of the political spectrum.
by 1998 it was the democrats not the republicans who were viewed as the party of fiscal responsibility.
clinton also helped bring peace and stability to the balkans one of the most violent regions of europe.
at times however his boundless self confidence led to arrogant recklessness.
he debased the presidency with his sexual escapades and his effort undertaken with his wife hillary rodham clinton to bring health i nsurance to the uninsured was a clumsy failure.
clinton was less a great statesman than a great escape artist.
in 2000 his last year in office he enjoyed a public approval rating of 65 percent the highest e nd of term rating since p resident dwight d eisenhower.
yet his popularity was not enough to ensure the election of his vice president al gore as his successor.
a chaotic start to a new century wild celebrations around the world ushered in the year 2000 and americans led the cheering.
they greeted the new century with a sense of triumphalism.
the cold war was over the united states was the worlds only hyperpower 1474 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present and the high tech american economy dominated global trade.
but the joyous mood did not last.
powerful and unstable new forces were emerging the most dangerous of which were sophisticated global networks of menacing terrorists eager to disrupt and destroy american values and institutions.
a disputed election the presidential election of 2000 proved to be one of the closest and most controversial in history.
the two m ajor party candidates vice president albert gore jr the democrat and texas governor george w bush son of the former republican president offered contrasting views on the role of the federal government tax cuts environmental policies and the best way to preserve social security and medicare.

bush campaigned on a theme of compassionate conservatism promised to restore honor and dignity to the white house and proposed to transfer power from the federal government to the states.
a born again evangelical christian with degrees from yale university and harvard business school bush urged tax cuts and a more humble foreign policy that would end u s efforts to install democratic governments in undemocratic societies nation building.
the bitter tone of party politics called polarization continued to inspire candidates at the extremes to run as third party candidates.
two independent candidates added zest to the recount in yet another recount the 2000 presidential campaign the col on november 24 2000 judge robert orful conservative commentator patrick rosenberg examines a ballot with buchanan and the liberal consumer a magnifying glass.

of the close results.
the november election created high drama.
the television networks i nitially reported that gore had narrowly won the state of florida and its decisive twenty five electoral votes.
later in the evening however they reversed themselves saying that florida was too close to call.
in the chaotic e arly morning hours the networks declared that bush had been elected president.
the final tally showed bush with a r azor thin lead but florida law required a recount.
for the first time in 125 years the results of a presidential election remained in doubt for weeks after the voting.
as a painstaking hand recount proceeded supporters of bush and gore sparred in the courts.
each side accused the other of trying to steal the e lection.
the political drama lasted for five weeks until on d ecember 12 a b itterly divided u s supreme court decided with a 5 4 m ajority ruling that the recount was to be halted.
bush was declared the winner in florida by 537 votes.
gore had amassed a 540 000 vote lead nationwide but l osing florida meant he lost in the electoral college by two votes.
although gore strongly disagreed with the 1476 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present supreme courts decision he asked voters to rally around president elect bush and move forward.
partisan rancor he urged must be put aside the ferocious sparring between the two national parties was not put aside however in part because bush chose as key advisers men known for their brusqueness and strong ideological convictions.
one of them r ichard dick cheney a former wyoming congressman and influential m ember of the nixon ford and bush administrations quickly became the most p owerful vice president in history.
cheney so secretive that he often appeared sinister used his long experience with the government bureaucracy to fill the administration with like minded associates who helped him control the flow of information to the president.
he became a domineering influence on the inexperienced bush.
a change of direction george w bush had promised to cut taxes for the wealthy increase military spending oppose strict environmental regulations and privatize social security by investing workers retirement pension funds in the stock market.
first however he had to deal with a sputtering economy.
by march 2001 the economy was in recession for the first time in more than a decade.
bush decided that cutting taxes was the best way to boost economic growth.
on june 7 2001 he signed the economic growth and tax relief act which cut 1 35 trillion in taxes.
instead of paying for themselves in renewed economic growth however the bush tax cuts led to a sharp drop in federal revenue producing in turn a fast growing budget deficit as the clinton surpluses were quickly used up.
huge increases in the costs of medicare and medicaid resulting from the aging of the baby boom generation contributed to the soaring deficits as did m ilitary expenditures caused by an unexpected war.
bush was also distracted by global crises.
islamic militants around the world bitterly resented what they viewed as the imperial globalization of u s culture and power.
with increasing frequency they used terrorism including suicide bombings to gain notoriety exact vengeance and generate fear and insecurity.
throughout the nineties the united states had fought a losing struggle against global terrorist groups in part because terrorism thrives in nations with weak governments overwhelmed by rapid population growth scarce resources widespread poverty and huge numbers of unemployed young men symptoms many nations were suffering.
the ineffectiveness of u s intelligence agencies in tracking the movements and intentions of militant extremists became tragically evident in the late summer of 2001.
a chaotic start to a new century 1477 9 11 a new day of infamy at 8 45 a m on september 11 2001 the continental united states was attacked for the first time since 1814 when a passenger airliner that had been hijacked by islamist terrorists slammed into the north tower of the world trade center in new york city.
eighteen minutes later a second hijacked jumbo jet crashed into the south tower.
the twin towers 110 stories tall and filled with 50 000 workers burned fiercely the infernos forcing hundreds of desperate people to jump to their deaths as t housands more on the floors below the points of impact struggled to evacuate.
the steel structures quickly collapsed from the intense heat destroying surrounding buildings and killing nearly 3 000 people including more than 400 firefighters police officers and emergency responders.
the southern end of manhattan ground zero became a hellish scene of twisted steel suffocating smoke wailing sirens and panicked people.
while the catastrophic drama in new york city was unfolding a third hijacked plane crashed into the pentagon in washington d c a fourth airliner september 11th smoke pours out of the north tower of the world trade center as the south tower bursts into flames after being struck by a second hijacked airplane.
both iconic buildings would collapse within an hour.
1478 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present probably headed for the white house missed its mark when the passengers who had heard reports of the earlier hijackings via their cell p hones assaulted the hijackers to prevent the plane from being used as a weapon.
during the struggle the plane went out of control and plummeted into the ground near shanksville pennsylvania killing all aboard.
within hours of the hijackings the nineteen dead terrorists were i dentified as members of al qaeda arabic for the base a well financed network of islamic extremists led by a wealthy saudi renegade osama bin laden.
years before bin laden had declared jihad holy war on the united states israel and the saudi monarchy in his effort to create a single islamist caliphate global empire.
he used remote bases in sudan and war torn afghanistan as training centers for jihadist fighters.
collaborating with bin ladens terrorist network was afghanistans ruling taliban a coalition of ultraconservative islamists who provided bin laden a safe haven.
the war on terror the 9 11 assault on the united states like the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 changed the course of modern life.
people were initially paralyzed by grief fear and anger.
the u s economy already in decline went into free fall.
president bush was thrust into the role of commander in chief of a nation eager for vengeance.
bush said that he was going to launch a global war on terror to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil he warned other nations that either you are with us or you are with the terrorists a wave of patriotic fervor rolled across the nation.
people formed long lines to donate blood and many signed up for military service.
bush demanded that afghanistans taliban government surrender the al qaeda terrorists or risk military attack.
the taliban refused and on october 7 2001 the united states and its allies launched operation enduring freedom.
after american and british cruise missiles and bombers destroyed afghan military installations and al qaeda training camps ground troops from the united states and some of its nato allies routed taliban forces.
on december 9 the taliban regime collapsed.
the war in afghanistan then transitioned into a h igh stakes manhunt for the elusive osama bin laden who had escaped into the mountains of pakistan.
fighting terror at home while the military campaign continued in afghanistan officials in washington worried that terrorists might attack the united states with biological chemical or even nuclear weapons.
a chaotic start to a new century 1479 war fever president george w bush addresses members of the special forces in july 2002 as part of an appeal to congress to increase defense spending after the september 11 terrorist attacks.
to address the threat and to help restore public confidence president bush without congressional approval established the office of homeland security and gave it sweeping authority to spy on americans.
another new federal agency the transportation security administration assumed responsibility for screening airline passengers for weapons and bombs.
at the same time bush and a supportive congress created the usa patriot act which gave government agencies the right to eavesdrop on confidential conversations between prison inmates and their lawyers and permitted suspected terrorists to be tried in secret military courts.
civil liberties groups voiced grave concerns that the measures jeopardized constitutional rights and protections but most people supported these extraordinary steps.
what the public did not know was that vice president dick cheney secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and other s o called neoconservatives neocons in the departments of state and defense had convinced the president to authorize the use of torture enhanced interrogation techniques in the cias and fbis treatment of captured terrorist suspects.
such tactics violated international law and compromised the human rights ideals that had always been americas greatest strength.
when asked about such activities the shadowy cheney scoffed that america sometimes had to work the dark side weve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world.
1480 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present the taliban a young woman shows her face in public for the first time in five years after northern alliance troops capture kabul the capital of afghanistan in november 2001.
the strict sharia law enforced by the taliban required that women be covered from head to foot.
the bush doctrine in the fall of 2002 president bush unveiled a dramatic new national security policy.
the bush doctrine said that the growing menace posed by shadowy networks of terrorist groups and unstable rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction wmds required the united states at times to use preemptive military action.
if we wait for threats to fully materialize or wait for allies to join america he explained we will have waited too long.
in the world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action.
and this nation will act the dangerously sweeping bush doctrine promised to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe.
for all peoples everywhere without reference to the potential human and financial cost of such an open ended commitment.
the second iraq war during 2002 and 2003 iraq emerged as the focus of the bush administrations policy of preemptive military action.
three of the presidents most influential advisers all neocons vice president cheney secretary of defense rumsfeld and deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz urged the president to use u s power to reshape the world in the american mold.
this included sponsoring regime change in nations lacking political and economic freedom in order to create a new world order friendly to our security our prosperity and our principles they convinced bush that a chaotic start to a new century 1481 the dictatorial regime of saddam hussein and his loyal sunni faction of muslims who lorded over the nations shiite majority and the ethnic kurds in the north represented a grave and gathering danger because of its supposed possession of biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction.
some in congress urged caution.
republican senator chuck hagel of nebraska a vietnam veteran warned that many of those who want to rush this country into war and think it would be so quick and easy dont know anything about war the white house responded trust us on march 17 2003 bush issued hussein an ultimatum he and his sons must leave iraq within f orty eight hours or face a united s tates led invasion.
hussein refused.
two days later on march 19 american and british forces the coalition of the willing attacked.
france and germany refused to participate in what they viewed as unnecessary american aggression.
operation iraqi freedom according to bush and his advisers would quickly topple hussein with overwhelming military force and then usher in a new era of u s style democracy in iraq.
the second iraq war began with a massive bombing campaign followed by a fast moving invasion from bases in kuwait.
some 250 000 american soldiers sailors and marines were joined by 50 000 british troops.
on april 9 after three weeks of intense fighting amid sweltering heat and blinding sandstorms u s forces captured baghdad the capital of iraq.
saddam husseins regime and his inept demoralized army collapsed a week later.
the six week war came at a cost of fewer than 200 combat deaths among the 300 000 allied troops.
more than 2 000 iraqi soldiers were killed civilian casualties numbered in the tens of thousands.
president bush staged a celebration on a u s aircraft carrier at which he announced victory under a massive banner proclaiming mission accomplished but he spoke too soon the initial military triumph carried with it the seeds of deception and disaster for no weapons of mass destruction were to be found in iraq.
secretary of state colin powell later admitted that he had been misled about the issue.
bush said that the absence of wmds in iraq left him with a sickening feeling for he knew that his primary justification for the war had evaporated.
rebuilding iraq it proved far easier to win the brief war than to rebuild iraq in americas image.
unprepared u s officials faced the daunting task of installing a democratic government in a nation fractured by religious feuds and ethnic tensions made worse by the breakdown in law and order caused by the allied invasion.
the successful invasion triggered a vicious civil war in iraq and the disintegration of law and order.
looting and violence engulfed the war torn country large parts of which fell under the control of 1482 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present warlords and criminal gangs.
in the process the entire middle east already volatile was further destabilized.
within weeks vengeful islamic radicals streamed into the crippled nation to wage a merciless campaign of terror sabotage and suicide bombings against the u s forces.
bushs macho reaction to the i nsurgency bring em on revealed how uninformed he was about the f ast deteriorating situation.
the leader of the new iraqi government prime minister n ourial maliki quickly imposed his own authoritarian s hiite dominated regime which discriminated against the sunnis the kurds and other ethnic and religious minorities.
defense secretary rumsfeld greatly underestimated the difficulty and expense of occupying pacifying and reconstructing postwar iraq.
by the fall of 2003 bush admitted that substantial numbers of american troops around 150 000 would have to remain in iraq much longer than anticipated.
he also said that rebuilding iraq would take years and cost almost a trillion dollars.
investigative reporter james fallows concluded that the u s occupation in iraq is a debacle not because the government did no planning but because a vast amount of expert planning was willfully ignored by the people in charge victory on the battlefields of iraq did not bring victory in the war on terrorism militant islamist groups remained a global threat.
americans grew more and more dismayed as the number of casualties and the expense of the military occupation in iraq soared.
the nation became more alienated when journalists revealed graphic pictures of u s soldiers abusing and torturing arab detainees in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad.
when you lose the moral high ground an army general sadly observed you lose it all president bush urged americans to stay the course insisting that a democratic iraq would bring stability to the middle east and thereby blunt the momentum of islamic terrorism.
yet even though saddam hussein was captured in december 2003 and later hanged iraq seemed less secure than ever.
by the beginning of 2004 some 1 000 americans had died in the conflict and more than 10 000 had been wounded.
the ethnic and religious tensions only worsened as violent sunni jihadists allied with al qaeda to undermine the new iraqi government and assault u s forces.
the u s effort in iraq was the wrong war in the wrong place fought in the wrong way.
it forced bush to spend government funds at a rate faster than any president since lyndon johnson and it distracted attention from the revival of the taliban and other terrorist groups in afghanistan.
we thank god for appeasing us with the u s dilemmas in iraq and afghanistan snickered bin ladens deputy ayman a l zawahiri.
journalist roger cohen distilled perhaps the most important lesson from the wars in iraq and afghanistan when a chaotic start to a new century 1483 freedom for whom.
the american torture of iraqis in abu ghraib prison only exacerbated the anger and humiliation that iraqis experienced since the first gulf war.
in response to americas incessant promises of peace and autonomy a baghdad mural fires back that freedom for b u sh he said that the american ideal of democracy can still resonate with people around the world but u s leaders must embody it rather than impose it the election of 2004 growing public concern about iraq complicated george w bushs campaign for a second presidential term in 2004.
the democratic nominee senator john kerry of massachusetts condemned bush for misleading the nation about weapons of mass destruction and for his slipshod handling of the reconstruction of postwar iraq.
kerry also highlighted the bush administrations record budget deficits.
bush countered that the tortuous efforts to create a democratic government in iraq would enhance americas long term security.
on election day november 2 2004 exit polls suggested a kerry victory but in the end the election hinged on the crucial swing state of ohio.
no republican had ever lost ohio and won the presidency.
despite early returns indicating a kerry victory in ohio late returns tipped the balance toward bush even as rumors of electoral irregularities began to circulate.

second term blues george bushs second term was beset by thorny political problems a sluggish economy and continuing turmoil in iraq.
in 2005 he pushed through congress an energy bill and a central american free trade act.
but his effort to second term blues 1485 privatize social security retirement accounts by enabling individuals to invest their accumulated pension dollars themselves went nowhere and soaring budget deficits made many fiscal conservatives feel betrayed by the supposedly conservative bush.
the editors of the economist an influential conservative newsmagazine declared that bush had become the least popular re elected president since richard nixon hurricane katrina in 2005 president bushs eroding public support suffered another blow.
in late august a killer hurricane named katrina slammed into the gulf coast devastating large areas of alabama mississippi and louisiana.
katrina left more than 1 000 dead and millions homeless and hopeless especially in new orleans.
local officials and the federal emergency management agency fema were caught unprepared as the catastrophe unfolded and confusion and incompetence abounded.
in the face of blistering criticism bush accepted responsibility for the balky federal response and accepted the resignation of the fema director.
rebuilding the gulf coast would take a long time and a lot of money.
the backlash over the federal response to katrina contributed to a devastating defeat for republicans in the november 2006 congressional the aftermath of hurricane katrina two men use boards to paddle through high water in flood devastated new orleans.

nancy pelosi the first female speaker of the house at a news conference on capitol hill.
the surge in iraq george w bush bore the brunt of p ublic indignation over the bungled federal response to the katrina d isaster and the costs and casualties of the war in iraq.
senator chuck hagel a nebraska republican declared in 2005 that were losing in iraq throughout the fall of 2006 the violence in iraq spiraled upward.
bush eventually responded to declining public and political support for the iraq war by creating the iraq study group a bipartisan task force appointed by the p resident.
it surprised the president by issuing a report recommending the withdrawal of combat forces from a grave and deteriorating iraq by the spring of 2008.
bush disagreed with those who urged a phased withdrawal.
on january 10 2007 he announced that he was sending a surge of 20 000 eventually 30 000 more troops to iraq bringing the total to almost 170 000.
from a military perspective the surge succeeded.
by the fall of 2008 violence in iraq had declined dramatically and the iraqi government had grown in stature and confidence.
the u s general who masterminded the increase in troops admitted that the gains were fragile and reversible however and as the number of u s combat deaths in iraq passed 4 000 bush acknowledged that the conflict was longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated by 2008 more than 60 percent of americans said that the war had been a mistake.
second term blues 1487 economic shock after the intense but brief 2001 recession the boom bust capitalist economy had begun another period of prolonged expansion.
between 1997 and 2006 home prices in the united states especially in the fast growing sunbelt states rose 85 percent leading to a frenzy of irresponsible mortgage lending and a debt financed consumer spending spree.
tens of millions of people bought houses they could not afford refinanced their mortgages or tapped h ome equity loans to make discretionary purchases.
the irrational confidence in soaring housing prices also led government regulatory agencies and mortgage lenders to ease credit restrictions so that unqualified people could buy homes without making any down payment.
the housing bubble burst in 2007 when home values and sales began a sharp decline.
the loss of trillions of dollars in home values set off a seismic shock across the economy as record numbers of borrowers defaulted on their mortgage payments.
foreclosures and bankruptcies soared and banks lost billions first on the shaky mortgages then on most other categories of overleveraged debt credit cards car loans student loans and commercial m ortgage backed securities.
the sudden contraction of corporate spending and consumer purchases pushed the economy into a recession in 2008.
some of the nations most prestigious banks investment firms and insurance companies went belly up.
the price of food and gasoline spiked and unemployment soared.
what had begun as a sharp decline in home prices became a global economic meltdown.
the crisis demanded decisive action.
on october 3 2008 president bush signed into law the troubled asset relief program tarp which called for the treasury department to spend 700 billion to keep big banks and other large financial institutions afloat.
yet the passage of the bill did little to restore confidence in the economy as a whole.
in early october stock markets around the world began to crash with the onset of what came to be called the great recession which technically lasted from december 2007 to january 2009 and forced almost 9 million people out of work.
its effects would linger however and the economic recovery that began in june 2009 would be the weakest since the end of the second world war.
the great recession had powerful political effects.
bush who as governor of texas had described himself as a uniter not a divider became one of the least popular and most divisive presidents in american history.
just 29 percent of voters approved of his leadership and more than 80 percent said that the nation was headed in the wrong direction kevin phillips a prominent republican strategist deemed bush perhaps the least competent president in modern history bushs failed presidency 1488 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present rio vista california with an 816 000 deficit this northern california city filed for bankruptcy and pulled the plug on its massive 750 home housing development in november 2008.

i inherited a recession and im ending on a recession bush admitted at one of his last press conferences.
a historic new presidency george bushs unpopularity excited democrats about regaining the white house in 2008.
the early f ront runner for the nomination was new york senator hillary rodham clinton the spouse of ex president bill clinton.
like her husband she displayed an impressive command of policy issues and mobilized a well funded campaign team.
and as the first woman with a serious chance of gaining the presidency she had widespread support among voters eager for female leadership.
in the end however an overconfident clinton was upset in the d emocratic primaries and caucuses by barack obama of illinois a l ittle known first term senator.
young handsome and intelligent a vibrant mixture of i dealism and a historic new presidency 1489 pragmatism coolness and passion obama was an inspiring speaker who attracted huge crowds by promising a politics of hope he mounted an innovative internet based campaign directed at grassroots voters donors and volunteers.
in early june 2008 he gained enough delegates to secure the nomination with senator joseph biden of delaware as his running mate.
obama was the first african amer the clinton campaign democratic ican presidential nominee of either presidential candidate senator hillary rodham clinton speaks at a rally in fort party the gifted biracial son of a white worth texas.

obama eventually graduated from columbia university before earning a law degree from harvard.
the forty seven year old senator presented himself as a deal maker who could inspire unite and forge bipartisan collaborations.
candidate obama radiated poise confidence and energy.
he told an aide that he didnt need to be president.
it turns out that being barack obama is a pretty good gig in and of itself he and his strategists were able to turn his vitality and political inexperience into strengths at a time when voter disgust with politics was widespread.
by contrast his republican opponent s eventy two year old arizona senator john mccain was the oldest presidential candidate in history.
as a twenty five year veteran of congress and a leading senator mccain had developed a reputation as a bipartisan maverick willing to work with democrats to achieve key legislative goals.
on november 4 2008 barack obama made history by becoming the first person of color to be elected presi barack obama the president elect and his family wave to supporters in dent.

obama also helped the democrats win solid majorities in both houses of congress.
within days of his victory obama adopted a bipartisan approach in s electing his new cabinet members.
he appointed hillary clinton secretary of state retained republican robert gates as secretary of defense selected retired general james jones who had campaigned for mccain as his national s ecurity adviser and appointed eric holder as the nations first african a merican attorney general.
but picking a bipartisan cabinet proved easier than forging a bipartisan presidency.
obamas first term president obama and his administration inherited two unpopular wars and the worst economic situation in eighty years.
his most pressing challenge was to keep the great recession from becoming a prolonged depression.
unemployment in early 2009 had passed 8 percent and was still rising.
the financial sector remained paralyzed and public confidence had plummeted.
a historic new presidency 1491 one visible sign of the great recessions effects was the sharp decline in mexicans emigrating to the united states.
in 2000 some 700 000 mexicans had crossed the rio grande but by 2010 the number had dropped to less than 150 000 as it became easier for people to improve their quality of life in mexico and harder to do so in the united states.
by 2014 some experts believed that more mexicans were leaving the u s than entering it.
to enable banks to start lending again the new administration continued the tarp program that provided massive government bailouts to the largest banks and financial institutions.
the bailouts were attacked by both the left and the right as deeply unfair to most struggling americans.
treasury secretary timothy geithner later explained we had to do whatever we could to help people feel their money was safe in the banking system even if it made us unpopular had they not saved the big banks obama and geithner argued the economy would have crashed.
preserving the banking system did not create many jobs however.
to do so in mid february 2009 congress passed and obama signed an 832 billion economic stimulus bill called the american recovery and reinvestment act.
the bill included cash distributions to states for construction projects to renew the nations infrastructure roads bridges levees government buildings and the electricity grid money for renewable energy systems and 212 billion in tax reductions for individuals and businesses as well as funds for food stamps and unemployment benefits.
it was the largest government infusion of cash into the economy in history.
in the end however it was not enough to generate a robust economic recovery but obamas actions did save the nation and the world economy from a financial meltdown.
health care reform the economic crisis merited barack obamas full attention but he chose as his top legislative priority a controversial federal health insurance program.
from his first day in office obama stressed his intention to reform a health care system that was bankrupting families bankrupting businesses and bankrupting our government at the state and federal level the united states home to the worlds costliest health system was the only rich nation without a national health care program.
since 1970 the proportion of uninsured people had been steadily rising along with health care costs.
in 2010 roughly 50 million americans 16 percent of the population most of them poor young or people of color had no health insurance.
the presidents goal in creating the patient protection and affordable care act aca which republican critics labeled obamacare was to make health insurance more affordable and make health care accessible for everyone.
the 940 billion law proposed in 2009 and debated for a year centered on the 1492 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present s o called individual mandate which required uninsured adults to purchase an approved private insurance policy made available through state run exchanges websites where people could shop for insurance or pay a tax penalty.
l ower income americans could receive federal subsidies to help pay for their coverage and insurance companies could no longer deny coverage to people with preexisting illnesses.
employers who did not offer health insurance would have to pay higher taxes and drug companies and manufacturers of medical devices would have to pay annual government fees.
everyone but especially the wealthy would pay higher medicare payroll taxes to help fund the changes.
the individual mandate was designed to ensure that all americans had health insurance so as to reduce the skyrocketing costs of hospitals providing charity care for the uninsured.
the aca did not change the american tradition of e mployment based health insurance provided by private companies.
but the idea of forcing people to buy health insurance flew in the face of such ideals as individual freedom and personal responsibility.
critics questioned not only the individual mandate but the administrations projections that the program would reduce federal expenditures over the long haul.
republicans mobilized to defeat the aca.
if were able to stop obama on this it will be his waterloo.
it will break him predicted south carolina senator jim demint.
despite heated opposition however the aca passed with narrow party line majorities in both houses of congress.
obama signed it into law on march 23 2010.
its complex provisions to be implemented over a f our year period would bring health insurance to 32 million people half of whom would be covered by expanded medicaid and the other half by the individual mandate.
in its scope and goals the aca was a landmark in the history of health and social w elfare as well as the expansion of the federal government.
obamacare and the courts no sooner had president obama pushed his h ealth care plan through congress than republicans began challenging its constitutionality.
on june 28 2012 in the case of national federation of independent business v sebelius the supreme court surprised observers by ruling 5 4 that most of the new law was constitutional.
even more surprising was that the chief justice john g roberts a philosophical conservative who had never before voted with the four liberal justices on the court cast the deciding vote.
roberts upheld the acas individual mandate that required people to buy private health insurance or pay a tax arguing that it was within congresss power to impose taxes as outlined in article 1 of the constitution.
many conservatives including the four dissenting justices felt betrayed.
the verdict led the new york times to predict that the ruling may secure obamas place in history a historic new presidency 1493 regulating wall street the near collapse of the nations nancial system beginning in 2008 prompted calls for overhauling the financial fi regulatory system.
on july 21 2010 obama signed the wall street reform and consumer protection act also called the dodd frank bill after its two congressional sponsors.
it was the most comprehensive reform of the financial system since the new deal in the thirties.
the 2 319 page law required government agencies to exercise greater oversight over complex new financial transactions and protected consumers from unfair practices in loans and credit cards by establishing a new consumer financial protection agency.
president obama predicted that the bill despite its complexity would lift our economy give certainty to everybody about the technical rules g overning banking and end tax funded bailouts period by 2010 however the economy had not been lifted and many bankers remained confused about the new rules regulating the financial industry.
foreign affairs president obama had more success in dealing with foreign affairs than in reviving the american economy.
what journalists came to call the obama doctrine was very much like the nixon doctrine 1970 stressing that the united states could not continue to be the worlds principal policeman.
yet the fate of americas economy and security was entangled more than ever with the fate of an unstable and often violent world.
the obama doctrine the loosely defined obama doctrine grew out of efforts to end the expensive wars in iraq and afghanistan.
in essence the president wanted to replace confrontation and military intervention with a stance of cooperation and negotiation.
the president told administration officials that his doctrine could be summed up in the phrase dont do stupid stuff on february 27 2009 obama announced that all 142 000 u s troops would be withdrawn from iraq by the end of 2011 as the iraqi government and the bush administration had agreed in 2008.
true to his word the last u s combat troops left iraq in december 2011.
their departure marked the end of a bitterly divisive war that had raged for nearly nine years killed more than 110 000 iraqis and left the nation shattered and unstable despite obamas upbeat claim that the departing u s forces were leaving behind a sovereign stable and self reliant iraq with a representative government the war had cost more than 4 500 american lives 30 000 wounded many grievously so and 2 trillion.
perhaps the greatest embarrassment was that 1494 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present the iraqi government the united states left behind was inept and not even friendly to american interests.
the long and chaotic war was an expensive mistake and a prolonged distraction for the government the military and the nation.
as it turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction nor was there a direct link between the al qaeda terrorists and saddam hussein.
al qaeda in fact did not arrive in iraq until after the american invasion.
the first iraq war in which i led a tank platoon was necessary said john nagel a retired army officer.
this one was not american efforts at nation building had failed.
in june 2014 a j ournalist said that it was time to admit that we cannot force a pluralistic society on a dysfunctional iraq torn by sectarian and ethnic violence into three rival regional states one shiite one sunni governed by jihadists and one kurdish.
even leon panetta who served as cia director and secretary of defense under obama scolded the president for being so eager to withdraw u s forces that he failed to create the circumstances that would preserve our influence and interests in iraq.
obamas hopes that the united states could get out of fighting wars in the middle east and that the iraqis could sustain a home from iraq u s troops returned from iraq to few celebrations.
a historic new presidency 1495 stable and secure government in the face of terrorist incursions and sectarian fighting proved to be fantasies.
iraqs woeful s elf government and the fractious nations constant sectarian strife and disorder required continued infusions of u s military assistance daily bombing raids and massive economic aid.
surge in afghanistan at the same time that president obama was ending u s military involvement in iraq he dispatched 21 000 additional troops to afghanistan in what was called a surge while doing so however he narrowed the focus of the u s mission to suppressing terrorists rather than transforming strife torn afghanistan into a stable capitalist democracy.
the surge worked.
by the summer of 2011 obama announced that the tide of war was receding and that the united states had largely achieved its goals in afghanistan setting in motion a substantial withdrawal of forces that lasted until 2014.
obama stressed that the afghans must determine their countrys future stability.
we will not try to make afghanistan a perfect place he said.
we will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely.
that is the responsibility of the afghan government as the troops came home americans quickly lost interest in what obama had earlier called the good war in afghanistan.
in april 2014 despite threats by the taliban to kill voters afghans turned out in huge numbers to choose a new president to lead them into the post american era.
but it was an expensive outcome for americas longest war.
in the thirteen years since its 2001 invasion of afghanistan america had spent more than a trillion dollars there and lost 2 300 servicemen.
the death of osama bin laden the crowning achievement of president obamas anti terrorism efforts was the discovery at long last of osama bin ladens hideout.
ever since the attacks of 9 11 bin laden had eluded an intensive manhunt.
in august 2010 however u s intelligence analysts discovered his sanctuary in a walled residential compound outside of abbottabad pakistan.
on may 1 2011 obama authorized a daring night raid by a u s navy seal team transported by helicopters from afghanistan.
after a brief firefight the seals killed bin laden.
his death was a watershed moment but it did not spell the end of islamist terrorism.
the arab awakening in late 2010 and early 2011 spontaneous democratic uprisings erupted throughout much of the arab world as l ong oppressed peoples rose up against authoritarian regimes.
corrupt tyrants were forced out of power by a new generation of young activists inspired by democratic ideals and connected by social media on the internet.
what was soon dubbed 1496 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present arab awakening thousands of protesters converge in cairos tahrir square to call for an end to mubaraks rule.
libya ousts gaddafi the arab awakening sent waves of youthful unrest across tunisia algeria bahrain jordan morocco egypt oman yemen libya saudi arabia and syria during what came to be called the arab spring of 2011.
dictators were toppled while democracy was embraced as the remarkable uprisings heralded a new era in the history of the middle east.
yet the heroic days of revolutionary idealism soon gave way to the harsh reality that the rebels were so busy fighting among each other that they could not forge unified political alternatives.
building new democratic governments proved much harder than expected.
the grassroots revolutionary movements in most arab nations stumbled and stalled by 2014.
egypt reverted to an authoritarianism even harsher than that in place before the arab spring.
libya lapsed into chaos and yemen exploded in civil war.
the p ro democracy turmoil in north africa engulfed oil rich libya long governed by the mercurial dictator colonel muammar gaddafi the arab worlds most violent despot.
anti government demonstrations began on february 15 2011 prompting gaddafi to order l ibyan soldiers and mercenaries paid foreign soldiers to suppress the rebellious rats by the end of february what began as a peaceful p ro democratic uprising had turned into a full scale civil war that provided the first real test of the obama doctrine.
true to his word the president refused to act alone in helping the l ibyan rebels critics called it leading from behind.
instead he encouraged european allies to take the lead.
on march 19 france and great britain with american support launched a bombing campaign against gaddafis military strongholds.
in late august rebel forces captured the capital of tripoli scattering gaddafis government and marking the end of his forty two year dictatorship.
on october 20 rebel fighters captured and killed gaddafi.
but the rebel militias that removed gaddafi soon started shooting at each other and stability remained elusive by the end of 2014.
a historic new presidency 1497 the cuban thaw at the end of 2014 president obama surprised the world by announcing that the united states and cuba were going to restore normal relations after more than fifty years of bitter hostility.
as a first step obama relaxed restrictions on american tourists visiting cuba.
six months later in mid 2015 the two nations took a much more substantial step toward normalization when they reestablished embassies in each others capital cities.
the bold move was controversial however.
the powerful cuban community in south florida fiercely criticized obamas decision and congressional republicans threatened to block the appointment of a u s ambassador to cuba because of its communist government.
but the president persisted in his efforts insisting that isolating cuba had not worked.
americans and cubans alike are ready to move forward he said in july 2015.
i believe its time for congress to do the same polarized politics barack obama had campaigned in 2008 on the promise of bringing dramatic change to the federal government in a way that would reduce the p artisan warfare between the two national parties.
by the end of his first year in office however a gallup poll found that he had become the most polarizing president in modern history.
in part the widening partisan divide resulted from obamas aloof presidential style.
like jimmy carter he does not like to lobby and horse trade his way to legislative approval.
even democrats c riticized his growing aloofness from the messy business of working with legislators.
yet the standoff with congress was not solely his fault.
his republican o pponents had no interest in negotiating with him and american political culture had become so polarized that it resembled two separate nations.
each party had its own cable news station and rabidly partisan commentators its own newspapers its own think tanks and its own billionaire donors.
governing obama quickly discovered is far more difficult than campaigning.
the tea party no sooner was barack obama sworn in than anti government conservatives mobilized against him and the tax and spend liberalism he represented in their eyes.
in january 2009 a new york stock trader named graham makohoniuk sent an e mail message urging people to send tea bags to their congressional representatives to symbolize the boston tea party of 1773 when american colonists protested against british tax policies.
within a year or so the tax revolt had become a national tea party movement with groups in all fifty states.
the tea party is not so much a cohesive political organization as it is a mood an attitude and an i deology 1498 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present the tea party movement tea party supporters gather outside the new hampshire statehouse for a tax day rally.
a diverse collection of self described disaffected angry and very conservative activists mostly white male married middle class republicans over f orty five.
to the anti tax rebels the federal bailouts ordered by presidents bush and obama in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown were a form of crony capitalism whereby the elite rewarded the big companies that had funded their campaigns.
tea party members demanded a radically smaller f ederal government although most of them supported social security and m edicare the two most expensive federal social programs.
democrats including obama initially dismissed the tea party as a fringe group but the 2010 election results proved them wrong.
democratic house and senate candidates as well as moderate republicans including many long serving leaders were defeated in droves when conservative republicans many of them aligned with the tea party gained sixty three seats to recapture control of the house of representatives.
they won a near majority in the senate as well.
it was the most lopsided midterm election since 1938.
thereafter the bickering between both parties prevented meaningful action on the languishing economy chronic joblessness and the runaway federal budget deficit.
neither party wanted to negotiate or compromise.
a historic new presidency 1499 occupy wall street the emergence of the tea party was mirrored on the left by the occupy wall street ows movement mobilized in the fall of 2011 when a call went out over the internet to occupy wall street.
bring tent dozens then hundreds then thousands of people many of them unemployed young adults converged on zuccotti park in lower manhattan.
they formed tent villages and gathered to occupy wall street protesting the tyrannical power of major banks and investment companies.
the protesters described themselves as the voice of the 99 percent of americans who were being victimized by the 1 percent the wealthiest and most politically connected amer occupy wall street the manhattan born grassroots movement grew icans.
unlike the tea party however rapidly from rallies to massive marches ows did not have staying power.
in financial districts nationwide like within a year its energies and visi this demonstration in downtown los bility had waned in part because of angeles.
mass arrests in part because it was an intentionally leaderless movement more interested in saying what it was against than explaining what it was for.
bold decisions for all of the political sniping however attitudes toward hot button c ultural values were slowly changing.
in december 2010 congress repealed the dont ask dont tell dadt military policy that since 1993 had resulted in some 9 500 gay men and women being discharged from the armed forces.
a year later a report by army officers concluded that the repeal had no o verall negative impact on military readiness or its component dimensions including cohesion recruitment retention assaults harassment ormorale gay marriage in may 2012 president obama became the first s itting president to support the right of gay and lesbian couples to marry.
that his statement came a day after the north carolina legislature voted to 1500 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present ban all rights for gay couples illustrated how incendiary the issue was.
while asserting that it was the right thing to do obama knew that endorsing same sex marriage had powerful political implications.
the gay community would play an energetic role in the 2012 presidential election and the youth v ote the u nder thirty electorate who most supported gay marriage would be crucial.
no sooner had obama made his announcement than polls showed that american voters for the first time were evenly split on the charged issue with democrats and independent voters providing the bulk of support for s ame sex marriage.
the dream act in june 2012 obama again made waves by issuing an executive order soon labeled the dream act that allowed 1 5 million undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the united states as children to remain as citizens.
his unanticipated decision thrilled hispanic supporters who had lost heart over his failure to convince congress to support more comprehensive immigration reform.
congressional republicans steadfastly opposed giving the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants 80 percent of whom were latinos a pathway to citizenship without first ensuring that the border with mexico was secured.
the dream act however had unexpected consequences.
it excited masses of central americans willing to endure enormous risks to live in america.
panicked parents in el salvador guatemala and honduras worried about widespread drug related gang violence started sending their children through mexico to the united states in hopes of connecting with relatives and being granted citizenship.
during 2014 some 57 000 young migrants were caught along the nearly 2 000 mile long border with mexico and communities across the nation rushed to find families to sponsor the unaccompanied children.
at the same time the obama administration was deporting record numbers of undocumented immigrants more than 2 million by the end of 2014 some of whom had been working in the nation for decades in what was called the great expulsion obama called the deporter in chief by critics claimed that he was only following the laws written by a nti immigration republicans.
others suggested that the harsh deportation policy was part of obamas grand strategy to force congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill.
either way the immigrants were caught in the middle.
the supreme court in the twenty first century the supreme court surprised observers in 2013 by overturning the defense of marriage act doma of 1996 which had denied gay and lesbian couples a historic new presidency 1501 refugees from gangland braving hundreds of miles on foot honduran and salvadorian children are sent off by their parents for a better life in the united states away from the drug dealing violence of central america.

who married in states allowing such unions the right to federal benefits.
in united states v windsor 2013 the court voted 5 4 that the federal government could not withhold spousal benefits from s ame sex couples who had been legally married.
while restoring federal benefits the court did not rule that same sex marriage was a right guaranteed under the constitution.
that issue would have to be resolved by a future court decision scheduled for the summer of 2015.
in the meantime each state could decide whether to allow such marriages.
during 2014 however federal courts repeatedly overturned state laws banning s ame sex marriages arguing that the right to marry was guaranteed by the constitution.
while the court disappointed social conservatives with its windsor decision its five conservative justices continued to make rulings intended to restrict the powers of the federal government.
in june 2013 in shelby county v holder 2013 the court gutted key provisions of the 1965 voting rights act vra which had outlawed discrimination directed toward voters on account of race or color the majority opinion declared that in five of the six southern states originally covered by the vra black voter turnout now exceeded white turnout.
1502 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present to the judges this seemed to prove that there was no evidence of continuing racial discrimination.
todays laws must be justified by current needs chief justice john roberts wrote.
soon after the courts ruling counties and states in the south pushed through new laws that had the effect of making it more difficult for minorities and poor people to vote by reducing voting hours or requiring that drivers licenses be shown on voting days.
the 2012 election as the november 2012 presidential election approached one thing was certain it would be the most expensive election ever in part because the supreme court ruled in citizens united v federal elections committee 2010 that corporations could spend as much as they wanted in support of candidates.
after a divisive battle in the primaries mitt romney a former corporate executive and massachusetts governor won the republican nomination.
the main question for romney was whether the s till powerful religious right would allow him to sidestep tough social issues the question for president obama was whether he could sidestep his failure to restore prosperity.
two factors injured romneys candidacy toward the end of the most expensive campaign in history 6 billion.
the first was his decision to please right wing voters by opposing immigration reforms that might allow undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship.
the second was the disclosure that he had privately told a group of wealthy contributors that he did not care about the 47 percent of americans who failed to take personal responsibility and care for their lives it was not his job to worry about those who did not pay federal income taxes because they were dependent on federal government programs.
the obama campaign seized on the impolitic statement and demonized the wealthy romney as an uncaring elitist.
on election day obama won with 66 million votes to romneys 61 million and 332 electoral votes to 206.
nearly 60 percent of white voters chose romney.
but the nations fastest growing groups hispanics asian americans and african americans voted overwhelmingly for obama as did c ollege educated women.
david frum a prominent republican speechwriter and columnist confessed that his party was becoming increasingly isolated and estranged from modern america obama began his second term on an assertive note.
in january 2013 the defense department lifted its ban on women serving in combat.
the following month obama announced that more u s troops would be withdrawn from afghanistan over the next year leaving 34 000 by early 2014.
it had become americas longest war.
a historic new presidency 1503 obamacare on the defensive president obamas proudest achievement the affordable care act was so massive in its scope and complicated in its implementation that it took four years before it was ready to roll out in the fall of 2013 the federal online health insurance exchange where people without insurance could sign up opened with great fanfare.
obama assured americans that using the online registration system would be real simple it was not.
on october 1 millions tried to sign up only six succeeded.
as it turned out the website had never been properly tested and it was hobbled with technical glitches.
it also became evident that obama had misled the nation about key elements of the plan.
in campaigning for its passage in 2010 he had repeatedly told voters that if they liked their current health insurance plan they could under obamacare keep that insurance.
end of story as it turned out however many with substandard policies saw them canceled by insurers.
congressional republicans as well as many democrats condemned the president for his misleading statements and inept management of his signature program.
during the winter of 2013 2014 the r epublican led house of representatives repeatedly tried and failed to overturn the aca at one point passing a federal budget that would have stripped the new health care program of its funding.
when the president refused to sign the bill the federal government some 800 000 employees shut down after the existing budget expired on september 30.
for sixteen days every nonessential federal agency was closed costing the government 2 billion.
the republicans shutdown strategy failed however as it had in 1995 when citizen outrage was directed not at president clinton but at republican legislators.
in response to widespread criticism and the threat of global economic repercussions house republicans on october 16 passed a revised senate approved budget that removed the a nti aca provision.
the conservative radio commentator rush limbaugh described the republican shutdown as one of the greatest political disasters ive ever seen democrats had little time to celebrate however.
by november 2013 some 57 percent of voters said they opposed obamacare in part because the program benefited only a quarter of the population the uninsured and the underinsured and obamas job approval ratings had plunged.
it had taken the president weeks to acknowledge the botched roll out of obamacare we created this problem we didnt need to create he said to aides.
and its our own doing and its our most important initiative and nobody is madder than me eventually the aca website was fixed and by august 2014 more than 9 million people well above the original target number had signed up for 1504 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present health insurance.
the affordable care act is here to stay obama said.
but even though the s ign up system was fixed public perception of the governments ability to manage the program never recovered.
new global challenges in an age of insecurity in 2013 the united states held its first high level talks with iran since 1979 when iranian militants took u s embassy employees in tehran hostage.
on november 23 secretary of state john kerry reached a multinational agreement with iran to scale back its nuclear development program for six months as a first step toward a more comprehensive agreement not to develop nuclear weapons.
at the same time an increasingly bloody civil war in syria that had claimed 150 000 lives was beginning to have major international repercussions.
in 2013 u s intelligence analysts confirmed that the syrian government ruled with an iron fist by bashar a l assad on august 21 had used chemical weapons to kill 1 400 people many of them children.
president obama had repeatedly warned that such use of weapons of mass destruction was a red line that would trigger international military intervention of enormous consequences in late august he and the french government hesitantly began preparing for a military strike although congress and most americans opposed such action.
it appeared that obama had gotten cold feet about a military intervention.
his former secretary of defense leon panetta argued that obamas failure to follow through on his threat was a blow to american credibility.
when the president as commander in chief draws a red line it is critical that he act if the line is crossed on september 9 secretary of state kerry defused the crisis by signing an agreement with russia to dispose of syrias chemical weapons.
by the end of october all the chemical weapon stockpiles had been destroyed or dismantled but the civil war raged on.
ukraine as the syrian civil war continued a civil uprising occurred in ukraine the former soviet republic of 46 million people that had gained its independence in 1991.
for nearly a quarter of a century russian p resident vladimir putin had viewed the disintegration of the soviet union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century like many russian rulers before him he developed an almost paranoid fear of being invaded from the west either by armies or by democratic ideas.
to restore russian influence over its neighbors and to divide nato and the european union he had exerted economic and political pressure on the republics of the former soviet union.
a historic new presidency 1505 civil war in ukraine a protester in the ukrainian capital of kiev throws a molotov cocktail during violent clashes with police on january 22 2014.
a month later russian president vladimir putin would use the unrest as an excuse to seize control of the crimean region.
on february 27 putin sent troops into the crimea a part of ukraine along the black sea long claimed by russia.
a week later the crimean parliament voted to become part of the russian federation.
putin claiming that crimea had always been an inseparable part of russia quickly made the illegal a nnexation official by positioning russian troops there while denying their presence.
the speed and ruthlessness with which putin seized control of crimea mobilized 40 000 russian troops on the ukrainian border and cut off ukraines crucial access to russian natural gas surprised president obama and e uropean leaders.
it may not have been the start of a new cold war but it put an end to hope that russia would become a cordial partner of the united states and the european democracies.
by 2014 putin had developed a raw and resentful anti americanism fearful that the menacing united states and nato was gaining influence in the former soviet republics at the expense of russia.
in response the united states and the european union hurriedly o rganized diplomatic efforts to de escalate the crisis they refused to recognize the legitimacy of the annexation of crimea and announced economic sanctions against russia while pledging financial assistance to ukraine.
if russia 1506 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present c ontinues to interfere in ukraine we stand ready to impose further sanctions obama said.
by a vote of 100 11 the united nations general assembly also opposed the annexation.
in april 2014 heavily armed pro russian separatists as many as a third of whom were russian soldiers and agents seized control of several cities in eastern ukraine.
they declared a peoples republic and called for secession.
pressure mounted to impose even more sanctions when a malaysian passenger jet flying across eastern ukraine was shot down by a r ussian made rocket in july 2014 killing all 298 on board.
the united states and its allies slammed russia with more economic sanctions but the coldly calculating putin showed no sign of backing away.
in fact his popularity in russia had soared leaving the united states once again in the position of containing russias expansionist ambitions.
the burdens of leadership rarely are presidents more popular than on their first day in office.
to govern is to make decisions and decisions in democratic nations inevitably produce disappointments disagreements and criticism.
during his presidency barack obama has discovered how hard it is to lead the worlds economic and military superpower in the post cold war era.
he has struggled to stabilize a cluster of unstable n ations iraq afghanistan libya ukraine and syria that craved u s resources but resented american meddling.
what unites the crises in ukraine and the middle east is the seeming powerlessness of obama european leaders and the united nations to resolve them easily or quickly in an age of growing insecurity and turmoil.
overall obama adopted a posture of restraint in world affairs.
he was determined to avoid stupid errors wind down the wars in iraq and afghanistan stay aloof from the arab awakening and reduce the use of u s military power abroad so as to concentrate on issues at home.
yet he and others were naive to think that the united states could avoid the burdens of being the only superpower in a p ost cold war world of g rowing anarchy and violence.
there is no diplomatic solution to be found for groups s eeking the total destruction of the american and european d emocracies.
democratic senator diane feinstein of california wondered out loud in september 2014 if obama had become too cautious about the use of force in world affairs.
islamists on the move unexpected events overseas during the summer of 2014 gave obama the opportunity to take decisive action.
in june the volatile middle east took a sudden turn for the worse when sunni jihadists who had been fighting in syria invaded northern iraq and announced the creation of their own nation caliphate called the islamic state isis.
with lightning speed the islamic state emerged as the largest best financed most a historic new presidency 1507 eavily armed and most brutal of the many jihadist terrorist groups financh ing its far flung operations and 40 000 fanatical fighters by selling captured oil and ransoming hostages.
isis was both the culmination of decades of arab islamist rage against europe and the united states and the collapse of effective government and security in syria and iraq.
once american forces left iraq and sunnis grew frustrated with the shia dominated government isis swept in setting off a panic that helped topple the government.
in the areas it captured isis established its own tyrannical form of government based on what it called the management of savagery in the face of the isis advance many iraqi government soldiers that the united states had spent billions of dollars training and equipping fled leaving their valuable weapons and vehicles.
sadistic isis fighters seized huge tracts of territory in syria and iraq while enslaving terrorizing raping massacring crucifying or beheading thousands of men women and children who in some way fell short of their ruthless version of the sunni faith.
in august 2014 after isis terrorists gruesomely beheaded two captured americans president obama ordered systematic airstrikes first in iraq and later in syria to prevent genocide as isis fighters assaulted christians yazidis and kurds in the region.
those airstrikes continue.
obama pulled off a diplomatic coup by building a broad coalition of arab and european partners but u s warplanes bore the brunt of the action.
obama assured americans that he would not get dragged into another ground war but the latest military intervention remained a bitter setback for a president committed to ending u s wars in the middle east.
if george w bush had plunged u s power too deeply into iraq obama seemed to have w ithdrawn u s power too quickly.
one over reached the other under shot.
the stakes were high.
yousef al otaiba the ambassador of the united arab emirates to the united states warned that the radical islamist leaders of the islamic state posed an existential threat to those of us who believe in the true nature of islam as a religion of peace although some criticized obamas actions he characterized the air campaign to slow the mass murder and mayhem by the islamic state as american leadership at its best preventing genocide and deterring the worlds tyrants and terrorists from further mischief is not simply a burden of great power he decided it is a responsibility in an era burdened by constant warfare.
during 2015 however the stability and security in the middle east desired and funded by the united states disintegrated.
civil wars between sectarian factions were engulfing syria iraq libya and yemen.
in 2015 the united states remained the worlds only superpower capable of projecting military power anywhere in the world.
but the i ll considered wars in afghanistan and iraq had left many americans deeply reluctant to support 1508 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present any use of extensive military power that might involve a long term commitment.
the painful lessons of afghanistan and iraq showed that no nation not even a superpower could easily impose its will and its democratic system on people with very different needs beliefs and traditions.
the age of gridlock american politics has always been chaotic and combative its raucous energy is one of its great strengths.
during barack obamas t wo term presidency however the emergence of the tea party and occupy wall street symbolized how savage and unyielding political combat had become.
compromise and moderation had become dirty words.
the scorched earth tactics of republicans in congress were designed to protect the political status quo.
were the party of hell no cried sarah palin the former republican governor of alaska who had run for vice president alongside john mccain in 2008 before becoming the darling of the tea party.
intense partisanship dominated the 2014 congressional elections when republicans gained nine senate seats giving them control of the senate for the first time since 2006.
they also strengthened their hold on the house added governorships and tightened their control of state legislatures.
republicans campaigned on a single theme the failure of president obama and the disaster of obamacare.
kentucky senator rand paul vowed that he and his colleagues would send the president bill after bill until he wearies of it including renewed efforts to repeal obamacare.
political moderates became a dying breed.
by late 2014 the percentage of voters who described themselves as liberals or conservatives had doubled since 1994 and more than twice as many democratic and republican voters as in 1994 had a very unfavorable view of the other party.
congress included mostly republicans on the far right democrats on the far left and hardly anyone in the middle.
that alignment said gerald seib of the wall street journal created a congress that does less and does it less well than any time in memory by 2014 six years after taking office on the promise of hope and change president obama had discovered how difficult it is to preside over a polarized nation much less bring it together.
you know i love this job obama told an adviser early in his presidency.
i love diving into problems.
but dealing with some of the people you have to deal with.
wears you out in the final two years of his presidency obamas greying hair and waning energy revealed a weariness that mirrored his public approval ratings which were well below 50 percent.
james bennet editor of the atlantic monthly a historic new presidency 1509 pointed out that every modern t wo term president had experienced plummeting support.
if we werent sick of the guy to start with we certainly are by now.
what once seemed like roguish charm or bracing surety or nuanced intelligence has curdled into self indulgence or arrogance or passivity voters hoping for a more energetic and engaged obama after his reelection were disappointed by his slow withdrawal from engaged leadership.
he seemed disheartened by the troubling gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics critics savaged him for playing golf more often than any president since eisenhower.
even prominent democrats joined in the attacks.
a successful presidency former secretary of state hillary clinton said needed organizing principles and dont do stupid stuff is not an organizing principle obama repeatedly blamed republicans for stalemating his second term but the president was not blameless.
cabinet member leon panetta stressed that obamas most conspicuous weakness was a frustrating reticence to engage his opponents and rally support for his cause while acknowledging that the president was supremely intelligent panetta added that obama avoids the battle complains and misses opportunities obama was a talented man drawn to political power but frustrated by horse trading politics a leader eager to have power but increasingly reluctant to e xercise it.
to many americans his naturally cautious and careful approach to foreign policy came across as indecisive and weak and his coolness smacked of aloofness.
george w bush was a leader who didnt like to think said ian bremmer an international consultant.
barack obama is a thinker who doesnt like to lead renewed energy yet during the summer of 2015 in the sunset of his presidency obama regained his energy and momentum.
while restoring normal relations with cuba he benefited from two surprising u s supreme court rulings in late june.
for years republicans had waged all out war on the affordable care act obamacare.
unable to halt the implementation of the new program in congress the critics turned to the courts to challenge the flawed new health care law.
in a surprising 6 3 decision in a case called king v burwell the supreme court saved the controversial health care law that will define obamas presidency for generations to come.
chief justice roberts explained in the majority opinion that some of the sloppy language in the original congressional legislation should not be used to destroy the new program.
congress passed the affordable care act to improve health insurance markets not to destroy them roberts stressed.
if at all possible we must interpret the act in a way that is consistent with the former and avoids the 1510 chapter 32 twenty first century a merica 1993 present married with pride a california couple pose in front of the united states supreme court building in washington d c while the supreme court justices hear arguments on the constitutional right for gay couples to wed in april 2015.
on june 26 2015 in a landmark 5 4 decision the court ruled in favor of upholding same sex marriage in all fifty states.
latter president obama was overjoyed by the much anticipated ruling.
five years ago after nearly a century of talk decades of trying a year of bipartisan debate we finally declared that in america health care is not a privilege for a few but a right for all obama said from the white house.
the affordable care act is here to stay then just a day later the u s supreme court issued another bombshell ruling when it announced a 5 4 decision in the obergefell v hodges case which banned states from preventing same sex marriages.
the landmark decision that same sex couples had a constitutional right to marry infuriated the religious right.
rick scarborough a baptist minister in texas vowed that he and others would denounce this practice in our religious services we will not teach it in our schools we will refuse to officiate at this type of wedding and we will not accept any encroachments on our first amendment rights yet the supreme courts affirmation of same sex marriage reflected the profound change in public attitudes toward homosexual rights during the early twenty first century.
in 2008 presidential candidate barack obama had felt a historic new presidency 1511 the need to disavow support for marriage equality.
by 2012 he had reversed himself by embracing the right of same sex marriage.
his change of mind reflected a resurgent social transformation in american life.
cultural diversity like obamacare was here to stay.
obama for example the nations first african american president had appointed two women to the u s supreme court including the first latina justice.
he also ended the ban on open homosexuality in the military.
the unexpected momentum of the court decisions in june 2015 bolstered obamas efforts in another controversial arena foreign policy.
in his 2009 inaugural address he had vowed to international enemies that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist that effort finally paid off in 2015 not only with the normalizing of relations with cuba but also when the united states and five other major world powers announced a draft treaty with iran intended to thwart its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
in exchange for ending the international trade embargo against iran the agreement called for the iranians to dismantle much of their nuclear program and allow for international inspectors to confirm their actions.
obama warned congressional critics that voting against such a treaty would mean a greater chance of war in the middle east a fading american dream.
