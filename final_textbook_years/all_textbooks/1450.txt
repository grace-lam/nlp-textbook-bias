reading helpdesk it matters because human history in the americas began thousands of years ago.
the migration begins guiding question who were the first americans and how did they live.
the written history of the americas is several hundred years old yet human beings have been living on these continents for thousands of years.
where did these people come from.
how and when did they get here.
how did the different corners of north and south america get settled.
today scientists are still seeking answers to these questions.
experts in archaeology ahrkee ahluh jee the study of ancient peoples continue to piece together evidence that tells the story of the first americans.
archaeologists have learned a lot about the past from artifacts ahrtih fakts the tools weapons and other objects that early people left behind.
based on this and other types of evidence archaeologists have offered some possible answers to questions about the first americans.
a widely held theory of recent times is that the first humans might have come to the americas 20 000 or more years ago.
this theory maintains that early people traveled along a strip of land that once linked asia and the americas.
a land bridge revealed throughout earth s history the climate has changed.
several periods of extreme cold have occurred.
the most recent of these ice ages began 100 000 years ago and ended about 10 000 years taking notes identifying as you read use a chart like this one to record reasons early peoples migrated from place to place.

movement based on this map how did prehistoric people get to north america from asia.
critical thinking analyzing why do you think prehistoric people moved from one place in the americas to another.
during these years a large share of earths water formed huge sheets of ice or glaciers.
the glaciers held so much water that ocean levels were lower.
the lower sea level exposed a strip of land a land bridge connecting northeastern asia to what is now alaska.
scientists today call this land bridge beringia.
it now lies beneath the bering strait a body of water named for explorer vitus bering.
a strait is a narrow body of water that connects two larger ones.
many scientists believe early people traveled from asia to north america across the land bridge.
yet not all scientists agree on how or when this might have happened.
for example some think people might have come to the americas by boat.
this might have allowed humans to spread faster throughout the americas.
as archaeologists discover new artifacts and evidence new theories emerge to challenge old ones.
searching for hunting grounds it is clear of course that humans arrived in the americas.
long ago they traveled throughout both continents.
in time settlements stretched as far east as the atlantic ocean and as far south as the tip of south america.

archaeology the study of the material strait a narrow passage of water between remains of ancient peoples two larger bodies of water artifact a tool weapon or other object left behind by early peoples lesson 1 55 what is the reason for this migration my gray shuhn or movement of people from one area to another.
why did these early americans travel such distances.
the answer may lie in the search for food.
early peoples were nomads noh madz people who moved from place to place in search of hunting grounds.
although they also ate wild grains and fruits they depended on hunting for much of their food.
the first americans did indeed find huge mammals to hunt.
these included giant shaggy beasts that resembled modern elephants mastodons and mammoths.
early americans were skilled at hunting these and other animals.
they stalked herds of bison mastodons or mammoths charging at the animals with spears.
r a single mammoth which averaged 12 feet 3 7 m tall could provide tons of meat enough to feed a group of people for months.
earth warms about 15 000 years ago the last ice age began to end.
temperatures started to rise and the glaciers began to melt.
ocean levels rose and beringia disappeared beneath the waves cutting off the land route between asia and the americas.
around the same time the large mammals on which humans depended for food began to disappear.
this might have been the result of overhunting or changes in the climate.
the decline in game populations meant that early americans had to find other sources of food.
reading progress check explaining how did the ice age expose a land bridge between asia and the americas.
settlement guidingquestion how did agriculture change the way of life for early americans.
reading helpdesk the constant search for food meant trying new methods.
early americans caught fish and hunted smaller animals while also gathering berries and grains.
farming was another new option that began to emerge.
its development would change the nomadic way of life of many groups.
migration the movement of people from one area to another nomad to place a person who moves from place the first americans maize a variety of corn carbon dating a scientific method of determining the age of an artifact culture a people s shared values beliefs traditions and behaviors academic vocabulary source a supply estimate a rough calculation of a number learning to farm around 10 000 years ago people in the area now known as mexico learned to plant an early form of maize mayz which is a type of corn.
these early farmers also planted pumpkins beans and squash.
the crops provided a steady reliable source of food.
the farming people no longer had to move from place to place to find things to eat.
farming also allowed the people to spend time on activities other than finding food.
this resulted in an improvement in the lives of early americans.
in the 1600s native americans taught the pilgrims of plymouth colony how to grow maize as well as beans and pumpkins.
establishing unique cultures studying artifacts such as this antler or bone tool helps scientists learn about early cultures.
items such as these give important clues about the way ancient people lived.
for example scientists may be able to use a tool to infer how early people worked what foods they ate and what other tools they may have used.
although some early americans remained nomadic hunters many others began to settle down.
they built permanent shelters from clay stone or wood.
they also made pottery and cloth.
scientists have a method of determining how old an artifact is.
using a process called carbon dating scientists can measure the amount of radioactive carbon in an artifact.
they can use this measurement to come up with an estimate of the artifacts age.
carbon dating has helped scientists to date some settled north american villages to about 5 000 years ago.
through the study and dating of artifacts from these villages scientists know that agriculture changed the lives of early americans.
common customs and beliefs also grew over time.
eventually the groups of people living in the americas developed their own cultures kuhl churz or shared traditions and behaviors.

centuries before the europeans arrived great civilizations sih vuhluhzay shuhnz or highly developed societies thrived in mexico central america and south america.
the largest and most advanced of these were the olmec maya aztec and inca.
each of these civilizations controlled areas covering hundreds of square miles.
they included millions of people and lasted for several centuries.
the accomplishments of the olmec maya aztec and inca rivaled any of the great civilizations in other parts of the world.
their people built grand cities in dense forests and on high mountains.
they created spectacular works of art and developed advanced tools.
they also came up with complex methods for tracking time counting and writing.
the olmec along the gulf coast of what is now mexico a people called the olmec ohl mehk once flourished.
between 1200 b c.
and 800 b c the olmec built stone houses monuments and drainage systems.

the maya the maya my uh civilization followed the olmec and reached its peak between a d 250 and a d 900.
maya farmers planted maize beans squash and other vegetables.
these crops helped feed a large population which may have peaked at 2 million people.
these people lived in the many large cities the maya built in the steamy rain forests of present day mexico guatemala honduras and belize.
maya civilization was a theocracy thee ahkruhsee a society ruled by religious leaders.
powerful maya priests believed the gods were visible in the stars sun and moon.

they were searching for a permanent home for their people.
one day they came upon an island in lake texcoco tehs koh koh.
there they saw what they thought was a sign from their god an eagle with a snake in its beak sitting on a cactus.
according to aztec legend this sign indicated that the island was to be their home.
it was on this site that the aztec would build their capital city tenochtitlan tay nawch teet lahn.
today it is the site of mexico city.
at its height tenochtitlan was the largest city in the americas and one of the largest in the world.
the city was a center of trade attracting thousands of merchants to its outdoor marketplaces.
tenochtitlans construction was a marvel of building skill knowledge and human labor.
workers toiled day and night under the direction of priests and nobles.
they dug soil from the bottom of the lake to make causeways or bridges of earth.
these causeways linked the island and the shore.
elsewhere they used earth to fill in parts of the lake creating fields for growing crops.
aztec culture the aztec created a military empire.
in the 1400s the aztec army conquered many neighboring communities.
conquered people had to pay tribute in food and other goods.
some were also forced to work as slaves in aztec cities and villages.
like maya culture aztec culture revolved around its religious beliefs.
the aztec believed they must perform human sacrifices to please the gods and ensure abundant harvests.
they sacrificed prisoners of war by the thousands for this purpose.

among these cultures were the adena hopewell and mississippians in the central and eastern regions of the present day united states.
the hohokam and the ancient puebloans emerged in the southwestern region.
the adena hopewell and mississippian cultures in central and eastern north america prehistoric native americans built thousands of earthen mounds or earthworks.
the earthworks were not created by a single group but by many different peoples.
scientists have sometimes referred to these different peoples together as the mound builders.
the ancient earthworks take many different forms.
one famous example is in the shape of a serpent.
some resemble the pyramids of the maya and the aztec.
some contained burial chambers and others were topped with temples.

within different regions different groups shared common features.
these features reflected the conditions within each region.
sspl getty northern peoples a people called the inuit ih noo wuht settled the frigid lands at the northernmost part of north america near the arctic ocean.
some scientists believe the inuit were the last migrants to come from asia to north america.
the inuit may have originally come from the asian region of siberia bringing with them the skills needed to survive the cold climate.
in the winter the inuit built igloos low lying structures of snow blocks which protected them from severe weather.
the early inuit were skilled hunters and fishers.
in the coastal waters they hunted whales seals and walruses in small skin covered boats called kayaks.
