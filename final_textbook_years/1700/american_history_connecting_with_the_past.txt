how did this growing population contribute to the nation s economic transformation.
total immigration during 347 five year periods in thousands 41 1821 1825 1826 1830 1831 1835 1836 1840 year immigration 1821 1840 among the sources of the nations growing population in the nineteenth century was rapidly increasing immigration.
this graph shows how rapidly immigration to the united states increased in the 1820s and 1830s.
the 347 000 immigrants in the second half of the 1830s were almost nine times the number in the first half of the 1820s.
where did most of these new immigrants settle.
immigration choked off by wars in europe and economic crises in america contributed little to the american population in the first three decades of the nineteenth century but rapidly revived beginning in the 1830s.
of the total 1830 population of nearly 13 million the foreign born numbered fewer than 500 000.
but the number of immigrants climbed by 60 000 in 1832 and nearly 80 000 in 1837.
reduced transportation costs and increasing economic opportunities helped stimulate the immigration boom as did deteriorating economic conditions in some areas of europe.
the migrations introduced new groups to the united states.
in particular the number of immigrants arriving from the southern counties of ireland began to grow marking the beginning of a tremendous influx of irish catholics that would continue through the three decades before the civil war.
much of this new european immigration flowed into the rapidly growing cities of the northeast.
but urban growth was a result of substantial internal migration as well.
as the agricultural regions of new england and other areas grew less profitable more and more people picked up stakes and moved some to more promising agricultural regions in the west but many to eastern cities.
in 1790 one person in thirty had lived in a city defined as a community of 8 000 or more in 1820 one in twenty and in 1840 one in twelve.
the rise of new york city was particularly dramatic.
by 1810 it was the largest city in the united states.
that was partly a result of its superior natural harbor.
it was also a result of the erie canal completed in 1825 which gave the city unrivaled access to the interior and of liberal state laws that made the city attractive for both foreign and domestic commerce.
immigration and urban growth 1840 1860 the growth of cities accelerated even more dramatically between 1840 and 1860.
the population of new york for exam rapid ple rose from 312 000 to 805 000.

philadelphia s population grew over the same twenty year pe riod from 220 000 to 565 000 bostons from 93 000 to 177 000.
by 1860 26 percent of the population of the free states was living in towns places of 2 500 people or more or cities 8 000 people or more up from 14 percent in 1840.
that percentage was even higher for the industrializing states americas economic revolution 257 1 all others sources of immigration 1820 1840 this pie chart shows where the large numbers of immigrants portrayed in the previous chart came from.

of the northeast.
in the south by contrast the increase of urban residents was only from 6 percent in 1840 to 10 percent in 1860.
the booming agricultural economy of the western regions of the nation produced significant urban growth as well.
between 1820 and 1840 communities that had once been small western villages or trading posts became major cities st louis pittsburgh cincinnati louisville.
all of them benefited from strategic positions on the mississippi river or one of its major tributaries.
all of them became centers of the growing carrying trade that connected the farmers of the midwest with new orleans and through it the cities of the northeast.
after 1830 however substantial shipping began from the mississippi river to the great lakes creating major new urban centers that gradually superseded the river ports.
among them were buffalo detroit milwaukee cleveland and most important chicago.
the enlarged urban population was in part a reflection of the growth of the national population as a whole which rose by more than a third from 23 million to over 31 million in the decade of the 1850s alone.
by 1860 the american population was larger than britains and quickly approaching that of france and germany.
urban growth was also a result of the increasing flow of people into cities from the farms of the northeast.

americas economic revolution 259 immigration from abroad continued to increase as well.
between 1840 and 1850 more than 1 5 million europeans moved to surging america three times the number of arrivals immigration in the 1830s.
still greater numbers arrived in the 1850s over 2 5 million.
almost half the residents of new york city in the 1850s were recent immigrants.
in st louis chicago and milwaukee the foreign born outnumbered those of native birth.
few immigrants settled in the south.
only 500 000 lived in the slave states in 1860 and a third of these were concentrated in missouri mostly in st louis.
the newcomers came from many different countries and regions england france italy scandinavia poland and holland.
german and but the verwhelming majority came from irish ireland and germany.
in 1850 the irish immigrants constituted approximately 45 percent and the germans over 20 percent of the foreign born in america.
by 1860 there were more than 1 5 million irish born and approximately 1 million german born people in the united states.
in germany the economic dislocations of the industrial revolution had caused widespread poverty and the collapse of the liberal revolution there in 1848 also persuaded many germans to emigrate.
in ireland the oppressiveness and unpopularity of english rule drove many people out.
but even more important was the greatest disaster in irelands history a catastrophic failure of the potato crop and other food crops that caused the devastating potato famine of 1845 1849.
nearly a million people died of starvation and disease.
well over a million more emigrated to the united states.
the great majority of irish immigrants settled in the eastern cities where they swelled the ranks of unskilled labor.
most german immigrants moved on to the northwest where they became farmers or went into business in the western towns.
one reason for the difference was wealth german immigrants generally arrived with at least some money the irish had practically none.
another important reason was gender.
most german immigrants were members of family groups or were single men for whom movement to the agricultural frontier was both possible and attractive.
many irish immigrants were young single women for whom movement west was much less plausible.
they were more likely to stay in the eastern cities where factory and domestic work was available.
the rise of nativism some native born americans welcomed the new immigration which provided a large supply of cheap labor that they believed would help keep wage rates low.
land speculators and others with investments in the sparsely populated west hoped that immigrants would move into the region and help expand the population and thus the market for land and goods there.
political leaders in western states and territories wanted the im migrants to swell their population which would increase the political influence of the region.
wisconsin for example permit ted foreign born residents to become voters as soon as they had declared their intention of seeking citizenship and had resided m the state for a year other western states soon followed its lead.
in eastern cities too urban political organizations eagerly courted immigrant voters hoping to enhance their own political strength.
other americans however viewed the growing foreign born population with alarm.
their fears led to the rise of what is known as nativism a defense of native born people and a hostility to the foreign born usually combined with a desire to stop or slow immigration.
the emerging nativism took many forms.
some of it was a result of simple racism.
many nativists conveniently overlooking their own immigrant heritage argued that the new immigrants were inherently inferior to older stock americans.
some viewed them with the same contempt and prejudice and the same low estimate of their potential abilities with which they viewed african americans and indians.
many nativists avoided racist arguments but argued nevertheless that the newcomers were socially unfit to live alongside people of older stock that they did not bring with them sufficient standards of civilization.
evidence for that they claimed was the wretched urban and sometimes rural slums in which they lived.
many nativists seemed to assume that such wretchedness was something immigrants chose rather than the result of their extreme poverty.
others especially workers complained that because foreigners were willing to work for low wages they were stealing jobs from the native labor force.
protestants observing the success of irish catholics in establishing footholds in urban politics warned that the catholic church and the pope were gaining a foothold in total immigration during 1 748 1841 1845 1846 1850 1851 1855 1856 1860 year immigration 1841 1860 immigration continued to increase in the forty years before the civil war.
this chart illustrates the much higher levels of growth than in the previous forty years.
the low point in this era was the first half of the 1840s in which 430 000 new immigrants entered the united states.
that was significantly higher than the largest number of the previous twenty years.
in the early 1850s the number of immigrants grew to nearly 2 million.

whig politicians were outraged because so many of the newcomers voted democratic.
others complained that the immigrants corrupted politics by selling their votes.
many older stock americans of both parties feared that immigrants would bring new radical ideas into national life.
out of these tensions and prejudices emerged a number of new secret societies created to combat what nativists had come to call the alien menace most of them originated in the northeast.
some later spread to the west and even to the south.
the first of these the native american association began agitating against immigration in 1837.
in 1845 nativists held a convention in philadelphia and formed the native american party unaware that the term they used to describe themselves would one day become a common label for american indians.
many of the nativist groups combined in 1850 to form the supreme order of the star spangled banner.
it endorsed a list of demands that included banning catholics or the foreign born from holding public office more restrictive naturalization laws and literacy tests for voting.
the order adopted a strict code of secrecy which included the secret password used in lodges across the country t know nothing ultimately members of the movement became known as the know nothings gradually the know nothings turned their attention to party politics and after the election of 1852 they created a new political organization that they called the american party.

after 1854 the strength of the know nothings declined.
transportation communications and technology just as the industrial revolution needed a growing population it also required an efficient system of transportation and co munications.
such a system was essential in creating regional.
national and ultimately international markets.
progress in this area required not just significant investment but also important advances in technological knowledge.
the canal age from 1790 until the 1820s the so called turnpike era americans had relied largely on roads for internal transportation.
but in a country as large as the united states was becoming roads alone and the mostly horse drawn vehicles that used them were not adequate for the nations expanding needs.
and so in the 1820s and 1830s americans began to turn to other means of transportation as well.
the larger rivers especially the mississippi and the ohio had been important transportation routes for years but most of the traffic on them consisted of flat barges little more than rafts that floated downstream laden with cargo and were broken up at the end of their journeys because they could not navigate back upstream.
to return north shippers had to send goods by land or by agonizingly slow upstream vessels that sometimes took up to four months to travel the length of the mississippi.
these rivers became vastly more important by the 1820s steamboats as steambats grew in number and improved in design.
the new riverboats carried the corn and wheat of northwestern farmers and the cotton and tobacco of southwestern planters to new orleans in a fraction of the time of the old barges.

this picture shows a deep cutting at connected new york to the great lakes via the hudson river.
the granger collection new york the erie canal this lithograph suggests something lockport new york.
the canal was completed in 1825 and 264 chapter 10 ships took the cargoes on to eastern ports.
steamboats also developed a significant passenger traffic and companies built increasingly lavish vessels to compete for this lucrative trade.
but neither the farmers of the west nor the merchants of the east were wholly satisfied with this pattern of trade.
farmers would pay less to transport their goods and eastern consumers would pay less to consume them if they could ship them directly eastward to market rather than by the roundabout river sea route and northeastern merchants too could sell larger quantities of their manufactured goods if they could transport their merchandise more directly and economically to the west.
new highways across the mountains provided a partial solution to the problem.
but the costs of hauling goods overland although lower than before were still too high for anything except the most compact and valuable merchandise.
the thoughts of some merchants and entrepreneurs began therefore to turn to an alternative canals.
a team of four horses could haul one and a half tons of goods eighteen miles a day on the turnpikes.
but the same four horses walking along the towpaths next to canals while yoked to barges could draw a boatload of a hundred tons twenty four miles a day.
by the 1820s the economic advantages of canals had economic advantages of canals generated a booming interest in expanding the water routes to the west.
canal building was too expensive for private enterprise and the job of digging canals fell largely to the states.
the ambitious state governments of the northeast took the lead in constructing them.
new york was the first to act.
it had the natural advantage of a good land route between the hudson river and lake erie through the only real break in the appalachian chain.
but the engineering tasks were still imposing.
the distance was more than 350 miles several times the length of any of the existing canals in america.
the route was interrupted by high ridges and a wilderness of woods.
after a long public debate over whether the scheme was practical canal advocates prevailed when de witt clinton a late but ardent convert to the cause became governor in 1817.
digging began on july 4 1817.
the building of the erie canal was the greatest construction project the united states had ever undertaken.
the canal itself was simple a ditch forty feet wide and four feet deep with the erie towpaths along the banks.
but hundreds of canal difficult cuts and fills some of them enor mous were required to enable the canal to pass through hills and over valleys stone aqueducts were ml antic ocean canals in the northeast 1823 1860 the great success of the erie canal which opened in 182s inspired decad f th s map illustrates.

r 1 y s competitors among them baltimore philadelphia and boston what form of transportation ultimately displaced the canals.
americas economic revolution 265 necessary to carry it across streams and eighty eight locks of heavy masonry with great wooden gates were needed to permit ascents and descents.
the erie canal was not just an engineering triumph but an immediate financial success as well.
it opened in october 1825 amid elaborate ceremonies and celebrations and traffic was soon so heavy that within about seven years tolls had repaid the entire cost of construction.
by providing a route to the great lakes the canal gave new york city direct access to chicago and the growing markets of the west.
new york city could now compete with and increasingly replace new orleans as a destination for agricultural goods particularly wheat and other products of the west and as a source for manufactured goods to be sold in the region.
the system of water transportation and the primacy of new york city extended farther when the states of ohio and indiana inspired by the success of the erie canal provided water connections between lake erie and the ohio river.
these canals helped connect them by an inland water route all the way to new york although it was still necessary to transfer cargoes several times between canal lake and river craft.
one of the immediate results of these new transportation routes was increased white settlement in the northwest because canals made it easier for migrants to make the westward journey and to ship their goods back to eastern markets.
rival cities along the atlantic seaboard took alarm at the prospect of new yorks acquiring so vast a hinterland.
but they had limited success in catching up.
boston its way to the hudson river blocked by the berkshire mountains did not even try to connect itself to the west by canal its hinterland would remain confined largely to new england.
philadelphia and baltimore had the still more formidable allegheny mountains to contend with.
they made a serious effort at canal building nevertheless but with discouraging results.
pennsylvanias effort ended in an expensive failure.
maryland constructed part of the chesapeake and ohio canal beginning in 1828 but completed only the stretch between washington d c and cumberland maryland and thus never crossed the mountains.
in the south richmond and charleston also aspired to build water routes to the ohio valley but never completed them.
in the end canals did not provide a satisfactory route to the west for any of new yorks rivals.
some cities however saw their opportunity in a different and newer means of transportation.
even before the canal age had reached its height the era of the railroad was already beginning.
the early railroads eventually railroads became the primary transportation system for the united states and they remained so until the construction of the interstate highway system in the midtwentieth century.
railroads emerged from a combination of technological and entrepreneurial innovations.
the technological breakthroughs included the invention of tracks the cre technological basis of the ation of steam powered locomotives and railroad the development of railroad cars that could serve as public carriers of passengers and freight.
by 1804 both english and american inventors had experimented with steam engines for propelling land vehicles.
in 1820 john stevens ran a locomotive and cars around a circular track on his new jersey estate.
and in 1825 the stockton and darlington railroad in england opened a short length of track and became the first line to carry general traffic.
american entrepreneurs especially in those northeastern cities that sought better communication with the west quickly grew interested in the english experiment.
the first company to begin actual operations was the baltimore and ohio which opened a thirteen mile stretch of track in 1830.
in new york the mohawk and hudson began running trains along the sixteen miles between schenectady and albany in 1831.
by 1836 more than a thousand miles of track had been laid in eleven states.
but there was not yet a true railroad system.
even the longest of the lines was comparatively short in the 1830s and most of them served simply to connect water routes not to link one railroad to another.
even when two lines did connect the tracks often differed in gauge width so that cars from one line often could not fit onto the tracks of another.
k as a philanthropist and as the founder of the cooper union in new york city was also a successful iron radng on the railroad peter cooper who n later years wa test k own as a p ntanufacturer.
cooper designed and built the first were ocomohve am thumb against a horse drawn railroad car.
this sketch depicts the 266.
chapter 10 schedules were erratic and wrecks were frequent.
but railroads made some important advances in the 1830s and 1840s.
the introduction of heavier iron rails improved the roadbeds.
steam locomotives became more flexible and powerful.
redesigned passenger cars became stabler more comfortable competition between railroads and canals and larger.
railroads and canals were soon competing bitterly.
for a time the chesapeake and ohio canal company blocked the advance of the baltimore and ohio railroad through the narrow gorge of the upper potomac which it controlled and the state of new york prohibited railroads from hauling freight in competition with the erie canal and its branches.
but railroads had so many advantages that when they were able to compete freely with other forms of transportation they almost always prevailed.
the triumph of the rails after 1840 railroads gradually supplanted canals and all other modes of transport.
in 1840 there were 2 818 miles of railroad tracks in the united states by 1850 there were 9 021.
an unparalleled burst of railroad construction followed in the 1850s tripling the amount of trackage in just ten years.
the most comprehensive and efficient system was in the northeast which had twice as much trackage per square mile as the northwest and four times as much as the south.
but the expansion of the rails left no region untouched.
railroads were even reaching west of the mississippi which was spanned at several points by great iron bridges.
one line ran from hannibal to st joseph on the missouri river and another was under construction between st louis and kansas city.
an important change in railroad development was the trend toward the consolidation of short lines into longer lines known as trunk lines.
by 1853 four major railroad consolidation a ll.
trunk lines had crossed the appalachian mountains to connect the northeast with the northwest.
the new york central and the new york and erie gave new york city access to the lake erie ports.
the pennsylvania railroad linked philadelphia and pittsburgh and the baltimore and ohio connected baltimore with the ohio river at wheeling.
from the terminals of these lines other railroads into the interior touched the mississippi river at eight points.
chicago became the rail center of the west served by fifteen lines and more than a hundred daily trains.
the appearance of the great trunk lines tended to divert traffic from the main water routes the erie canal and the mississippi river.
by lessening the dependence of the west on the mississippi the railroads helped weaken further the connection between the northwest and the south.
capital to finance the railroad boom came from many sources.
private american investors provided part of the necessary funding and railroad companies borrowed large sums from abroad.
but local governments states counties cities towns also often contributed capital because they were eager to have railroads serve them.
the railroads obtained substantial additional assistance from the federal government in the form of public land grants.
in 1850 senator stephen a douglas of illinois and other railroad minded politicians persuaded congress to grant federal lands to aid the illinois central which was building from chicago toward the gulf of mexico.
other states and their railroad promoters demanded the same privileges and by 1860 congress had allotted over 30 million acres to eleven states to assist railroad construction.
innovations in communications ano journalism critical to the railroads was an important innovation in communications the magnetic telegraph.
telegraph lines extended along the tracks connecting one station with another and aiding the scheduling and routing of trains.
but the telegraph also permitted instant communication between distant cities tying the nation together as never before.
at the same time it helped reinforce the schism between the north and the south.
like railroads telegraph lines were far more extensive in the north than in the south and they helped similarly to link the north to the northwest and thus to separate the northwest further from the south.
jhe the telegraph burst into american life telegraph in 1844 when samuel f b morse after several years of experimentation succeeded in transmitting from baltimore to washington d c the news of james k polk s nomination for the presidency.
the relatively low cost of constructing wire systems made the morse telegraph system seem the ideal answer to the problems of long distance communication.
by 1860 more than 50 000 miles of wire connected most parts of the country and a year later the pacific telegraph with 3 595 miles of wire opened between new york city and san francisco.
by then nearly all the independent lines had joined in one organization the western union telegraph company.
new forms of journalism also drew communities into a common communications system.
in 1846 richard hoe invented the yhe steam cylinder rotary press making it possi associated t0 print newspapers rapidly and cheaply.
press the development of the telegraph together with the introduction of the rotary press made possible much speedier collection and distribution of news than ever before.
in 1846 newspaper publishers from around the nation formed the associated press to promote cooperative news gathering by wire no longer did they have to depend on the cumbersome exchange of newspapers for out of town reports.
major metropolitan newspapers began to appear in the larger cities of the northeast.
in new york alone there were horace greeleys tribune james gordon bennetts herald henry j raymonds times and others.
all gave serious attention to national and even international events and had substantial circulations beyond the city.
in the long run journalism would become an important unifying factor in american life.
in the 1840s and 1850s however the rise of the new journalism helped to feed sectional discord.

but it did not of course affect everyone equally.
some classes and regions benefited from the economic development far more than others.
advantages of the corporation the expansion of business 1820 1840 american business grew rapidly in the 1820s and 1830s partly because of population growth and the transportation revolution but also because of the daring imagination and ruthlessness of a new generation of entrepreneurs whose enormous wealth allowed for lifestyles of conspicuous consumption one important change came in the retail distribution of goods.
in the larger cities stores specializing in groceries dry goods hardware and other lines appeared although residents of smaller towns and villages still depended on general stores stores that did not specialize.
in these less populous areas many people did much of their business by barter.
the organization of business was also changing.
individuals or limited partnerships continued to operate most businesses and the dominating figures were still the great merchant capitalists who generally had sole ownership of their enterprises.
in some larger businesses however the individual merchant capitalist was giving way to the corporation.
corporations began to develop particularly rapidly in the 1830s when some legal obstacles to their formation were removed.
previously a corporation could obtain a charter only by a special act of the state legislature a cumbersome process that stifled corporate growth.
by the 1830s however states were beginning to pass general incorporation laws under which a group could secure a charter merely by paying a fee.
the new laws also permitted a system of limited liability which meant that individual stockholders risked losing only the value of their own investment if a corporation should fail and that they were not liable as they had been in the past for the corporation s larger losses.
the rise of these new corporations made possible the accumulation of much greater amounts of capital and hence made possible much larger manufacturing and business enterprises.
investment alone however still provided too little capital to meet the demands of the most ambitious businesses.
such inadequate businesses relied heavily on credit and credit their borrowing often created dangerous instability.
credit mechanisms remained very crude in the early nineteenth century.
the government alone could issue official currency but the official currency consisted only of gold and silver or paper certificates backed literally by gold and silver and there was thus too little of it to support the growing demand for credit.
under pressure from corporate promoters many banks issued large quantities of bank notes unofficial currency that circulated in much the same way that government currency did but was of much less stable value.
but the notes had value only to the degree that the bank could sustain public confidence in their value and some banks issued so many notes that their own reserves could not cover them.
as a result bank failures were frequent and bank deposits were often insecure.
the difficulty of obtaining credit for business investment remained therefore an impediment to economic growth.
americas economic revolution 269 the emergence of the factory the most profound economic development in mid nineteenth century america was the rise of the factory.
before the war of 1812 most of what manufacturing there was in the united states took place within private households or in small individually operated workshops.
men and women built or made products by hand or with simple machines such as hand operated looms.
gradually however improved technology and increasing demand produced a fundamental change.
it came first in the new england textile industry.
there entrepreneurs were beginning to make use of new and larger machines driven by water power that allowed them to bring textile operations together under a single roof.
this factory system as it came to be known spread rapidly in the 1820s and began to make serious inroads into the old home based system of spinning thread and weaving cloth.
factories also penetrated the shoe industry concentrated in eastern massachusetts.
shoes were still largely handmade but manufacturers were beginning to transformation of the shoe employ workers who specialized in one industry or another of the various tasks involved in production.
some factories began producing large numbers of identical shoes in ungraded sizes and without distinction as to rights and lefts.
by the 1830s factory production was spreading from textiles and shoes into other industries and from new england to other areas of the northeast.
between 1840 and 1860 american industry experienced even more dramatic growth as the factory system spread rapidly.
in 1840 the total value of manufactured goods produced in the united states stood at 483 million ten years later the figure had climbed to over 1 billion and in 1860 it reached close to 2 billion.
for the first time the value of manufactured goods was approximately equal to that of agricultural products.
of the approximately 140 000 manufacturing establishments in the country in 1860 74 000 were located in the northeast.
the northeast plants were so large that the region produced more than two thirds of the nations manufactured goods.
of the 1 311 000 workers in man ufacturing in the united states about 938 000 were employed in the mills and factories of new england and the mid atlantic states.
the industrial northeast advances in technology even the most highly developed industries were still immature by later standards.
american cotton manufacturers for example produced goods of coarse grade fine items continued to come from england.
but machine technology advanced more rapidly in the united states in the mid nineteenth century than in any other country in the world.
the american economy was growing so rapidly that the rewards of technological innovation were very great.
change was so rapid in fact that some manufacturers built their new machinery out of wood by the time the wood wore out they reasoned improved u rk n river illustrates the rapid growth of the city in the 1850s as it was becoming the great trading center of the central cargo in chicago this engraving of cargo ships docked in the l icag part of the united states.
f archive photos getty image 270 chapter 10 interchangeable north had tried to interchangeable parts technology would have made the machine obsolete.
by the beginning of the 1830s american technology had become so advanced particularly in textile manufacturing that industrialists in britain and europe were beginning to travel to the united states to learn new techniques instead of the other way around.
the manufacturing of machine tools the tools used to make machinery parts was an important contribution to manufacturing.
the government supported much of the research and development of machine tools often in connection with supplying the military.
for example a government armory in springfield massachusetts developed two important tools the turret lathe used for cutting screws and other metal parts and the universal milling machine which replaced the hand chiseling of complicated parts and dies early in the nineteenth century.
the precision grinding machine which became critical to among other things the construction of sewing machines was designed in the 1850s to help the united states army produce standardized rifle parts.
the federal armories such as those at springfield and harpers ferry virginia became the breeding ground for many technological discoveries and a magnet for craftsmen and factory owners looking for ideas that could be useful to them.
by the 1840s the machine tools used in the factories of the northeast were already better than those in most european factories.
parts which eli whitney and simeon introduce into gun factories now found their way into many industries.
eventually interchangeability would revolutionize watch and clock making the manufacturing of locomotives and steam engines and the making of many farm tools.
it would also help make possible such newer devices as bicycles sewing machines typewriters cash registers and eventually the automobile.
industrialization was also profiting from the introduction of new sources of energy.
coal was replacing wood and water power as fuel for many factories.
the production of coal most of it mined around pittsburgh in western pennsylvania leaped from 50 000 tons in 1820 to 14 million tons in 1860.
the new power source made it possible to locate mills away from running streams and thus permitted industry to expand still more widely.
the great technological advances in american industry owed much to american inventors as the patent records of technological the time make clear in 1830 the num innovations ber of inventions patented was 544 by 1850 the figure had risen to 993 and in 1860 it stood at 4 778.
in 1839 charles goodyear a new england hardware merchant discovered a method of vulcanizing rubber treating it to give it greater strength and elasticity by 1860 his process had found over 500 uses and had helped create a major american rubber industry.
in 1846 elias howe of massachusetts constructed a sewing machine isaac singer made improvements on it and the howe singer machine was soon being used in the manufacture of ready to wear clothing.
for all the technological innovations that characterized the early factory system most american industry remained dependent on the most traditional source of power water.
in the 1820s and 1830s water power remained the most important source of power for manufacturing.
the first important factory towns in new england lawrence lowell and others emerged where they did because of the natural waterfalls that could be channeled to provide power for the mills built along their banks.
this sometimes required factories to close for periods in the winter when rivers were frozen.
that was one reason factory owners began to look for alternative forms of energy that could be used throughout the year which led them by the late 1830s to rely more and more on steam and other transportable forms of energy that could be fueled by wood coal or later petroleum.
men and women at work however sophisticated industrial firms became technologically and administratively manufacturers still relied above all on a supply of labor.
in the 1820s and 1830s factory labor came primarily from the native born population.
after 1840 the growing immigrant population became the most important new source of workers.
recruiting a native workforce recruiting a labor force was not an easy task in the early years of the factory system.
ninety percent of americans in the 1820s still lived and worked on farms and many urban residents were skilled artisans independent crafts workers who owned and managed their own shops as small businessmen they were not likely to flock to factory jobs.
the available unskilled workers were not numerous enough to form a reservoir from which the new industries could draw.
the beginnings of an industrial labor supply came instead from the transformation of american agriculture in the nineteenth century.
the opening of vast fertile new farmlands in transformation the midwest the improvement of trans portation systems the development of new farm machinery all combined to increase food production dramatically.
new farming methods were also less labor intensive than the of american agriculture old ones the number of workers required to produce large crops in the west was much smaller than the number required to produce smaller crops in the less fertile northeast.
no longer did each region have to feed itself entirely from its own farms it could import food from other regions.
as as result farmers and their families began to abandon some of the relatively unprofitable farming areas of the east.
in the northeast especially in new england where poor land had always placed harsh limits on farm productivity rural people began leaving the land to work in the factories.
two systems of recruitment emerged to bring this new labor supply to the expanding textile mills.
one common in the americas economic revolution 271 women at work this wood engraving from an american newspaper of 1859 shows women working in a skirt factory.
aside from the crowdedness of the factory none of the usual primitive and unsafe conditions characteristic of many work environments of the time are shown.
the granger collection new york mid atlantic states especially in such major manufacturing centers as new york city and philadelphia brought whole families from the farm to the mill.
parents tended looms alongside their children some of whom were no more than four or five years old.
the second system common in massachusetts enlisted young women mostly farmers daughters in their late teens and early twenties.
it was known as the lowell or waltham system after the factory towns in which it first emerged.
many of these women worked for several years in the factories saved their wages and returned home to marry and raise children.
others married men they met in the factories or in town and remained part of the industrial world but often stopped working in the mills to take up domestic roles instead.
labor conditions in these early years of the factory system were significantly better than those in english industry better too than they would ultimately become in much of the united states.
the employment of young children created undeniable hardships.
but the misery was not as great as in european factories since working children in america usually remained under the supervision of their parents.
in england by contrast asylum authorities often hired out orphans to factory owners who showed little concern for their welfare and kept them in something close to slavery.
even more different from the european labor pattern was the lowell system which relied heavily indeed almost thf 1 own exclusively on young unmarried women.
system in england and other areas of industrial europe the conditions of work for women were often horrifyingly bad.
a british parliamentary investigation revealed for example that women workers in the coal mines endured unimaginably wretched conditions.
some had to crawl on their hands and knees naked and filthy through cramped narrow tunnels pulling heavy coal carts behind them.
it was little wonder that english visitors to america considered the lowell mills a female paradise by contrast.
the lowell workers lived in clean boardinghouses and dormitories which the factory owners maintained for them.
they were well fed and carefully supervised.
because many new englanders considered the employment of women to be vaguely immoral the factory owners placed great emphasis on maintaining a proper environment for their employees enforcing strict curfews and requiring regular church attendance.
employers quickly dismissed women suspected of immoral conduct.
wages for the lowell workers were generous by the standards of the time.
the women even found time to write and publish a monthly magazine the lowell offering.
yet even these relatively well treated workers often found the transition from farm life to factory work difficult even traumatic.
uprooted from everything familiar forced to live women among strangers in a regimented environ workers ment many women suffered from severe loneliness and disorientation.
still more had difficulty adjusting to the nature of factory work the repetition of fixed tasks hour after hour day after day.
that the women had to labor from sunrise to sunset was not in itself a new experience many of them had worked similarly long days on the farm.
but that they now had to spend those days performing tedious unvarying chores and that their schedules did not change from week to week or season to season made the adjustment to factory work especially painful.
but however uncomfortable women may have found factory work they had few other options.
they were barred from such manual labor as construction or from work as sailors or on the docks.

the excerpts from the handbook to lowell from 1848 that follow suggest the tight supervision under which the lowell mill girls worked and lived.
many companies today publish employee handbooks that provide information about employee responsibilities including working hours and days and expectations of employee performance.
they may also outline employee benefits such as compensation vacation policies and medical benefits.
some companies issue formal rules of conduct and ethics by which their employees must abide.
the example from the simpson manufacturing company which makes building products provides an interesting comparison to the lowell guidelines.

275 276 chapter 10 lowell massachusetts 1832 lowell was one of the leading manufacturing centers of new england in the 1830s and one of the largest textile centers in america.
lowell relied heavily on women workers.
company owners in deference to popular uneasiness about women working outside the home created a paternalistic system of boardinghouses for them where they could be carefully supervised.
this map shows the clusters of boardinghouses adjacent to groups of factories.
note how concentrated the manufacturing center of the town was and how the transportation system rail and water served the factories.
note also the many churches which women workers were usually required to attend.
what happened to this labor system in the 1840s and 1850s.
decline of the lowell system for women to travel the country alone as many men did in search of opportunities.
work in the mills was in many cases the only alternative to returning to farms that could no longer support them.
the paternalistic factory system of lowell did not in any case survive for long.
in the competitive textile market as it developed in the 1830s and 1840s a market prey to the booms and busts that afflicted the american economy as a whole manufacturers found it difficult to maintain the high living standards and the attractive working conditions with which they had begun.
wages declined the hours of work lengthened the conditions of the boardinghouses deteriorated as the buildings decayed and overcrowding increased.
in 1834 mill workers in lowell organized a union the factory girls association which staged a strike to protest a 25 percent wage cut.
two years later the association struck again against a rent increase in the boardinghouses.
both strikes failed and a recession in 1837 virtually destroyed the organization.
eight years later the lowell women led by the militant sarah bagley created the female labor reform association and began demanding a ten hour day some women worked twelve hour shifts and for improvements in conditions in the mills.
the new association not only made demands of management it also turned to state government and asked for legislative investigation of conditions in the mills.
by then however the character of the factory workforce was changing again.
the young women who had worked in the mills were gradually moving into other occu pations teaching or domestic service or they got married.
and textile manufacturers were turning to a less contentious labor supply immigrants.
the immigrant workforce the rapidly increasing supply of immigrant workers after 1840 was a boon to manufacturers and other entrepreneurs.
at last they had access to a source of labor that was both large and inexpensive.
these new workers because of their vast numbers and unfamiliarity with their new country had less leverage than the women they at times displaced.
as a result they often encountered far worse working conditions.

economic advantages of immigrant labor gangs made up increasingly of irish immigrants performed the heavy unskilled work on turnpikes canals and railroads under often intolerable conditions.
because most of these workers had no marketable skills and because of native prejudice against them they received wages so low and so intermittently since the work was seasonal and uncertain that they generally did not earn enough to support their families in even minimal comfort.
many of them lived in flimsy shanties in grim conditions that endangered the health of their families and reinforced native preju dices toward the shanty irish.
the arrival of irish workers accelerated the deterioration of working conditions in new england.
there was far less social pressure on owners to provide a decent environment for irish workers than there had been for native women.
employers began paying piece rates wages tied to how much a worker produced rather than a daily wage and employed other devices to speed up production and use the labor force more profitably and efficiently.
by the mid 1840s the town of lowell once a model for foreign visitors of enlightened industrial development had become a squalid slum.
similarly miserable working class neighborhoods were emerging in other northeastern cities.
conditions were still not as bad as in most factory towns in england and europe but in almost all industrial areas factories themselves were becoming large noisy unsanitary and often dangerous places to work.
harsh work conditions the average workday was ex tending to twelve often fourteen hours.
wages were declining so that even skilled male workers could hope to earn only from 4 to 10 per week while unskilled laborers were likely to earn only about 1 to 6 per week.
women and children whatever their skills also earned less than most men.
the factory system and the artisan tradition it was not only the mill workers who suffered from the transition to the modern factory system.
it was also the skilled artisans whose trades the factories were displacing.
the artisan tradition was as much a part of the older republican vision of america as the tradition of sturdy independent yeoman farmers.
independent craftsmen considered themselves embodiments of the american ideal they clung to a vision of economic life that was in some ways very different from what the new capitalist class was promoting.
skilled artisans valued their independence they also valued the stability and relative equality within their economic world.
the factory system threatened that world with obsolescence.
de skilling some artisans made successful transitions into small scale industry.
but others found themselves unable to compete with the new factory made goods that sold for a fraction of the artisans prices.
in the face of this competition from industrial capitalists craftsmen began early in the nineteenth century to form organizations workingmen s political parties and the first american labor unions to protect their endangered positions and to resist the new economic order.
as early as the 1790s printers and cordwainers makers of high quality boots and shoes took the lead.
members of other skilled trades carpenters joiners masons plasterers hatters and shipbuilders felt similarly vulnerable.
in such cities as philadelphia baltimore boston and new york the skilled workers of each craft formed societies for mutual aid.
during the 1820s and 1830s the trade unions craft societies began to combine on a citywide basis and set up central organizations known as trade unions.
with the widening of markets the 278 chapter 10 economies of cities were interconnected so workers soon realized there were advantages in joining forces.
they established national unions or federations of local ones.
in 1834 delegates from six cities founded the national trades union and in 1836 the printers and the cordwainers set up their own national craft unions.
this early craft union movement fared poorly.
labor leaders struggled against the handicap of hostile laws and hostile courts.
the common law as interpreted by the courts in the industrial states viewed a combination among workers as an illegal conspiracy.
the panic of 1837 a dramatic financial collapse that produced a severe recession weakened the movement further.
fighting for control commonwealth v hunt workers at all levels of the emerging industrial economy attempted to improve their lots.
they tried with little success to persuade state legislatures to pass laws setting a maximum workday.
two states new hampshire in 1847 and pennsylvania in 1848 passed ten hour laws limiting the workday unless the workers agreed to an express contract calling for more time on the job.
such measures were virtually without impact however because employers could simply require prospective employees to sign the express contract as a condition of hiring.
three states massachusetts new hampshire and pennsylvania passed laws regulating child labor.
but again the results were minimal.
the laws simply limited the workday to ten hours for children unless their parents agreed to something longer employers had little difficulty persuading parents to consent to additional hours.
perhaps the greatest legal victory of industrial workers came in massachusetts in 1842 when the supreme court of the state in commonwealth v hunt declared that unions were lawful organizations and that the strike was a lawful weapon.
other state courts gradually accepted the principles of the massachusetts decision.
on the whole however the union movement of the 1840s and 1850s remained generally ineffective.
some workers were reluctant to think of themselves as members of a permanent laboring force and resisted joining unions.
but even those unions that did manage to recruit significant numbers of industrial workers were usually not large enough or strong enough to stage strikes and even less frequently strong enough to win them.
artisans and skilled workers despite their setbacks in the 1830s had somewhat greater success than did factory workers.
but their unions often had more in common with preindustrial guilds than with modern labor organizations.
in most cases their primary purpose was to protect the favored position of their members in the labor force by restricting admission to the skilled trades.
the organizing effort that had floundered in the 1830s revived impressively in the 1850s.
among the new organizations skilled workers created were the national typographical union founded in 1852 the stone cutters in 1853 the hat finishers in 1854 and the molders and the machinists both in 1859.
virtually all the early craft unions excluded women even though female workers were numerous in almost every industry and craft.
as a result women began es pjjtcctjve tablishing their own protective unions by unions the 1850s often with the support of mid dle class female reformers.
like the male craft unions the female protective unions had little power in dealing with employers.
they did however serve an important role as mutual aid societies for women workers.
despite these persistent efforts at organization and protest the american working class in the 1840s and 1850s was notable for its relatively modest power.
in england workers were becoming a powerful united and often violent economic and political force.
they were creating widespread social turmoil and helping to transform the nations political structure.
in america nothing of the sort happened.
many factors combined to inhibit the growth of effective labor resistance.
among the most important was the flood of immigrant laborers into the country.
the newcomers were usually willing to work for lower wages than native workers.
because they were so numerous manufac turers had little difficulty replacing disgruntled or striking workers with eager immigrants.
ethnic divisions and tensions both between natives and immigrants and among the various immigrant groups themselves often led workers to channel their resentments into internal bickering rather than into their shared grievances against employers.
there was too the sheer strength of the industrial capitalists who had not only economic but also political and social power and could usually triumph over even the most militant challenges.
americas divided working class w i free labor despite the many obstacles and challenges that faced northern workers in the first half of the nineteenth century nothing was more important than the idea of personal freedom.
most workers had hard lives but they were proud of their personal freedoms and considered themselves what some people called the sovereign individual people who could at least in theory make choices and change their lives.
modern notions of freedom are much more robust than those of the early nineteenth century when only a few men and no women were able to vote when workers were sometimes bound to their employers for years when husbands subjugated their wives and when of course millions of african americans were living with almost no freedom.
but even in the early years of american history the belief in the freedom of the individual was strong.
in the north in particular pen sonal liberty was growing exponentially for more and more americans.
by the mid nineteenth century most white americans identified themselves as free individuals no matter what their occupations or means.
americas economic revolution 279 some of the great philosophers of nineteenth century america argued that the independency of the individual required free people to escape from the market economy and find freedom in solitude and the wonders of nature as henry david thoreau tried to do in his famous retreat to live alone in a cabin on walden pond in concord massachusetts see p 318.
but for most americans the opportunities for solitude and communion with nature were slim.
for most northern workers freedom meant the absence of slavery.
it meant that they could leave jobs they did not want move to new areas of the country and seek opportunities to change their lives.
their material circumstances were sometimes far worse than those of many slaves in the south.
still they believed that their lives were better than those who lacked freedom.
and when the great debate over slavery began in the 1840s and 1850s northern laborers however bad their own lots abhorred slavery both because it was the antithesis of freedom and because they feared that slavery threatened the jobs of free laborers.
not only slaves were denied the freedom that most americans valued.
the more than 200 000 free black men and women living in the north and a few in the south remained ineligible to vote and were not considered legal citizens.
many of the free blacks in the north were people who had been skilled crafts workers as slaves and who bought or were given their freedom.
but their lots were in many ways worse than when they were working in the south.
in the northern cities to which many free blacks moved there were many white craftsmen already who saw black workers as rivals.
most free blacks worked in menial jobs and as domestic servants.
patterns of industrial society the industrial revolution made the united states and particularly its more economically developed regions dramatically wealthier almost every year.
it was also making society more unequal and it transformed social relationships and everyday life at almost every level from the workplace to the family.
the rich and the poor the commercial and industrial growth of the united states greatly elevated the average income of the american people.
but this increasing wealth was being distributed highly un equally.
substantial groups of the population shared hardly at all in the economic growth slaves indians landless farmers and many of the unskilled workers on the fringes of the manufacturing system.
but even among the rest of the population disparities of income were marked.
wea t had always been unequally distributed in the united states to be sure.
even in the era of the revolution according to some estimates 45 percent of the wealth was concentrate in increasing inequality in wealth the hands of about 10 percent of the population.
but by the mid nineteenth century that concentration had become far more pronounced.
in boston in 1845 for example 4 percent of the citizens are estimated to have owned more than 65 percent of the wealth in philadelphia in 1860 1 percent of the population possessed more than half the wealth.
among the american people overall in 1860 according to scholarly estimates 5 percent of the families possessed more than 50 percent of the wealth.
there had been wealthy classes in america almost from the beginning of european settlement.
but the extent and character of wealth were changing in response to the commercial revolution of the mid nineteenth century.
merchants and industrialists were accumulating enormous fortunes and because there was now a significant number of rich people living in cities a distinctive culture of wealth began to emerge.
in large cities people of great wealth gathered together in neighborhoods of great opulence.
they founded clubs and developed elaborate social rituals.
they looked increasingly for ways to display their wealth in the great mansions they built the showy carriages in which they rode the lavish household goods they accumulated the clothes they wore the elegant social establishments they patronized.
new york city which had more wealthy families than anywhere else developed a particularly elaborate high society.

compare the circumstances of these homeless people with those of the aristocrats shown in the picture on page 280.
the granger collection new york 280 chapter 10 central park to affluent new yorkers the construction of the city s great central park was important because it provided them with an elegant setting for their daily carriage rides an activity ostensibly designed to expose the riders to fresh air but that was really an occasion for them to display their finery to their neighbors.
private collection the bridgeman art library new yorkers in 1857 were trying to make the city as important as london and paris.
to achieve this goal they decided to build a great park that would impart elegance to the city and draw new yorkers to the upper part of the city where new real estate was available.
two great landscape architects frederick law olmsted and calvert vaux devel oped a vast part of manhattan displacing people from their houses in the process.
the result was one of the largest parks in america.
olmsted called central park a central park r place or great importance as the first real park in this country designed with hills lakes paths bridges and elegant buildings it began as a place for wealthy new yorkers but very soon became important to almost everyone in the city.
there was also a significant population of genuinely desti the urban tute peop e emerging in the growing urban poor centers of the nation.
these were people who were not merely poor in the sense of having to struggle to sustain themselves most americans were poor in that sense.
they were almost entirely without resources often homeless dependent on charity or crime or both for survival.
some of these paupers as contemporaries called them were recent immigrants who had failed to find work or to adjust to life in the new world.
some were widows and orphans stripped of the family structures that allowed most working class americans to survive.
some were people suffering from alcoholism or mental illness unable to work.
others were victims of native prejudice barred from all but the most menial employment because of race or ethnicity.
the irish were particular victims of such prejudice.
among the worst off were free blacks.
african american communities in antebellum northern cities were small by later standards but most major urban areas had significant african black populations.
some of these african american americans were descendants of families poverty that had lived in the north for generations.
others were former slaves who had escaped from the south or been released by their masters or had bought their freedom some former slaves once free then worked to buy the freedom of relatives left behind.
in material terms at least life was not always much better for them in the north than it had been in slavery.
most had access only to very menial jobs which usually paid too little to allow workers to support their families or educate their children in bad times many had access to no jobs at all.
in most parts of the north blacks could not vote could not attend public schools indeed could not use any of the public services available to white americas economic revolution 281 residents.
still most blacks preferred life in the north how ever arduous to life in the south because it permitted them at least some level of freedom.
social mobility one might expect the contrasts between conspicuous wealth and conspicuous poverty in antebellum america to have encouraged more class conflict than actually occurred.
but a number of factors operated to limit resentments.
for one thing however much the relative economic position of american workers may have been declining the absolute living standard of most laborers was improving.
life in material terms at least was usually better for factory workers than it had been on the farms or in the european societies from which they had migrated.
they ate better they were often better clothed and housed and they had greater access to consumer goods.
there was also a significant amount of mobility within the working class which helped to limit discontent.
oppor social tunities for social mobility for working mobility ones way up the economic ladder were relatively modest.
a few workers did manage to move from poverty to riches by dint of work ingenuity and luck a very small number but enough to support the dreams of those who watched them.
and a much larger number of workers managed to move at least one notch up the ladder for example becoming in the course of a lifetime a skilled rather than an unskilled laborer.
such people could envision their children and grandchildren mov ing up even further.
more common than social mobility was geographic mobility which was even more extensive in the united states than in europe where it was considerable.
america had a huge expanse of uncultivated land in the west much of it open for settlement for the first time in the 1840s and 1850s.
some workers saved money bought land and moved west to farm it.
the historian frederick jackson turner later referred to the availability of western lands as a safety valve for discontent a basic explanation for the relative lack of social conflict in the antebellum united states.
but few urban workers and even fewer poor ones could afford to make such a move or had the expertise to know how to work land even if they could.
much more common was the movement of laborers from one industrial town to another.
restless questing sometimes hopeful sometimes despairing these frequently moving people were often the victims of layoffs looking for better opportunities elsewhere.
their searches may seldom have led to a marked improvement in their circumstances but the rootlessness of this large segment of the workforce one of the most distressed segments made effective organization and protest difficult.
there was finally another safety valve for working class discontent politics.
economic opportunity may not have greatly expanded in the nineteenth century but opportuni ties to participate in politics did.
and to many white ma e working people access to the ballot seemed to offer a way to help guide their society and to feel like a significant part of their communities.
middle class life for all the visibility of the very rich and the very poor in antebellum society the fastest growing group in america was the middle class.
the expansion of the middle class was in part a result of the growth of the industrial economy and the increasing commercial life that accompanied it.
economic development opened many more opportunities for people to rapidly own or wor in businesses to own shops expanding t0 ena8e in trade to enter professions middle class and to administer organizations.
in earlier times when ownership of land had been the only real basis of wealth society had been divided between people with little or no land people europeans generally called peasants and a landed gentry which in europe usually meant an inherited aristocracy.
once commerce and industry became a source of wealth these rigid distinctions broke down and many people who did not own land could become prosperous by providing valuable services to the new economy or by owning capital other than land.
middle class life in the years before the civil war rapidly established itself as the most influential cultural form of urban america.
middle class families lived in solid and often substantial homes which like the wealthy they tended to own.
workers and artisans were increasingly becoming renters a relatively new phenomenon in american cities that spread widely in the early nineteenth century.
middle class women tended to remain in the home and care for the children and the household although increasingly they were also able to hire servants usually young unmarried immigrant women who put in long hours of arduous work for very little money.
one of the aspirations of middle class women in an age when doing the familys laundry could take an entire day was to escape from some of the drudgery of housework.
new household inventions altered and greatly improved the character of life in middle class homes.
perhaps the most important was the invention of the cast household iron stove which began to replace fire inventions places as the principal vehicle for cooking and also as an important source of heat.
these wood or coal burning devices were hot clumsy and dirty by the standards of the twenty first century but compared to the inconvenience and danger of cooking on an open hearth they seemed a great luxury.
stoves gave cooks more control over the preparation of food and allowed them to cook several things at once.
middle class diets were changing rapidly in the antebellum years and not just because of the wider range of cooking the stove made possible.
the expansion and diversification of american agriculture and the ability of farmers to ship goods to urban markets by rail from distant regions greatly 282 chapter 10 increased the variety of food available in cities.
fruits and vegetables were difficult to ship over long distances in an age with little refrigeration but families had access to a greater variety of meats grains and dairy products than they had had in the past.
a few households acquired iceboxes in the years before the civil war and the sight of wagons delivering large chunks of ice to wealthy and middle class homes began to become a familiar part of urban life.
iceboxes allowed their owners to keep fresh meat and dairy products for as long as several days without spoilage.
most families however did not yet have any kind of refrigeration.
preserving food for them meant curing meat with salt and preserving fruits in sugar.
diets were generally much heavier and starchier than they are today and middle class people tended to be considerably stouter than would be fashionable in the twenty first century.
middle class homes came to differentiate themselves from those of workers and artisans in other ways as well.
they growing were more elaborately decorated and fur class nished with household goods made avail distinctions able for the first time through factory production.
houses that had once had bare walls and floors now had carpeting wallpaper and curtains.
the spare simple styles of eighteenth century homes gave way to the much more elaborate even baroque household styles of the early victorian era styles increasingly characterized by crowded even cluttered rooms dark colors lush fabrics and heavy furniture and draperies.
middle class homes also became larger.
it became less common for children to share beds and less common for all family members to sleep in the same room.
parlors and dining rooms separate from the kitchen once a luxury reserved largely for the wealthy became the norm for the middle class as well.
some urban middle class homes had indoor plumbing and indoor toilets by the 1850s a significant advance over the outdoor wells and privies that had been virtually universal only a few years earlier and that remained common among working class people.
the changing family the new industrializing society of the northern regions of the united states produced profound changes in the nature and function of the family.
at the heart of the transformation was the movement of families from farms to urban areas where jobs not land were the most valued commodities.
the patriarchal system of the countryside whereby fathers controlled their childrens futures by controlling the distribution of land to them could not survive the move to a city or town.
sons and daughters were much more likely to leave the family in search of work than they had been in the rural world.
another important change was the shift of income earning work out of the home and into the shop mill or factory.
in the early decades of the nineteenth century and for many years before that the family had been the principal unit of economic activity.
family farms family shops and family industries were the norm throughout most of the united states.
men women and children worked together sharing tasks and jointly earning the income that sustained the family.
but as farming spread to the fertile lands of the northwest and as the size and profitability of farms expanded declining agricultural work became more commer role ofthe cialized.
farm owners in need of labor be family gan to rely less on their families which often were not large enough to satisfy the demand and more on hired male workers.
these farmhands performed many of the tasks that on smaller farms had once been the jobs of the women and children of the family.
as a result farm women tended to work increasingly at domestic tasks cooking sewing gardening and dairying a development that spared them from some heavy labor but that also removed them from the principal income producing activities of the farm.
see chapter 11 for a discussion of family relations in the agrarian south.
in the industrial economy of the rapidly growing cities there was an even more significant decline in the traditional economic function of the family.
the urban household became less important as a center of production.
instead most income earners left home each day to work elsewhere.
a sharp distinction began to emerge between the public world of the work place the world of commerce and industry and the private world of the family.
the world of the family was now more often dominated not by production but by housekeeping child rearing and other primarily domestic concerns.
it was also a world dominated by women.
accompanying and perhaps in part caused by the chang ing economic function of the family was falling birth rates a decline in the birth rate.
in 1800 the average american woman could be expected to give birth to approximately seven children during her childbearing years.
by 1860 the average woman bore five children.
the birth rate fell most quickly in urban areas and among middle class women.
mid nineteenth century americans had access to some birth control devices which undoubtedly contributed in part to the change.
there was also a significant rise in abortions which remained legal in some states until after the civil war and which according to some estimates may have terminated as many as 20 percent of all pregnancies in the 1850s.
but the most important cause of the declining birth rate was changes in sexual behavior including increased abstinence.
women and the cult of domesticity the emerging distinction between the public and private worlds between the workplace and the home led to increasingly sharp distinctions between the social roles of men and women.
those distinctions affected not only factory workers and farmers but members of the growing middle class as well there had of course always been important differences between pastoral america 1848 this painting by the american artist edward hicks suggests the degree to which americans continued to admire the peaceable kingdom the name of another more famous hicks work of the agrarian world.

women had long been denied many legal and political rights enjoyed by men within the family the husband and father had traditionally ruled and the wife and mother had generally bowed to his demands and desires.
it had long been practically impossible for most women to obtain divorces although divorces initiated by men were often easier to arrange.
men were also far more likely than women to win custody of children in case of a divorce.
in most states husbands retained almost absolute authority over both the property and persons of their wives.
wife beating was illegal in only a few areas and the law did not acknowledge that rape could occur within marriage.
women traditionally had very little access to the worlds of business or politics.
indeed in most communities custom dictated that women never speak in public before audiences that included men.
most women also had much less access to education than men a situation that survived into the mid nineteenth cen female turv although they were encouraged to education attend school at the elementary level they were strongly discouraged and in most cases effectively barred from pursuing higher education.
oberlin in ohio became the first college in america to accept female students it permitted four to enroll in 1837 despite criticism that coeducation was a rash experiment approximating free love.
oberlin authorities were confident that the mutual influence of the sexes upon each other is decidedly happy in the cultivation of both mind manners but few other institutions shared their views.
coeducation remained extraordinarily rare until long after the civil war and only a very few womens colleges such as mount holyoke founded in massachusetts by mary lyon in 1837 emerged.
no longer income producers middle class women became guardians of the domestic virtues their role as mothers entrusted with the nurturing of the young new roles for seemed more central to the family than it had in the past.
and their role as wives as companions and helpers to their husbands grew more important as well.
middle class women also became more important as consumers.
they learned to place a high value on keeping a clean comfortable and well appointed home on entertaining and on dressing elegantly and stylishly.
family time consider the source a how a family spends time together has been a favorite subject of artists for centuries.

albany institute of history and art purchase 1951 58 womens separate sphere occupying their own separate sphere some women began to develop a distinctive female culture.
friendships among women became increasingly intense women began to form their own social networks and ultimately to form female clubs and associations that were of great importance to the advancement of various reforms.
a dis tinctive feminine literature began to emerge to meet the demands of middle class women.
there were womens magazines of which the most prominent was godeys lady s book edited after 1837 by sarah hale.
the magazine scrupulously avoided dealing with public controversies or political issues and focused instead on fashions shopping and homemaking advice and other purely domestic concerns.
politics and religion were inappropriate for the magazine hale explained in 1841 because other subjects are more important for our sex and more proper for our sphere by the standards of a later era the increasing isolation of women from the public world seems to be a form of oppression and discrimination.
and it is true that few men considered women fit for business politics or the professions.
on the other hand most middle class men and many middle class omen as well considered the new female sphere a vehicle benefits and costs for expressing special qualities that made women in some ways superior to men.
women were to be the custodians of morality and benevolence just as the home shaped by the influence of women was to be a refuge from the harsh compet itive world of the marketplace.
it was womens responsibility to provide religious and moral instruction to their children and to counterbalance the acquisitive secular impulses of their husbands.
thus the cult of domesticity as some scholars have called it brought both benefits and costs to middle class women.
it allowed them to live lives of greater material comfort than in the past and it placed a higher value on their female virtues and on their roles as wife and mother.
at the same time it left women increasingly detached from the public world with few outlets for their other interests and energies.
the costs of that detachment were particularly clear among unmarried women of the middle class.
by the 1840s the ideology of domesticity had grown so powerful that few genteel women would any longer consider working as many had in the past in shops or mills and few employers would consider hiring them.
but unmarried women nevertheless required some income producing activity.
they had few americas economic revolution 287 choices.
some could become teachers or nurses professions that seemed to call for the same female qualities that made women important within the home and both of those professions began in the 1840s and 1850s to attract significant numbers of women although not until the civil war did females begin to dominate them.
otherwise unmarried females were largely dependent on the generosity of relatives or hired as governesses for children or companions for widows and other women.
middle class people gradually came to consider work by women outside the household to be unseemly something working characteristic of the lower classes as class women indeed it was.
but working class women could not afford to stay home and cultivate the domestic virtues they had to produce income for their families.
they continued to work in factories and mills but under conditions far worse than those that the original more respectable women workers had once enjoyed.
they also frequently found employment in middle class homes.
domestic service became one of the most frequent sources of female employment.
in other words now that production had moved outside the household women who needed to earn money had to move outside their own households to do so.
leisure activities leisure time was scarce for all but the wealthiest americans in the mid nineteenth century.
most people worked long hours.
saturday was a normal working day.
vacations paid or unpaid were rare.
for most people sunday was the only respite from work and was generally reserved for religion and rest.
almost no commercial establishments did any business on sunday and even within the home many families frowned upon playing games or engaging in other kinds of entertainment on the sabbath.
for working class and middle class people therefore holidays took on a special importance.
that was one reason for the strikingly elaborate fourth of july celebrations throughout the country.
the celebrations were not just expressions of patriotism.
they were also a way of enjoying one of the few holidays from work available to virtually all americans.
in rural america where most people still lived the erratic pattern of farmwork gave many people some relief from the relentless work schedules of city residents.
for urban people however leisure was something to be seized in what few free moments they had.
men gravitated to taverns for drinking talking and game playing.
women gathered in one another s homes for conversation or card games or to share work on such household tasks as sewing.
for educated people whose numbers were rapidly expanding reading became one of the prin cipal leisure activities.
newspapers and magazines proliferated rapidly and books novels histories autobiographies biogra phies travelogues and others became staples of affluent homes.
women were particularly avid readers and women writers created a new genre of fiction specifically for females the sentimental novel which often offered idealized visions of womens lives and romances see p 336.
there was also a vigorous culture of public leisure even if many families had to struggle to find time or means to participate in it.
in larger cities theaters were becoming increasingly popular and while some of them catered to particular minstrel social groups others attracted audiences shows crossed class lines.
wealthy people middle class people workers and their families all could sometimes be found watching a performance of shakespeare or a melodrama based on a popular novel or an american myth.
minstrel shows in which white actors mimicked and ridiculed african american culture became increasingly popular see p 420.
public sporting events boxing horse racing cockfighting already becoming controversial and others often attracted considerable crowds.
baseball not yet organized into professional leagues was beginning to attract large crowds when played in city parks or fields on the edges of towns see p 384.
a particularly exciting event in many communities was the arrival of the circus a traveling entertainment with roots in the middle ages that continued to entertain delight and bamboozle chil dren and adults alike.
popular tastes in public spectacle tended toward the bizarre and the fantastic.
most men and women lived in a constricted world of familiar things.
relatively few people traveled and in the absence of film radio television or even much photography they hungered for visions of unusual phenomena that contrasted with their normal experiences.
people going to the theater or the circus or the museum wanted to see things that amazed and even frightened them.
perhaps the most celebrated provider of such experiences p t barnum was t ie famous ard unscrupulous showman p t barnum who opened the american museum in new york city in 1842 not a showcase for art or nature but a great freak show populated by midgets the most famous named tom thumb siamese twins magicians and ventriloquists.
barnum was a genius in publicizing his ventures with garish posters and elaborate newspaper announcements.
only later in the 1870s did he launch the famous circus for which he is still best remembered.
but he was always a pioneer in exploiting public tastes for the wild and exotic.
one of the ways barnum tried to draw visitors to his museum was by engaging lecturers.
he did so because he understood that the lecture was one of the most popular forms of entertainment in nineteenth century america.
men and women flocked in enormous numbers to lyceums churches schools and auditoriums to hear lecturers explain the latest advances in science to describe their visits to exotic places to provide vivid historical narratives or to rail against the evils of alcohol or slavery.
messages of social uplift and reform attracted rapt audiences particularly among women eager for guidance as they adjusted to the often jarring changes in the character of family life in the industrializing world.

corbis the agricultural north even in the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing northeast and more so in what nineteenth century americans called the northwest and what americans today call the midwest most people remained tied to the agricultural world.
but agriculture rise of in ustry an commerce was becoming commercial increasingly a part of the new capitalist agriculture economy linked to the national and inter national market.
where agriculture could not compete in this new commercial world it declined.
where k could compete it simultaneously flourished and changed.
truck farming in the northeast northeastern agriculture the story of agriculture in the northeast after 1840 is one of decline and transformation.
the reason for the decline was simple the farmers of the section could no longer compete with the new and richer soil of the northwest.
centers of production were gradually shifting westward for many of the farm goods that had in the past been most important to northeastern agriculture wheat corn grapes cattle sheep and hogs.
some eastern farmers responded to these changes by moving west themselves and establishing new farms.
still others moved to mill towns and became laborers.
some farmers however remained on the land and managed to hold their own.
as the eastern urban centers increased in population many farmers turned to the task of supplying food to nearby cities they raised vegetables truck farming or fruit and sold it in local towns.
new york for example led all other states in apple production.
the rise of cities also stimulated the rise of profitable dairy farming.
approximately half the dairy products of the country were produced in the east most of the rest came from the west where ohio was the leading dairy state.
partly because of the expansion of the dairy industry the northeast led other sections in the production of hay.
new york was the leading hay state in the nation pennsylvania and new england grew large crops as well.
the northeast also exceeded other areas in producing potatoes.
but while agriculture in the region remained an important part of the economy it was steadily becoming less important than the industrial growth of the northeast itself.
as a result the rural population in many parts of the northeast continued to decline.
the old northwest there was some industry in the states of the northwest more than in the south and in the two decades before the civil war the region experienced steady industrial growth.
by 1860 it had 36 785 manufacturing establishments employing 209 909 workers.
there was a flourishing industrial and commercial area along the shore of lake erie with cleveland at its center.
another manufacturing region was in the ohio river valley the meatpacking city of cincinnati was its nucleus.
farther west the rising city of chicago destined to become the great metropolis of the region was emerging as the national center of the agricultural machinery and meatpacking industries.
most of the major industrial activities of the west either served agriculture as in the case of farm machinery or relied on agricultural products as in flour milling meatpacking whiskey distilling and the making of leather goods.
as this su88ests industry was much less important in the northwest than farming.
industrialization in the old northwest americas economic revolution 289 some areas of the northwest were not yet dominated by whites.
indians remained the most numerous inhabitants of much of the upper third of the great lakes states until after the civil war.
in those areas hunting and fishing along with some sedentary agriculture remained the principal economic activities of both whites and native americans.
but the tribes did not become integrated into the new commercialized econ omy that was emerging elsewhere in the northwest.
for the white and occasionally black settlers who populated the lands farther south the northwest was primarily an agricultural region.
its rich and plentiful lands made farming a lucrative and expanding activity there in contrast to the declining agrarian northeast.
thus the typical citizen of the northwest was not an industrial worker or poor marginal farmer but the owner of a reasonably prosperous family farm.
the average size of western farms was 200 acres the majority owned by the people who worked them.
rising farm prices around the world provided a strong incentive for these western farmers to engage in commercial agriculture.
that usually meant concentrating on a single crop for market corn wheat cattle sheep hogs and others.
in the early years of white settlement in the northwest farm prices rose because of the debilitation of european agriculture in the.
aftermath of the napoleonic wars and the specialization growing urban population and hence the growing demand for food of industrializing areas of europe.
the northwest with good water routes on the mississippi for getting its crops to oceangoing vessels prof ited from this international trade.
but industrialization in both the united states and europe provided the greatest boost to agriculture.
with the growth of factories and cities in the northeast the domestic market for farm goods increased dramatically.
the growing national and worldwide demand for farm products resulted in steadily rising farm prices.
for most farmers the 1840s and early 1850s were years of increasing prosperity.
to meet the increasing demand for its farm products residents of the northwest worked strenuously and often frantically to increase their productive capacities.
many tried to take advantage of the large areas of still uncultivated land and to enlarge the area of white settlement during the 1840s.
by 1850 the growing western population was moving into the prairie regions both east and west of the mississippi into areas of indiana michigan illinois missouri iowa and minnesota.
residents cleared forest lands or made use of fields the indians had cleared many years earlier.
and they began to develop a timber industry to make use of the forests that remained.
wheat was the staple crop of the region but other crops corn potatoes and oats and livestock were also important.
the northwest increased production not only by expanding the area of settlement but also by adopting new agricultural technologies that greatly reduced the labor necessary for pro ducing a crop and slowed the exhaustion of new the regions rich soil.
farmers began to cul agricultural tivate new varieties of seed notably technologies mediterranean wheat which was hardier cyrus mccormicks automatic reaper cyrus mccormick invented an automatic reaper in 1831 and had it patented in 1834.
the machine drawn by a horse cut wheat corn or other crops and left it lying in swaths in the field where farmworkers would gather it up and store it in stacks.
the reaper allowed one worker to harvest as much wheat in a day as five could harvest using earlier methods.
hulton archive getty images mccormick reaper than the native type and they imported better breeds of animals such as hogs and sheep from england and spain to take the place of native stock.
most important were improved tools and farm machines which american inventors and manufacturers produced in rapidly increasing numbers.
during the 1840s more efficient grain drills harrows mowers and hay rakes came into wide use.
the cast iron plow an earlier innovation remained popular because its parts could be replaced when broken.
an even better tool appeared in 1847 when john deere established at moline illinois a factory to manufacture steel plows which were more durable than those made of iron.
two new machines heralded a coming revolution in grain production.
the most important was the automatic reaper the invention of cyrus h mccormick of virginia.
the reaper enabled one worker to harvest as much wheat or any other small grain in a day as five could harvest using older methods.
mccormick who had patented his device in 1834 established a factory at chicago in the heart of the grain belt in 1847.
by 1860 more than 100 000 reapers were in use on western farms.
almost as important to the grain grower was the thresher a machine that separated the grain from the wheat stalks.
threshers appeared in large numbers after 1840.
before that farmers generally flailed grain by hand seven bushels a day was a good average for a farm or used farm animals to tread it twenty bushels a day on the average.
a threshing machine such as those manufactured by the jerome i.
case factory in racine wisconsin could thresh twenty five bushels or more in an hour.
the northwest considered itself the most democratic section of the country.
but its democracy was based on a defense of economic freedom and the rights of property a white middle class vision of democracy that was becoming common 290 chapter 10 in many other parts of the country as well.
abraham lincoln an illinois whig voiced the economic opinions of many of the people of his section.
i take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can said lincoln.
some will get wealthy.
i dont believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich it would do more harm than good.
when one starts poor as most do in the race of life free society is such that he knows he can better his condition he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor for his whole life rural life life for farming people was very different from life in towns and cities.
it also varied greatly from one farming region to another.
in the more densely populated farm areas east of the appalachians and in the easternmost areas of the northwest farmers were usually part of vibrant communities and made extensive use of the institutions of those communities the churches schools stores and taverns.
as white settlement moved farther west farmers became isolated and had to struggle to find any occasions for contact with people outside their own families.
religion drew farm communities together perhaps more than any other force particularly since so many farm areas were populated by people of common ethnic and therefore religious backgrounds.
town or village churches were popular meeting places for both services and social events most of them dominated by women.
even in areas with no organized churches farm families and importance of religion in rural communities again women in particular gathered in one anothers homes for prayer meetings bible readings and other religious activities.
weddings baptisms and funerals also brought communities together in celebration or mourning.
but religion was only one of many reasons for interaction.
farm people joined together frequently to share tasks that a single family would have difficulty performing on its own festive barn raisings were among the most frequent.
women prepared large suppers while the men worked on the barn and the children played.
large numbers of families also gathered together at harvest time to help bring in crops husk corn or thresh wheat.
women came together to share domestic tasks as well holding bees in which groups of women joined together to make quilts baked goods preserves and other products.
but despite the many social gatherings farm families managed to create they lived in a world with much less contact with popular culture and public social life than people who lived in towns and cities.
rural people often even more than urban ones treasured their links to the outside world letters from relatives and friends in distant places newspapers and magazines from cities they had never seen catalogs advertising merchandise that their local stores never had.
yet many also valued their separation from urban culture and cherished the relative autonomy that farm life gave them.
one reason many rural americans looked back nostalgically on country life once they moved to the city was that they sensed that in the urban world they did not have as much control over the patterns of their daily lives as they had once known.
looking back between the 1820s and the 1850s the american economy experienced the beginnings of an industrial revolution a change so profound that in the united states as in europe it transformed almost every area of life in fundamental ways.
the american industrial revolution was a result of many things population growth through both natural increase and immigration advances in transportation and communication new technologies that spurred the development of factories capable of mass producing goods the recruiting of a large industrial labor force and the creation of corporate bodies capable of managing large enterprises.
the new economy created great wealth expanding the ranks of the wealthy and helping to create a large new middle class.
it also created high levels of inequality which were particularly visible in the growth of a large industrial working class.
culture in the industrializing areas of the north changed too and there were important changes in the structure and behavior of the family in the role of women and in the way people used their leisure time and encountered popular culture.
the changes were often alluring often disorienting and often both.
they helped widen the gap in experience and understanding between the generation of the revolution and the generation of the mid nineteenth century.
they also helped widen the gap between north and south.

how did slavery shape the southern economy and society and how did it make the south different from the north.
what was the myth and what was the reality of white society in the south.
why was the myth so pervasive and widely believed.
how did slaves resist their enslavement.
how successful were their efforts.
what was the response of whites.
setting the stage the south like the north experienced dramatic growth in the middle years of the nineteenth century.
southerners fanned out into the territories of the southwest and established new communities new states and new markets.
the southern agricultural economy grew increasingly productive and prosperous.
trade in such staples as sugar rice tobacco and above all cotton made the south a major force in international commerce and created substantial wealth within the region.
it also tied the south securely emerging capitalist world of the united states and its european trading partners.
yet despite its expansion and growth the south experienced a much less fundamental transformation in these years than did the north.
the south had begun the nineteenth century a primarily agricultural region it remained overwhelmingly agrarian in 1860.
it had begun the century with few important cities and little industry so it remained sixty years later.
in 1800 a plantation system dependent on slave labor had dominated the southern economy by 1860 that system had only strengthened its grip on the region.
as the south grew and expanded it became increasingly unlike the north and increasingly sensitive to what it considered threats to its distinctive way of life.
one historian has written the south grew but it did not develop.
the cotton economy the most important economic development in the mid nineteenth century south was the shift of economic power from the upper south the original southern states along the atlantic coast to the lower south the expanding agricultural regions in the new states of the southwest.
that shift reflected above all the growing dominance of cotton in the southern economy.
the rise of king cotton decline of the tobacco economy much of the upper south continued in the nineteenth century to rely as it always had on the cultivation of tobacco.
but the market for that crop was notoriously unstable.
tobacco prices were subject to frequent depressions including a prolonged one that began in the 1820s and extended into the 1850s.
tobacco also rapidly exhausted the land on which it grew it was difficult for most growers to remain in business in the same place for very long.
by the 1830s therefore many farmers in the old tobacco growing regions of virginia maryland and north carolina were shifting to other crops notably wheat while the center of tobacco cultivation was moving westward into the piedmont area.
the southern regions of the coastal south south carolina georgia and parts of florida continued to rely on the cultivation of rice a more stable and lucrative crop than tobacco.
rice however demanded substantial irrigation and needed an exceptionally long growing season nine months so cultivation of that staple remained restricted to a relatively small area.
sugar growers along the gulf coast similarly enjoyed a reasonably profitable market for their crop.
but sugar cultivation required intensive and debilitating labor and a long growing time.
only relatively wealthy planters could afford to engage in it and they faced major competition from the great sugar plantations of the caribbean.
sugar cultivation therefore did not spread much beyond a small area in southern louisiana and eastern texas.
long staple sea island cotton was another lucrative crop but like rice and sugar it could grow only in a limited area the coastal regions of the southeast.
the decline of the tobacco economy in the upper south and the limits of the sugar rice and long staple cotton economies farther south might have forced the region to shift its attention in short staple the nineteenth century to other nonagricultural pursuits had it not been for cotton the rowing importance of a new product that soon overshadowed all else short staple cotton.
this was a hardier and coarser strain of cotton that could grow successfully in a variety of climates and in a variety of soils.
it was harder to process than the long staple variety its seeds were more difficult to remove from the fiber.
but the 1793 invention of the cotton gin see p 189 had largely solved that problem.
cotton slavery and the old south 295 the new orleans cotton exchange edgar degas the french impressionist painted this scene of cotton traders examining samples in the new orleans cotton exchange in 1873.
by this time the cotton trade was producing less impressive profits than those that had made it the driving force of the booming southern economy of the 1850s.
degas s mother came from a creole family of cotton brokers in new orleans and two of the artist s brothers depicted here reading a newspaper and leaning against a window joined the business in america.
musee des beaux arts pau france giraudon the bridgeman art library demand for cotton was growing rapidly.
the growth of the textile industry in britain in the 1820s and 1830s and in new england in the 1840s and 1850s created an enormous new demand for the crop.
as a result ambitious men and women rapidly moved into previously uncultivated lands many of them newly open to planter settlement after the relocation of the tribes in the 1820s and 1830s to establish new cottongrowing regions.
beginning in the 1820s therefore cotton production spread rapidly.
from the western areas of south carolina and georgia production moved steadily westward first into alabama and mississippi then into northern louisiana texas and arkansas.
by the 1850s cotton had become the linchpin of the southern economy.
in 1820 the south had produced about 500 000 bales of cotton.
by 1850 it was producing nearly 3 million bales a year and by 1860 nearly 5 million.
there were periodic fluctuations in cotton prices resulting generally from overproduction periods of boom frequently gave way to abrupt busts.
but the cotton economy continued to grow even if in fits and starts.
by the time of the civil war cotton constituted nearly two thirds of the total export trade of the united states and was bringing in nearly 200 million a year.
the annual value of the rice crop in contrast was 2 million.
it was little wonder that southern politicians now proclaimed cotton is king cotton production dominated the more recently settled areas of what came to be known as the lower south or in a later era spread of cotton production the deep south.
many people began to call this region the cotton kingdom settlement of the area resembled in some ways the rush of gold seekers to a new strike.
the prospect of tremendous profits from growing cotton drew white settlers to the lower south by the thousands.
some were wealthy planters from the older states who transferred their assets and slaves to a cotton plantation.
most were small slaveholders or slaveless farmers who hoped to move into the planter class.
a similar shift if an involuntary one occurred in the slave population.
between 1820 and 1860 the number of slaves in expansion of alabama leaped from 41 000 to 435 000 slavery and in mississippi from 32 000 to 436 000.
in the same period the increase in virginia was only from 425 000 to 490 000.
between 1840 and 1860 according to some estimates 410 000 slaves moved from the upper south to the cotton states either accompanying masters who were themselves migrating to the southwest or more often sold to planters already there.
indeed the sale of slaves to the southwest became an important economic activity in the upper south and helped the troubled planters of that region compensate for the declining value of their crops.
weak manufacturing sector southern trade and industry in the face of this booming agricultural expansion other forms of economic activity developed slowly in the south.
the business classes of the region the manufacturers and merchants were not unimportant.
there was growing activity in flour milling and in textile and iron manufacturing particularly in the upper south.
the tredegar iron works in richmond for example compared favorably with the best iron mills in the northeast.
but industry remained an insignificant force in comparison with the agricultural economy.
the total value of southern textile manufactures in 1860 was 4 5 million a threefold increase over the value of those goods twenty years.
68 chapter 3 in the 1670s the flow began to decline substantially.
a decrease in the english birth rate and an increase in english prosperity reduced the pressures on many men and women who might otherwise have considered emigrating.
after 1700 those who did travel to america as indentured servants generally avoided the southern colonies where working conditions were arduous and prospects for advancement were slim and took advantage of the better opportunities in the mid atlantic colonies especially pennsylvania and new york.
in the chesapeake landowners themselves began to find the indenture system less attractive in part because they were troubled by the instability that former servants created or threatened to create.
that was one reason for the increasing centrality of african slavery in the southern agricultural economy.
birth and death at first new arrivals in most colonies whatever their background or status could anticipate great hardship inadequate food frequent epidemics and in an appalling number of cases early death.
gradually however conditions improved enough to allow the non indian population to begin to expand.
by the end of the seventeenth century the non indian population in the english colonies of north america had grown to over a quarter of a million of whom about 25 percent were africans.

but unlike in the seventeenth century the most important reason for this expansion was natural increase children born in america replacing immigration from europe.

indentures were the most common form of labor in most of the colonies during much of the seventeenth century but by 1749 the system was already beginning to die out replaced in the south by the enslavement of africans.
charleston library society charleston sc altnougu immigration remained for a time the greatest source of population increase marked improvement in the re production rate began in new england and the mid atlantic colonies in the second half of the seventeenth century.
after the 1650s natural increase became the most important source of population.
the new england population more than quadru pled through reproduction alone in the second half of the sev exceptional enteenth century.
this was less a result ol unusual fertility families in new englanc and in other regions were probably equalb fertile than of exceptional longevity indeed the average life spans of residents of some areas of nev england were nearly equal to those of people in the twentietl century.
in the first generation of american born colonists ac cording to one study men who survived infancy lived to ai average age of seventy one women to seventy.
the next gener ations life expectancy declined somewhat to sixty five fo men who survived infancy but remained at least ten year higher than the english equivalent and approximately twenv years higher than life expectancy in the south.
scholars dis longevity in new england agree on the reasons for these remarkable life spans but contributing factors probably included the cool climate and the relatively disease free environment it produced clean water a stark contrast to england in these years and the absence of arge population centers that might breed epidemics.
conditions improved much more slowly in the south.
the mortality rates for whites in the chesapeake region remained markedly higher than those elsewhere until the mid eighteenth century and the mortality rates for africans higher still.
throughout the seventeenth century the average life expectancy for white men in the region was just over forty years and for white women slightly less.
one in four children died in infancy and fully half died before the age of twenty.
the high death rate among adults meant that only about a third of all marriages lasted more than ten years thus those children who survived infancy often lost one or both of their parents before reaching maturity.
widows widowers and orphans formed a substantial proportion of the white population of the chesapeake.
the continuing ravages of disease particularly malaria and the prevalence of salt contaminated water kept the death rate high in the south only after the settlers developed immunity to the local diseases a slow process known as seasoning did life expectancy increase significantly.
population growth was substantial in the region but largely as a result of immigration.
natural increases in the population wherever they occurred were largely a result of a steady improvement in the sex ratio through the seventeenth century.
in the early years of settlement more than three quarters of the white population of the chesapeake consisted of men.
and even in new england which from the beginning had attracted more fami more balanced lies t us more women than the sex ratio southern colonies 60 percent of the white inhabitants in 1650 were male.
gradually however more women began to arrive in the colonies and increasing birth rates which of course produced roughly equal numbers of males and females contributed to shifting the sex ratio as well.
not until well into the eighteenth century did the ratio begin to match that in england where women were a slight majority but by the late seventeenth century the proportion of males to females in all the colonies was becoming more balanced.
medicine in the colonies the very high death rates of women who bore children illustrate the primitive nature of medical knowledge and practice in the colonies.
seventeenth and eighteenth century physicians had little or no understanding of infection and sterilization.
as a result many people died from infections contracted during childbirth or surgery from dirty instruments or dirty hands.
because communities were unaware of bacteria many were plagued with infectious diseases transmitted by garbage or unclean water.
one result of the limited extent of medical knowledge was that it was relatively easy for people to enter the medical field even without professional training.
the biggest beneficiaries of m this ease of access were women who estab midwives themselves in considerable numbers as midwives.
midwives assisted women in childbirth but they also dispensed other medical advice usually urging their society and culture in provincial america 69 patients to use herbs or other natural remedies.
midwives were popular because they were usually friends and neighbors of the people they treated unlike physicians who were few and therefore not often well known to their patients.
male doctors felt threatened by the midwives and struggled continually to drive them from the field although they did not make substantial progress in doing so until the nineteenth century.
midwives and doctors alike practiced medicine on the basis of the prevailing assumptions of their time most of them derived from the theory of humoralism popularized by the second century roman physician galen.
galen argued that the human body was governed by four humors that were lodged in four bodily fluids yellow bile or choler black bile melancholy blood and phlegm.
in a healthy body the four humors existed in balance.
illness represented an imbalance and suggested the need for removing from the body the excesses of whatever fluid was causing the imbalance.
that was the rationale that lay behind the principal medical techniques of the seventeenth century purging expulsion and bleeding.
bleeding was the most extreme of the treatments and the most destructive and it was practiced mostly by male physicians.
midwives preferred more homeopathic treatments and favored pukes and laxatives.
the great majority of early americans however had little contact with physicians or even midwives and sought instead to deal with illness on their own confident that their abilities were equal to those of educated physicians which given the state of medical knowledge was often true.
that seventeenth century medicine rested so much on ideas produced 1 400 years before is evidence of how little support there was for the scientific method which rests on experimentation and observation rather than on inherited faiths in england and america at the time.
bleeding for example had been in use for hundreds of years during which time there had been no evidence that it helped people recover from illness indeed if anyone had chosen to look for it there was considerable evidence that bleeding could do great harm.
but what would seem in later eras to be the simple process of testing scientific assumptions was not yet a common part of western thought.
only with the birth of the enlightenment in the late seventeenth century with its faith in human reason and its belief in the capacity of individuals and societies to create better lives would the scientific method begin to find acceptance.
women and families in the chesapeake the importance of reproduction in the labor scarce society of seventeenth century america had particularly significant effects on women.
the high sex ratio meant that few women remained unmarried for long.
the average european woman in america male authority married for the first time at twenty or undermined twenty one years of age considerably earlier than in england in some areas of the chesapeake the average bride was three to four years younger.
in the chesapeake the most important factor affecting women 70 chapter 3 and families remained until at least the mid eighteenth century the extraordinarily high mortality rate.
under those circumstances the traditional male centered family structure of england by which husbands and fathers exercised firm even dictatorial control over the lives of their wives and children was difficult to maintain.
because so few families remained intact for long rigid patterns of male authority were constantly undermined.
standards of sexual behavior were also more flexible in the south than they were in england or other parts of america.
because of the large numbers of indentured servants who were forbidden to marry until their terms of service expired premarital sexual relationships were frequent.
female servants who became pregnant before the expiration of their terms could expect harsh treatment heavy fines whippings if no one could pay the fines an extra year or two of service added to their contract and the loss of their children after weaning.
bastard children were themselves bound out as indentures at a very early age.
on the other hand a pregnant woman whose term of service expired before the birth of her child or whose partner was able to buy her remaining time from her master might expect to marry quickly.
over a third of chesapeake marriages occurred with the bride already pregnant.
women in the chesapeake could anticipate a life consumed with childbearing.
the average wife became pregnant every two years.
those who lived long enough bore an average of eight children apiece up to five of whom typically died in infancy or early childhood.
since childbirth was one of the most frequent causes of female death relatively few women survived to see all their children grow to maturity.
for all the hardships women encountered in the seventeenth century south they also enjoyed more power and greater independence in the south a greater level of freedom than women in other parts of america or than southern women in later years.
because men were plentiful and women scarce females had considerable latitude in choosing husbands.
they also often had no fathers or other male relatives nearby trying to control their choices.
because women generally married at a much younger age than men they often outlived their husbands even though female life expectancy was somewhat shorter than male.
widows were often left with several children and with responsibility for managing a farm or plantation a circumstance of enormous hardship but one that also gave them significant economic power.
widows seldom remained unmarried for long however.
those who had no grown sons to work the tobacco farms and plantations had particular need for male assistance and marriage was the surest way to secure it.
since many widows married men who were themselves widowers complex combinations of households were frequent.
with numerous stepchildren half brothers and half sisters living together in a single household women often had to play the role of peacemaker a role that may have further enhanced their authority within the family.
by the early eighteenth century the character of the chesapeake population was beginning to change and with it the nature of the typical family.
life expectancy was increasing indentured servitude was in decline and natural repro duction was becoming the principal source revival of r h h patriarchy w ite population increase.
the sex ratio was becoming more equal.
one result of these changes was that life for white people in the region became less perilous and less arduous.
another result was that guide to the seasons among their many purposes almanacs sought to help farmers predict weather and plan for the demands of changing seasons.
this illustration part of a calendar of farming images shows a man and a woman tending fields in july in preparation for the coming harvest.
american antiquarian society society and culture in provincial america 71 women lost some of the power that their small numbers had once given them.
as families grew more stable traditional patterns of male authority revived.
by the mid eighteenth century southern families were becoming highly patriarchal that is dominated by the male head of the family.
women and families in new england in new england where many more immigrants arrived with family members and where death rates declined quickly family structure was much more stable than it was in the chesapeake and hence much more traditional.
because the sex ratio was reasonably balanced most men could expect to marry.
women however remained in the minority and as in the chesapeake they married young began producing children early and continued to do so well into their thirties.
in contrast to the south however northern children were more likely to survive the average family raised six to eight children to maturity and families were more likely to remain intact.
fewer new england women became widows and those who did generally lost their husbands later in life.
hence women were less often cast in roles independent of their husbands.
young women moreover had less control over the conditions of marriage both because there were fewer unmarried men vying for them and because their fathers were more often alive and able to exercise control over their choice of husbands.
among other things increased longevity meant that unlike in the chesapeake where three fourths of all children lost at least one parent before the age of twenty one white parents in new england usually lived to see their children and even their grandchildren grow to maturity.
still the lives of most new england women were nearly as consumed by childbearing and child rearing as those of women in the chesapeake.
even women who lived into their sixties spent the majority of their mature years with young chil dren in the home.
the longer lives in new england also meant that parents continued to control their children far longer than did parents in the south.
although they were less likely than parents in england to arrange marriages for their children few sons and daughters could choose spouses entirely independent of their parents wishes.
men usually depended on their fathers for land generally a prerequisite for beginning families of their own.
women needed dowries from their parents if they were to attract desirable husbands.
stricter parental supervision of children meant too that fewer women became pregnant before marriage than in the south although even in puritan new england the premarital pregnancy rate was not insubstantial as high as 20 percent in some communities.
puritanism placed a high value on the family which was the principal economic and religious unit within every com munity.
at the same time however p p v purinism enforced the dea o need absolute male authority and the assumption of female weakness and inferiority.
women were life spans expected to be modest and submissive.
such popular girls names as prudence patience chastity and comfort suggest something about puritan expectations of female behavior.
a wife was expected to devote herself to serving the needs of her husband and household.
the beginnings of slavery in british america almost from the beginning of european settlement in north america there was a demand for african workers to supplement the always scarce southern labor supply.
the demand grew rapidly once tobacco cultivation became a staple of the chesapeake economy.
but the supply of african laborers was limited during much of the seventeenth century because the atlantic slave trade did not at first serve the english colonies in america.
portuguese slavers who had dominated the trade since the sixteenth century shipped captive men and women from the west coast of africa to the new european colonies in south america and the caribbean.
gradually dutch and french navigators joined the slave trade.
but a substantial commerce in slaves grew up within the americas particularly between the caribbean islands and the southern colonies of british america.
by the late seventeenth century the supply of african workers in north america was becoming plentiful.
as the commerce in slaves grew more extensive and sophisticated it also grew more horrible.
before it ended in the nineteenth century it was responsible for the forced immigration of as many as 11 million africans to the new world.
until the late eighteenth century the number of african immigrants to the middle americas was higher than that of passage europeans.
native african chieftains captured members of enemy tribes in battle tied them together in long lines or coffles and sold them in the flourishing slave marts on the african coast.
then after some haggling on the docks between the european traders and the african suppliers the terrified victims were packed into the dark filthy holds of ships for the horrors of the mid dle passage the journey to america.
for weeks sometimes even months the african prisoners remained chained in the bowels of the slave ships.
conditions varied from one ship to another.
some captains took care to see that their potentially valuable cargo remained reasonably healthy.
others accepted the deaths of numerous africans as inevitable and tried to cram as many as possible into their ships to ensure that enough would survive to yield a profit at journeys end.
on such ships the african prisoners were sometimes packed together in such close quarters that they were unable to stand hardly able to breathe.
some ships supplied them with only minimal food and water.
women were often victims of rape and other sexual abuse.
those who died en route were simply thrown overboard.
upon arrival in the new world slaves were auctioned off to white landowners and transported frightened and bewildered to their new homes.
debating the past the origins of slavery m t t c debate among historians over how and why white americans created a system of slave x h u labor in the seventeenth century and how and why they determined that people of african descent and no others should populate that system has been a long and unusually heated one.
at its center is the question of whether slavery was a result of white racism or whether slavery created racism.
in 1950 oscar and mary handlin published an influential article origins of the southern labor system comparing slavery to other systems of unfreedom in the colonies.
what differentiated slavery from other conditions of servitude they argued was that it was restricted to people of african descent it was permanent and it passed from one generation to the next.
the unique characteristics of slavery the handlins maintained were part of an effort by colonial legislatures to increase the available labor force.
white laborers needed an incentive to come to america black laborers forcibly imported from africa did not.
the distinction between the conditions of white workers and the conditions of black workers was therefore based on legal and economic motives not on racism.
racism emerged to justify slavery it did not cause slavery.
winthrop d jordan was one of a number of historians who later challenged the handlins thesis and argued that white racism more than economic interests produced african slavery.
in white over black 1968 and other works jordan argued that europeans had long viewed people of color and black africans in particular as inferior beings appropriate for serving whites.
those attitudes migrated with white europeans to the new world and white racism shaped the treatment of africans in america and the nature of the slave labor system from the beginning.
george fredrickson echoed jordan s emphasis on the importance of racism as an independent factor reinforcing slavery but unlike jordan he argued that racism did not precede slavery.
the treatment of blacks he wrote engendered a cultural and psycho social racism that after a certain point took on a life of its own racism although the child of slavery not only outlived its parent but grew stronger and more independent after slavery s demise.
in black majority 1974 a study of seventeenth century south carolina peter wood moved the debate away from racism and back toward social and economic conditions.
wood demonstrated that blacks and whites often worked together on relatively equal terms in the early years of settlement.
but as rice cultivation expanded finding white laborers willing to do the arduous work became more difficult.
the forcible importation of african workers and the creation of a system of permanent bondage was a response to a growing demand for labor and to fears among whites that without slavery a black labor force would be difficult to control.
edmund morgan argued similarly in american slavery american freedom 1975 that the southern labor system was at first relatively flexible and later grew more rigid.
in colonial virginia he claimed white settlers did not at first intend to create a system of permanent bondage.
but as the tobacco economy grew and created a high demand for cheap labor white landowners began to feel uneasy about their dependence on a large group of dependent white workers since such workers were difficult to recruit and control.
thus slavery was less a result of racism than of the desire of white landowners to find a reliable and stable labor force.
in the making of new world slavery 1996 robin blackburn argued that while race was a factor in allowing whites to justify to themselves the enslavement of africans the real reasons for slavery were hardheaded economic decisions by ambitious entrepreneurs who realized early on that a slave labor system in the labor intensive agricultural world of the american south and the caribbean was more profitable than a free labor system.
slavery served the interests of a powerful combination of groups planters merchants governments industrialists and consumers.
race may have been a rationale for slavery allowing planters and traders to justify to themselves the terrible human costs of the system.
but the most important reason for the system was not just racism but the pursuit of profit and the success of the system in producing it.
blackburn concluded that slavery was not an antiquated remnant of an older world but rather a recognizably modern labor system that however ugly served the needs of an emerging market economy.

what do historians say is the relationship between racism and slavery.
what are the economic arguments put forward by historians to explain the system of slave labor that developed in america.
do these arguments account fully for the development of slavery.
why was slavery more successful than other labor systems in meeting the labor needs of colonial americas market economy.
the first african laborers arrived in english north america before 1620 and as english seamen began to establish themselves in the slave trade the flow of africans to the colonies gradually increased.
but north america was always a much less important market for africans than were other parts of the new world especially the caribbean islands and brazil whose labor intensive sugar economies created an especially large demand for slaves.
less than 5 percent of the africans imported to the americas went directly to the english colonies on the mainland.
most blacks who ended up in what became the united states spent time first in the west indies.
not until the 1670s did traders start importing blacks directly from africa to north america.
even then however the flow remained small for a time mainly because a single group the royal african company of england maintained a monopoly on trade in the mainland colonies and managed as a result to keep prices high and supplies low.
v cunntig uuil m me nistory oi the african population in north america came in the mid 1690s when the roval african companys monopoly was finally broken.
with the trade now opened to english and colonial merchants on a competitive basis prices fell and the number of africans arriving in north america rapidly increased.
by the end of the seventeenth cen growing tury only about one in ten of the residents slave f the colonies were africans about 25 06b population in all.
but because africans were so heavily concentrated in a few southern colo nies they were already beginning to outnumber europeans in some areas.
the high ratio of men to women among african immigrants there were perhaps two males to one female in most areas retarded the natural increase of the black population.
but in the chesapeake at least more new slaves were being born by 1700 than were being imported from africa.
in south carolina by contrast the difficult conditions of rice cultivation and the high death rates of those who worked in the rice fields ensured that the black population would barely be able to sustain itself through natural increase until much later.
between 1700 and 1760 the number of africans in the colonies increased tenfold to about a quarter of a million.
a relatively small number 16 000 in 1763 lived in new england there were slightly more 29 000 in the middle colonies.
the vast majority however continued to live in the south.
by then the flow of free white laborers to that region had all but stopped and africans had become securely established as the basis of the southern workforce.
it was not entirely clear at first that the status of african laborers in america would be fundamentally different from that of white indentured servants.
in the rugged conditions of the seventeenth century south it was often difficult for europeans and africans to maintain strictly separate roles.
in uncertain status some areas south carolina for example where the number of african arrivals swelled more quickly than anywhere else whites and blacks lived and worked together for a time on terms of relative equality.
some blacks were treated much like white hired servants and some were freed after a fixed term of servitude.
a few africans themselves became land owners and some apparently owned slaves of their own.
by the early eighteenth century however a rigid distinction had become established between black and white.
see debating the past above.
masters were contractually obliged to free white servants after a fixed term of servitude.
there was no such necessity to free black workers and the assumption slowly spread that blacks would remain in service permanently.
another incentive for making the status of africans rigid was that the children of slaves provided white landowners with a self perpetuating labor force.
72 73 74 chapter 3 white assumptions about the inferiority of people of color contributed to the growing rigidity of the system.
such assumptions came naturally to the english settlers.
they had already defined themselves as a superior race in their relations with the native indian population and earlier in their relations with the irish.
the idea of subordinating a supposedly inferior race was therefore already established in the english imagination by the time substantial numbers of africans appeared in america.
in the early eighteenth century colonial assemblies began to pass slave codes limiting the rights of blacks in law and ensuring almost absolute authority to white masters.
one factor and slave codes one actor on y determined whether a person was subject to the slave codes color.
in contrast to the colonial societies of spanish america where people of mixed race had a different and higher status than pure africans english america recognized no such distinctions.
any african ancestry was enough to classify a person as black.
changing sources of european immigration by the early eighteenth century the flow of immigrants from england itself began to decline substantiallya result of better economic conditions there and of new government restrictions on emigration in the face of massive depopulation in some regions of the country.
but as english immigration declined french german swiss irish welsh scottish and scandinavian immigration continued and increased.
the earliest although not the most numerous of these non english european immigrants were the french calvinists ar rican slave trade this image is from a plate from british author amelia opie s poem blnru c l opie s poem depicts the life of an african who was captured by slave traders and h f u p b k s ves hld fthe slave ship or how to m t were narked like remn fnr 4 i y e traders and chronicles his journey to the west indies nn i w sugar published in london packed hke cargo for the long ocean voyage.

soon after that huguenots and husuenots besan leaving the country.
about 300 000 left france in the following decades.
a small proportion of them traveled to the english colonies in north america.
many german protestants suffered similarly from the arbitrary religious policies of their rulers and all germans catholics as well as protestants suffered from the devastating wars with king louis xiv of france the sun king.
the rhineland of southwestern germany the area known as the palatinate experienced particular hardships.
because it was close to france its people were particularly exposed to slaughter and ruin at the hands of invaders.
the unusually cold winter of 1708 1709 dealt a final blow to the precarious economy of the region.
more than 12 000 palatinate germans sought refuge in england and approximately 3 000 of them soon found their way to america.
they arrived in new york and tried at first to make homes in the mohawk valley only to be ousted by the powerful landlords of the region.
some of the germans moved farther up the mohawk out of reach of the patroons but most made their way to pennsylvania where they received a warm welcome and where they ultimately became known to english settlers as the pennsylvania dutch a corruption of their own word for german deutsch.
the quaker colony became the most common destination for germans who came to america in growing numbers.
among them were moravians and mennonites with religious views similar in many ways to those of the quakers.
many german protestants went to north carolina as well especially after the founding of new bern in 1710 by a company of 600 german speaking swiss.
the most numerous of the newcomers were the scots irish scottish presbyterians who had settled in northern ireland in the province of ulster in the early seventeenth century.
the ulster colonists had prospered for a time despite the barren soil and the constant never wholly successful struggle to suppress the catholic natives.
but in the first years of the eighteenth century parliament prohibited ulster from exporting to england the woolens and other products that had become the basis of the northern irish economy at the same time the english government virtually outlawed the practice of the presbyterian religion the slave ship spookes the british slave ship brookes provided this plan of its stowage of slaves to conform to 1798 legislation from parliament.
it illustrates vividly the terrible conditions under which slaves were shipped from africa to the americas human beings squeezed into every available space like cargo for the long dangerous passage during which many africans died.

the growth of slavery was a result of both supply a readily available population of african workers in the caribbean islands and demand the growth of tobacco rice and cotton cultivation in larger areas of the south.
the slave population in the colonies also increased naturally in this period at a far greater rate than in the past largely because living conditions for african workers improved.
why did slaveowners invest in better conditions for their slaves.

after 1710 moreover the long term leases of many scots irish expired english landlords doubled and even tripled the rents.

often coldly received at the colonial ports many of the scots irish pushed out to the edges of european settlement.
there they occupied land without much regard for who actually claimed to own it whether absentee whites indians or the colonial governments.
they were as ruthless in their displacement and the pennsylvania dutch this folk art painted dish illustrates the traditional dress of the pennsylvania dutch.

immigrants from scotland and southern ireland added other elements to the colonial population in the eighteenth century.
scottish highlanders some of them roman catholics who had been defeated in rebellions in 1715 and 1745 immigrated into several colonies north carolina above all.
presbyterian lowlanders faced in scotland with high rents in the country and unemployment in the towns left for america in large numbers shortly before the american revolution joining earlier groups of scots who had arrived in the late seventeenth century.
they became a significant influence in new jersey and pennsylvania and helped establish presbyterianism as an important religion in those colonies.
the catholic irish migrated steadily over a long period and by the time of the revolution they were almost as numerous as the scots although less conspicuous.
many of them had by then abandoned their roman catholic religion and with it much of their ethnic identity.
continuing immigration and natural increase contributed to a rapid population growth in the colonies in the eighteenth century.
in 1700 the non indian population of the colonies totaled less than 250 000 by 1775 it was over 2 million a nearly tenfold increase.
throughout the colonial period the non indian population nearly doubled every twenty five years.
the colonial economies to those who remained in europe and even to some who settled in north america the english colonies often appeared so small and isolated as to seem virtually at the end of the world.
but from the beginning almost all the english colonies were commercial ventures and were tied in crucial ways to other economies.
they developed substantial trade with the native population of north america with the french settlers to the north and to a lesser extent with spanish colonists to the south and west.
and over time they developed an even more substantial trade within the growing atlantic economy of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries of which they became a critical part.
american colonists engaged in a wide range of economic pursuits.
but except for a few areas in the west where the small white society and culture in provincial america 77 populations subsisted largely on the fur and skin trade with the indians farming dominated all areas of european and african settlement throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
some farmers engaged in simple subsistence agriculture but whenever possible american farmers attempted to grow crops for the local intercolonial and export markets.
the southern economy in the chesapeake region tobacco quickly became the basis of the economy.
a strong european demand for the crop enabled tobacco sme planters to row enormously wealthy.
and at times allowed the region as a whole to prosper.
but production frequently exceeded demand and as a result the price of tobacco periodically suffered severe declines.
the first major bust in the tobacco economy occurred in 1640 and the boom and bust pattern continued throughout the colonial period and beyond.
growing more tobacco only made the problem of overproduction worse but chesapeake farmers never understood that.
those planters who could afford to do so expanded their landholdings enlarged their fields and acquired additional laborers.
after 1700 tobacco plantations employing several dozen slaves or more were common.
the staple of the economies of south carolina and georgia was rice.
by building dams and dikes along the many tidal rivers farmers managed to create rice paddies that could be flooded and then drained.
rice cultivation was arduous work performed standing knee deep in the mud of malarial swamps under a blazing sun surrounded by insects.
it was a task so difficult and unhealthful that white laborers generally refused to immigrant groups in colonial america 1760 even though the entire atlantic seaboard of what is now the united states had become a series of british colonies by 1760 the population consisted of people from many nations.
as this map reveals english settlers dominated most of the regions of north america.
but note the large areas of german settlement in the western chesapeake and pennsylvania the swath of dutch settlement in new york and new jersey the scots irish areas in the western regions of the south and the large areas in which africans were becoming the majority of the population even if subjugated by the white minority.
what aspects of the history of these colonies help explain their ethnic composition.
atlantic ocean sout carols wilmington g apeof charles town savannah immigrant groups english scots irish german dutch i african 200 400 km 78 chapter 3 perform it.
as a result planters in south carolina and georgia were even more dependent than those elsewhere on african slaves.
it was not only because africans could be compelled to perform difficult work that whites found them so valuable.
it was also because they were much better at it.
they showed from the beginning a greater resistance to malaria and other local diseases although the impact of disease on african workers was by no means inconsiderable.
and they proved more adept at the basic agricultural tasks required in part because some of them had come from rice producing regions of west africa.
in the early 1740s another staple crop contributed to the south carolina economy indigo.
eliza lucas a young antiguan woman who managed her family s north american plantations experimented with cultivating the west indian plant which was the source of a blue dye in great demand in europe on the mainland.
she discovered that it could grow on the high ground indigo out carolina which was unsuitable for rice planting and that its harvest came while the rice was still growing.
indigo became an important complement to rice and a popular import in england.
because of the souths early dependence on large scale cash crops the southern colonies developed less of a commercial or industrial economy than the colonies of the north.
the trading in tobacco and rice was handled largely by merchants based in london and later in the northern colonies.
few cities of more than modest size developed in the south.
northern economic and technological life more diverse economy in the north in the north agriculture was the single most important part of the economy.
but unlike in the south the northern colonies were less dominated by farming.
the northern economy was more diverse than the economy in the south in part because conditions for farming were less favorable there.
in northern new england in particular colder weather and hard rocky soil made it difficult for colonists to develop the kind of large scale commercial farming system that southerners were creating.
conditions for agriculture were better in southern new england and the middle colonies where the soil was fertile and the weather more temperate.
new york pennsylvania and the connecticut river valley were the chief suppliers of wheat to much of new england and to parts of the south.
even there however a substantial commercial economy emerged alongside the agricultural one.
r r k th sl 1 coliclilorooy i almost every colonist engaged in a certain amount of industry at home.
occasionally these home industries provided families with surplus goods they could trade or sell.
beyond these domestic efforts craftsmen and artisans established themselves in colonial towns as cobblers blacksmiths rifle makers cabinetmakers silversmiths and printers.
in some areas entrepreneurs harnessed water power to run small mills for grinding grain processing cloth or milling lumber.
and in several places large scale shipbuilding operations began to flourish.
the first effort to establish a significant metals industry in the colonies was an ironworks established in saugus massachusetts in the 1640s after iron ore deposits had been saugus discovered in the region.
iron technology ironworks was already advancing rapidly in england and the colonists attempted to transfer those skills to america.
the saugus works used water power to drive a bellows which controlled the heat in a charcoal furnace.
as the ore melted it trickled down into molds or was society and culture in provincial america 79 taken in the form of simple sow bars to a forge to be shaped into such marketable objects as plows hoes axes pots and other tools.
the saugus works was a technological success indeed it could boast technological capabilities equal to those of any ironworks in europe at the time.
but it was a financial failure.
it began operations in 1646 in 1668 its financial problems forced it to close its doors.
metalworks however gradually became an important part of the colonial economy.
the largest industrial enterprise anywhere in english north america was the ironworks of the german ironmaster peter hasenclever in northern new jersey.
founded in 1764 with british capital it employed several hundred laborers many of them imported from ironworks in germany.
there were other smaller ironmaking enterprises in every northern colony with particular concentrations in massachusetts new jersey and pennsylvania and there were ironworks as well in several southern colonies.
even so these and other growing industries did not become the basis for the kind of explosive industrial growth that great britain commerce in new england this late eighteenth century painting of the home wharves countinghouse and fleet of a prosperous new england.

pl 2001 53 80 chapter 3 experienced in the late eighteenth century in part because english parliamentary regulations such as the iron act of 1750 restricted metal processing in the colonies.
similar prohibitions limited the manufacture of woolens hats and other goods.
but the biggest obstacles to industrialization in america were an inadequate labor supply a small domestic market and inadequate transportation facilities and energy supplies.
more important than manufacturing were industries that exploited the natural resources of the continent.
by the mid seventeenth century the flourishing fur trade of earlier years was in decline.
taking its place were lumbering mining and fishing particularly in the waters off the new england coast.
these industries provided commodities that could be exported to england in exchange for manufactured goods.
and they helped produce the most distinctive feature of the northern economy a thriving commercial class.
extractive industries the extent and limits of technology despite the technological progress that was occurring in some parts of america in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries much of colonial society was conspicuously lacking in even very basic technologies.
up to half the farmers in the colonies were so primitively equipped that they did not even own a plow.
substantial numbers of households owned no pots or kettles for cooking.
and only about half the households in the colonies owned guns or rifles with rural people almost as unlikely to have firearms as urban people.
the relatively low levels of ownership of these and other elementary tools was not because such things were difficult to make but because most americans remained too poor or too isolated to be able to afford them.
many households had few if any candles because they were unable to afford candle molds or tallow wax or because they had no access to commercially produced candles.
in the early eighteenth century very few farmers owned wagons.
most made do with two wheeled carts which could be hauled by hand or by horse around the farm but which were not very efficient for transporting crops to market.
the most commonly owned tool on american farms was the axe which suggests how much time most farmers had to spend clearing land.
but throughout the colonies the ability of people to acquire manufactured implements lagged far behind the capacity to produce them.
even so few colonists were self sufficient in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
the popular image of early american households is of people who had little myth of self connection t0 the market who grew their sufficiency own food made their own clothes and bought little from anyone else.
in fact relatively few colonial families owned spinning wheels or looms which suggests that most people purchased whatever yarn and cloth they needed or could afford from merchants.
most farmers who grew grain took it to centralized facilities for processing.
shortage of currency the rise of colonial commerce perhaps the most remarkable feature of colonial commerce in the seventeenth century was that it was able to survive.
american merchants faced such bewildering and intimidating obstacles and lacked so many basic institutions of trade they managed to stay afloat only with great difficulty.
there was first no commonly accepted medium of exchange.
the colonies had almost no specie gold or silver coins.
they experimented at times with different forms of paper currency tobacco certificates for example which were secured by tobacco stored in warehouses or land certificates secured by property.
such paper was not however acceptable as payment for any goods from abroad and it was in any case ultimately outlawed by parliament.
for many years colonial merchants had to rely on a haphazard barter system or on crude money substitutes such as beaver skins.
a second obstacle was the near impossibility of imposing order on their trade.
in the fragmented jerry built commercial world of colonial america no merchants could be certain that the goods they sold would be produced in sufficient quantity nor could they be certain of finding adequate markets for them.
few channels of information existed to inform traders of what they could expect in foreign ports vessels sometimes stayed at sea for several years journeying from one market to another trading one commodity for another attempting to find some way to turn a profit.
engaged in this chaotic commerce moreover were an enormous number of small fiercely competitive companies which made the problem of stabilizing the system even more acute.
despite these and other problems commerce in the colonies not only survived but grew.
there was an elaborate coastal trade through which the colonies did business with one another and sold goods to the west indies among them rum agricultural products meat and fish.
the mainland colonies triangular bought sugar molasses and slaves from the trade caribbean markets in return.
there was also an expanding transatlantic trade which linked the north american colonies in an intricate network of commerce with england continental europe and the west coast of africa.
this commerce has often been described somewhat inaccurately as the triangular trade suggesting a neat process merchants carried rum and other goods from new england to africa exchanged their merchandise for slaves whom they then transported to the west indies hence the term middle passage for the dreaded journey it was the second of the three legs of the voyage and then exchanged the slaves for sugar and molasses which they shipped back to new england to be distilled into rum.
in fact the system was almost never so simple.
the triangular trade in rum slaves and sugar was in fact part of a maze of highly diverse trade routes between the northern and southern colonies america and england america and africa the west indies and europe and other combinations.
out of this complex and highly risky trade emerged a group of adventurous entrepreneurs who by the mid eighteenth society and culture in provincial america 81 the triangular trade this map illustrates the complex pattern of trade that fueled the colonial american economy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
a simple explanation of this trade is that the american colonies exported raw materials agricultural products furs and others to britain and europe and imported manufactured goods in return.
but while that explanation is accurate it is not complete largely because the atlantic trade was not a simple exchange between america and europe but rather a complex network of exchanges involving the caribbean africa and the mediterranean.
note the important exchanges between the north american mainland and the caribbean islands the important trade between the american colonies and africa and the wide range of european and mediterranean markets in which americans were active.
not shown on this map but also very important to colonial commerce was a large coastal trade among the various regions of british north america.
why did the major ports of trade emerge almost entirely in the northern colonies.
century were beginning to constitute a distinct merchant class.
concentrated in the port cities of the north above all boston new york and philadelphia they enjoyed protection p from foreign competition within the merchant english colonies the british navigation class acts had excluded all non british ships from the colonial carrying trade.
they had access to a market in england for such american products as furs timber and ships.
that did not however satisfy all their commercial needs.
many colonial products fish flour wheat and meat all of which england could produce for itself needed markets outside the british empire.
ignoring laws restricting colonial trade to england and its possessions many merchants developed markets in the french spanish and dutch west indies where prices were often higher than in the british colonies.
the profits from this illegal commerce enabled the colonies to import the manufactured goods they needed from europe.
the rise of consumerism among relatively affluent residents of the colonies the growing prosperity and commercialism of british america created both new appetites and new opportunities.
the result was a growing preoccupation with the consumption of material goods and of the association of possessions with social status.
82 chapter 3 tea party in the time of george i this painting by an unknown artist dates from the 1720s and shows a prosperous virginian posing with a fashionable and expensive tea service some of it from china.
his eagerness to display his possessions in this way is a sign of the growing interest in the badges of refinement among colonial americans of means in the eighteenth century.
the colonial williamsburg foundation the growth of eighteenth century consumerism was partly a result of the increasing division of american societies by class.
as the difference between the upper and lower classes became more glaring people of means became more intent on demonstrating their own membership in the upper ranks of society.
growing t0 purchase and display con consumerism sumer goods was an important way of doing so particularly for affluent people in cities and towns.
but the growth of consumerism was also a product of the early stages of the industrial revolution.
although there was relatively little industry in america in the eighteenth century england and europe were making rapid advances and producing more and more affordable goods for affluent americans to buy.
the new manufacturing was dependent of course on customers for its products.
in an increasingly commercial society therefore there were many people committed to promoting the purchase of consumer goods as a positive social good.
consumption also grew because of an increasing tendency among colonists to take on debt to finance purchases and be cause of the willingness of some merchants to offer credit.
to facilitate the new consumer appetites merchants and traders began advertising their goods in journals and newspapers.
agents of urban merchants the first traveling salesmen fanned out through the countryside attempting to interest wealthy landowners and planters in luxury goods.
george and martha washington for example spent considerable time and money ordering elegant furnishings for their home at mount vernon goods that were shipped to them mostly from england and europe.
things that had once been considered expensive luxuries gradually became commonplace necessities among them tea household linens glassware manufactured cutlery crockery and social furniture and many others.
another result of consumerism was the association of material goods of the quality of a persons home and possessions and clothing for ex ample with virtue and refinement the ideal of the cultivated gentleman and the gracious lady became increasingly powerful throughout the colonies in the eighteenth century.
that meant striving to become educated and refined gentlemanly or ladylike in speech and behavior.
americans read books on manners and fashion.
they bought magazines about london society.
they also commissioned portraits of themselves and their families devoted large portions of their homes to entertainment built shelves and cases in which they could display fashionable possessions constructed formal gardens and lavished attention on their wardrobes and hairstyles.
the growing importance of consumption and refinement was visible in public spaces as well.
eighteenth century cities in america as in england and europe began to plan their growth to ensure that there would be elegant and gracious public squares parks and boulevards.
in the past social in teraction in american communities had largely been between neighbors and relatives or at most among members of church congregations.
now that a wider society was emerging within cities it became important to create not just private but also public stages for social display.
patterns of society although there were sharp social distinctions in the colonies the deeply entrenched class system of england failed to re social produce itself in america.
in england land mobility was scarce and the population large.
the relatively small number of people who owned property had power over the great majority who did not the imbalance between land and population became a foundation of the english economy and the cornerstone of its class system.
in early america the opposite was true.
land was abundant and people were scarce.
aristocracies emerged in america to be sure.
but they tended to rely less on landown ership than on control of a substantial workforce and they society and culture in provincial america 83 were generally less secure and less powerful than their english counterparts.
far more than in england there were opportunities in america for social mobility both up and down.
the plantation the plantation defined a distinctive way of life for many white and black southerners that would survive in varying forms until the civil war.
the first plantations emerged in the early new georgia csavannah atlantic ocean percent of population that was black per county colony in 1775 bm 61 to 71 51 to 60 31 to 50 11 to 30 0 1 to 10 100 200 km african population as a proportion of total population c 1775 this map illustrates the parts of the colonies in which slaves made up a large proportion of the population in some areas a majority.
the densest african population was in tidewater virginia but there were black majorities as well in south carolina and parts of north carolina.
the slave population was smallest in the western regions of the southern colonies and in the area north of the chesapeake although there remained a significant african population in parts of new jersey and new york some slave some free.
what explains the dense concentrations of slaves in certain areas of the south.
vagaries of the plantation economy settlements of virginia and maryland once tobacco became the economic basis of the chesapeake.
some plantations were enormous much like some of the great estates of england.
the maryland plantation of charles carroll of carrollton reputedly the wealthiest man in the colonies covered 40 000 acres and contained 285 slaves.
on the whole however seventeenth century colonial plantations were rough and relatively small estates.
in the early days in virginia most plantations were crude clearings where land owners and indentured servants worked side by side in conditions so rugged that death was an everyday occurrence.
even in later years when the death rate declined and the landholdings became more established plantation workforces seldom exceeded thirty people.
the economy of the plantation like all agricultural economies was precarious.
in good years successful growers could earn great profits and expand their operations.
but since they could not control their markets even the largest planters were constantly at risk.
when prices for their crops fell as tobacco prices did for example in the 1660s they faced ruin.
because plantations were sometimes far from cities and towns which were relatively few in the south they tended to become self contained communities.
residents lived in close proximity to one another in a cluster of buildings that included the great house of the planter a house that was usually far from great the service buildings the barns and the cabins of the slaves.
wealthier planters often created something approaching a full town on their plantations with a school for white children only a chapel and a large population.
smaller planters lived more modestly but still in a relatively self sufficient world.
in some parts of the south for example the region around charleston south carolina planters often divided their time between the city and their nearby plantations.
on the larger plantations the presence of a substantial slave workforce altered not only the economic but also the family lives of the planter class.
the wives of plantation owners unlike the wives of small farmers could rely on servants to perform ordinary household chores.
they could thus devote more time to their husbands and children than people in poorer parts of colonial society.
but there were also frequent sexual liaisons between their husbands or sons and black women of the slave community.
southern white women generally learned to pretend not to notice these relationships but they were almost certainly a source of anxiety and resentment.
black women naturally had even greater cause to resent such liaisons.
southern society was highly stratified.
within given areas great landowners controlled not only the lives of those who worked on their own plantations.
wealthy planters also shaped the livelihoods of small farmers who could not effectively compete with the wealthy planters and thus depended on them to market crops and receive credit.
small farmers working modest plots of land with few or no slaves to help them formed the majority of the southern agrarian stratified southern society 84 chapter 3 mulberry plantation 1770 this painting of a rice plantation in south carolina is unusual in placing the slave quarters in the forefront of the picture.
the steep roofs of the slave cabins which were built by the slaves themselves reflected african architectural styles.

most landowners lived in rough cabins or houses with their servants or slaves nearby.
few landowners lived in anything resembling aristocratic splendor.
plantation slavery african slaves of course lived very differently than white planters.
on the smaller farms with only a handful of slaves there was not always a rigid social separation between whites and blacks.
but by the mid eighteenth century over three fourths of all blacks lived on plantations of at least ten slaves nearly half lived in communities of fifty slaves or more.
in these larger establishments africans developed a society and culture of their own influenced by their white masters to be sure but also partly independent of them.
although whites seldom encouraged formal marriages among slaves africans themselves developed an elaborate family structure.
this became possible beginning in the eighteenth century as a result of the increased life expectancy of slaves the gradual equalization of the sex ratio and the growth of the population through natural increase.
slaves attempted to construct nuclear families and they managed at times to build stable households even to work together growing their own food in gardens provided by their masters.
but such efforts were in constant jeopardy.
any family member could be sold at any time to another planter even to one in another colony.
as a result the black family developed in ways different from its white counterpart.
africans placed special emphasis on extended kinship networks even creating surrogate relatives for those who were separated from their own families.
they adapted themselves in short to difficult conditions over which they had limited control.
african workers also developed languages of their own.
in south carolina for example the early slaves communicated with one another in gullah a hybrid of english and slave culture african tongues which enabled them to engage in conversations their white masters could not understand.
there emerged too a distinctive slave religion which blended christianity with african folklore.
nevertheless slave society was heavily tied to white society.
african house servants for example at times lived in what was by the standards of slavery great luxury but they were also isolated from their own community and under constant surveillance from whites.
black women were often subjected to unwanted sexual advances from owners and overseers and hence to bearing mulatto children who were rarely recognized by their white fathers but generally accepted as members of the slave community.
on some society and culture in provincial america 85 plantations african workers received kindness and even affection from their masters and mistresses and displayed genuine devotion in return.
on others they encountered physical brutality and occasionally even sadism against which they were powerless.
there were occasional acts of individual resistance by slaves against harsh masters and at least twice during the colonial period there were actual slave rebellions.
in the most import stono ant such revolt the so called stono rebellion rebellion in south carolina in 1739 about 100 africans rose up seized weapons killed several whites and attempted to escape south to florida.
whites quickly crushed the uprising and executed most participants.
the most frequent form of resistance was simply running away but for most slaves that provided no real solu tion either.
there was nowhere to go.
most slaves male and female worked as field hands with women also shouldering the additional burdens of cooking and child rearing.
on the larger plantations that aspired to genuine self sufficiency some slaves learned trades and crafts blacksmithing carpentry shoemaking spinning weaving sewing midwifery and others.
these skilled craftsmen and craftswomen were at times hired out to other planters.
some set up their own establishments in towns or cities and shared their profits with their owners.
on occasion they were able to buy their freedom.
there was a small free black population living in southern cities by the time of the revolution.
the puritan community a very different form of community emerged in puritan new england but one that was also distinctively american.
the characteristic social unit in new england was not the isolated farm but the town.
each new settlement drew up a covenant among its members binding all residents in a religious and so cial commitment to unity and harmony.

new york city wealth distribution in colonial cities 1687 1771 although the gap between rich and poor in colonial america was not as large as it would become in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the rise of commerce in the early eighteenth century did produce increasing inequality.
this chart shows the distribution of wealth in three important commercial cities boston philadelphia and new york.
the upper pie charts show the distribution of wealth in the late seventeenth century and the lower charts show how that distribution had changed by the mid or late eighteenth century.
note the heavy concentration of wealth in the top 10 percent of the population in the seventeenth century and the even heavier concentration of wealth in boston and philadelphia in the eighteenth century.
in new york by contrast wealth distribution became slightly more equal between 1695 and 1730 because of the breaking up of the great dutch estates once the colony came under the control of the british.
in later years new york would show the same pattern of growing inequality that boston and philadelphia experienced.
what aspects of colonial commerce helped concentrate so much wealth in the hands of a relatively small group.
area of colonial life except of course in the relationship between masters and slaves social distinctions were real and visible in urban areas.
cities were also the centers of much of what industry there was in the colonies such as ironworks and distilleries for turning imported molasses into exportable rum.
and they were the locations of the most advanced schools the most sophisti commercial and cate cultural activities and shops cultural where imported goods could be bought.
importance in addition they were communities with peculiarly urban social problems crime vice pollution epidemics traffic.
unlike smaller towns cities were required to establish elaborate governments.
they set up constables offices and fire departments.
they developed systems for supporting the urban poor whose numbers grew steadily and became especially large in times of eco nomic crisis.
cities were also particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in trade.
when a market for a particular product became glutted and prices fell the effects on merchants and other residents could be severe.
in the countryside the impact of economic instability was generally more muted than in cities.
farmers were still somewhat independent from the larger world of the markets.
of particular importance for the political future of the colonies cities became places where new ideas could circulate and be discussed.
because there were printers it was possible to have regular newspapers.
books and other publications from abroad introduced new intellectual influences.
and the taverns and coffeehouses of cities provided forums in which people could gather and debate the issues of the day.
it was not surprising that when the revolutionary crisis began to build in the 1760s and 1770s it was first visible in the cities.
inequality new england for all its belief in community and liberty was far from an egalitarian society.
some must be rich and some poor john winthrop wrote early in the seventeenth century and his prediction perhaps exceeded his expectations.
wealthy families and socially distinguished ones which were usually the same people had privileges and rights that were not available to poor citizens.
elites were called ladies and gentleman while people in the lower levels of society were known as goodman or goodwife elites were given the best seats in their churches and had the most influence over the parish.
men had more power than women.
servants had few rights.
the church itself taught that inequality reflected gods intention.
in cities such economic stratification was significant although unlike in later eras the ranks of the richest were the largest group in the population and in boston in the eighteenth century the majority.
that was partly because wealthy people were more likely than poor people to move to cities and participate in commerce.
in the agricultural countryside many fewer people accumulated significant wealth.
awakenings and enlightenments two powerful forces were competing in american intellectual life in the eighteenth century.
one was the traditional outlook of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with its emphasis on a personal god intimately involved with the world keeping watch over individual lives.
the other was the new spirit of the enlightenment a movement sweeping both europe and america which stressed the importance of science and human reason.
the old views supported such phenomena as the belief in witchcraft and they placed great value on a stern moral code in which intellect was less important than faith.
the enlightenment by contrast suggested that people had substantial control over their own lives and the course of their societies that the world could be explained and therefore could be structured along rational scientific lines.
much of the intellectual climate of colonial america and long after was shaped by the tension between these two impulses.
the pattern of religions religious toleration flourished in many parts of america to a degree unmatched in any european nation not because americans deliberately sought to pro religious duce k but because conditions virtually toleration required it.
settlers in america brought with them so many different religious practices that it proved difficult to impose a single religious code on any large area.
the church of england was established as the official faith in virginia maryland new york the carolinas and georgia.
but with few exceptions the laws establishing the church of england as the official colonial religion were largely ignored.
even in new england where the puritans had originally believed that they were all part of a single faith there was a growing tendency in the eighteenth century for different congregations to affiliate with different denominations especially congregationalism and presbyterianism.
in parts of new york and new jersey dutch settlers had established their own calvinist denomination dutch reformed which survived after sinners in hell 1744 this mid eighteenth century religious image illustrates both the fears and prejudices of many colonial christians.

all baptists shared the belief that rebaptism usually by total immersion was necessary when believers reached maturity.
but while some baptists remained calvinists believers in predestination others came to believe in salvation by free will.
protestants extended toleration to one another more readily than they did to roman catholics.
many protestants in anti catholicism america like many in england feared and hated the pope.
new englanders in particular viewed their catholic neighbors in new france canada not only as commercial and military rivals but also as dangerous agents of rome.
in most of the english colonies the witchcraft trials hp t t t.
witchcraft trials of the 1690s which began in salem massachusetts and spread to 1 o ti other areas of new england have been the stuff of popular legend for centuries.
they have also engaged the interest of generations of historians who have tried to explain why these seventeenth century americans became so committed to the belief that some of their own neighbors were agents of satan.
although there have been many explanations of the witchcraft phenomenon some of the most important in recent decades have focused on the central place of women in the story.
through the first half of the twentieth century most historians dismissed the witchcraft trials as hysteria prompted by the intolerance and rigidity of puritan society.
this interpretation informed perhaps the most prominent popular portrayal of witchcraft in the twentieth century arthur millers play the crucible first produced in 1953 which was clearly an effort to use the salem trials as a comment on the great anticommunist frenzy of his own time.
but at almost the same time the renowned scholar of puritanism perry miller argued in a series of important studies that belief in witchcraft was not a product of hysteria or intolerance but rather a widely shared part of the religious worldview of the seventeenth century.
to the puritans witchcraft seemed not only plausible but scientifically rational as well.
a new wave of interpretation of witchcraft began in the 1970s with the publication of salem possessed 1976 by paul boyer and stephen nissenbaum.
their examination of the town records of salem in the 1690s led them to conclude that the witchcraft controversy there was a product of class tensions between the poor marginal residents of one part of salem and the wealthy privileged residents of another.
these social tensions which could not find easy expression on their own terms led some poor salemites to lash out at their rich neighbors by charging them or their servants with witchcraft.
a few years later john demos in entertaining satan 1983 examined witchcraft accusations in a larger area of new england and similarly portrayed them as products of displaced anger about social and economic grievances that could not be expressed otherwise.
demos provided a far more complex picture of the nature of these grievances than had boyer and nissenbaum but like them saw witchcraft as a symptom of a persistent set of social and psychological tensions.
at about the same time however a number of scholars were beginning to look at witchcraft through the scholarly lens of gender.
carol karlsen s the devil in the shape of a woman 1987 demonstrated however roman catholics were too few to cause serious conflict.
they were most numerous in maryland and even there they numbered no more than 3 000.
perhaps for that reason they suffered their worst persecution in that colony.
after the overthrow of the original proprietors in 1691 catholics in maryland not only lost their political rights but also were forbidden to hold religious services except in private houses.
jews in provincial america totaled no more than about 2 000 at any time.
the largest community lived in new york city.
smaller groups settled in newport and charles town and there were scattered jewish families in all the colonies.
nowhere could they vote or hold office.
only in rhode island could they practice their religion openly.
by the beginning of the eighteenth century some americans were growing troubled by the apparent decline in religious piety in their society.
the movement of the population westward and the wide scattering of settlements had caused many communities to lose touch with organized religion.
the rise of commercial prosperity created a secular outlook in urban areas.
the progress of science and free thought in europe anc the importation of enlightenment ideas to america caused a least some colonists to doubt traditional religious beliefs.
concerns about weakening piety surfaced as early as th 1660s in new england where the puritan oligarchy warned of decline in the power of the church.
sabbatl jeremiads after sabbath ministers preached sermons despair known as jeremiads deploring the signs of waning piety.
by the standards of other societies or other eras the puritan faith remained remarkably strong.
but new englanders measured their faith by their own standards and to them the declension of religious piety seemed a serious problem.
the great awakening by the early eighteenth century concerns about declining piety and growing secularism were emerging in other regions and among members of other faiths.
the result was the first major american revival the great awakening.
the great awakening began in earnest in the 1730s reached its climax in the 1740s and brought a new spirit of religious fervor to the colonies.
the revival had particular appeal to women who constituted the majority of converts and to younger sons of the third or fourth generation of settlers those who stood to inherit the least land and who faced the most uncertain futures.
the rhetoric of the revival emphasized the potential for every person to break away from the constraints of the past and start anew in his or her relationship with god.
such beliefs may have reflected the desires of many people to break away from their families or communities and start a new life.
powerful evangelists from england helped spread the revival.
john and charles wesley the founders of methodism visited georgia and other colonies in the 1730s.
george through intensive scrutiny of records across new england that a disproportionate number of those accused of witchcraft were property owning widows or unmarried women in other words women who did not fit comfortably into the normal pattern of male dominated families.
karlsen concluded that such women were vulnerable to these accusations because they seemed threatening to people including many women who were accustomed to women as subordinate members of the community mary beth norton s in the devil s snare 2002 placed the witchcraft trials in the context of other events of their time particularly in the terrifying upheavals and dislocations that the indian wars of the late seventeenth century created in puritan communities.
in the face of this crisis in which refugees from king william s war were fleeing towns destroyed by the indians and flooding salem and other eastern towns fear and social instability helped create a more than normal readiness to connect aberrant behavior such as the actions of unusually independent or eccentric women to supernatural causes.
the result was a wave of witchcraft accusations that 7he wonder of the jnvifihle world banu au account of the t r y a l s 01.

whitefield a powerful open air preacher and for a time an associate of the wesleys made several evangelizing tours through the colonies and drew tremendous crowds.
but the outstanding preacher of the great awakening was the new england congregationalist jonathan edwards a deeply orthodox puritan but a highly original theologian.
from his pulpit in northampton massachusetts edwards attacked the new doctrines of easy salvation for all.
he preached anew the traditional puritan ideas of the absolute sovereignty of god predestination and salvation by gods grace alone.
his vivid descriptions of hell could terrify his listeners.
the great awakening led to the division of congregations between new light revivalists and old light traditionalists.
it also affected areas of society outside the churches.
some of old lights the rev va sts denounced book learning as and new a hindrance to salvation and some commu lights nities repudiated secular education.
but other evangelists saw education as a means of furthering religion and they founded or led schools for the training of new light ministers.
the enlightenment the great awakening caused one great upheaval in the culture of the colonies.
the enlightenment a very different and in many ways competing phenomenon caused another.
the enlightenment was largely the product of some of the great scientific and intellectual discoveries in seventeenth century europe.
as scientists and other thinkers discovered natural laws that they believed regulated the workings of nature they came to celebrate the power of human reason and scientific inquiry.
enlightenment thinkers argued that reason not just faith could create progress and advance knowledge.
they argued that humans had a moral sense on which they could rely to tell the difference between right and wrong that they did not need always to turn to god for guidance in making decisions.
they insisted that men and women could through the power of their own reason move civilization to ever greater heights.
in celebrating reason the enlightenment slowly helped undermine the power of traditional authority something the great awakening did as well.
but unlike the great awakening the enlightenment encouraged men and women to look to themselves not to god for guidance as to how to live their lives and to shape society.
enlightenment traditional.
authority thought with its emphasis on human ratio challenged nality encouraged a new emphasis on edu cation and a heightened interest in politics and government for through governments the believers in reason argued society had its best chance of bettering itself.
most enlightenment figures did not challenge religion and insisted that rational inquiry would support not undermine 91 colonial almanacs were scarce and expensive in colonial america and many families owned only d u w o one the bible.
but starting very early in the life of the english colonies men and women had another important source of information almanacs the most popular nonreligious literature in early america.
almanacs first appeared in america in 1638 or 1639 when printers in cambridge massachusetts began publishing the philomath almanac which combined an elaborate calendar of religious holidays with information about astronomy astrology and other popular interests.
by the 1680s the farmers almanac a heavily illustrated publication that added medical advice practical wisdom navigational information and humor began to rival the philomath.
through a combination of superstition popular folklore and astronomical and astrological devices the farmers almanac also predicted weather patterns throughout the year crop yields and many other things.
almanac predictions were notoriously unreliable but many people relied on them nevertheless.
by 1700 there were dozens perhaps hundreds of almanacs circulating throughout the colonies and even in the sparsely settled lands to the west and north.
the most popular almanacs sold tens of thousands of copies every year.
most families had at least one and many had several.
it is easy to prove one almanac writer claimed in the mid eighteenth century that no book we read except the bible is so much valued and so serviceable to the community.
america was a multilingual society and although most almanacs were in english some appeared in french dutch hebrew norwegian spanish german and various indian languages.
for five years just after the revolution benjamin banneker of maryland was the only african american almanac writer publishing a book that occasionally included harsh commentary on slavery and the slave trade.
the best known almanac in the colonies in the years before the american revolution was poor richards almanack published in philadelphia by benjamin franklin under the pseudonym richard saunders.
i endeavor d to make it both entertaining and useful franklin later wrote in his autobiography.
and observing that it was generally read.
i consider d it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people who bought scarcely any other books.
in issue after issue franklin accompanied his calendars astronomical information and other standard almanac fare with proverbial sentences chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality.
poor richard s many sayings became among the most familiar passages in america.
franklin was among many writers who used the almanac to promote the new scientific discoveries of his time and to try to discredit what he considered the backward superstitions standing in the way of knowledge.
almanacs were the only widely read publications in america that contained popular humor and they are one of the best sources today for understanding what early americans considered funny.
not unlike later generations they delighted in humor that ridiculed the high and mighty aristocrats lawyers clergymen politicians made fun of relationships between men and women and expressed stereotypes about racial and ethnic groups.
in the 1760s and 1770s almanac humor was often used to disguise political ideas in the way it ridiculed british officials and american tories.
during the war itself humorous anecdotes about military officers and political leaders reflected the uneasy views of americans about the long and difficult struggle.
during and after the revolution much almanac humor consisted of admiring anecdotes about the man who was by then perhaps the most famous and beloved man in christianity.
but they challenged the notion of some religious groups that the answer to all questions about human society should or could come directly from god.
in the early seventeenth century enlightenment ideas in america were largely borrowed from abroad from such earlier giants as francis bacon and john locke and from more contemporary enlightenment thinkers in england and scotland.
few americans had yet made important contributions of their own to the new age of science and reason.
later however such americans as benjamin franklin thomas jefferson thomas paine and james madison made their own contributions to the enlightenment tradition.
education even before enlightenment ideas became common in america colonists had placed a high value on education despite the difficulties they confronted in gaining access to it.
some families tried to teach their children to read and write at home although the heavy burden of work in most agricultural households limited the time available for schooling.
in massachusetts a 1647 law required every town to support a pi many communities failed to comply a modest network of edu cational establishments emerged as a result.
elsewhere the quakers and other sects operated church schools.
and in some communities widows or unmarried women conducted dame schools by holding private classes in their homes.
in cities mas ter craftsmen set up evening schools for their apprentices a least a hundred such schools appeared between 1723 and 1770 only a relatively small number of children received educa tion beyond the primary level but white male americans a high white least achieved a hish degree of literacy.

the farmer s almanac is still popular today distributing more than 4 million copies a year.
why do you think it continues to be popular.
colonial girls often received the same home based education as boys and their literacy rate too was substantially higher than that of their european counterparts.
african slaves had virtually no access to education.
occasionally a master or mistress would teach slave children to read and write but they had few real incentives to do so.
indeed as the slave system became firmly entrenched strong social and ultimately legal sanctions developed to discourage any efforts to promote black literacy lest it encourage slaves to question their station.
indians too remained largely outside the white educational system to a large degree by choice most tribes preferred to educate their children in their own way.
but some white missionaries and philanthropists established schools for native americans and helped create a small but significant population of indians literate in spoken and written english.
nowhere was the intermingling of the influences of traditional religiosity and the new spirit of the enlightenment clearer than in the colleges and universities that grew up in colonial america.
of the six colleges in operation by 1763 all but two were founded by religious groups primarily for the training of preachers.
yet in almost all the influences of the new scientific rational approach to knowledge could be felt.
harvard the first american college was established in 1636 by the general court legislature of massachusetts at the behest of puritan theologians who wanted to create a training center for ministers.
the college was named for a charlestown minister john harvard who had died and left his library and half his estate to the college.
decades later in 1693 william and mary college named for the english king and queen was established in williamsburg virginia by anglicans like harvard it was conceived as an academy to train clergymen.
in 1701 conservative congregationalists dissatisfied with what they considered the growing religious liberalism of harvard founded yale named for one of its first benefactors elihu yale in new haven connecticut.
out of the great awakening emerged the college of new jersey founded in 1746 and known later as princeton after the town in which it is located.
one of its first presidents was jonathan edwards.
despite the religious basis of these colleges students at most of them could derive something of a secular education from the curricula which included not only theology but logic ethics 93 94 chapter 3 george whitefield whitefield succeeded john wesley as leader of the calvinist methodists in oxford england.
like wesley he was a major force in promoting religious revivalism in both england and america.
he made his first missionary journey to the new world in 1738 and returned in the mid 1740s for a celebrated journey through the colonies that helped spark the great awakening.

a dame school primer more than the residents of any other region of north america and far more than those of most of europe the new england colonists strove to educate their children and achieved perhaps the highest level of literacy in the world.
throughout the region young children attended institutions known as dame schools because the teachers were almost always women and learned from primers like this one.
puritan education emphasized both basic skills the alphabet and reading and moral and religious precepts as this sample page suggests.
american antiquarian society liberal curricula physics geometry astronomy rhetoric latin hebrew and greek as well.
from the beginning harvard attempted not only to provide an educated ministry but also to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity members of the harvard faculty made strenuous efforts to desseminate new scientific ideas particularly the ideas of copernican astronomy to a larger public often publishing their ideas in popular almanacs.
by doing so they hoped to stamp out popular belief in astrology which they considered pagan superstition.
kings college founded in new york in 1754 and later renamed columbia was even more devoted to the spread of secular knowledge.
although it was founded in part by the anglican trinity church in new york it had no theological faculty and was interdenominational from the start.
the academy and college of philadelphia which became the university of pennsylvania was a completely secular institution founded in 1755 by a group of laymen under the inspiration of benjamin franklin.
it offered courses in utilitarian subjects mechanics chemistry agriculture government commerce and modern languages as well as in the liberal arts.
it also became the site of the first medical school in british america founded in 1765.
the spread of science the clearest indication of the spreading influence of the enlightenment in america was an increasing interest in scientific knowledge.
most of the early colleges established chairs in the natural sciences and introduced some of the advanced scientific theories of europe including copernican astronomy and newtonian physics to their students.
but the most vigorous promotion of science in these years occurred outside the colleges through the private efforts of amateurs and the activities of scientific societies.

benjamin franklin on electricity the discovery of electricity was one of the great scientific events of the eighteenth century even though large scale practical use of electrical energy emerged much later.
benjamin franklin was one of the first americans and certainly the most famous one to experiment with electricity.
this is the frontispiece for a book originally published in 1750 in philadelphia that describes his experiments and observations.
the pages shown here are from the london edition which appeared in 1774.

he continued to believe that disease was a punishment for sin.
yet despite strong opposition from many of his neighbors he urged inoculation on his fellow bostonians during an epidemic in the 1720s.
the results confirmed the effectiveness of the technique.
other theologians including jonathan edwards took up the cause along with many physicians.
by the mid eighteenth century inoculation had become a common medical procedure in america.
concepts of law and politics in seventeenth and eighteenth century law and politics as in other parts of their lives americans of european descent believed that they were re creating in the new world the practices and institutions of the old.
but as in other areas they managed to create something very different.
changes in the law in america resulted in part from the scarcity of english trained lawyers who were almost unknown in the colonies until after 1700.
not until well into the eighteenth century did authorities punishment in new england new england communities prescribed a wide range of punishments for misconduct and crime in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
among the more common punishments were public humiliations placing offenders in stocks forcing them to wear badges of shame or as in this woodcut publicly ducking them in a stream or pond to create both discomfort and embarrassment.

chapter 3 in england try to impose the common law and the statutes of the realm upon the provinces.
by then it was already too late.
although the american legal system adopted most of the essential elements of the english system including such ancient rights as trial by jury significant differences had already become well established.
pleading and court procedures were simpler in america than in england and punishments were different.
instead of the gallows or prison colonists more commonly resorted to the whipping post the branding iron the stocks and for gossipy women the ducking stool.
in a labor scarce society it was not in the interests of communities to execute or incarcerate potential workers.
crimes were redefined.
in england a printed attack on a public official whether true or false was considered libelous.
in the 1734 1735 trial of the new york publisher john peter zenger who was powerfully defended by the philadelphia lawyer andrew hamilton the courts ruled that criticisms of the government were not libelous if factually true a verdict that removed some restrictions on the freedom of the press there was a subtle but decisive transformation in legal philosophy.
some colonists came to think of law as a reflection of the divine will others saw it as a result of the natural order.
in neither case did they consider it an expression of the power of an earthly sovereign.
colonial even more significant for the future of governments the relationship between the colonies and england were important differences between the american and british political systems.
because the royal government was so far away americans created a group of institutions of their own that gave them in reality if not looking back what began as a few small isolated precarious settlements in the wilderness had evolved by the mid eighteenth century into a large and complex society.
the english colonies in america grew steadily between the 1650s and the 1750s in population in the size of their economies and in the sophistication and diversity of their cultures.
in many ways the colonies had become more like england by the mid eighteenth century than they had been during their frail early years.
in other ways life in america and life in britain had begun to diverge.
many distinct societies developed in the colonies but the greatest distinction was between the colonies of the north and those of the south.
in the north society was dominated regional by small family farms and by towns and differences cities of growing size.
a thriving commer cial class was developing and with it an increasingly elaborate urban culture.
in the south there were many family farms as well.
but there were also large plantations cultivating tobacco rice indigo and cotton for export.
in theory a large measure of self government.
in most colonies local communities grew accustomed to running their own affairs with minimal interference from higher authorities.
communities also expected to maintain strict control over their delegates to the colonial assemblies and those assemblies came to exercise many of the powers that parliament exercised in england even though in theory parliament remained the ultimate authority in america.
provincial governors appointed by the crown had broad powers on paper but in fact their influence was sharply limited.
they lacked control over appointments and contracts such influence resided largely in england or with local colonial leaders.
they could never be certain of their tenure in office because governorships were patronage appointments a governor could be removed any time his patron in england lost favor.
and in many cases governors were not even familiar with the colonies they were meant to govern.
some governors were native born americans but most were englishmen who came to the colonies for the first time to assume their offices.
the result of all this was that the focus of politics in the colonies became a local one.
the provincial governments became accustomed to acting more or less independently of parliament and a set of assumptions and expectations about the rights of the colonists began to take hold in america that policymakers in england did not share.
these differences caused few problems before the 1760s because the british did little to exert the authority they believed they possessed.
but when beginning in 1763 the english government began attempting to tighten its control over the american colonies a great imperial crisis developed.
by the late seventeenth century these plantations were relying heavily on african workers who had been brought to the colonies forcibly as slaves.
there were few significant towns and cities in the south and little commerce other than the marketing of crops.
the colonies did however also have much in common.
most white americans accepted common assumptions about racial inequality.
that enabled them to accept and at times celebrate the enslavement of african men and women and to justify a campaign of displacement and often violence against native americans that would continue for two centuries.
most white americans and in different ways most nonwhite americans as well were deeply religious.
the great awakening therefore had a powerful impact throughout the colonies north and south.
and most white colonists shared a belief in certain basic principles of law and politics which they considered embedded in the english constitution and which in the years after the 1750s would lead to a great imperial crisis.

the library of congress ppmsca 17521 in setting the stage as late as the 1750s few americans objected to their membership in the british empire the imperial system provided them with many benefits opportunities for trade and commerce military protection political stability.
and for the most part the english government left the colonies alone.
beginning in 1763 however the british government embarked on a series of new policies toward its colonies policies dictated by changing international realities and new political circumstances within england itself.
in the beginning most americans reacted to the changes with relative restraint.
gradually however as crisis followed crisis a large group of americans found themselves fundamentally disillusioned with the imperial relationship.
by the mid 1770s the relationship between the american colonies and their british rulers had become so strained so poisoned so characterized by suspicion and resentment the once seemingly unbreakable bonds of empire were ready to snap.
and in the spring of 1775 the first shots were fired in a war that would ultimately win america its independence.
loosening ties after the glorious revolution of 1688 in england and the collapse of the dominion of new england in america the english government which became the british government after 1707 when a union of england and scotland created great britain made no serious or sustained effort to tighten its control over the colonies for over seventy years.
during those years an increasing number of colonies were brought under the direct control of the king.
new jersey in 1702 north and south carolina in 1729 georgia in 1754 all became royal colonies bringing the total to eight in all of them the king had the power to appoint the governors and other colonial officials.
during those years parliament also passed new laws supplementing the original navigation acts and strengthening the mercantilist program laws restricting colonial manufactures prohibiting paper currency and regulating trade.
on the whole however the british government remained uncertain and divided about the extent to which it ought to interfere in colonial affairs.
the colonies were left within broad limits to go their separate ways.
a tradition of neglect in the fifty years after the glorious revolution the british parliament established a growing supremacy over the king.
during the reigns of george i 1714 1727 and george ii 1727 1760 both growing of whom were german born and unaccustomed to english ways the prime power of minister and his cabinet ministers began to become the nations real execu parliament tives.
they held their positions not by the kings favor but by their ability to control a majority in parliament.
these parliamentary leaders were less inclined than the seventeenth century monarchs had been to try to tighten imperial organization.
they depended heavily on the support of the great merchants and landholders most of whom feared that any such experiments would require large expenditures increase taxes and diminish the profits they were earning from the colonial trade.
the first of the modern prime ministers robert walpole deliberately refrained from strict enforcement of the navigation acts believing that relaxed trading restrictions would stimulate commerce.
meanwhile the day to day administration of colonial affairs remained decentralized and inefficient.
there was no colonial office in london.
the nearest equivalent was the board of trade and plantations established in 1696 a mere advisory body that had little role in any actual decisions.
real authority rested in the privy council the central administrative agency for the government as a whole the admiralty and the treasury.
but those agencies were responsible for administering laws at home as well as overseas none could concentrate on colonial affairs.
to complicate matters decentralized colonial administration 99.
