64 chapter 4 chapter 4 life in the colonies what was life really like in the colonies.
4 1 introduction in 1723 a tired teenager stepped off a boat onto a wharf in philadelphia.
he was an odd looking sight.
not having luggage he had stuffed his pockets with extra clothes.
the young man followed a group of clean dressed people into a quaker meetinghouse where he soon fell asleep.
the sleeping teenager with the lumpy clothes was benjamin franklin.
he had recently run away from his brother jamess print shop in boston.
when he was 12 franklin had signed a contract to work for his brother for nine years.
but after enduring jamess nasty temper for five years franklin packed his pockets and left.
in philadelphia franklin quickly found work as a printers assistant.
within a few years he had saved enough money to open his own print shop.
his first success was a newspaper called the pennsylvania gazette.
in 1732 readers of the gazette saw an advertisement for poor richard s almanac.
an almanac is a book published annually that contains weather predictions planting advice for farmers and information on other useful subjects.
according to the ad poor richard s almanac was written by richard saunders and printed by b franklin.
nobody knew then that author and printer were the same person.
franklin also printed proverbs or wise sayings in his almanacs.
some like these are still remembered today a penny saved is a penny earned.
early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise.
fish and visitors smell in three days.
poor richard s almanac sold so well that franklin was able to retire at age 42.
a man of many talents he spent the rest of his long life as a scientist inventor political leader diplomat and national postmaster.
franklins rise from penniless runaway to wealthy printer was one of many colonial success stories.
in this chapter you will learn what life was like for people throughout the colonies in the 1700s.
philadelphia was a thriving colonial city in the 18th century.
this painting from 1701 shows the old state house in the heart of the busy city of boston.
life in the colonies 65 i although mostfarmers lived in one room farmhouses they held out hope that they would achieve wealth like that pictured above.
4 2 life on a farm the colonists developed an economy based on farming commerce buying and selling goods and handcrafts.
nine out of ten people lived on small family farms.
most farm families raised or made nearly everything they needed.
one farmer wrote with pride about a typical year nothing to wear eat or drink was purchased as my farm provided all.
the first and hardest task facing farm families was to clear the land of trees.
the colonists had only simple basic tools.
they cut down trees with axes and saws.
then they used the same tools to cut square timbers and flat planks for building houses barns and fences.
imagine living on a colonial farm.
your home is a single large room with a fireplace at one end.
in this room your family cooks eats and sleeps.
your parents sleep in a large bed built into one corner.
your younger brothers and sisters sleep in a smaller trundle bed a bed that can slide under the big bed during the day.
at bedtime you climb a ladder next to the chimney to sleep in an attic or a loft.
as your family grows you help to build another room on the other side of the chimney.
the fireplace is the only source of heat for warmth and cooking so keeping a supply of firewood is important.
the fire is kept burning all the time because without matches it is very difficult to light a new one.
cooking is one of the most dangerous jobs on your farm.
food is cooked in heavy iron pots hung over an open fire.
while lifting or stirring these pots your mother might burn her hands scorch her clothes or strain her back.
your day on the farm starts before sunrise.
everyone wakes up early to share the work.
chores include cutting wood feeding animals clearing land tending crops building fences making furniture and ools gathering eggs spinning thread weaving cloth sewing clothes making candles and soap cooking cleaning and caring for babies.
6 chapter 4 4 3 life in cities in 1750 one colonist out of 20 lived in a city.
compared to the quiet farm life cities were exciting places.
the heart of the city was the waterfront.
there ships brought news from england as well as eagerly awaited items such as paint carpets furniture and books.
just beyond the docks a marketplace bustled with fishers selling their catch and farmers selling fresh eggs milk and cheese.
close by were taverns where food and drink were served.
people gathered there to exchange gossip and news from other colonies.
the nearby streets were lined with shops.
sparks flew from the blacksmiths block as he hammered iron into tools.
shoemakers clockmakers silversmiths tailors and other craftspeople turned out goods based on the latest designs from england.
there were barbers to cut colonists hair and wigmakers to make it look long again.
cities were noisy smelly places.
church bells rang out several times a day.
carts clattered loudly over streets paved with round cobblestones.
the air was filled with the stench of rotting garbage and open sewers but the colonists were used to it.
animals ran loose in the street.
during hot weather clouds of flies and mosquitoes swarmed about.
city homes were close together on winding streets.
most were built of wood with thatched roofs like the houses the colonists had left behind in europe.
their windows were small because glass was costly.
for lighting colonists used torches made of pine that burned l.
colonial cities were very small by today s standards.
philadelphia pictured below and boston the two largest cities had fewer than 20 000 people in 1700 brightly when they were wedged between hearthstones in the fireplace.
colonists also burned grease in metal containers called betty lamps and made candles scented with bayberries.
with torches and candles lighting homes fire was a constant danger.
colonists kept fire buckets hanging by their front doors.
when a fire broke out the whole town helped to put it out.
grabbing their buckets colonists formed a double line from the fire to a river pond or well.
they passed the buckets full of water from hand to hand up one line to the fire.
then the empty buckets went back down the opposite line to be refilled.
life in the colonies 67 rights powers or privileges that belong to people as citizens and that cannot or should not be taken away by the government magna carta an agreement made in 1215 listing the rights granted by king john to all free men of the kingdom parliament the lawmaking body of england consisting of representatives from throughout the kingdom english bill of rights an act passed by parliament in 1689 that limited the monarchs power by giving certain powers to parliament and listing specific rights of the citizens 4 4 rights of colonists colonists in america saw themselves as english citizens.
they expected the same rights that citizens enjoyed in england.
the most important of these was the right to have a voice in their government.
magna carta the english people had won the right to participate in their government only after a long struggle.
a key victory in this struggle came in 1215 when king john agreed to sign magna carta or great charter this agreement established the idea that the power of the monarch or ruler was limited.
not even the king was above the law.
the next major victory was the founding of parliament in 1265.
parliament was made up of representatives from across england.
over time it became a lawmaking body with the power to approve laws and taxes proposed by the king or queen.
in 1685 james the duke of york became king james ii.
the king did not want to share power with an elected assembly in new york.
nor did he want to share power with an elected parliament in england.
when he tried to rule without parliament james was forced off his throne.
this change in power which took place without bloodshed is known as the glorious revolution.
the english bill of rights in 1689 parliament offered the crown to prince william of orange and his wife mary.
in exchange they had to agree to an act or law known as the english bill of rights.
this act said that the power to make laws and impose taxes belonged to the peoples elected representatives in parliament and to no one else.
it also included a bill or list of rights that belonged to the people.
among these were the right to petition the king request him to change something and the right to trial by jury.
english colonists saw the glorious revolution as a victory not only for parliament but for their colonial assemblies as well.
they wanted to choose the people who made their laws and set their taxes.
after all this was a cherished right of all english citizens.
t newyork colonists established assemblies to pre mote citizen rights.
the english traditio of self government thrived in all 13 colonies.
here we see a depiction of the first colonial assembly of virginia in 161.
crime and punishment each colonial assembly passed its own laws defining crimes and punishments.
however most crimes were treated similarly in all the colonies.
certain very serious crimes could be punished by death.
these included murder treason acts of disloyalty toward the government and piracy robbery at sea.
puritans in new england added other crimes to this list based on their understanding of gods law in the bible.
in new england colonists could be put to death for denying the true god or for striking or cursing their parents.
crimes such as theft forgery and highway robbery carried harsh punishments in every colony.
for these crimes people might be jailed whipped or branded with hot irons.
lesser crimes such as drunkenness and breaking the sabbath working or traveling on sunday were punished with fines short jail terms or public humiliation.
a colonist caught breaking the sabbath for example might be locked in the town stocks.
the stocks were a heavy wooden frame with holes for a persons neck wrists and ankles.
lawbreakers were locked for hours in this device in a public place where others could ridicule them.
no group had firmer ideas about right and wrong than new englands puritans.
the puritans required everyone to attend church on sundays.
they also forbade anyone to work or play on that day.
the puritans wrote their sunday laws in books with blue paper bindings.
for this reason these rules came to be known as blue laws.
some blue laws persist to this day.
in connecticut for example it is still illegal for stores to sell alcohol on sundays.
the puritans were constantly on the watch for signs of satan believed to be an evil angel who rebelled against god.
satan was thought to work through witches.
in 1692 fear of witchcraft overtook residents of salem massachusetts when several girls were seen acting strangely in church.
the girls accused their neighbors of being witches and putting spells on them.
nineteen accused witches were put to death during the salem witch trials before calm was restored and the townspeople realized that the girls accusations were untrue.
courts like the one pictured here were important to social life in the colonies.
this painting depicts a woman being tried for witchcraft in salem massachusetts in 1692 h i i 68 chapter 4 life in the colonies 69 4 5 life for african americans slavery in the colonies began in virginia with tobacco planters.
from there it spread both north and south.
by the early 1700s enslaved africans were living in every colony.
even benjamin franklin owned slaves for a time.
but like most people in the new england and middle colonies franklin found that hiring workers when he needed them cost less than owning slaves.
in the southern colonies however slavery expanded rapidly.
from virginia to georgia slaves helped raise tobacco rice indigo and other cash crops.
the first slaves were brought to the united states in 1619 to help raise tobacco in the virginia colony.
here slaves tend tobacco while their owner relaxes feet up smoking his pipe.
the granger collection new the atlantic slave trade most of the slaves who were brought to the colonies came from west africa.
year after year slave ships filled with cloth guns and rum sailed from the colonies to the coast of west africa.
there these goods were traded for africans.
the ships then returned to the americas carrying their human cargo.
for the africans packed onto slave ships the ocean crossing known as the middle passage was a nightmare.
according to his autobiography olaudah equiano oh lau duh ek wee ah noh was just ten years old when he was put onto a slave ship.
he never forgot the closeness of the place.
which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself nor did he forget the shrieks of the women and groans of the dying the terrified boy refused to eat hoping for the last friend death to relieve me although equiano survived the voyage many africans died of sickness or despair.
even so the atlantic slave trade was very profitable.
many colonial merchants built fortunes trading in human beings.
work without hope the slaves masters in america demanded that the africans work hard.
most enslaved africans were put to work in the fields raising crops.
others worked as nurses carpenters blacksmiths drivers servants gardeners and midwives people who assist women giving birth.
unlike other colonists slaves had little hope of making a better life.
their position was fixed at the bottom of colonial society.
some slaves rebelled by refusing to work or running away.
but most adapted to their unhappy condition as best they could.
slowly and painfully they began to create a new african american way of life.
70 chapter 4 colonial society had a strong religious flavor.
here colonial citizens gather around a church on sunday.
4 6 religion religion was an important part of colonial life.
most colonists tried to lead good lives based on their faith.
children grew up reading the bible from cover to cover several times over.
puritan church services in new england the sound of a drum or horn called puritans to worship on sunday morning.
captains of the watch made sure everyone was a sabbath keeper sometimes houses were searched to ensure that everyone was at church.
church services were held in the town meetinghouse.
this was the most important building in the community and was used for all public meetings.
inside were rows of wooden benches called pews and a pulpit a platform where the preacher stood.
a seating committee carefully assigned seats with the best ones going to older wealthy people.
services could last as long as five hours.
at midday villagers would go to noon houses near the church to warm themselves by a fire eat and socialize.
then they returned to church for the long afternoon sermon.
the great awakening beginning in the 1730s a religious movement known as the great awakening swept through the colonies.
this movement was spurred by a feeling that people had lost their religious faith.
the forms of religion were kept up a puritan observed but there was little of the power of god in it.
to revive peoples religious spirit preachers traveled from town to town holding outdoor revival meetings.
there they delivered fiery sermons to huge crowds.
their words touched the hearts and souls of many colonists.
benjamin franklin wrote about the change he observed in philadelphia it seemed as if all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk through the town in an evening without hearing psalms bible songs sung in different families of every street the great awakening had a powerful effect on the colonies.
it helped spread the idea that all people are equal in the eyes of god.
ordinary people could understand gods will if they had an open heart and a desire to know gods truth.
by encouraging ideas of liberty equality and self reliance the great awakening helped pave the way for the american revolution.
great awakening a revival of religious feeling and belief in the american colonies that began in the 1730s life in the colonies 71 4 7 education i children gather with their teacher in a colonial school.
these children were among a minority of children who received formal education.
most children did not go to school beyond the elementary level.
except in new england most children in the colonies received little formal education.
neither the middle nor the southern colonies had public schools.
in the southern colonies most families were spread out along rivers.
a few neighbors might get together to hire a teacher for their children.
wealthy planters often hired tutors to educate younger children at home.
older children were sent to schools in distant cities or even england to complete their education.
in the middle colonies religious differences among quakers catholics jews baptists and other religious groups slowed the growth of public education.
each religious group or family had to decide for itself how to educate its children.
some groups built church schools.
others were content to have parents teach their children at home.
only in new england were towns required to provide public schools.
the puritans support for education was inspired by their religious faith.
they wanted their children to be able to read the bible.
to encourage education massachusetts passed a law in 1647 that required every town with 50 families or more to hire an instructor to teach their children to read and write.
towns with more than 100 families were required to build a school.
similar laws were passed in other new england colonies.
wiv adivcu lu contribute whatever they could to the village school.
contributions might be money vegetables firewood or anything else the school needed.
often land was set aside as school meadows or school fields this land was then rented out to raise money for teachers salaries.
schools were one room buildings with a chimney and fireplace ii the center.
there were no boards to write on or maps.
pencils and pa per were scarce.
students shouted out spelling words and wrote sum in ink on pieces of bark.
there was usually one book the new engl primer which was used to teach the alphabet syllables and prayers.
i 72 chapter 4 most colonists believed that boys needed more education than girls.
female education in the best families wrote first lady abigail adams went no further than writing and arithmetic in some few and rare instances music and dancing 4 8 colonial families the concept of family has changed often throughout history.
today most people think of a family as being made up of parents and their children.
in colonial times however families might include grandparents aunts and uncles cousins and stepchildren.
marriage colonial men and women generally married in their early to mid 20s.
those who arrived in america as indentured servants were not allowed to marry until they had gained their freedom.
men outnumbered women throughout the colonies.
as a result almost every woman was assured of receiving a marriage proposal.
maid servants of good honest stock family wrote a colonist could choose their husbands out of the better sort of people for a young woman though life as a wife and mother often proved to be even harder than life as an indentured servant.
large families colonial families were generally large.
most families had between seven and ten children.
benjamin franklin had 16 brothers and sisters.
farm families in particular needed all the hands they could get to help with chores.
religious and cultural backgrounds influenced colonists ideas about raising children.
but almost everywhere in the colonies children were expected to be productive members of the family.
married women gave birth many times but nearly half of all children died before they reached adulthood.
childhood deaths were especially high in the middle and southern colonies where the deadly disease of malaria raged.
adults often died young as well.
after the death of a wife or husband men and women usually remarried quickly.
thus households often swelled with stepchildren as well as adopted orphans children whose parents had died.
whether colonists lived in cities in villages or on isolated farms their lives focused on their families.
family members took care of one another because there was no one else to do so.
young families often welcomed elderly grandparents aunts uncles and cousins into their homes when they could no longer care for themselves.
it didnt matter if there was barely enough room for everyone.
no one would turn away a needy relative.
family life was atthe center of colonial society.
this family is gathered around a fire on a wintry evening.

below colonists enjoy a form of billiards called trock.
4 9 leisure while most colonists worked hard they enjoyed their periods of leisure time away from work.
they also took advantage of gatherings such as town meetings and sunday services to talk with neighbors and make friends.
bees and frolics when possible colonists combined work and play by organizing bees and frolics.
new settlers might hold a chopping bee in which all the neighbors helped clear the trees off their land.
other frolics included corn husking bees for men and quilting bees for women.
sharing the work made it faster and more fun.
the germans introduced house and barn raisings to the colonies.
at these events neighbors joined together to build the frame of a house or barn in one day.
the men assembled the four walls flat on the ground and then raised them into place.
meanwhile the women prepared a huge feast.
at the end of the day everyone danced on the barns new floor.
the granger collection new york toys and sports colonial children had a few simple toys such as dolls marbles and tops.
they played tag blindmans bluff and stoolball which was related to the english game of cricket a game like baseball.
children in new england also enjoyed coasting down snowy hills on sleds.
adults must have thought coasting was dangerous because several communities forbade it.
adults enjoyed several sports.
almost every village had a bowling green.
here men rolled egg shaped balls down a lane of grass toward a white ball called a jack.
colonists also played a game similar to backgammon called tick tack and a form of billiards pool called trock.
in the southern colonies fox hunting with horses and hounds was a popular sport.
card playing was another favorite pastime one that new england puritans disapproved of strongly.
horse racing cockfighting and bull baiting were also popular in the south.
fairs were held throughout the colonies.
at these events colonists competed in contests of skill and artistry.
there were footraces wrestling matches dance contests and wild scrambles to see who could win a prize by catching a greased pig or climbing a greased pole.

here churchgoers sing as they waitto enter their church.
a great awakening in the 1730s and 1740s the great awakening shook up the english colonies.
this religious movement caused an outpouring of christian faith.
it also prompted new ways of thinking about the church and society.
as a result it helped lay the foundations for political changes to come.
nathan cole was working on his farm on the morning of october 23 1740 when he heard the news.
george whitefield was coming.
a famous preacher whitefield was known for his powerful sermons.
he had traveled all over the colonies drawing huge crowds wherever he went.
now he was in connecticut.
in fact he was preaching in nearby middletown that very morning.
cole knew he had to move fast.
i dropped my tool.
and ran to my pasture for my horse with all my might fearing that i should be too late to hear him.
i brought my horse home and soon mounted and took my wife up and went forward as fast as i thought the horse could bear.
and when we came within about half a mile i from the main road.
i saw before me a cloud or fog rising.
i first thought it came from the great river but as i came nearer.
i heard a noise something like a low rumbling thunder and presently found it was the noise of horses feet coming down the road and this cloud was a cloud of dust.
as i drew nearer it seemed like a steady stream of horses and their riders.
every horse seemed to go with all his might to carry his rider to hear news from heaven for the saving of souls.
nathan cole in george leon walker some aspects of religious life in new england 1897 thousands of people were rushing to middletown to hear white field speak.
i saw no man at work in his field cole wrote but all seemed to be gone when cole and his wife reached the town they found a large crowd gathered there.
the mood was electric as they waited for whitefield to appear.
what was behind all this excitement.
why would a preachers arrival cause a commotion like that of a rock star or a hollywood celebrity today.
in fact whitefield was a superstar of his time.
he was the most amous gure in a religious revival that was sweeping the colonies eop e were seeking a deep spiritual experience and a direct connec n o o.
they found that connection in preachers like whitefield 76 chapter 4 origins of the awakening religion played a major role in the lives of colonists in the early 1700s.
most people attended church regularly.
there were a number of different churches but most provided a similar experience.
they emphasized traditional religious teachings.
their ministers were educated men who valued reason over emotion.
the atmosphere in church was calm and orderly.
some ministers however believed that the church had lost its way.
they feared that religion had become a collection of formal empty rituals.
they wanted to wake people up and renew their faith.
in their sermons they offered an emotional message of sin and salvation that was aimed at the heart not the head.
by the 1730s a split was developing between old line ministers and those favoring a new way.
these two groups became known as the old lights and the new lights.
the old lights stressed tradition and respect for authority.
the new lights called for a more individual personal form of worship.
they wanted people to feel the spirit of god for themselves.
george whitefield was the best known personality of the revival movement.
his powerful sermons awakened religious belief in his listeners.
whitefield and other new light ministers often preached at open air revivals.
they depicted the glories of heaven and the miseries of hell.
hearing these highly charged sermons many people were seized by feelings of great joy or despair.
they would weep moan and fall to the ground.
as news of the revivals spread the movement gained strength.
jonathan edwards was one of the first revival preachers.
though he was not as dramatic as whitefield his words still carried great weight.
leading lights whitefield and edwards a number of ministers played key roles in the great awakening.
the leading figures however were george whitefield and jonathan edwards.
if whitefield was the star of the movement edwards was its most important thinker.
whitefield was a young anglican minister in england when he joined the revival movement.
in 1739 he defied church authorities by holding revival meetings across the country.
that same year he traveled to the colonies where he caused a sensation.
whitefield was a magnificent speaker with a beautiful voice and the skills of an accomplished actor.
his words and gestures could lift audiences into an emotional frenzy.
he toured from maine to georgia appearing in towns and cities along the way.
in boston some 20 000 people gathered to hear him speak.
he was the most celebrated man in america.
whitefield was pleased with his success.
but he was also troubled by the wealth and vanity he saw in the colonies.
noting the fine clothing worn by wealthy citizens he argued that christians should dress simply and plainly.
in boston he was disturbed to see young children dressed in fancy clothes the little infants who were brought to baptism were wrapped up in such fine things.
that one would think they were brought thither there to be initiated into rather than to renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world.
while in massachusetts whitefield visited jonathan edwards at his home in northampton.
edwards had helped start the revival movement and had been a great influence on whitefield.
edwards in turn recognized that whitefield had given new life to the movement.
he decided to increase his own efforts to win converts.
in this way he said he hoped to make new england a kind of heaven upon earth 78 chapter 4 edwards began to preach in neighboring towns.
in 1741 he gave his most famous sermon in enfield connecticut.
called sinners in the hands of an angry god this sermon was directed at a congregation that had resisted the revival message.
edwards told them that they had angered god with their sinful ways.
god held them in his hand he said and could cast them into hell at any moment.
the god that holds you over the pit of hell much as one holds a spider is dreadfully provoked his wrath towards you burns like fire tis nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire oh sinner.
consider the fearful danger you are in and now you have an extraordinary opportunity a day wherein christ has flung the door of mercy wide open and stands in the door calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners many that were very lately in the same miserable condition you are in are in now a happy state rejoicing in the hope of the glory of god.
how awful is it to be left behind at such a day.
these words had a devastating effect.
the congregation began to wail and beg for mercy.
the shrieks and cries were piercing wrote one witness.
the uproar was so great that edwards could not even finish his sermon.
sm s i n nf.
in the angry god.
sermon preached at enfield july 8th 1741.

f the impact of the awakening over the next few years such incidents became more common.
at the same time the split between old light and new light ministers grew wider.
churches were breaking apart.
for the sake of unity both sides agreed to make peace and heal their divisions.
by the late 1740s the great awakening was over.
the impact of the movement was deep and ongoing however.
new light preachers had encouraged people to think for themselves and to make their own choices about religious faith.
as a result the church no longer had absolute authority in religious matters.
preachers also taught that everyone was equal in the eyes of god.
as one preacher said the common people.
claim as good a right to judge and act for themselves as civil rulers or the learned clergy by encouraging people to act independently and defy authority the great awakening helped lay the groundwork for rebellion against british rule.
in sinners in the hands of an angry god edwards spoke of hell as a real place that awaited those who sinned against god.
this was a common theme in revival sermons.

our colonial heritage 81 unit 2 setting the stage 75 vv revolution in the colonies in this unit you will learn why some colonists wanted to replace british rule with an independent government.
you will also learn about the long difficult struggle to gain that independence.
in the 1760s great britain began passing new trade and tax laws for the colonies and enforcing old laws passed years before.
picture a southern rice farmer who is required by law to sell his crop only to england even if he might get a higher price elsewhere.
or think of a northern merchant having to pay a new tax on paper a tax imposed by a distant government in which he had no representation.
how do you think they felt about such laws and taxes.
colonists who supported great britain s policies and british rule were known as loyalists.
those who resisted called themselves patriots.
when the colonies declared independence patriots were opposed by many loyalists as well as british troops.
the map on the opposite page shows the physical geography of the 13 colonies.
knowing the land was one advantage patriot forces had over british troops in the american revolution.
