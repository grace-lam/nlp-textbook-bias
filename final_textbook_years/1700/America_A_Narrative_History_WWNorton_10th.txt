110 chapter 3 colonial ways of life indentured servants or slaves.
during the eighteenth century england would transport some 50 000 convicts to the north american colonies to relieve overcrowded jails and provide needed workers.
once in america many of the newcomers kept moving within and across colonies in search of better lands or new business opportunities such as trading with the native peoples who controlled the profitable fur trade.
this extraordinary mosaic of adventurous people created americas enduring institutions and values as well as its distinctive spirit and restless energy.
the shape of early america life in early america was hard and often short.
many in the first wave of american colonists died of disease or starvation others were killed by native americans.
the average death rate in the first years of settlement was 50 percent.
once colonial life became more settled and secure however the colonies grew rapidly.
on average the american population doubled every twenty five years during the colonial period.
by 1750 the number of colonists had passed 1 million by 1775 it approached 2 5 million.
by comparison the combined population of england scotland and ireland in 1750 was 6 5 million.
population growth benjamin franklin a keen observer of life in the new country said that the extraordinary growth in the colonial population came about because land was plentiful and cheap and laborers were scarce and expensive.
the opposite conditions prevailed in europe.
it suffered from overpopulation and expensive farmland.
from this reversal of conditions flowed many of the changes that european culture underwent during the colonization of america not the least being that more land and good fortune lured enterprising immigrants and led settlers to replenish the earth with large families.
once in the colonies settlers tended to have large families in part because farm children could lend a hand in the fields.
colonists tended to marry and start families at an earlier age than in europe.
in england the average age at marriage for women was twenty five or twenty six in america it dropped to twenty.
men in the colonies also married at a younger age.
the birth rate rose accordingly since women who married earlier had time for about two additional pregnancies during their childbearing years.
on average a married woman had a child every two to three years before menopause.
some women had as many as 20 pregnancies over their lifetime making for large families.
benjamin franklin for example had sixteen brothers and sisters.
the shape of early america 111 birthing children however was also dangerous since most babies were delivered at home in often unsanitary conditions and harsh weather.
miscarriages were common.
between 25 and 50 percent of women died during birthing or soon thereafter and almost a quarter of all babies did not survive infancy especially during the early stages of a colonial settlement.
each year more deaths occurred among young children than any other age group.
disease and epidemics were rampant in colonial america.
in 1713 boston minister cotton mather lost three of his children and his wife to a measles epidemic.
mather lost eight of fifteen children in their first year of life.
martha custis the virginia widow who married george washington had four children during her first marriage all of whom died young at ages two three sixteen and seventeen.
overall however mortality rates in the colonies were lower than in europe.
because fertile land was plentiful famine seldom occurred after the early years of settlement and although the winters were more severe than in england firewood was abundant.
the average age in the new nation in 1790 was sixteen years because the colonial population was younger on the colonial farm this plan of a newly cleared farm shows how trees were cut whole americans as a group were less down and the stumps left to rot.
susceptible to disease than were europeans.
colonists longevity reflected the different living conditions in america.
the majority of colonists lived in sparsely populated settlements and were less likely to be exposed to infectious diseases.
that began to change of course as colonial cities grew larger and more congested and trade and travel increased.
by the mid eighteenth century the colonies were beginning to see levels of contagion much like those in the cities of europe.
women in the colonies in contrast to the colonies of new spain and new france english america had far more women which largely explains the difference in population growth rates among the european empires competing in the americas.
more 112 chapter 3 colonial ways of life women did not mean more equality however.
most colonists brought to america deeply rooted convictions about the inferiority of women.
as one new england minister stressed the woman is a weak creature not endowed with the strength and constancy of mind of men women as had been true for centuries were expected to focus their time and talents on what was then called the domestic sphere they were to obey and serve their husbands nurture their children and maintain their households.
governor john winthrop insisted that a true wife would find contentment only in subjection to her husbands authority the wifes role said another puritan was to guide the house etc.
and not guide the husband a wife should view her spouse with a noble but generous fear which proceeds from love women in most colonies could not vote hold office attend schools or colleges bring lawsuits sign contracts or become ministers.
divorces were usually granted only for desertion or cruel and barbarous treatment and no matter who was named the guilty party the father received custody of the children.
a pennsylvania court did see fit to send a man to prison for throwing a loaf of hard bread at his wife which occasioned her death in a short time womens work virtually every member of a household regardless of age or gender worked and no one was expected to work harder than women.
as john cotton a boston minister admitted in 1699 women are creatures without which there is no comfortable living for a man women who failed to perform the work expected of them were punished as if they were servants or slaves.
in 1643 margaret page of salem massachusetts was jailed for being a lazy idle loitering person during the eighteenth century womens work typically involved activities in the house garden and fields.
unmarried women often worked outside their home.
many moved into other households to help with children or to make clothes.
others stayed at home but took in children or spun thread into yarn to exchange for cloth.
still others hired themselves out as apprentices to learn a skilled trade or craft.
throughout colonial america there were women silversmiths blacksmiths shoemakers sailmakers shopkeepers and mill owners.
other women operated laundries or bakeries.
technically any money earned by a married woman was the property of her husband.
farm women usually rose and prepared breakfast by sunrise and went to bed soon after dark.
they were responsible for building the fire and hauling water from a well or creek.
they fed and watered the livestock woke the children churned butter tended the garden prepared lunch the main meal of the the shape of early america 113 the first second and last scene of mortality prudence pundersons needlework ca.

women also combed spun spooled wove and bleached wool for clothing knitted linen and cotton hemmed sheets pieced quilts made candles and soap chopped wood hauled water mopped floors and washed clothes.
female indentured servants in the southern colonies commonly worked as field hands weeding hoeing and harvesting.
meals in colonial america differed according to ethnic groups.
the english focused their diet on boiled or broiled meats venison mutton beef and pork.
meals were often cooked in one large cast iron pot combining stew meat with potatoes and vegetables which were then smothered with butter and seasoned with salt.
puddings made of bread or plums were the favorite dessert while beer with just a little alcohol content was the most common beverage even for children and infants.
cooking was usually done over a large open fireplace.
the greatest accidental killer of women was kitchen fires that ignited long dresses.
114 chapter 3 colonial ways of life one of the most lucrative trades among colonial women was the oldest prostitution.
many servants took up prostitution after their indenture was fulfilled and the colonial port cities had thriving brothels.
they catered to sailors and soldiers but men from all walks of life married and unmarried frequented what were called bawdy houses or in puritan boston disorderly houses virginias william byrd perhaps the wealthiest man in the colony complained in his diary that he had walked the streets of williamsburg trying to pick up a whore but could not find one local authorities frowned on such activities.
in massachusetts convicted prostitutes were stripped to the waist tied to the back of a cart and whipped as it moved through the town.
in south carolina several elected public officials were dismissed because they were caught lying with wenches new york city officials ordered raids on brothels in 1753.
some two dozen ladies of pleasure were arrested and five of them were subjected to a public whipping.
some enslaved women whose owners expected sexual favors turned the tables by demanding compensation.
on occasion circumstances forced women to exercise leadership outside the domestic sphere.
such was the case with south carolinian elizabeth lucas pinckney 1722 1793.
born in the west indies raised on the island of antigua and educated in england eliza moved with her family to charleston south carolina at age fifteen when her father george lucas inherited three plantations.
the following year however lucas a british army officer and colonial administrator was called back to antigua leaving eliza to care for her ailing mother and younger s ister and to manage three plantations worked by slaves.
she wrote a friend in england i have the business of three plantations to transact which requires much writing and more business and fatigue.
but by rising early i find i can go through much business eliza loved the vegetable world and experimented with several crops uch coveted before focusing on indigo a west indian plant that produced a m blue dye for coloring fabric especially military uniforms.
indigo made her family a fortune as it did for many other plantation owners on the carolina coast.
in 1744 she married charles pinckney a widower twice her age who was speaker of the south carolina assembly.
she made him promise that she could continue to manage the plantation.
as eliza began raising children she resolved to make a good wife to my dear husband.
a good mother to my children.
a good mistress to my servants making their lives as comfortable as i can she also pledged not to be luxurious or extravagant in the management of my table family budget and family on the one hand nor niggardly and covetous or too anxiously concerned about it on the other the shape of early america 115 in the towns women commonly served as tavern hostesses and shopkeepers and occasionally worked as doctors printers upholsterers painters and silversmiths.
often these women were widows carrying on their dead husbands trade or business and they became accustomed to some measure of social authority in a mans world women and religion during the colonial era no denomination allowed women to be ordained as ministers.
only the quakers let women hold church offices and preach exhort in public.
puritans cited biblical passages claiming that god required virtuous women to submit to male authority and remain silent in congregational matters.
governor john winthrop demanded that women not meddle in such things as are proper for men to manage.
women who challenged ministerial authority were usually prosecuted and punished.
yet by the eighteenth century as is true today women made up the overwhelming majority of church members.
their disproportionate attendance at church services and revivals worried many ministers since a feminized church was presumed to be a church in decline.
in 1692 the influential boston minister cotton mather observed that there are far more godly women in the world than there are godly men in explaining this phenomenon mather put a new twist on the old notion of women being the weaker sex.
he argued that the pain associated with childbirth which had long been interpreted as the penalty women paid for eves sinfulness was in part what drove women more frequently the more fervently to commit their lives to christ.
in colonial america the religious roles of black women were quite different from those of their white counterparts.
in most west african tribes women were not subordinate to men and frequently served as priests and cult leaders.
although some enslaved africans had been exposed to christianity or islam in africa most of them tried to sustain their traditional african religion once they arrived in the colonies.
in america black women and men were often excluded from church membership for fear that christianized slaves might seek to gain their freedom.
to clarify the situation virginia in 1667 passed a law specifying that children of slaves would be slaves even if they had been baptized as christians.
over time the colonial environment did generate slight improvements in the status of women.
the acute shortage of women in the early years made them more highly valued than they were in europe and the puritan emphasis on a w ell ordered family life led to laws protecting wives from physical abuse and allowing for divorce.
in addition colonial laws gave wives greater control 116 chapter 3 colonial ways of life over property that they had contributed to a marriage or that was left after a husbands death.
but the a ge old notion of female subordination and domesticity remained firmly entrenched in colonial america.
as a massachusetts boy maintained in 1662 the superior aspect of life was masculine and eternal the feminine inferior and mortal society and economy in the southern colonies as the southern colonies matured inequalities of wealth became more visible and social life grew more divided.
the use of enslaved indians and africans to grow and process the crops most in demand in europe generated enormous wealth for a few large landowners and their families.
socially the planters and merchants increasingly became a class apart from the common folk they dominated the legislatures bought luxury goods from london and paris and built brick mansions with formal gardens all the while looking down upon their social inferiors both white and black.
warm weather and plentiful rainfall enabled the southern colonies to grow the staple crops most profitable also called cash crops valued by the mother country tobacco rice sugarcane and indigo.
virginia as king charles i put it was founded upon smoke tobacco production soared during the seventeenth century.
in virginia and maryland wrote a royal official in 1629 tobacco.
is our all and indeed leaves no room for anything else the same was true for rice cultivation in south carolina and georgia.
using only hand tools slaves transformed the coastal landscapes removing trees from swamps and wetlands infested with snakes alligators and mosquitos.
they then created a system of floodgates to allow workers to drain or flood the fields as needed.
over time the rice planters became the wealthiest group in the british colonies.
as plantations grew in size the demand for enslaved laborers first native americans and later africans rose dramatically.
the first english immigrants to virginia and maryland the chesapeake colonies built primitive one room huts with dirt floors and little privacy.
they provided limited protection from the cold and wind and rotted quickly.
a visitor to virginia in 1622 reported that the colonys huts were the worst i ever saw eventually colonists built sparsely furnished cabins on stone or brick foundations roofed with thatched straw.
the spaces between the log timbers were chinked with wattle and daub a mix of mud sand straw and wooden stakes that when dried formed a sturdy wall or seam.
there were few furnishings in most colonial homes.
because most of the huts or cabins were society and economy in new england 117 virginia plantation wharf southern colonial plantations were often constructed along rivers with easy access to oceangoing vessels as shown on this 1730 tobacco label.
too small for beds residents slept on the floor and used blankets to keep warm.
rarely did they have glass to fill windows.
instead they simply used wooden shutters to cover the openings.
society and economy in new england environmental social and economic factors contributed to the remarkable diversity among the early american colonies.
new england was quite different from the southern and middle atlantic regions more governed by religious concerns less focused on commercial agriculture more engaged in trade and much less involved with slavery.
townships whenever new england towns were founded the first public structure built was usually a church.
by law every town had to collect taxes to support a church and every r esident whether a church member or 118 chapter 3 colonial ways of life ot was required to attend midweek and sunday religious services.
the avern age new englander heard 7 000 sermons in a lifetime.
the puritans believed that god had created a covenant or contract in which people formed a congregation for common worship.
this led to the idea of people joining together to form governments but the principles of democracy were not part of puritan political thought.
puritan leaders sought to do the will of god not to follow the will of the people and the ultimate source of authority was not majority rule but the bible as interpreted by ministers and magistrates political leaders.
unlike the settlers in the southern colonies or in dutch new york few new england colonists received huge tracts of land.
township grants were usually awarded to organized groups of settlers often already gathered into a church congregation.
they would request from the general court a town what elsewhere was commonly called a township.
they then divided the land according to a rough principle of equity.
those who invested more or had larger families or greater status might receive more land while the town retained some pasture and woodland in common and held other tracts for later arrivals.
dwellings and daily life the first colonists in new england initially lived in caves tents or cabins but they soon built simple w ood frame housing in colonial new england this frame house built in the 1670s belonged to rebecca nurse one of the women hanged as a witch in salem village in 1692.
society and economy in new england 119 houses.
the roofs were steeply pitched to reduce the buildup of snow and were covered with thatched grasses or reeds.
by the end of the seventeenth century most new england homes were plain but sturdy dwellings centered on a fireplace.
some had glass windows brought from england.
interior walls were often plastered and whitewashed but it was not until the eighteenth century that the exteriors of most houses were painted usually a deep indian red.
the interiors were dark illuminated by candles or oil lamps both of which were expensive out of practicality most people usually went to sleep soon after sunset.
family life revolved around the main room on the ground floor called the hall where meals were cooked in a large fireplace and where the family lived most of the time hence they came to be called living rooms.
food would be served at a table of r ough hewn planks called the board.
the father was sometimes referred to as the chair man because he sat in the only chair the origin of the term chairman of the board.
the rest of the family usually stood or sat on stools or benches and ate with their hands and wooden spoons.
forks were not introduced until the eighteenth century.
a typical meal consisted of corn boiled meat and vegetables washed down with beer cider rum or milk.
cornbread was a daily favorite as was cornmeal mush known as hasty pudding.
the new england economy early new england farmers and their families led hard lives.
clearing rocks from the g lacier scoured soil might require sixty days of hard labor per acre.
the growing season was short and no staple crops for sale in markets grew in the harsh climate.
the crops and livestock were those familiar to the english countryside wheat barley oats some cattle pigs and sheep.
many new englanders turned to the sea for their livelihood.
codfish had been a regular element of the european diet for centuries and the waters off the new england coast had the heaviest concentrations of cod in the world.
whales too abounded in new england waters.
they supplied oil for lighting and lubrication as well as ambergris a waxy substance used in the manufacture of perfumes.
new englanders exported dried fish to europe with lesser grades going to the west indies as food for slaves.
the thriving fishing industry encouraged the development of shipbuilding and the growing experience and expertise at seafaring spurred transatlantic commerce.
rising incomes and a booming trade with britain and europe soon brought a taste for luxury goods in new england that clashed with the puritan ideal of plain living and high thinking.
in 1714 a worried puritan deplored the great extravagance that people are 120 chapter 3 colonial ways of life fallen into far beyond their circumstances in their purchases buildings families expenses apparel generally in the whole way of living shipbuilding the abundant forests of new england represented a source of enormous wealth.
old growth trees were especially prized for use as ships masts and spars on which sails were attached.
early on the british government claimed the tallest and straightest american trees mostly white pines and oaks for use by the royal navy.
at the same time british officials encouraged the colonists to develop their own shipbuilding industry.
american built ships quickly became known for their quality and price.
it was much less expensive to purchase ships built in america than to transport american timber to britain for ship construction especially since a large ship might require as many as profitable fisheries catching curing 2 000 trees.
nearly a third of all british and drying codfish in newfoundland in ships were made in the colonies.
the early 1700s.
for centuries the rich fishing grounds of the north atlantic provided new englanders with a prosperous industry.
trade by the end of the seventeenth century the new england colonies had become part of a complex north atlantic commercial network trading not only with the british isles and the british west indies but also often illegally with spain france portugal the netherlands and their colonies.
trade in new england and the middle colonies differed from that in the south in two respects their lack of staple crops to exchange for english goods was a relative disadvantage but the success of shipping and commercial enterprises worked in their favor.
after 1660 to protect its agriculture and fisheries the english government placed prohibitive duties taxes on fish flour wheat and meat while leaving the door open to timber furs and whale oil products in great demand in the home country.
between 1698 and 1717 new england and new york bought more from england than they exported to it creating an unfavorable trade balance as more of their coins went out than came in.
these circumstances gave rise to the triangular trade in which new englanders for example shipped rum to the west coast of africa where it was society and economy in new england 121 es atlantic trade routes h o rs north america s ves mo mola n ey s u sse s ga r sl a fis h l iv es t ock fl o u r l u m b e r sl a v e s cuba en france lin s e r o t s l a v a s europe d o o fi s h f urs n g d e r m a nufactu portugal spain d goods i ns man uf act ure lisbon o sk indi g e to b a c c o azores c i r cadiz m e a t fi s h r u m l u m b e r g r a i n ma nuf ac t ur e d g o od s wi ne madeira at l a n t i c win e fr ui t newfoundland boston new york philadelphia charleston glasgow england bristol london netherlands su jamaica ga mo r la e ss s fr u it eu ea rop ro np du c ts africa hispaniola ocean west indies sla r u ve s m sla v sl av ec go oa ivo ld st ry co co as as t t es south america major trade routes intercoastal trade routes how was overseas trade in the south different from that in new england and what were north americas most important exports.

first proof exchanged for slaves took the enslaved africans to the west indies to sell and returned home with various west indian commodities including molasses from which new englanders then manufactured rum.
in another version they shipped provisions to the west indies carried sugar and molasses to england and returned with goods manufactured in europe.
the devil in new england the puritans who settled new england were religious fundamentalists who looked to the bible for authority and inspiration.
they read the bible daily and memorized much of it.
yet at times religious zeal could get out of hand.
the strains of massachusettss 122 chapter 3 colonial ways of life t ransition from puritan utopia to royal colony reached a tragic climax in 1692 amid the witchcraft hysteria at salem village some fifteen miles north of boston.
belief in witchcraft was widespread throughout europe and the colonies in the seventeenth century.
prior to the dramatic episode in salem almost 300 new englanders mostly m iddle aged women had been accused of practicing witchcraft and more than 30 had been hanged.
the salem episode was unique in its scope and intensity however.
during the winter of 1691 1692 several adolescent girls became fascinated with the fortune telling and voodoo practiced by tituba a slave from barbados.
the entranced girls began to behave oddly shouting barking crawling and twitching for no apparent reason.
when asked who was tormenting them the girls replied that three women tituba sarah good and sarah osborne were satans servants.
the reverend samuel parris whose daughter claimed to be bewitched beat tituba his slave until she confessed.
authorities then arrested tituba and the other accused women.
two of them were hanged but not before they named other supposed witches in the village and more young girls experienced inexplicable fits.
soon the wild accusations spread and within a few months the salem village jail was filled with more than 150 men women and children all accused of practicing witchcraft.
when a prominent farmer giles corey was accused of supernatural crimes his neighbors lowered him into an open grave placed a board over his body and began loading it with heavy boulders to force a confession.
after three days of such abuse the defiant old man finally succumbed having muttered only two words more weight by denying guilt and choosing death corey ensured that his estate would go to his son rather than be confiscated by the government.
that convicted witches forfeited their property which was then put up for sale revealed the practical benefits and self interested motives behind some of the accusations.
as the allegations and executions multiplied leaders of the massachusetts bay colony began to worry that the witch hunts were out of control.
the governor finally intervened when his own wife was accused of serving the devil.
he disbanded the special court in salem and ordered the remaining suspects released including tituba who had languished in jail for thirteen months.
by then nineteen people including some men married to women who had been convicted had been hanged all justified by the biblical verse that tells believers not to suffer a witch to live a year after it had begun the witchcraft frenzy was finally over.
society and economy in the middle colonies 123 what explains salems mass hysteria.
it may have represented nothing more than theatrical adolescents trying to enliven the dreary routine of everyday life.
some historians have stressed that most of the accused witches were women many of whom had in some way defied the traditional roles assigned to females.
still another interpretation suggests that the accusations may have reflected the panicky atmosphere caused by frequent indian attacks occurring just north of salem along new englands northern frontier.
some of the accusing girls had seen their families killed by indians.
whatever its actual causes the witchcraft controversy also reflected the peculiar social tensions and personal feuds in salem village.
late in 1692 as the hysteria subsided several girls were traveling through nearby ipswich when they encountered an old woman.
a witch they shouted and began writhing as if possessed.
but the people of ipswich showed no interest and the bewitched girls picked themselves up and continued on their way.

mather a prominent boston minister warned his congregation that the devils legions were assaulting new england.
society and economy in the middle colonies both geographically and culturally the middle colonies new york new jersey pennsylvania delaware and maryland stood between new england and the south.
they reflected the diversity of colonial life and foreshadowed the pluralism of the future nation.
an economic mix the middle colonies produced surpluses of foodstuffs for export to the s lave based plantations of the south and the west indies wheat barley oats and other grains flour and livestock.
three great 124 chapter 3 colonial ways of life r ivers the hudson the delaware and the s usquehanna and their tributaries provided access to the backcountry of pennsylvania and new york which opened up a rich fur trade with native americans.
the regions bustling commerce thus rivaled that of new england.
land policies in the middle colonies followed the headright system prevalent in the chesapeake colonies.
in new york the early royal governors continued the dutch device of the patroonship granting to influential men called patroons vast estates on long island and throughout the hudson and mohawk valleys north of new york city.
the patroons controlled large domains farmed by tenants renters who paid fees to use the landlords mills warehouses smokehouses and docks.
with free land available elsewhere however new yorks population languished and the new waves of immigrants sought the promised land of pennsylvania.
an ethnic mix in the makeup of their population the middle colonies differed from both new englands puritan settlements and the biracial plantation colonies to the south.
in new york and new jersey dutch culture and language lingered.
along the delaware river near philadelphia the first settlers swedes and finns were overwhelmed by an influx of europeans.
by the mid eighteenth century the middle colonies were the fastest growing region in north america.
the germans came to america primarily pennsylvania mainly from the rhineland region of europe which had suffered from brutal religious wars that pitted protestants against catholics.
william penns recruiting brochures in german translation circulated throughout central europe and his promise of religious freedom appealed to many persecuted sects especially the mennonites german baptists whose beliefs resembled those of the quakers.
in 1683 a group of mennonites founded germantown near philadelphia.
they represented the first wave of german migrants a large proportion of whom paid their way as indentured servants or redemptioners the large numbers of penniless german immigrants during the eighteenth century alarmed many english colonists.
benjamin franklin worried that the germans will soon.
outnumber us throughout the eighteenth century the scots irish moved still farther out into the pennsylvania backcountry.
scotch irish is the more common but inaccurate name for the scots irish a mostly presbyterian population transplanted from scotland to northern ireland by the english government a century earlier to give catholic ireland a more protestant tone.
land was the great magnet attracting the poor scots irish immigrants.

how were they received.
wwn64 america 10e 26593 03map 02 first proof 126 chapter 3 colonial ways of life were unwilling to be disappointed in most cases the lands they squatted on were claimed by native americans.
in 1741 a group of delaware indians protested to pennsylvania authorities that the s cots irish intruders were taking our land without giving us anything for it if the colonial government did not stop the flow of whites the delawares threatened then they would drive them off the scots irish and the germans became the largest n on english ethnic groups in the colonies.
other ethnic minorities also enriched the population in the middle colonies huguenots french protestants whose religious freedom had been revoked in 1685 forcing many to leave france irish welsh swiss and jews.
new york had inherited from the dutch a tradition of ethnic and religious tolerance which had given the colony a diverse population before the english conquest french speaking walloons a celtic people of southern belgium french germans danes portuguese spaniards italians bohemians poles and others including some new england puritans.
the backcountry pennsylvania became the great distribution point for the different ethnic groups of european origin just as the chesapeake bay region and charleston south carolina became the distribution points for african peoples.
before the mid eighteenth century settlers in the pennsylvania backcountry had trespassed across indian lands and reached the appalachian mountain range.
rather than crossing the steep ridges the scots irish and germans filtered southward down the shenandoah valley of virginia and on into the carolina and georgia backcountry.
germans were the first white settlers in the upper shenandoah valley in southern pennsylvania western maryland and northern virginia and s cots irish filled the lower valley in western virginia and north carolina.
feisty determined and rugged the german and scots irish settlers built cabins and tended farms on indian lands built evangelical churches and established contentious isolated communities along the frontier of settlement.
r ace based slavery the institution of slavery is central to the history of the american colonies.
during the late seventeenth century slavery was legalized in all the colonies but was most prevalent in the south.
white colonists viewed race based slavery as a normal aspect of everyday life in an imperfect world few c onsidered it a moral issue.
they believed that god determined ones station in life slavery race based slavery 127 was therefore not a social evil but a personal misfortune dictated by god.
not until the late eighteenth century did large numbers of white europeans and americans begin to raise ethical questions about slavery.
initially during the seventeenth century many of the first africans in america were treated like indentured servants with a limited term of service after which they gained their freedom.
antonio an african arrived in jamestown during the early 1620s and worked as a servant for fourteen years before gaining his freedom.
he thereafter married an african woman changed his name to anthony johnson and developed a substantial farm of his own along the virginia shore.
until the mid seventeenth century no laws in the colonies specified the meaning and scope of the word slavery gradually however life long slavery for blacks became the c ustom and the l aw of the land.
by the 1660s colonial legislatures had begun to legalize the institution of r ace based slavery with detailed slave codes regulating most aspects of their lives.
the south carolina code for example defined all negroes mulattoes and indians sold into bondage as slaves for life as were the children born of enslaved mothers.
in 1667 the virginia legislature declared that slaves could not serve on juries travel without permission or gather in groups of more than two or three.
some colonies even prohibited owners from freeing their slaves manumission.
the codes allowed owners to punish slaves by whipping them slitting their noses cutting their ankle cords castrating men or killing them.
in 1713 a south carolina planter punished a slave by closing him up in a tiny coffin to die only to have his son slip in a knife so that he could kill himself rather than await suffocation.
color prejudice more than a century before the english arrived in america the portuguese and spanish had established a global trade in enslaved africans in spanish the word negro means black.
while english settlers often enslaved indian captives as had the spanish and portuguese before them the europeans did not enslave other europeans who were captured in warfare.
color was the crucial difference or at least the crucial rationalization used to justify the institution of slavery and its hellish brutalities.
the english associated the color black with darkness and evil.
to them the different appearance behavior and customs of africans and native americans represented savagery and heathenism.
colonial virginians justified slavery by convincing themselves that blacks and indians were naturally lazy treacherous and stupid among other shortcomings.
128 chapter 3 colonial ways of life colonial slavery during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the profitable sugar based economies of the french and british west indies and portuguese brazil had the greatest demand for enslaved africans as sugar became valued almost as much as gold or silver.
by 1675 the island colonies in the caribbean had more than 100 000 slaves while slaves in the american colonies numbered about 5 000.
the profits generated by sugar colonies in the caribbean were greater than all of the commerce in the american mainland colonies.
as tobacco rice and indigo crops became more established in maryland virginia and the carolinas however the number of african slaves in those colonies grew enormously.
at the same time the flow of white indentured servants from britain and europe to america was slowing.
between 1700 and 1709 only 1 500 indentured servants arrived in the american colonies 9 000 enslaved africans arrived during the same period.
until the eighteenth century english immigrants made up 90 percent of the american colonists.
after 1700 the largest number of new arrivals were enslaved africans who totaled more than all european immigrants combined.
the shifting popularity of black slaves over white servants reflected the growing industry of slave trading.
in the late seventeenth century the profitability of african slavery led dozens of new slave trading companies to emerge both in europe and america thus expanding the availability of enslaved africans and lowering the price.
american colonists preferred slaves because they were officially viewed as property with no civil rights and they and their offspring were servants for life not for a fixed number of years.
africans were preferred over enslaved indians because they could not escape easily in a land where they stood out because of their dark skin.
in short african slaves offered a better investment for colonial americans.
the market in slaves once a slave ship arrived at an american port africans in chains not knowing any english would be auctioned to the highest bidder who would cart them off to begin lifelong work for a complete stranger.
they were usually forbidden to use their former languages practice african religions or to sustain their native cultures.
with only rare exceptions slaves were allowed to own nothing.
enslaved africans were used in virtually all aspects of the expanding colonial economy.
the vast majority worked on farms or plantations often performing strenuous labor from dawn to dusk in oppressive heat and humidity.
as jedidiah morse a prominent charleston minister admitted in the late eighteenth century no white man to speak generally ever thinks of settling a farm and improving it for himself without negroes race based slavery 129 during the eighteenth century the demand for slaves soared in the southern colonies.
by 1750 there were almost 250 000 slaves in british america.
the vast majority resided in virginia and maryland about 150 000 compared with 60 000 in south carolina and georgia.
as the number of slaves grew so too did the breadth of their talents and expertise.
over time slaves became skilled artisans blacksmiths carpenters bricklayers.
many enslaved women worked as household servants and midwives.
typically the first wave of enslaved africans lived five years after arriving in america.
eight of the thirty two slaves that john mercer brought to his virginia plantation in the early eighteenth century died in their first year.
slave abuse and resistance colonial laws allowed whites to use brutal means to discipline and control their slaves.
they were whipped branded castrated or sold away often to the caribbean islands where working conditions were even worse.
a 1669 virginia law declared that accidentally killing a slave who was being whipped or beaten was not a serious crime.
during a three year period a south carolina overseer whipped five slaves to death.
william byrd ii a wealthy virginia planter confessed that the unhappy effect of owning many negroes is the necessity of being severe colonial newspapers were sprinkled with notices about runaway slaves.
a georgia slave owner asked readers to be on the lookout for a negro fellow named mingo about 40 years old and his wife quante a sensible wench about 20 with her child a boy about 3 years old all this country born in a few cases slaves organized armed rebellions in which they stole weapons burned and looted plantations and occasionally killed their captors.
in the late summer of 1739 some twenty slaves attacked a store in stono south carolina south of charleston.
led by a slave named jemmy they killed the owner seized weapons and headed south toward freedom in spanish florida gathering more recruits along the way.
within a few days the slaves had roamed over fifteen miles and killed t wenty five whites.
the growing army of slaves marched in military formation waving banners beating drums and freeing more slaves as they moved southward.
then the militia caught up with them.
most of the rebels were killed and in the weeks that followed sixty more were captured by enraged planters who cut off their heads and set them up at every mile post the stono rebellion so frightened white planters that they convinced the colonial assembly to pass the so called negro act of 1740 which called for more oversight of slave activities and harsher punishments for rebellious behavior.
it also reduced the penalty for a white killing a slave to a minor offense and banned slaves from testifying in courts.
130 chapter 3 colonial ways of life slavery in new york city in contrast to the experience of slaves in the southern colonies most slaves in the northern colonies lived in towns or cities and their urban environs gave them more opportunities to move about.
new york city had more slaves than any other american city.
by 1740 it was second only to charleston in the percentage of slaves in its population.
as the number of slaves increased in the congested city racial fears and tensions mounted and occasionally exploded.
in 1712 several dozen slaves revolted they started fires and then used swords axes and guns to kill whites as they attempted to fight the fires.
called out to restore order the militia captured t wenty seven slaves.
six committed suicide and the rest were executed some were burned alive.
new york officials thereafter passed their own black code that strictly regulated slave behavior.
the harsh regulations did not prevent another major racial incident.
in the bitterly cold march of 1741 city dwellers worried about a series of suspicious slavery in new amsterdam 1642 the significance of african slaves to the colonial economy is the focus of this engraving of the dutch colony new amsterdam later known as new york city.
colonial cities 131 fires including one at the governors house.
their worst fear was that the fires were set by slaves.
the negroes are rising shouted terrified whites.
the frantic city council launched an intense investigation to find the villains mary burton a sixteen year old white indentured servant told authorities that slaves and poor whites were plotting to burn the whole town and kill the white men.
the plotters were supposedly led by john hughson a white trafficker in stolen goods who owned the tavern where mary burton worked.
his wife two slaves and a prostitute were charged as c o conspirators.
despite their denials all were convicted and hanged.
within weeks more than half of the adult male slaves in the city were in jail.
what came to be called the conspiracy of 1741 finally ended after seventeen slaves and four whites were hanged thirteen more blacks were burned at the stake while many more were deported.
such organized rebellions were rare however in large part because the likelihood of success was so small and the punishments so severe.
much more common were subtler forms of resistance and accommodation adopted by enslaved africans stealing food breaking tools destroying crops feigning illness etc.
colonial cities throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the american colonies were mostly populated by farmers or farmworkers.
but a handful of cities blossomed into dynamic urban centers of political and social life.
economic opportunity drove most city dwellers.
in new york city for example a visitor said the art of getting money dominated everything the residents did.
colonial cities hugged the coastline or like philadelphia sprang up on rivers large enough to handle oceangoing vessels.
never comprising more than 10 percent of the colonial population the large coastal cities had a disproportionate influence on commerce politics society and culture.
by the end of the colonial period philadelphia with some 30 000 people was the largest city in the colonies and new york city with about 25 000 ranked second.
boston numbered 16 000 charleston south carolina 12 000 and newport rhode island 11 000 the social and political order the urban social elite was dominated by wealthy merchants and property owners served by a middle class of shop owners innkeepers and skilled craftsmen.
almost two thirds of urban male workers were a rtisans people who made their living at 132 chapter 3 colonial ways of life andicrafts.
they included carpenters h and coopers barrel makers shoemakers and tailors silversmiths and blacksmiths sailmakers stonemasons weavers and potters.
at the bottom of the social order were sailors manual laborers servants and slaves.
colonial cities were busy crowded and dangerous.
epidemics such as cholera malaria and yellow fever were common.
the use of open fireplaces for heating caused frequent fires that in turn led to the development of fire companies.
rising crime and violence required increased policing of neighborhoods by sheriffs and local militias.
colonists also were concerned the rapalje children john durand painted the children of a wealthy about the poor and homeless.
the numbrooklyn merchant wearing clothing ber of bostons poor receiving aid from typical of u pper crust urban society.
colonial authorities rose from 500 in 1700 to 4 000 in 1736 in new york city the number rose from 250 in 1698 to 5 000 in the 1770s.
those designated helpless among the destitute poor especially the disabled elderly widows and orphans were often provided money food clothing and fuel.
in some towns poorhouses were built to house the homeless poor and provide them with jobs.
the urban web overland travel in the colonies was initially by horse or by foot.
inns and taverns also called public houses or pubs were especially important since travel at night was treacherous and americans loved to drink.
during the colonial period it was said that when the spanish settled an area they would first build a church the dutch would first erect a fort and the english would first construct a tavern.
in 1690 boston alone had fi fty four taverns half of them operated by women.
colonial taverns and inns were places to eat relax read a newspaper play cards gossip and conduct business.
and of course they were the most popular places to drink alcoholic beverages beer hard cider and rum which became the favored drink.
but ministers and magistrates began to worry that the pubs were promoting drunkenness and social rebelliousness.
not only colonial cities 133 taverns a tobacconists business card from 1770 captures men talking in a philadelphia tavern while they drink ale and smoke pipes.
were poor whites drinking heavily but also indians which one governor told the assembly would have fatal consequences to the government early in the eighteenth century ministers succeeded in passing an anti tavern law in massachusetts bay colony.
called the act against intemperance immorality and profaneness it was directed at taverns that had become nurseries of intemperance it tightened the process of issuing licenses for the sale of liquor eliminated fiddle playing in pubs called for the public posting of the names of common drunkards and banned the sale of rum and brandy the most potent beverages.
after a few years however the law was rarely enforced and the concerns about taverns and drinking continued.
in 1726 a bostonian declared that the abuse of strong drink is becoming epidemical among us and it is very justly supposed.
that the multiplication of taverns has contributed not a little to this excess of riot and debauchery the failed 1712 law was the last legislative effort to restrict alcohol consumption before the revolution.
by the end of the seventeenth century there were more taverns in america than any other business.
indeed taverns became the most important social institution in the c olonies and the most democratic.
they were places where rich and poor often intermingled and by the mid eighteenth century they would become the gathering places for protests against british rule.
134 chapter 3 colonial ways of life ong distance communication was a more complicated matter.
postal serl vice in the seventeenth century was almost nonexistent people gave letters to travelers or sea captains in hopes they would be delivered.
under a parliamentary law of 1710 the postmaster of london named a deputy in charge of the colonies and a postal system eventually encompassed most of the atlantic seaboard providing the colonies with an effective means of communication that would prove crucial in the growing controversy with great britain.
more reliable mail delivery spurred the growing popularity of newspapers.
before 1745 t wenty two newspapers had been started seven in new england ten in the middle colonies and five in the south.
an important landmark in the development of freedom of the press was john peter zengers 1735 trial for publishing criticisms of new yorks royal governor in his newspaper the new york weekly journal.
english common law held that one might be punished for libel or criticism that fostered an ill opinion of the government zengers lawyer claimed that the editor had published the truth.
the jury agreed and found the editor not guilty.
the enlightenment in america the most significant of the new european ideas circulating in eighteenth century america grew out of a burst of innovative intellectual activity known as the enlightenment a profound breakthrough in understanding human society and the natural world.
the enlightenment celebrated rational inquiry scientific research and individual freedom.
enlightened people were those who sought the truth wherever it might lead rather than remain content with believing ideas and dogmas passed down through the ages or taken from the bible.
immanuel kant the e ighteenth century german philosopher summed up the enlightenment point of view by saying dare to know.
have the courage to use your own understanding he and others used the power of reason to analyze the workings of nature and they employed new tools like microscopes and telescopes to engage in close observation scientific experimentation and precise mathematical calculation.
the age of reason the enlightenment often called the age of reason was triggered when the ancient view that the earth was at the center of the universe was challenged by the controversial heliocentric sun centered solar system described in 1533 by nicolaus copernicus a polish astronomer the enlightenment in america 135 and catholic priest.
his theory that the earth orbits the sun was scorned by catholic officials before it was confirmed by other scientists.
in 1687 englishman isaac newton 1642 1727 announced his transformational theory of the earths gravitational pull.
using both scientific experiments and mathematics especially calculus newton challenged biblical notions of the worlds workings by depicting a changing dynamic universe moving in accordance with natural laws that could be grasped by human reason and explained by mathematics.
he implied that natural laws rather than god govern all things from the orbits of the planets to the effects of gravity to the science of human relations politics economics and society.
some enlightened people called deists carried newtons scientific outlook to its logical conclusion claiming that god created the world and designed its natural laws and that these laws governed the operation of the universe.
in other words deists insisted that god planned the universe and set it in motion but no longer interacted directly with the earth and its people.
so the rational god of the deists was nothing like the intervening providential god of the christian tradition to whom believers prayed for daily guidance and direct support.
evil according to the deists resulted not from humanitys inherent sinfulness as outlined in the bible but from human ignorance of the rational laws of nature.
therefore the best way to improve both society and human nature according to deists such as thomas jefferson and benjamin franklin was by cultivating reason which was the highest virtue.
enlightenment thinkers often capitalized both words.
by using education reason and scientific analysis societies were bound to improve their knowledge as well as their quality of life.
faith in human progress was thus one of the most important beliefs of the enlightenment.
equally important was the enlightened notion of political freedom.
both jefferson and franklin were intrigued by the english political philosopher john locke 1632 1704 who maintained that natural law called for a government resting on the consent of the governed and respecting the natural rights of all.
this idea would later influence colonial leaders efforts to justify a revolution.
the american enlightenment benjamin franklin epitomized the enlightenment.
born in boston in 1706 franklin left home at the age of seventeen bound for philadelphia.
six years later he bought a print shop where he edited and published the pennsylvania gazette one of the leading newspapers in the colonies.
when he was t wenty six he published poor 136 chapter 3 colonial ways of life richards almanack a collection of seasonal weather forecasts puzzles household tips and witty sayings.
before he retired from business at the age of forty two franklin had founded a public library started a fire company helped create what became the university of pennsylvania and organized a debating club that grew into the american philosophical society.
franklin was devoted to scientific investigation.
skeptical and curious pragmatic and irreverent he was an inventive genius.
his wide ranging experiments encompassed the fields of medicine meteorology geology astronomy and benjamin franklin a champion of physics among others.
he developed the rational thinking and common sense franklin stove the lightning rod bifobehavior franklin was an inventor cal spectacles and a glass harmonica.
philosopher entrepreneur and statesman.
although raised as a presbyterian franklin became a deist who prized science and reason.
he questioned the divinity of jesus and the assumption that the bible was truly the word of god.
like the european deists franklin came to believe in a god that had created a universe directed by natural laws.
for franklin and others to be enlightened meant developing the confidence and capacity to think for oneself to think critically rather than simply accepting what tradition dictated as truth.
education in the colonies white colonial americans were among the most literate people in the world.
almost 90 percent of men more than in england could read.
for the colonists at large education in the traditional ideas and manners of s ociety even literacy itself remained primarily the responsibility of family and church.
the modern concept of free public education would not be fully embraced until the nineteenth century.
yet colonists were concerned from the beginning that steps needed to be taken to educate their young.
the puritan emphasis on reading scripture which all protestants shared to some degree led to the emphasis on literacy.
in 1647 the massachusetts bay colony required every town to support a grammar school a latin school that could prepare a student for college.
the great awakening 137 the dutch in new netherland were as interested in education as the new england puritans.
in pennsylvania the quakers established private schools.
in the southern colonies however schools were rare.
the wealthiest southern planters and merchants sent their children to england for schooling or hired tutors.
the great awakening the growing popularity of enlightenment rationalism posed a direct threat to traditional religious life in europe and america.
but christianity has always shown remarkable resilience in the face of challenging new ideas.
colonial education a page from the this was certainly true in the early rhymed alphabet of the new england eighteenth century when the ameri primer a popular american textbook can colonies experienced a widespread first published in the 1680s.
revival of spiritual zeal designed to restore the primacy of emotion in the religious realm.
between 1700 and 1750 when the controversial ideas of the enlightenment were circulating among the best educated colonists hundreds of new christian congregations were founded.
most americans 85 percent lived in colonies with an established church meaning that the colonial government officially endorsed and collected taxes to support a single official denomination.
the church of england also known as anglicanism was the established church in virginia maryland delaware and the carolinas.
puritan congregationalism was the official faith in most of new england.
in new york anglicanism vied with the dutch reformed church for control.
pennsylvania had no single s tate supported church but quakers dominated the legislative assembly.
new jersey and rhode island had no official denomination and hosted numerous christian splinter groups.
most colonies organized religious life on the basis of local parishes which defined their theological boundaries and defended them against people who 138 chapter 3 colonial ways of life did not hold to the same faith.
in colonies with official tax supported religions people of other faiths could not preach without the permission of the parish.
in the 1730s and 1740s the parish system was thrown into turmoil by the arrival of outspoken traveling evangelists called itinerants who claimed that most of the local parish ministers were incompetent.
in their emotionally charged sermons the itinerants several of whom were white women and african americans insisted that christians must be reborn in their convictions and behavior.
revivalism during the early 1730s worries about the erosion of religious fervor helped spark a series of emotional revivals known as the great awakening.
the revivals quickly spread up and down the atlantic coast.
every social class ethnic group and region that participated was swept up in the ecstasy of renewed spiritual passion.
in the process the revivals divided congregations towns and families and fueled the growth of new denominations especially the baptists and methodists.
a skeptical benjamin franklin admitted that the awakening was having a profound effect on social life never did the people show so great a willingness to attend sermons.
religion is become the subject of most conversation jonathan jonathan edwards one of the foremost preachers of the great awakening edwards dramatically described the torments that awaited sinners in the afterlife.
edwards in 1734 1735 a remarkable spiritual transformation occurred in the congregation of jonathan edwards a p rominent congregationalist minister in the western massachusetts town of northampton.
one of americas most brilliant philosophers and theologians edwards had entered yale college in 1716 at age thirteen and graduated at the top of his class four years later.
when edwards arrived in northampton in 1727 he was shocked by the towns lack of religious conviction.
he claimed that the young people of northampton were preoccupied with sinful pleasures they indulged in lewd practices that corrupted others the great awakening 139 he warned that christians had become dangerously obsessed with making and spending money and that the new ideas associated with the enlightenment were eroding the importance of religious life.
to counteract the secularizing forces of the enlightenment edwards rushed to restore the emotional side of religion.
our people he said do not so much need to have their heads stored with new scientific knowledge as to have their hearts touched with spiritual intensity edwards was fiery and charismatic.
his vivid descriptions of the sufferings of hell and the delights of heaven helped rekindle spiritual intensity among his congregants.
by 1735 he could report that the town seemed to be full of the presence of god it never was so full of love nor of joy to judge the power of the religious awakening he thought one need only observe that it was no longer the tavern that drew local crowds but the ministers house in 1741 edwards delivered his most famous sermon sinners in the hands of an angry god it was designed in part to frighten people into seeking salvation.
edwards reminded the congregation that hell is real and that god holds you over the pit of hell much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the fire abhors you and is dreadfully provoked.
he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire when he finished he had to wait several minutes for the agitated congregants to quiet down before he led them in a closing hymn.
george whitefield the most celebrated promoter of the great awakening was a young english minister george whitefield whose reputation as a spellbinding evangelist preceded him to the colonies.
congregations were lifeless he claimed because dead men preach to them too many ministers were slothful shepherds and dumb dogs whitefield set out to restore the fires of religious intensity in america.
in the autumn of 1739 the twenty five y ear old evangelist began a fourteen month tour preaching to huge crowds from maine to georgia.
his critics were as fervent as his admirers.
a disgusted george whitefield the english ministers dramatic eloquence roused americans inspiring many to experience a religious rebirth.
140 chapter 3 colonial ways of life bostonian described a revival meetings theatrics the meeting was carried on with.
some screaming out in distress and anguish.
some again jumping up and down.
some lying along on the floor.
the whole with a very great noise to be heard at a miles distance and continued almost the whole night the short thin cross eyed whitefield enthralled audiences with his golden voice flamboyant style and unparalleled eloquence.
his sermons produced electric effects.
even benjamin franklin a confirmed rationalist who went to see whitefield preach in philadelphia was so excited by the fiery sermon that he emptied his pockets into the collection plate.
whitefield urged his listeners to experience a new birth a sudden emotional moment of conversion and salvation.
by the end of his sermon one listener reported the entire congregation was in utmost confusion some crying out some laughing and bliss still roaring to them to come to christ as they answered i will i will im coming im coming radical evangelists edwards and whitefield inspired many imitators the most radical of whom carried emotional evangelism to extremes stirring up women as well as those at the bottom of s ociety laborers seamen servants slaves and landless farm folk and ordaining their own ministers.
william tennent an irish born presbyterian revivalist charged that many local ministers were cold and sapless afraid to thrust the nail of terror into sleeping souls tennents oldest son gilbert also an evangelist defended his aggressive tactics by explaining that he and other traveling preachers invaded parishes only when the local minister showed no interest in the getting of grace and growing in it the tennents urged people to renounce their ministers and pursue salvation on their own.
they also attacked the excesses of the wealthy and powerful.
worried members of the colonial elite charged that the radical revivalists were spreading anarchy levelling and dissolution singing procession in 1740 this equally unsettling to the elite was engraving depicts a characteristic new the reverend james davenport the england singing procession at the most radical of the revivalists who height of the great awakening.
urged christians to renounce ratio the great awakening 141 nalist ministers influenced by the enlightenment and become the agents of their own salvation through a purely emotional conversion experience.
a connecticut minister warned that davenport and other extremists were frightening people out of their senses rather than offering reasonable sermons.
in 1743 in new london connecticut davenport attracted a huge crowd by building a bonfire and encouraging people to burn their fancy clothes and rationalist books.
a few weeks later the unstable davenport reversed himself and called his rantings enthusiastical and delusive women and revivals the great awakenings most controversial element was the emergence of women who defied the biblical ban against women speaking in religious services.
scores of women served as lay exhorters including sarah haggar osborne a rhode island schoolteacher who organized prayer meetings that eventually included men and women black and white.
when concerned ministers told her to stop she refused to shut my mouth and doors and creep into obscurity similarly in western massachusetts bathsheba kingsley stole her husbands horse to spread the gospel among her rural neighbors because she had received immediate revelations from heaven when her husband tried to intervene she pummeled him with hard words and blows praying loudly that he go quick to hell jonathan edwards denounced kingsley as a brawling woman who should keep chiefly at home for all of the turbulence created by the revivals however churches even the more democratic baptist and methodist congregations remained male bastions of political authority.
a changing religious landscape the great awakening made religion intensely personal by creating both a deep sense of spiritual guilt and an intense yearning for redemption.
yet it also undermined many of the established churches by emphasizing that all individuals regardless of wealth or social status could receive gods grace without the guidance of ministers.
denominations became bitterly divided as old light conservatives criticized disruptive and democratic revivalism and sparred with new light evangelicals who delighted in provoking emotional outbursts among their listeners and celebrating individual freedom in matters of faith.
jonathan edwards for one regretted the emergence of warring factions.
we are like two armies he said separated and drawn up in battle array ready to fight one another new england religious life would never be the same as puritanism disintegrated amid the intense warfare over the revivals of the great awakening.
142 chapter 3 colonial ways of life the puritan ideal of religious uniformity was shattered.
the crusty connecticut old light minister isaac stiles denounced the intrusion of choice into spiritual matters and charged that the multitudes were seriously soberly and solemnly out of their wits in their embrace of ultra emotional religion.
john henry goetschius a dutch reformed evangelist shot back that stiles and other old lights were simply determined to impose on many people against their will their old rotten and stinking routine religion in anglican virginia some fifty baptist evangelists were jailed for disturbing the peace during the great awakening.
new england subsequently attracted more and more baptists presbyterians anglicans and other denominations while the revival frenzy scored its most lasting victories along the western frontier of the middle and southern colonies.
in the more sedate churches of boston the principle of rational or enlightened religion gained the upper hand in a reaction against the excesses of revivalistic emotion.
boston ministers such as charles chauncey and jonathan mayhew found puritan theology too cold and forbidding.
to them the calvinist concept that people could be forever damned by predestination was irrational.
they embraced many insights drawn from enlightenment rationalism arguing that god created laws of nature which people could discover and exploit.
religious colleges in reaction to taunts that born again revivalist ministers lacked learning the awakening gave rise to denominational colleges that became the distinctive characteristic of american higher education.
the three colleges already in existence had religious origins harvard college founded in 1636 because the puritans dreaded to leave an illiterate ministry to the church when our present ministers shall lie in the dust the college of william and mary created in 1693 to strengthen the anglican ministry and yale college set up in 1701 to educate the puritans of connecticut who believed that harvard was drifting from the strictest orthodoxy.
the college of new jersey later princeton university was founded by presbyterians in 1746.
in close succession came kings college 1754 in new york later renamed columbia university an anglican institution the college of rhode island 1764 later called brown university which was baptist queens college 1766 later known as rutgers which was dutch reformed and dartmouth college 1769 which was congregationalist and the outgrowth of a school for indians.
the heart versus the head like a ferocious fire that burned intensely before dying out the great awakening subsided by 1750.
the emotional the great awakening 143 awakening like its counterpart the rational enlightenment influenced the forces leading to the revolution against great britain and set in motion powerful currents that still flow in american life.
ministers could no longer control the direction of religious life as more and more people took charge of their own spirituality and new denominations sprouted like mushrooms.
the awakening implanted in american culture the evangelical impulse and the emotional appeal of revivalism weakened the status of the old fashioned clergy and state supported churches and encouraged believers to exercise their own individual judgment.
by encouraging the proliferation of denominations it heightened the need for toleration of dissent.
in some respects however the warring awakening and the enlightenment one stressing the urgings of the spirit and the other celebrating the cold logic of reason led by different roads to similar ends.
both movements spread across the mainland colonies and thereby helped bind them together.
both emphasized the power and right of individual d ecision making and both aroused hopes that america would become the promised land in which people might attain the perfection of piety or reason if not both.
by urging believers to exercise their own spiritual judgment revivals weakened the authority of the established churches and their ministers just as colonial resentment of british economic regulations would later weaken the colonists loyalty to the king.
as such the great awakening and the enlightenment helped nurture a growing commitment to individual freedom and resistance to authority that would play a key role in the rebellion against british tyranny in 1776.
