new ideas new nations guiding question where did the renaissance take place.
for centuries after the roman empire fell in a d 476 the people of western europe were cut off from the rest of the work.
western europe was made up of small kingdoms and city states dominated by the catholic church.
then in the early a d 6 s a new religion islam began to spread rapidly in the middle east and africa.
this rise of islam would soon end western europes isolation.
in 1095 the europeans launched the first of nine expeditions known as the crusades.
their purpose was to take hack control of christian holy sites in the middle east from the muslims followers of islam.
the crusades also had an unplanned result.
in the middle east europeans met arab merchants who sold them spices sugar silk and other goods from china and india.
european interest in asia grew.
that interest grew even more after italian explorer marco polo returned from china.
in the late 1200s polo wrote about asias people great riches and splendid cities in his book truvcls which was widely read in europe.
two hundred years later his travels would inspire another italian explorer christopher columbus.

technology pilgriims classical astrolabe mosque renaissance compass geography connection the growth of trade merchants in europe knew they could make a lot of money selling goods from asia.
wealthy europeans were eager to buy asian spices perfumes silks and precious stones.
merchants first bought these goods from arab traders in the middle east.
the merchants then sent the goods overland by caravan to the mediterranean sea.
from there the goods traveled by ship to italian ports in venice genoa and pisa.
these cities prospered as centers of the growing trade.
however arab traders charged high prices.
this led europeans to look for a route to the east that would not require them to buy from arab merchants.
the growth of ideas by the 1300s several italian city states had become strong economic and cultural centers.
their influence spread across europe.
newly powerful bankers and merchants in pisa venice and genoa studied classical works those of ancient greece and rome.
science was another area in which change occurred.
many scholars tested new and old theories of science.
they performed experiments and evaluated the results.
caravans or groups of travelers from asia carried silks and spices overland to markets in the west.
at the shores ofthe mediterranean and black seas the goods were loaded onto ships and transported to europe.

sometimes you can identify where things are taking place today by using natural features such as bodies of water.
historical maps provide a sense of time and help us to understand which cities and countries existed hundreds of years ago and which still exist today.
lesson 1 79 r the arts were also influenced by classical forms and new ideas.
authors wrote about the individual s place in the universe.
artists studied classical sculpture and architecture.
they admired the harmony and balance in greek art.
the renaissance this period of intellectual and artistic creativity is known as the renaissance reh nuh sahns.
the word renaissance means rebirth in french.
it refers to the rebirth of interest in classical greek and roman ideas.
as the renaissance spread across europe over the next two centuries it changed the way europeans thought about themselves and the world.
it also set the stage for an age of exploration and discovery.
the mona lisa painted by leonardo da vinci is a masterpiece of the renaissance.
from what we know the portrait features a woman from florence who was 24 years old when da vinci began the painting.
reading helpdesk the rise of powerful nations for centuries europe had been a patchwork of small states.
by the 1400s however a new larger type of state had developed in western europe.
strong monarchs rose to power in spain portugal england and france.
they began to establish national laws courts taxes and armies to replace those of the local rulers.
these ambitious monarchs sought ways to increase trade and make their countries even stronger and wealthier.
as early as the mid 1400s powerful countries such as portugal and spain began to search for sea routes to asia.
they too wanted to engage in foreign trade.
this placed them in direct competition with the italian port cities that had become so powerful a century earlier.
as a result a new era of exploration began.
reading progress check drawing conclusions in what way did trade help to bring about the renaissance.
the effects of new technology guidingquestion what technological advancements paved the way for european voyages of exploration.
advances in technology the use of scientific knowledge for practical purposes helped to make european voyages of exploration possible.
in the 1450s the introduction of the printing press made it much easier to print books.
more people had access to books and to new information.
many europeans read marco renaissance a reawakening of culture and intellectual curiosity in europe from the 1300s to the 1600s technology the use of scientific knowledge for practical purposes astrolabe an instrument used to plan a course of travel using the stars compass an instrument that shows the direction of magnetic north academic vocabulary acquire to get possession or control of 80 exploring the americas compass astrolabe aids to navigation quadrant the compass helped sailors tell which direction they were sailing.

polos travels when it appeared in printed form in 1477.
this book gave people descriptions of faraway places such as areas that are now iraq siberia japan india ethiopia and madagascar.
whether the descriptions were entirely accurate is open to debate.
however polos travels led european readers to realize that there were many spectacular sights beyond their immediate world.
better maps and instruments most early maps were not accurate.
this was because they were drawn based on the points of view of traders and travelers.
little by little cartographers or mapmakers improved their accuracy.
using reports of explorers and information from arab and chinese scholars and astronomers mapmakers made more accurate land and sea maps.
these maps showed the directions of ocean currents.
they also showed lines of latitude which measured distances north and south of the equator.
people also improved instruments for navigating the seas.
sailors could find their latitude with an astrolabe as truh layb which measured the positions of stars.
in the 1200s europeans acquired the magnetic compass from china.
the compass allowed sailors to accurately determine their direction.
better ship design advances in ship design allowed sailors to make long ocean voyages.
the stern rudder and triangular sail enabled ships to sail into the wind.
the portuguese three masted caravel keruh vehl became the most famous ship of the european age of exploration.
caravels could sail faster and carry more cargo and supplies than earlier ships.

columbus believed he had arrived in the indies islands located southeast of china.
actually he had reached north america.
how did columbus get it so wrong.
the maps that he and other european explorers used at the time did not include the americas because no one in europe knew they existed.
all maps showed three continents europe asia and africa merged into a huge landmass and bordered by oceans.
some explorers thought that the western atlantic and eastern pacific oceans ran together to form what they called the ocean sea.

portugals rulers wanted to find a new route to china and india.
the portuguese also knew about the great riches in the west african kingdoms.
these riches were carried by caravan across the desert to north africa and then by ship across the mediterranean.
portuguese traders needed a better route so that they too could get west african gold and other riches.

instead he planned the voyages and then analyzed the reports that his crews brought home.
at sagres prince henry set up a school of navigation.
there astronomers geographers and mathematicians came to share their knowledge with portuguese sailors shipbuilders and mapmakers.
as each successful voyage brought back new information henrys expert mapmakers updated the charts.
portuguese ships sailed south along the coast of west africa.
as they went south they traded for gold and ivory and set up trading posts in the region.
because of its abundance of gold africas west coast came to be known as the gold coast in the mid 1400s portuguese traders began to buy enslaved africans there as well.
king john ii of portugal launched new efforts to create a portuguese trading empire in asia.
all the portuguese had to do was find a sea route around africa.

the spanish observed the seafaring and trading successes of neighboring portugal with envy.
they too wanted the riches of asian trade.
king ferdinand and queen isabella of spain agreed to support columbuss expedition for two reasons.
one reason was that columbus promised to bring christianity to any lands he found.
this was important to isabella because she was a devout catholic.
another reason was that if he succeeded in finding a route to asia spain would become wealthy from trade with that region.
queen isabella promised columbus a share of any riches gained from lands he discovered on his way to asia.

columbus was captain of the santa maria his lead ship or flagship.
the three ships carried about 90 sailors and a six month supply of food and water.
the small fleet stopped at the canary islands off the coast of west africa for repairs and supplies.
columbus then began the difficult voyage westward across unknown and mysterious stretches of the atlantic ocean.
after a few weeks at sea the sailors grew nervous about the distance they had traveled.
columbus refused to alter his course.
instead he encouraged the crew by describing the riches he believed they would find.

the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america preamble when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
declaration of natural rights we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
list of grievances such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.
words are spelled as originally written.
the preamble the declaration of independence has four parts.
the preamble explains why the continental congress drew up the declaration.
natural rights the second part the declaration of natural rights lists the rights of the citizens.
it goes on to explain that in a republic people form a government to protect their rights.

he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within.
he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
he has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.
he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislature.
he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.
he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts ofthe world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislature and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.
he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people.
he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands.
he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions.
in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
nor have we been wanting in attention to our british brethren.
we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
