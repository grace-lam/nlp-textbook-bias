58 chapter 3 beginning in the 1670s a decrease in the birthrate in england and an improvement in economic conditions there reduced the pressures on laboring men and women to emigrate and the flow of indentured servants into america declined.
those who did travel to growing reliance on slavery america as indentures now generally avoided the southern colonies where prospects for advancement were slim.
in the chesapeake therefore landowners began to rely much more heavily on african slavery as their principal source of labor.
birth and death immigration remained for a time the greatest source of population growth in the colonies.
but the most important long range factor in the increase of the colonial population was its ability to reproduce itself.
improvement in the reproduction rate began in new england and the mid atlantic colonies in the second half of the seventeenth century.
after the 1650s natural increase became the most important source of population growth in those factors in population growth areas.
the new england population more than quadrupled through reproduction alone in the second half of the seventeenth century.
this rise was a result not only of families having large numbers of children.
it was also because life expectancy in new england was unusually high.
conditions improved much more slowly in the south.
the high death rates in the chesapeake region did not begin to decline to levels found elsewhere until the mideighteenth century.
throughout the seventeenth century the average life expectancy for european men in the region was just over forty years and for women slightly less.
one in four white children died in infancy and half died before the age of twenty.
children who survived infancy often lost one or both of their parents before reaching maturity.
widows widowers and orphans thus formed a substantial proportion of the white chesapeake population.
only after settlers developed immunity to local diseases particularly malaria did life expectancy increase significantly.
population growth was substantial in the region but it was largely a result of immigration.
the natural increases in the population in the seventeenth century reflected a steady improvement in the balance between men and women in the colonies.
in the early years toward a balanced sex ratio of settlement more than three quarters of the white population of the chesapeake consisted of men.
and even in new england which from the beginning had attracted more families and thus more women than the southern colonies 60 percent of the inhabitants were male in 1650.
gradually however more women began to arrive in the colonies and increasing birthrates contributed to shifting the sex ratio the balance between men and women as well.
throughout the colonial period the population almost doubled every twenty five years.
by 1775 the non indian population of the colonies was over 2 million.
medicine in the colonies there were very high death rates of women who bore children in the colonial era.
physicians had little or no understanding of infection and sterilization.
as a result many women and babies died from infections contracted during childbirth or surgery.
unaware of bacteria many communities were plagued with infectious diseases transmitted by garbage or unclean water.
because of the limited extent of medical knowledge and the lack of regulations for any practitioners at the time it was relatively easy for people to practice medicine even society and culture in provincial america 59 without any professional training.
the biggest beneficiaries of this were women who established themselves in considerable numbers as midwives.
midwives midwifery assisted women in childbirth but they also dispensed other medical advice.
they were popular because they were usually friends and neighbors of the people they treated unlike physicians who were few and therefore not often well known to their patients.
male doctors felt threatened by the midwives and struggled continually to drive them from the field although they did not make substantial progress in doing so until the nineteenth century.
midwives and doctors alike practiced medicine on the basis of the prevailing assumptions of their time most of them derived from the theory of humoralism humoralism popularized by the famous second century roman physician galen.
galen argued that the human body was governed by four humors that were lodged in four bodily fluids yellow bile or choler black bile melancholy blood and phlegm.
in a healthy body the four humors existed in balance.
illness represented an imbalance and suggested the need for removing from the body the excesses of whatever fluid was causing the imbalance.
that was the rationale that lay behind the principal medical techniques of the seventeenth century purging expulsion and bleeding.
bleeding was practiced mostly by male physicians.
midwives favored pukes and laxatives.
the great majority of early americans however had little contact with physicians or even midwives and sought instead to deal with illness on their own.
the assumption that treating illness was the exclusive province of trained professionals so much a part of the twentieth century and beyond lay far in the distance in the colonial era.
that seventeenth century medicine rested so much on ideas produced 1 400 years before is evidence of how little support there was for the scientific method in england and america at the time.
bleeding for example had been in use for hundreds of years during which time there had been no evidence at all that it helped people recover from illness indeed there was considerable evidence that bleeding could do great harm.
but what would seem in later eras to be the simple process of testing scientific assumptions was not yet a common part of western thought.
that was one reason that the birth of the enlightenment in the late seventeenth century with its faith in human reason and its belief in the capacity of individuals and societies to create better lives was important not just to politics but also to science.
women and families in the colonies because there were many more men than women in seventeenth century america few women remained unmarried for long.
the average european woman in america married for the first time at twenty or twenty one years of age.
because of the large early marriages numbers of indentured servants who were forbidden to marry until their terms of service expired premarital sexual relationships were not uncommon.
children born out of wedlock to indentured women were often taken from their mothers at a young age and were themselves bound as indentured servants.
women in the chesapeake could anticipate a life consumed with childbearing.
the average wife experienced pregnancies every two years.
those who lived long enough bore an average of eight children apiece up to five of whom typically died in infancy or early childhood.
since childbirth was one of the most frequent causes of female death many women did not survive to see their children grow to maturity.
those who did however were often widowed since they were usually much younger than their husbands.
60 chapter 3 life in the american colonies this colored engraving shows the domestic life of americans during the eighteenth century.
depicted are family members at work in their cozy surroundings.
the industriousness they show was a virtue of the era.
bettmann corbis in new england where many more immigrants arrived with family members and where death rates declined more quickly family structure was much more stable than in the chesapeake.
the sex ratio was more balanced than in the chesapeake so most men could expect to marry.
as in the chesapeake women married young began producing children early and continued to do so well into their thirties.
in contrast to their southern counterparts however northern children were more likely to survive and their families were more likely to remain intact.
fewer new england women became widows and those who did generally lost their husbands later in life.
the longer life span in new england meant that parents continued to control their children longer than did parents in the south.
few sons and daughters could choose a spouse entirely independently of their parents wishes.
men tended to rely on their fathers for land to cultivate.
women needed dowries from their parents if they were to attract desirable husbands.
stricter parental supervision of children meant too that fewer women became pregnant before marriage than was the case in the south.
puritanism placed a high value on the family and the position of wife and mother was highly valued in puritan culture.
at the same time however puritanism reinforced the idea of nearly absolute male authority.
a wife was expected to devote herself almost entirely to serving the needs of her husband and the family economy.
new england and chesapeake families compared the beginnings of slavery in english america the demand for african servants to supplement the scarce southern labor force existed almost from the first moments of settlement.
for a time however black workers were hard to find.
not until the mid seventeenth century when a substantial commerce in slaves society and culture in provincial america 61 grew up between the caribbean islands and the southern colonies did black workers become generally available in north america.
just how slavery actually took root and spread has been a source of endless debate among historians.
see debating the past the origins of slavery the demand for slaves in north america helped expand the transatlantic slave trade.
and as slave trading grew more extensive and more sophisticated it also the slave trade grew more horrible.
before it ended in the nineteenth century it was responsible for the forced immigration of as many as 11 million africans to north and south america and the caribbean.
in the flourishing slave marts on the african coast native chieftains brought captured members of rival tribes to the ports.
the terrified victims were then packed into the dark filthy holds of ships for the horrors of the middle passage the long journey to the americas during which the prisoners were usually kept chained in the bowels of the slave ships and supplied with only minimal food and water.
many slave traders tried to cram as many africans as possible into their ships to ensure that enough would survive to yield a profit at journeys end.
those who died en route and many did were simply thrown overboard.
upon arrival in the new world slaves were auctioned off to white landowners and transported frightened and bewildered to their new homes.
north america was a less important direct destination for african slaves than were such other parts of the new world as the caribbean islands and brazil fewer than 5 percent of the africans imported to the americas arrived first in the english colonies.
through most of the seventeenth century those blacks who were transported to what became the united states came not directly from africa but from the west indies.
not until the 1670s did traders start importing blacks directly from africa to north america.
even then the flow remained small for a time mainly because a single group the royal african company of england monopolized the trade and kept prices high and supplies low.
a turning point in the history of the black population in north america was 1697 the year rival traders broke the royal african companys monopoly.
with the trade now open to competition prices fell and the number of africans greatly increased.
in 1700 about 25 000 african slaves lived in english north america.
because african americans were so heavily concentrated in a few southern colonies they were already beginning to outnumber whites in some areas.
there were perhaps twice as many black men as black women in most areas but in some places the african american population grew by natural increase nevertheless.
by 1760 the number of africans in the english mainland colonies had increased to surging slave population approximately a quarter of a million the vast majority of whom lived in the south.
by then blacks had almost wholly replaced white indentured servants as the basis of the southern workforce.
for a time the legal and social status of the african laborers remained somewhat fluid.
in some areas white and black laborers worked together on terms of relative equality.
some blacks were treated much like white hired servants and some were freed after a fixed term of servitude.
by the late seventeenth century however a rigid distinction emerged between blacks and whites.
gradually the assumption emergence of a race based system spread that blacks would remain in service permanently and that black children would inherit their parents bondage.
white beliefs about the inferiority of africans reinforced the growing rigidity of the system but so did the economic advantages of the system to white slaveowners.
debating the past the origins of slavery the debate among historians over how and why white americans created a system of slave labor in the seventeenth century and how and why only african americans should be slaves has been an unusually lively one.
at its center is a debate over whether slavery was a result of white racism or whether racism was a result of slavery.
in 1950 oscar and mary handlin published an influential article comparing slavery to other systems of unfreedom in the colonies.
what separated slavery from other conditions of servitude they argued was that it was restricted to people of african descent that it was permanent and that it passed from one generation to the next.
the unique characteristics of slavery the handlins argued were part of an effort by colonial legislatures to increase the available labor force.
white laborers needed an incentive to come to america black laborers forcibly imported from africa did not.
the distinction between the conditions of white workers and the conditions of black workers was therefore based on legal and economic motives not on racism.
winthrop jordan was one of a number of historians who later challenged the handlins thesis and argued that white racism more than economic interests produced african slavery.
in white over black 1968 and other works jordan argued that europeans had long viewed people of color as inferior beings.
those attitudes migrated with white europeans to the new world and white racism shaped the treatment of africans in america from the beginning.
even without the economic incentives the handlins described in other words whites would have been likely to oppress blacks in the new world.
peter woods black majority 1974 a study of seventeenth century south carolina 62 was one of a number of works that moved the debate back toward social and economic conditions.
wood demonstrated that blacks and whites often worked together on relatively equal terms in the early years of settlement.
but as rice cultivation expanded it became more difficult to find white laborers willing to do the arduous work.
the increase in the forcible importation of african slaves was a response to this growing demand for labor.
it was also a response to fears among whites that without slavery it would be difficult to control a labor force brought to america against its will.
edmund morgans american slavery american freedom 1975 argued similarly that the southern labor system was at first relatively flexible and later grew more rigid.
in colonial virginia he claimed white settlers did not at first intend to create a system of permanent bondage.
but as the tobacco economy grew and created a high demand for cheap labor white landowners began to feel uneasy about their reliance on a large group of dependent white workers.
such workers were difficult to recruit and control.
slavery therefore was less a result of racism than of the desire for whites to find a reliable and stable labor force.
robin blackburns the making of new world slavery 1996 argues particularly strenuously that while race was a factor in making the enslavement of africans easier for whites to justify to themselves the real reasons for the emergence of slavery were hardheaded economic decisions by ambitious entrepreneurs who realized very early that a slave labor system in the labor intensive agricultural world of the american south and the caribbean was more profitable than a free labor system.
slavery served the interests of a powerful combination of groups planters merchants industrialists and consumers.
the most important reason for the creation and continuation of the system therefore was not racism but the pursuit of profit.
slavery was not blackburn concludes an antiquated remnant of an older world.
it was a recognizably modern labor system that served the needs of an emerging market economy.

what do historians say is the relation ship between racism and slavery.
what are the economic arguments put forward by historians to explain the system of slave labor that developed in america.
do these arguments account fully for the development of slavery.
the system of permanent servitude american slavery became legal in the early eighteenth century when colonial assemblies began to pass slave codes granting white masters almost absolute authority over their slaves.
only one factor determined whether a person was subject to the slave codes color.
in the colonial societies of spanish america people of mixed race were granted a different and higher status than pure africans.
english america recognized no such distinctions.

as this map reveals english settlers dominated most of the regions of north america.
but note the large areas of german settlement in the western chesapeake and pennsylvania the swath of dutch settlement in new york and new jersey the scotch irish regions in the western regions of the south and the large areas in which enslaved africans were becoming the majority of the population.
what aspects of the history of these colonies help explain their ethnic composition.
society and culture in provincial america 65 changing sources of european immigration the most distinctive and enduring feature of the american population was that it brought together peoples of many different races ethnic groups and nationalities.
north america was home to a highly diverse population.
the british colonies were the home to native americans english immigrants forcibly imported africans and a wide range of other european groups.
among the earliest european immigrants were about 300 000 french calvinists known as huguenots.
the edict of nantes of 1598 had assured them freedom of religion in france.
but in 1685 the edict was revoked driving many huguenot refugees huguenots to north america.
germany had similar laws banning protestantism driving many germans to america where they settled in pennsylvania.
they came to be known as the pennsylvania dutch a corruption of the german term for their nationality deutsch.
frequent wars in europe drove many other immigrants to the american colonies.
the most numerous of the newcomers were the so called scotch irish scotch presbyterians who had settled in northern ireland in the province of ulster in the early s eventeenth scotch irish century.
most of the scotch irish in america pushed out to the western edges of european settlement and occupied land without much regard for who actually claimed to own it.
there were also immigrants from scotland itself and from southern ireland.
the irish migrated steadily over a long period.
some abandoned their roman catholic religion and much of their ethnic identity after they arrived in america.
the colonial economies farming hunting and fishing dominated almost all areas of european and african settlement in north america throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
even so the economies of the different regions varied markedly.
the southern economy a strong european demand for tobacco enabled some planters in the chesapeake maryland and virginia to become enormously wealthy and at times allowed the region as a whole to prosper.
but throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth boom and bust tobacco economy centuries production of tobacco frequently exceeded demand and as a result the price of the crop sometimes suffered severe declines.
the result was a boom and bust cycle in the chesapeake economy with the first major bust occurring in 1640.
south carolina and georgia relied on rice production since the low lying coastline with its many tidal rivers made it possible to create rice paddies that could be flooded and drained.
rice cultivation was so difficult and unhealthy that white laborers generally refused to perform it.
hence planters in south carolina and georgia were much more dependent on slaves than were their northern counterparts.
african workers were adept at rice cultivation in part because some of them had come from rice producing regions of west africa and in part because they were generally more accustomed to the hot humid climate than were europeans.
they also had a greater natural immunity to malaria.
but the work was arduous and debilitating for them nevertheless.
because of their dependence on large scale cash crops the southern colonies developed less of a commercial or industrial economy than the colonies of the north.
the trading in tobacco and rice was handled largely by merchants based in london and later in the northern colonies.

londons virginia tobacco label northern economic and technological life in the north as in the south agriculture continued to dominate but it was agriculture of a more diverse kind.
in northern new england colder weather and hard rocky soil made it difficult for colonists to develop the kind of large scale commercial farming system that southerners were creating.
conditions for agriculture were better in southern new england and the middle colonies where the soil was fertile and the weather more temperate.
new york pennsylvania and the connecticut river valley were the chief suppliers of wheat to much of new england and to parts of the south.
even there however a substantial commercial economy emerged alongside the agricultural one.
almost every colonist engaged in a certain amount of industry at home.
occasionally these home industries provided families with surplus goods they could trade or sell.
colonial artisans and entrepreneurs beyond these domestic efforts craftsmen and artisans established themselves in colonial towns as cobblers blacksmiths riflemakers cabinetmakers silversmiths and printers.
in some areas entrepreneurs harnessed water power to run small mills for grinding grain processing cloth or milling lumber.
and in several coastal areas large scale shipbuilding operations began to flourish.
the first effort to establish a significant metals industry in the colonies was an ironsaugus ironworks works established in saugus massachusetts in the 1640s.
the saugus ironworks used water power to drive a bellows which controlled the heat in a charcoal society and culture in provincial america 67 furnace.
the carbon from the burning charcoal helped remove the oxygen from the ore and thus reduced its melting temperature.
as the ore melted it trickled down into molds or was taken in the form of simple sow bars to a nearby forge to be shaped into iron objects such as pots and anvils.
there was also a mill suitable for turning the sow bars into narrow rods that blacksmiths could cut into nails.
the saugus ironworks was a technological success but a financial failure.
it began operations in 1646 in 1668 its financial problems forced it to close its doors.
metalworks however gradually became an important part of the colonial economy.
the largest industrial enterprise anywhere in english north america was the ironworks of the german ironmaster peter hasenclever in northern new jersey.
founded in 1764 with british capital it employed several hundred laborers.
there were other smaller ironmaking enterprises in every northern colony and there were ironworks as well in several of the southern colonies.
even so these and other growing industries did not immediately become the basis for the kind of explosive industrial growth that great britain experienced in the late eighteenth century in part because english parliamentary regulations such as the iron act of 1750 restricted metal processing in the colonies.
similar prohibitions limited the manufacture of woolens hats and other goods.
but the biggest obstacles to industrialization in america were an inadequate labor supply a small domestic market and inadequate transportation facilities and energy supplies.
more important than manufacturing were industries that exploited the natural resources of the continent.
by the mid seventeenth century the flourishing fur trade of earlier years was in decline.
taking its place were lumbering mining and fishing.
these industries provided commodities that could be exported to england in exchange for manufactured goods.
and they helped produce the most distinctive feature of the northern economy a thriving commercial class.
the extent and limits of technology despite the technological progress that was occurring in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries much of colonial society was conspicuously lacking in even very basic technological capacities.
up to half the farmers in the colonies did not even own a plow.
substantial numbers of households lacked pots and kettles for persistent colonial poverty cooking.
and only about half the households in the colonies owned guns or rifles.
the relatively low levels of ownership of these and other elementary tools was not because such things were difficult to make but because most americans remained too poor or too isolated to be able to obtain them.
many households had few if any candles because they were unable to afford candle molds or tallow wax or because they had no access to commercially produced candles.
in the early eighteenth century very few farmers owned wagons.
most made do with two wheeled carts which were inefficient for transporting crops to market.
the most commonly owned tool on american farms was the axe.
few colonists were self sufficient in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
a popular image of early american households is of people who grew their own food made their own clothes and bought little from anyone else.
in fact relatively few colonial families owned spinning wheels or looms which suggests that most myth of colonial self sufficiency people purchased whatever yarn and cloth they needed.
most farmers who grew grain took it to centralized facilities for processing.
in general people who lived in isolated or poor areas owned fewer tools and had less access to advanced technologies than did those in more populous or affluent areas.
68 chapter 3 the rise of colonial commerce perhaps the most remarkable feature of colonial commerce was that it was able to survive at all.
american merchants faced such bewildering obstacles and lacked so many of the basic institutions of trade that they managed to stay afloat only with great difficulty and through considerable ingenuity.
the colonies had almost no gold or silver and their paper currency was not acceptable as payment for goods from abroad.
for many years colonial merchants had to rely on barter or on money substitutes such as beaver skins.
a second obstacle was lack of information about the supply and demand of goods and services.
traders had no way of knowing what they would find in foreign ports vessels sometimes stayed at sea for years journeying from one port to another trading one commodity for another attempting to find some way to turn a profit.
there was also an enormous number of small fiercely competitive companies which made the problem of organizing the system of commerce even more acute.

a simple explanation of this trade is that the american colonies exported raw materials agricultural products furs and others to britain and europe and imported manufactured goods in return.
while that explanation is accurate it is not complete largely because the atlantic trade was not a simple exchange between america and europe but a complex network of exchanges involving the caribbean africa and the mediterranean.
note the important exchanges between the north american mainland and the caribbean islands the important trade between the american colonies and africa and the wide range of european and mediterranean markets in which americans were active.
not shown on this map but also very important to colonial commerce was a large coastal trade among the various regions of british north america.
why did the major ports of trade emerge almost entirely in the northern colonies.
society and culture in provincial america 69 nevertheless commerce in the colonies survived and grew.
there was elaborate trade among the colonies themselves and with the west indies.
the mainland colonies offered their caribbean trading partners rum agricultural products meat and fish.
the islands offered sugar molasses and at times slaves in return.
there was also trade with england continental europe and the west coast of africa.
this commerce has often been described somewhat inaccurately as the triangular trade suggesting a neat process by which merchants carried rum and other goods from new england to africa exchanged their merchandise for slaves whom they then transported to the west indies hence the term middle passage for the dreaded journey it was the second of the three legs of the voyage and then exchanged the slaves for sugar and molasses which they shipped back to new england to be distilled into rum.
in reality the so called triangular trade in rum slaves and sugar was a complicated maze of highly diverse trade routes.
out of this risky trade emerged a group of adventurous entrepreneurs who by the mid eighteenth century were beginning to constitute a distinct merchant class.
the british navigation acts protected them from foreign competition in the colonies.
they had an emerging merchant class ready access to the market in england for such colonial products as furs timber and american built ships.
but they also developed markets illegally outside the british empire in the french spanish and dutch west indies where they could often get higher prices for their goods than in the british colonies.
the rise of consumerism as affluent residents of the colonies grew in number the growing prosperity and commercialism of british america created both new appetites and new opportunities to satisfy them.
the result was a growing preoccupation with the consumption of material goods.
the growth of eighteenth century consumerism increased the class divisions in the american colonies.
as the difference between the upper and lower classes became more glaring people of means became more intent on demonstrating reasons for growing consumerism their own membership in the upper ranks of society.
the ability to purchase and display consumer goods was an important way of doing so particularly for wealthy people in cities and towns who did not have large estates to boast their success.
but the growth of consumerism was also a product of the early stages of the industrial revolution.
although there was relatively little industry in america in the eighteenth century england and europe were making rapid advances and producing more and more affordable goods for affluent americans to buy.
to facilitate the new consumer appetites merchants and traders began advertising their goods in journals and newspapers.
agents of urban merchants the ancestors of the traveling salesman fanned out through the countryside attempting to interest wealthy landowners and planters in the luxury goods now available to them.
george and martha washington for example spent considerable time and money ordering elegant furnishings for their home at mount vernon goods that were shipped to them mostly from england and europe.
one feature of a consumer society is that things that once were considered luxuries quickly come to be seen as necessities once they are readily available.
in the colonies items that became commonplace after having once been expensive luxuries included tea household linens glassware manufactured cutlery crockery furniture and many other things.
another result of consumerism is the association of material goods of the quality of a persons home and possessions and clothing for example with virtue and refinement the ideal of the cultivated gentleman and the gracious lady became 70 chapter 3 increasingly powerful throughout the colonies in the eighteenth century.
in part that meant striving to become educated and refined in speech and behavior.
americans read books new social ideals of refinement on manners and fashion.
they bought magazines about london society.
and they strove to develop themselves as witty and educated conversationalists.
they also commissioned portraits of themselves and their families devoted large portions of their homes to entertainment built shelves and cases in which they could display fashionable possessions constructed formal gardens and lavished attention on their wardrobes and hairstyles.
patterns of society although there were sharp social distinctions in the colonies the well defined and deeply entrenched class system of england failed to reproduce itself in america.
aristocracies emerged to be sure but they tended to rely less on landownership than on control of a substantial workforce and they were generally less secure and less powerful than their english counterparts.
more than in england white people in america faced opportunities social mobility for social mobility both up and down.
there were also new forms of community in america and they varied greatly from one region to another.
masters and slaves on the plantation the plantation system of the american south produced one form of community.
the first plantations emerged in the tobacco growing areas of virginia and maryland.
some of the early planters became established aristocrats with vast estates.
on the whole however realities of plantation life seventeenth century colonial plantations were rough and relatively small.
in the early days in virginia they were little more than crude clearings where landowners and indentured servants worked side by side in conditions so harsh that death was an everyday occurrence.
most landowners lived in rough cabins or houses with their servants or slaves nearby.
the economy of the plantation was precarious.
planters could not control their markets so even the largest plantations were constantly at risk.
when prices fell planters faced the prospect of ruin.
the plantation economy created many new wealthy landowners but it also destroyed many.
the enslaved african americans of course lived very differently.
on the smaller farms with only a handful of slaves it was not always possible for a rigid separation to develop between whites and blacks.
but by the early eighteenth century over three fourths of all slave communities slaves lived on plantations of at least ten slaves and nearly one half lived in communities of fifty slaves or more.
in those settings they were able to develop a society and culture of their own.
although whites seldom encouraged formal marriages among slaves many blacks themselves developed strong and elaborate family structures.
there was also a distinctive slave religion which blended christianity with african folklore and sacred practices that became a central element in the emergence of an independent black culture.
nevertheless black society was subject to constant intrusions from and interaction with white society.
black house servants for example were isolated from their own community.
black women were often subject to unwanted sexual advances from owners and overseers and hence to bearing mulatto children who were rarely recognized by their white fathers.
on some plantations black workers were treated with kindness and society and culture in provincial america 71 ie new york e er lak pe n n s y lva n i a new york city philadelphia new jersey baltimore m a r yl an delaware d virginia williamsburg norfolk n o r t h ca r o l i n a new bern wilmington south ca r o l i n a atla nti c ocea n charles town georgia percent of population that was black per county colony in 1775 savannah 61 to 71 51 to 60 31 to 50 100 mi 11 to 30 0 1 to 10 200 km african population as a proportion of total population ca.
1775 this map illustrates the parts of the colonies in which slaves made up a large proportion of the population in some areas a majority.
the slave population was smallest in the western regions of the southern colonies and in the area north of the chesapeake although there remained a significant african population in parts of new jersey and new york some slave some free.
what explains the dense concentration of slaves in certain areas.
responded to their owners with genuine devotion.
on others they encountered physical brutality and occasionally even sadism against which they were virtually powerless.
slaves often resisted their masters in large ways and small.
the most serious example in the colonial period was the stono rebellion in south carolina in 1739 stono rebellion during which about 100 slaves rose up seized weapons killed several whites and attempted 72 chapter 3 to escape south to florida.
the uprising was quickly crushed and most participants were executed.
a more frequent form of resistance was simply running away but that provided no real solution either.
for most there was nowhere to go.
resistance more often took the form of subtle and often undetected defiance or evasion of their masters wishes.
most slaves male and female worked as field hands.
but on the larger plantations that aspired to genuine self sufficiency some slaves learned trades and crafts blacksmithing carpentry shoemaking spinning weaving sewing midwifery and others.
these skilled craftspeople were at times hired out to other planters.
some set up their own establishments in towns or cities and shared their profits with their owners.
a few were able to buy their freedom.
the puritan community the characteristic social unit in new england was not the isolated farm or the large plantation but the town.
in the early years of colonization each new settlement drew up a covenant binding all residents tightly together both religiously and socially.
colonists laid out a village with houses and a meetinghouse arranged around a shared pasture or common thus families generally lived with their neighbors close by.

society and culture in provincial america 73 once a town was established residents held a yearly town meeting to decide important questions and to choose a group of selectmen who ran the towns puritan democracy affairs.
participation in the meeting was generally restricted to adult males who were members of the church.
only those who could give evidence of being among the elect assured of salvation the visible saints were admitted to full church membership although other residents of the town were required to attend church services.
new englanders did not adopt the english system of primogeniture the passing of all property to the firstborn son.
instead a father divided up his land among all his sons.
his control of this inheritance gave him great power over the family.
often a son would reach his late twenties before his father would allow him to move into his own household and work his own land.
even then sons would usually continue to live in close proximity to their fathers.
the early puritan community was a tightly knit organism.
but as the years passed and the communities grew strains and tensions began to affect this communal structure.
this was partly due to the increasing commercialization of new england society.
it was also partly due to population growth.
in the first generations fathers generally controlled enough land to satisfy the needs of all their sons.
after several generations however there was often too little to go around particularly in communities surrounded by other towns with no room to expand outward.
the result was that in many communities groups of younger residents broke off and moved elsewhere to form towns of their own.
the tensions building in puritan communities could produce bizarre and disastrous events.
one example was the widespread hysteria in the 1680s and 1690s over accusations of witchcraft the human exercise of satanic powers in new england.
the most famous outbreak was in salem massachusetts where adolescent girls leveled salem witchcraft trials charges of witchcraft against several west indian servants steeped in voodoo belief and practice.
it would be difficult to overstate how the trials captured public attention.
see debating the past the witchcraft trials hysteria spread throughout the town and hundreds of people most of them women were accused of witchcraft.
nineteen residents of salem were put to death before the trials finally ended in 1692 the girls who had been the original accusers later recanted and admitted that their story had been fabricated.
the salem experience was not unique.
accusations of witchcraft spread through many new england towns in the early 1690s and centered mostly on women.
research into the background of accused witches reveals that most were middle aged women often widowed with few or no children.
many accused witches were of low social position were often involved in domestic conflicts had frequently been accused of other crimes and were considered abrasive by their neighbors.
others were women who through inheritance or hard work had come into possession of substantial property of their own and thus challenged the gender norms of the community.
the witchcraft controversies were a reflection of the highly religious character of new england societies.
new englanders believed in the power of satan.
belief in witchcraft was not a marginal superstition rejected by the mainstream.
it was a common feature of puritan religious conviction.
cities in the 1770s the two largest colonial ports philadelphia and new york had populations of 28 000 and 25 000 respectively which made them larger than most english urban centers of their time.
boston 16 000 charles town later charleston south carolina debating the past the witchcraft trials the witchcraft trials of the 1690s which began in salem massachusetts and spread to other areas of new england have been the stuff of popular legend for centuries.
they have also engaged the interest of generations of historians who have tried to explain why these seventeenth century americans became so committed to the belief that some of their own neighbors were agents of satan.
although there have been many explanations of the witchcraft phenomenon some of the most important in recent decades have focused on the central place of women in the story.
through the first half of the twentieth century most historians dismissed the witchcraft trials as hysteria prompted by the intolerance and rigidity of puritan society.
this interpretation informed the most prominent popular portrayal of witchcraft in the twentieth century arthur millers play the crucible first produced in 1953 which was clearly an effort to use the salem trials as a comment on the great anticommunist frenzy of his own era.
but at almost the same time perry miller the renowned scholar of puritanism argued in a series of important studies that belief in witchcraft was not a product of hysteria or intolerance but a widely shared part of the religious worldview of the seventeenth century.
to the puritans witchcraft seemed not only plausible but scientifically rational.
a new wave of interpretation of witchcraft began in the 1970s with the publication of salem possessed 1976 by paul boyer and stephen nissenbaum.
their examination of the town records of salem in the 1690s led them to conclude that the witchcraft controversy was a product of 74 class tensions between the poorer more marginal residents of one part of salem and the wealthier more privileged residents of another.
these social tensions which could not find easy expression on their own terms led some poorer salemites to lash out at their richer neighbors by charging them or their servants with witchcraft.
a few years later john demos in entertaining satan 1983 examined witchcraft accusations in a larger area of new england and similarly portrayed them as products of displaced anger about social and economic grievances that could not be expressed otherwise.
demos provided a far more complex picture of the nature of these grievances than had boyer and nissenbaum but like them he saw witchcraft as a symptom of a persistent set of social and psychological tensions.
at about the same time however a number of scholars were beginning to look at witchcraft through the scholarly lens of gender.
carol karlsens the devil in the shape of a woman 1987 demonstrated through intensive scrutiny of records across new england that a disproportionate number of those accused of witchcraft were propertyowning widows or unmarried women in other words women who did not fit comfortably into the normal pattern of maledominated families.
karlsen concluded that such women were vulnerable to these accusations because they seemed threatening to people including many women who were accustomed to women as subordinate members of the community.
more recently mary beth nortons in the devils snare 2002 placed the witchcraft trials in the context of other events of their time and in particular the terrifying upheavals and dislocations that the indian wars of the late seventeenth century created in puritan communities.
in the face of this crisis in which refugees from king williams war were fleeing towns destroyed by the indians and flooding salem and other eastern towns fear and social instability grew.
the witchcraft trials helped create a greater than normal readiness to connect aberrant behavior such as the actions of unusually independent or eccentric women to supernatural causes.
the result was a wave of witchcraft accusations that ultimately led to the execution of at least twenty people.

how did the salem witchcraft trials r eflect attitudes toward women and the status of women in colonial new england.
why were colonial new englanders willing to believe accusations of witchcraft about their fellow colonists.
12 000 and newport rhode island 11 000 were also substantial communities by the standards of the day.
colonial cities served as trading centers for the farmers of their regions and as marts for international commerce.
cities were the centers of what industry existed in the colonies.
they were the locations of the most advanced schools and sophisticated cultural activities and of shops where imported goods could be bought.
in addition they were communities with urban social problems crime vice pollution traffic.
unlike smaller towns cities needed to set up constables offices and fire departments and develop systems for supporting the urban poor whose numbers became especially large in times of economic crisis.
finally cities were places where new ideas could circulate and be discussed.
there were newspapers books and other publications from abroad and hence new intellectual influences.
the taverns and coffeehouses of cities provided forums taverns and coffeehouses in which people could gather and debate the issues of the day.
that is one reason why the revolutionary crisis when it began to build in the 1760s and 1770s originated in the cities.
inequality new england for all its belief in community and liberty was far from an egalitarian society.
some must be rich and some poor john winthrop wrote in the early seventeenth century and his prediction perhaps exceeded his expectations.
wealthy families and socially distinguished ones who were usually the same people had privileges and rights that were not available to poorer citizens.
elites were called ladies and gentlemen while people in the lower levels of society were known as goodman or goodwife the elite were given the best seats in their churches and had the greatest influence over the parish.
men had more power than women.
servants had few rights.
the church itself taught that inequality reflected gods intention.
in cities such economic stratification was significant although unlike in later eras the rich were the largest sector of the population and in boston in the eighteenth century the majority.
that was so partly because wealthy people were most likely to move to cities and participate in commerce.
in the agricultural countryside differences in wealth were less extreme.
75 76 chapter 3 awakenings and enlightenments intellectual life in colonial america revolved around the conflict between the traditional emphasis on a personal god deeply involved in individual lives and the new spirit of the enlightenment which stressed the importance of science and human reason.
the old views placed a high value on a stern moral code in which intellect was less important than faith.
the enlightenment suggested that people had substantial control over their own lives and societies.
the pattern of religions religious toleration flourished in america to a degree unmatched in any european nation.
settlers in america brought with them so many different religious practices that it proved impossible to impose a single religious code on any large area.
the church of england was established as the official faith in virginia maryland new york the carolinas and georgia.
except in virginia and maryland however the laws establishing the church of england as the official colonial religion were largely ignored.
even in new england where the puritans had originally believed that they were all part of a single faith there was a growing tendency in the eighteenth century for different congregations to affiliate with different denominations.
in parts of new york and new jersey dutch settlers had established their own calvinist denomination dutch reformed.
numerous sects american baptists developed a great variety of sects and shared the belief that rebaptism usually by total immersion was necessary when believers reached maturity.
but while some baptists remained calvinists believers in predestination others came to believe in salvation by free will.
protestants extended toleration to one another more readily than they did to roman catholics.
new englanders in particular viewed their catholic neighbors in new france canada not only as commercial and military rivals but also as dangerous agents of rome.
rights of catholics in most of the english colonies however roman catholics were too few to cause serious conflict.
they were most numerous in maryland where they numbered 3 000.
perhaps for that reason they suffered the most persecution in that colony.
after the overthrow of the original proprietors in 1691 catholics in maryland not only lost their political rights but also were forbidden to hold religious services except in private houses.
jews in provincial america totaled no more than about 2 000 at any time.
the largest community lived in new york city.
smaller groups settled in newport and rights of jews charles town and there were scattered jewish families in all the colonies.
nowhere could they vote or hold office.
only in rhode island could they practice their religion openly.
by the beginning of the eighteenth century some americans were growing troubled by the apparent decline in religious piety in their society.
the movement of the population westward and the wide scattering of settlements had caused many communities to lose touch with organized religion.
the rise of commercial prosperity created a more secular outlook in urban areas.
the progress of science and free thought caused at least some colonists to doubt traditional religious beliefs.
concerns about weakening piety surfaced as early as the 1660s in new england where the puritan oligarchy warned of a decline in the power of the church.
ministers preached sermons of despair known as jeremiads deploring the signs of waning society and culture in provincial america 77 piety.
by the standards of other societies or other eras the puritan faith remained remarkably strong.
but to new englanders the declension of religious piety seemed a serious problem.
the great awakening by the early eighteenth century similar concerns about declining piety were emerging in other regions and among members of other faiths.
the result was the first great american revival the great awakening.
the great awakening began in earnest in the 1730s and reached its climax in the 1740s.
the revival had particular appeal to women the majority of converts and to younger sons of the third or fourth generation of settlers those who stood to inherit the least land and who faced the most uncertain futures.
the rhetoric of the revival emphasized the potential for every person to break away from the constraints of the past and start anew in his or her relationship with god.
such beliefs reflected in part the desires of many people to break away from their families or communities and start a new life.
powerful evangelists from england helped spread the revival.
john and charles wesley the founders of methodism visited georgia and other colonies in the 1730s.
george whitefield a powerful open air preacher from england made several evangelizing tours through the colonies and drew tremendous crowds.
but the wesleys whitefield and edwards outstanding preacher of the great awakening was the new england congregationalist jonathan edwards.
from his pulpit in northampton massachusetts edwards attacked the new doctrines of easy salvation for all.
he preached anew the traditional puritan ideas of the absolute sovereignty of god predestination and salvation by gods grace alone.
his vivid descriptions of hell could terrify his listeners.
the great awakening led to the division of existing congregations between new light revivalists and old light traditionalists and to the new lights and old lights founding of new ones.
it also affected areas of society outside the churches.
some of the revivalists denounced book learning as a hindrance to salvation.
but other evangelists saw education as a means of furthering religion and they founded or led schools for the training of new light ministers.
the enlightenment the great awakening caused one great cultural upheaval in the colonies.
the enlightenment caused another very different one.
the enlightenment was the product of scientific and intellectual discoveries in europe in the seventeenth century discoveries that revealed the natural laws that regulated the workings of nature.
the new scientific natural law knowledge encouraged many thinkers to begin celebrating the power of human reason and to argue that rational thought not just religious faith could create progress and advance knowledge in the world.
in celebrating reason the enlightenment encouraged men and women to look to themselves and their own intellect not just to god for guidance as to how to live their lives and shape their societies.
it helped produce a growing interest in education and a heightened concern with politics and government.
in the early seventeenth century enlightenment ideas in america were largely borrowed from europe from such thinkers as francis bacon and john locke of england 78 chapter 3 baruch spinoza of amsterdam and ren descartes of france.
later however such americans as benjamin franklin thomas paine thomas jefferson and james madison made their own important contributions to enlightenment thought.
literacy and technology white male americans achieved a high degree of literacy in the eighteenth century.
by the time of the revolution well over one half of all white men could read and write.
the literacy rate for women lagged behind the rate for men until the nineteenth century.
while opportunities for education beyond the primary level were scarce for men they were almost nonexistent for women.
the large number of colonists who could read created a market for the first widely circulated publications in america other than the bible almanacs.
by 1700 there were almanacs dozens perhaps hundreds of almanacs circulating throughout the colonies and even in the sparsely settled lands to the west.
most families had at least one.
almanacs provided medical advice navigational and agricultural information practical wisdom humor and predictions about the future most famously predictions about weather patterns for the coming year which many farmers used as the basis for decisions about crops even though the predictions were notoriously unreliable.
the most famous almanac in eighteenth century america was poor richards almanac published by benjamin franklin in philadelphia.
among their many purposes almanacs sought to help farmers predict weather and plan for the demands of changing seasons.
this illustration part of a calendar of farming images shows a man and a woman tending fields in july.
american antiquarian society guide to the seasons society and culture in provincial america 79 the wide availability of reading material in colonial america by the eighteenth century was a result of the spread of printing technology.
the first printing press began operating in the colonies in 1639 and by 1695 there were more towns in america with printers than there were in england.
at first many of these presses did not get very much use.
over time however the rising literacy of the society created a demand for books pamphlets and almanacs that the presses rushed to fill.
the first newspaper in the colonies publick occurrences was published first newspaper in boston in 1690 using a relatively advanced printing facility.
it was the first step toward what would eventually become a large newspaper industry.
one reason the stamp act of 1765 which imposed a tax on printed materials created such a furor was that printing technology had by then become central to colonial life.
education even before enlightenment ideas penetrated america colonists placed a high value on formal education.
some families tried to teach their children to read and write at home although the heavy burden of work in most agricultural households limited the time available for schooling.
in massachusetts a 1647 law required that every town support a school and a modest network of public schools emerged as a result.
the public schools quakers and other sects operated church schools and in some communities widows or unmarried women conducted dame schools in their homes.
in cities some master craftsmen set up evening schools for their apprentices.
african americans had virtually no access to education.
occasionally a master or mistress would teach slave children to read and write but as the slave system became more firmly entrenched strong social and ultimately legal sanctions developed to discourage such efforts.
indians too remained largely outside the white educational system to a large degree by choice.
some white missionaries and philanthropists established schools for native americans and helped create a small population of indians literate in spoken and written english.
harvard the first american college was established in 1636 by puritan theologians who wanted to create a training center for ministers.
the college was named for a charlestown massachusetts minister john harvard who had left it his library and onehalf of his estate.
in 1693 william and mary college named for the english king and queen was established in williamsburg virginia by anglicans.
and in 1701 first colleges conservative congregationalists dissatisfied with the growing religious liberalism of harvard founded yale named for one of its first benefactors elihu yale in new haven connecticut.
out of the great awakening emerged the college of new jersey founded in 1746 and known later as princeton after the town in which it was located one of its first presidents was jonathan edwards.
despite the religious basis of these colleges most of them offered curricula that included not only theology but also logic ethics physics geometry astronomy rhetoric latin hebrew and greek.
kings college founded in new york city in 1754 and later renamed columbia was specifically devoted to the spread of secular knowledge.
the academy and college of philadelphia founded in 1755 and later renamed the university of pennsylvania was also a secular institution established by a group of laymen under the inspiration of benjamin franklin.
after 1700 most colonial leaders received their entire education in america rather than attending university in england as had once been the case.
but higher education remained available only to a few relatively affluent white men.
80 chapter 3 the spread of science the clearest indication of the spreading influence of the enlightenment in america was an increasing interest in scientific knowledge.
most of the early colleges established chairs in the natural sciences and introduced some of the advanced scientific theories of europe including copernican astronomy and newtonian physics to their students.
but the most vigorous promotion of science in these years occurred through the private efforts of amateurs scientific societies and the activities of scientific societies.
leading merchants planters and even theologians became corresponding members of the royal society of london the leading english scientific organization.
benjamin franklin won international fame through his experiments with electricity.
particularly notable was his 1747 theory and his 1752 demonstration using a kite that lightning and electricity were the same.
previously most scientists had believed that there were several distinct types of electricity.
his research on the way in which electricity could be grounded led to the development of the lightning rod which greatly reduced fires and other damage to buildings during thunderstorms.
the high value that influential americans were beginning to place on scientific knowledge was clearly demonstrated by the most daring and controversial scientific experiment of the eighteenth century inoculation against smallpox.
the puritan theologian cotton cotton mather and vaccines mather had learned of experiments in england by which people had been deliberately infected with mild cases of smallpox to immunize them against the deadly disease.
despite strong opposition he urged inoculation on his fellow bostonians during an epidemic in the 1720s.
the results confirmed the effectiveness of the technique.
other theologians took up the cause along with many physicians.
by the mid eighteenth century inoculation had become a common medical procedure in america.
concepts of law and politics in law and politics as in other parts of their lives americans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries believed that they were re creating in the new world the practices and institutions of the old world.
but as in other areas they created something very different.
although the american legal system adopted most of the essential elements of the english system including such ancient rights as trial by jury significant differences developed in court procedures punishments and the definition of crimes.
in england for example a printed attack on a public official whether true or false was considered john peter zenger libelous.
at the 1734 1735 trial of the new york publisher john peter zenger the courts ruled that criticisms of the government were not libelous if factually true a verdict that removed some colonial restrictions on the freedom of the press.
more significant for the future relationship between the colonies and england were differences emerging between the american and british political systems.
because the royal government was so far away americans created a group of institutions of their own that gave them a large measure of self government.
in most colonies local communities grew accustomed to running their own affairs with minimal interference from higher authorities.
the colonial assemblies came to exercise many of the powers that parliament exercised in england.
provincial governors appointed by the king after the 1690s had broad powers on paper but their actual influence was limited.
the result of all this was that the provincial governments became accustomed to acting more or less independently of parliament and a set of assumptions and expectations about the rights of the colonists took hold in america that was not shared by policymakers in england.
society and culture in provincial america 81 american communities prescribed a wide range of punishments for misconduct and crime.
among the more common punishments were public humiliations placing offenders in stocks forcing them to wear badges of shame or as in this woodcut binding them into a ducking stool and immersing them in water.
fotosearch getty images colonial punishment these differences caused few problems before the 1760s because the british did little to exert the authority they believed they possessed.
but when beginning in 1763 the english government began attempting to tighten its control over the american colonies a great imperial crisis resulted.
conclusion between the 1650s and the 1750s the english colonies in america grew steadily in population in the size of their economies and in the sophistication and diversity of their cultures.
although most white americans in the 1750s still believed that they were fully a part of the british empire they were in fact living in a world that had become very different from that of england.
many distinct societies developed in the colonies but the greatest distinction was between the colonies of the north and those of the south.
in the north society was dominated by relatively small family farms and by towns and cities of growing size.
a thriving commercial class was developing and with it an increasingly elaborate urban culture.
in the south there were many family farms as well.
but there were also large plantations cultivating tobacco rice indigo a plant used to make a dark blue dye and cotton for export.
by the late seventeenth century these plantations were relying heavily on african workers who had been brought to the colonies forcibly as slaves.
there were few significant towns and cities in the south and little commerce other than the marketing of crops.
82 chapter 3 the colonies did however have much in common.
most white americans accepted common assumptions about racial inequality.
that enabled them to tolerate the enslavement of african men and women and to justify a campaign of displacement and often violence against native americans.
most white americans and in different ways most nonwhite americans as well were deeply religious.
the great awakening therefore had a powerful impact throughout the colonies.
and most white colonists shared a belief in certain basic principles of law and politics which they considered embedded in the english constitution.
their interpretation of that constitution however was becoming increasingly different from that of the parliament in england and was laying the groundwork for future conflict.

what policies did parliament implement with regard to the colonies in the 1760s and 1770s and why did britain adopt these policies.
how did the colonists respond to parliaments actions.
as late as the 1750s few americans objected to their membership in the british empire.
the imperial system provided many benefits to the americans and for the most part the english government left the colonies alone.
by the mid 1770s however the relationship between the american colonies and their british rulers had become so strained that the empire was on the verge of unraveling.
and in the spring of 1775 the first shots were fired in a war that would ultimately win america its independence.
how had it happened.
and why so quickly.
loosening ties in one sense it had not happened quickly at all.
ever since the first days of english settlement the ideas and institutions of the colonies had been diverging from those in britain.
in another sense however the revolutionary crisis emerged in response to relatively sudden changes in the administration of the empire.
in 1763 the english government began to enforce a series of colonial policies that brought the differences between the two societies into sharp focus.

under kings george i 1714 1727 and george ii 1727 1760 the prime minister and his cabinet became the nations real executives.
because they depended politically on the great merchants and landholders of england they were less inclined than the seventeenth century monarchs had been to try to tighten control over the empire which many merchants feared would disrupt the profitable commerce with the colonies.
as a result administration of the colonies remained loose decentralized and inefficient.
the character of royal officials in america contributed further to the looseness of the imperial system.
few governors were able men.
many perhaps most had used bribery to obtain their offices and continued to accept bribes once in office.
some appointees remained in england and hired substitutes to take their places in america.
the colonial assemblies taking advantage of the weak imperial administration had asserted their own authority to levy taxes make appropriations approve appointments and pass laws.
the assemblies came to look upon themselves as little parliaments each practically as sovereign within its colony as parliament itself was in england.
the colonies divided even so the colonists continued to think of themselves as loyal english subjects.
many felt stronger ties to england than they did to the other american colonies.
although the colonies had slowly learned to cooperate with one another on such practical matters as intercolonial trade road construction and a colonial postal service they remained reluctant to cooperate in larger ways even when in 1754 they faced a common threat from their old rivals the french and the empire in transition 85 frances indian allies.
delegates from pennsylvania maryland new york and new england met in albany in that year to negotiate a treaty with the iroquois.
they albany plan tentatively approved a proposal by benjamin franklin to set up a general government to manage relations with the indians.
war with the french and indians was already beginning when the albany plan was presented to the colonial assemblies.
none approved it.
the struggle for the continent the war that raged in north america through the late 1750s and early 1760s was part of a larger struggle between england and france.
the british victory in that struggle known in europe as the seven years war confirmed englands commercial supremacy and cemented its control of the settled regions of north america.
in america the conflict which colonists called the french and indian war was also the final stage in a long struggle among the three principal powers in northeastern north america the english the french and the iroquois.
new france and the iroquois nation by the end of the seventeenth century the french empire in america was vast the whole length of the mississippi river and its delta named louisiana after their king and the continental interior as far west as the rocky mountains and as far frances colonial empire south as the rio grande.
france claimed in effect the entire interior of the continent.
to secure their hold on these enormous claims they founded a string of widely separated communities fortresses missions and trading posts.
would be feudal lords established large estates seigneuries along the banks of the st lawrence river.
on a high bluff above the river stood the fortified city of quebec.
montreal to the south and sault sainte marie and detroit to the west marked the northern boundaries of french settlement.
on the lower mississippi there were plantations much like those in the southern colonies of english america worked by african slaves and owned by creoles people of european ancestry born in the americas.
new orleans founded in 1718 to service the french plantation economy was soon as big as some of the larger cities of the atlantic seaboard biloxi and mobile to the east completed the string of french settlement.
both the french and the english were aware that the battle for control of north america would be determined in part by who could best win the allegiance of native tribes.
the english with their more advanced commercial economy could usually offer the indians better and more plentiful goods.
but the french offered tolerance.
unlike the english the french settlers in the interior generally adjusted their own behavior to indian patterns.
french fur traders frequently married indian women and adopted tribal ways jesuit missionaries interacted comfortably with the natives and converted them to catholicism by the thousands without challenging most of their social customs.
by the mid eighteenth century therefore the french had better and closer relations with most of the indians of the interior than did the english.
the most powerful native group however had remained aloof from both sides.
the iroquois confederacy five indian nations mohawk seneca the iroquois confederacy cayuga onondaga and oneida that had formed a defensive alliance in the fifteenth century had been the most powerful native presence in the ohio valley since the 1640s.
