additional measures followed in 1660 and 1663.
englands new economic policy mercantilism rested on the idea that england should enjoy the profits arising from the english empire.
according to the navigation laws certain enumerated goods essentially how did the english empire in america expand in the mid seventeenth century.
the most valuable colonial products such as tobacco and sugar had to be transported in english ships and sold initially in english ports although they could then be re exported to foreign markets.
similarly most european goods imported into the colonies had to be shipped through england where customs duties were paid.
this enabled english merchants manufacturers shipbuilders and sailors to reap the benefits of colonial trade and the government to enjoy added income from taxes.
as members of the empire american colonies would profit as well since their ships were considered english.
indeed the navigation acts stimulated the rise of new englands shipbuilding industry.
the conquest of new netherland the restoration of the english monarchy when charles ii assumed the throne in 1660 sparked a new period of colonial expansion.
the government chartered new trading ventures notably the royal african company which was given a monopoly of the slave trade.
within a generation the number of english colonies in north america doubled.
first to come under english control was new netherland seized in 1664 during an anglodutch war that also saw england gain control of dutch trading posts in africa.
king charles ii awarded the colony to his younger brother james the duke of york with full and absolute power to govern as he pleased.
hence the colonys name became new york.
new netherland always remained peripheral to the far flung dutch empire.
the dutch fought to retain their holdings in africa asia and south america but they surrendered new netherland in 1664 without a fight.
english rule transformed this minor military base into an important imperial outpost a seaport trading with the caribbean and europe and a launching pad for military operations against the french.
new yorks european population around 9 000 when the english assumed control rose to 20 000 by 1685.
new york and englishmen the and rights of englishwomen english rule expanded the freedom of some new yorkers while reducing that of others.
the terms of surrender guaranteed that the english would respect the religious toleration and property holdings of the colonys many ethnic communities.
but english law ended the dutch tradition by which married women conducted business in their own name and inherited some of the property acquired during marriage.
as colonists of dutch origin adapted to english rule their wills directed more attention to advancing the fortunes of their sons than providing for their wives and daughters.
there had been many female traders in new amsterdam often widows who had inherited a deceased husbands property but few remained by the end of the seventeenth century.
the english also introduced more restrictive attitudes toward blacks.
in colonial new york city as in new amsterdam those residents who enjoyed the status of freeman obtained by birth in the city or by an act of local authorities enjoyed special privileges compared to others including the right to work in various trades.
but the english in a reversal of dutch practice expelled free blacks from many skilled jobs.

note the prevalence of wampum belts in the image in the foreground and in the hand and at the feet of the central figure.
wampum was used to certify treaties and other transactions.
global competition and the expansion of englands empire others benefited enormously from english rule.
the duke of york and his appointed governors continued the dutch practice of awarding immense land grants to favorites including 160 000 acres to robert livingston and 90 000 to frederick philipse.
by 1700 nearly 2 million acres of land were owned by only five new york families who intermarried regularly exerted considerable political influence and formed one of colonial americas most tightly knit landed elites.
new york and the indians initially english rule also strengthened the position of the iroquois confederacy of upstate new york.
after a complex series of negotiations in the mid 1670s sir edmund andros who had been appointed governor of new york after fighting the french in the caribbean formed an alliance known as the covenant chain in which the imperial ambitions of the english and indians reinforced one another.
the five later six iroquois nations assisted andros in clearing parts of new york of rival tribes and helped the british in attacks on the french and their indian allies.
andros for his part recognized the iroquois claim to authority over indian communities in the vast area stretching to the ohio river.
but beginning in the 1680s indians around the great lakes and ohio valley regrouped and with french aid attacked the iroquois pushing them to the east.
by the end of the century the iroquois nations adopted a policy of careful neutrality seeking to play the european empires off one another while continuing to profit from the fur trade.
the charter of liberties many colonists meanwhile began to complain that they were being denied the liberties of englishmen especially the right to consent to taxation.
how did the english empire in america expand in the mid seventeenth century.
there had been no representative assembly under the dutch and the governors appointed by the duke of york at first ruled without one.
discontent was especially strong on long island which had been largely settled by new englanders used to self government.
in 1683 the duke agreed to call an elected assembly whose first act was to draft a charter of liberties and privileges.
the charter required that elections be held every three years among male property owners and the freemen of new york city it also reaffirmed traditional english rights such as trial by jury and security of property as well as religious toleration for all protestants.
in part the charter reflected an effort by newer english colonists to assert dominance over older dutch settlers by establishing the principle that the liberties to which new yorkers were entitled were those enjoyed by englishmen at home.
the founding of carolina for more than three decades after the establishment of maryland in 1634 no new english settlement was planted in north america.
then in 1663 charles ii awarded to eight proprietors the right to establish a colony to the north of florida as a barrier to spanish expansion.
not until 1670 did the first settlers arrive to found carolina.
in its early years carolina was the colony of a colony it began as an offshoot of the tiny island of barbados.
in the mid seventeenth century barbados was the caribbeans richest plantation economy but a shortage of available land led wealthy planters to seek opportunities in carolina for their sons.
at first carolinians armed friendly indians employing them on raids into spanish florida and enslaved others shipping them to other mainland colonies and the west indies.
indeed between 1670 and 1720 the number of indian slaves exported from charleston was larger than the number of african slaves imported.
in 1715 the yamasee and creek alarmed by the enormous debts they had incurred in trade with the settlers and by slave traders raids into their territory rebelled.
the uprising was crushed and most of the remaining indians were enslaved or driven out of the colony into spanish florida from where they occasionally launched raids against english settlements.
the fundamental constitutions of carolina issued by the proprietors in 1669 proposed to establish a feudal society with a hereditary nobility with strange titles like landgraves and caciques serfs and slaves.
needing to attract settlers quickly however the proprietors also provided for an elected assembly and religious toleration by now recognized as essential to enticing migrants to north america.
they also instituted a generous headright system offering 150 acres for each member of an arriving family in the case of indentured servants of course the land went to the employer and 100 acres to male servants who completed their terms.
none of the baronies envisioned in the fundamental constitutions was actually established.
slavery not feudalism made carolina an extremely hierarchical society.
the proprietors instituted a rigorous legal code that promised slaveowners absolute power and authority over their human property and included imported slaves in the headright system.
this allowed any persons who settled in carolina and brought with them slaves including planters from barbados who resettled in the colony instantly to c h.

in its early days however the economy centered on cattle raising and trade with local indians not agriculture.
carolina grew slowly until planters discovered the staple rice that would make them the wealthiest elite in english north america and their colony an epicenter of mainland slavery.
the an early eighteenth century engraving depicts william penn welcoming a german immigrant on the dock in philadelphia.
penn sought to make migrants from all over europe feel at home in pennsylvania.
h o ly experiment the last english colony to be established in the seventeenth century was pennsylvania.
the proprietor william penn envisioned it as a place where those facing religious persecution in europe could enjoy spiritual freedom and colonists and indians would coexist in harmony.
penns late father had been a supporter and creditor of charles ii.
to cancel his debt to the penn family and bolster the english presence in north america the king in 1681 granted penn a vast tract of land south and west of new york as well as the old swedish dutch colony that became delaware.
a devout member of the society of friends or quakers penn was particularly concerned with establishing a refuge for his coreligionists who faced increasing persecution in england.
he had already assisted a group of english quakers in purchasing half of what became the colony of new jersey from lord john berkeley who had received a land grant from the duke of york.
penn was largely responsible for the frame of government announced in 1677 the west jersey concessions one of the most liberal of the era.
based on quaker ideals it created an elected assembly with a broad suffrage and established religious liberty.
penn hoped that west jersey would become a society of small farmers not large landowners.
quaker liberty like the puritans penn considered his colony a holy experiment but of a different kind a free colony for all mankind that should go hither he hoped that pennsylvania could be governed according to quaker principles among them the equality of all persons including women blacks and indians before god and the primacy of the individual conscience.
to quakers liberty was a universal entitlement not the possession of any single people a position that would eventually make them the first group of whites to repudiate slavery.
penn also treated indians with a consideration almost unique in the colonial experience arranging to purchase land before reselling it to colonists and offering refuge to tribes driven out of other colonies by warfare.
sometimes he even purchased the same land twice when more than one indian tribe claimed it.
since quakers were pacifists who came to america unarmed and did not even organize a militia until the 1740s peace with the native population was essential.
penns chain of friendship appealed to the local indians promising protection from rival tribes who claimed domination over them.
religious freedom was penns most fundamental principle.
he condemned attempts to enforce religious uniformity for how did the english empire in america expand in the mid seventeenth century.
depriving thousands of free inhabitants of england of the right to worship as they desired.
his charter of liberty approved by the assembly in 1682 offered christian liberty to all who affirmed a belief in god and did not use their freedom to promote licentiousness there was no established church in pennsylvania and attendance at religious services was entirely voluntary although jews were barred from office by a required oath affirming belief in the divinity of jesus christ.
at the same time the quakers upheld a strict code of personal morality.
penns frame of government prohibited swearing drunkenness and adultery as well as popular entertainments of the era such as revels bull baiting and cockfighting private religious belief may not have been enforced by the government but moral public behavior certainly was.
not religious uniformity but a virtuous citizenry would be the foundation of penns social order.
land in p e n n s y lva n i a given the power to determine the colonys form of government penn established an appointed council to originate legislation and an assembly elected by male taxpayers and freemen owners of 100 acres of land for free immigrants and 50 acres for former indentured servants.
these rules made a majority of the male population eligible to vote.
penn owned all the colonys land and sold it to settlers at low prices rather than granting it outright.
like other proprietors he expected to turn a profit and like most of them he never really did.
but if penn did not prosper pennsylvania did.
a majority of the early settlers were quakers from the british isles.
but pennsylvanias religious toleration healthy climate and inexpensive land along with penns aggressive efforts to publicize the colonys advantages soon attracted immigrants from all over western europe.
ironically the freedoms pennsylvania offered to european immigrants contributed to the deterioration of freedom for others.
the colonys successful efforts to attract settlers would eventually come into conflict with penns benevolent indian policy.
and the opening of pennsylvania led to an immediate decline in the number of indentured servants choosing to sail for virginia and maryland a development that did much to shift those colonies toward reliance on slave labor.
origins of american slavery no european nation including england embarked on the colonization of the new world with the intention of relying on african slaves for the bulk of its labor force.
but the incessant demand for workers spurred by the spread of tobacco cultivation eventually led chesapeake planters to turn to the transatlantic trade in slaves.
compared with indentured servants slaves offered planters many advantages.
as africans they could not claim the protections of english common law.
slaves terms of service never expired and they therefore did not become a population of unruly landless men.

it illustrates the prominent place of women in quaker gatherings.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 origins of american slavery children were slaves and their skin color made it more difficult for them to escape into the surrounding society.
african men moreover unlike their native american counterparts were accustomed to intensive agricultural labor and they had encountered many diseases known in europe and developed resistance to them so were less likely to succumb to epidemics.
englishmen and africans the english had long viewed alien peoples with disdain including the irish native americans and africans.
they described these strangers in remarkably similar language as savage pagan and uncivilized often comparing them to animals.
race the idea that humanity is divided into welldefined groups associated with skin color is a modern concept that had not fully developed in the seventeenth century.
nor had racism an ideology based on the belief that some races are inherently superior to others and entitled to rule over them.
the main lines of division within humanity were thought to be civilization versus barbarism or christianity versus heathenism not color or race.
nonetheless anti black stereotypes flourished in seventeenth century england.
africans were seen as so alien in color religion and social practices that they were enslavable in a way that poor englishmen were not.
most english also deemed indians to be uncivilized.
but the indian population declined so rapidly and it was so easy for indians familiar with the countryside to run away that indian slavery never became viable.
some indians were sold into slavery in the caribbean.
but it is difficult to enslave a people on their native soil.
slaves are almost always outsiders transported from elsewhere to their place of labor.
slavery in history slavery has existed for nearly the entire span of human history.
it was central to the societies of ancient greece and rome.
slavery survived for centuries in northern europe after the collapse of the roman empire.
germans vikings and anglo saxons all held slaves.
slavery persisted even longer in the mediterranean world where a slave trade in slavic peoples survived into the fifteenth century.
the english word slavery derives from slav pirates from the barbary coast of north africa regularly seized christians from ships and enslaved them.
in west africa as noted in chapter 1 slavery and a slave trade predated the coming of europeans and small scale slavery existed among native americans.
but slavery in nearly all these instances differed greatly from the institution that developed in the new world.
in the americas slavery was based on the plantation an agricultural enterprise that brought together large numbers of workers under the control of a single owner.
this imbalance magnified the possibility of slave resistance and made it necessary to police the system rigidly.
it encouraged the creation of a sharp boundary between slavery and freedom.
labor on slave plantations was far more demanding than in the household slavery common in africa and the death rate among slaves much higher.
in the new world slavery would come to be associated with race a concept that drew a permanent line between whites and blacks.
unlike in africa slaves who became free always carried with them in their skin color the mark of h o w w a s s l a v e r y e s t a b l i s h e d i n t h e we s t e r n a t l a n t i c w o r l d.
bondage a visible sign of being considered unworthy of incorporation as equals into free society.
slavery in the west indies a sense of africans as alien and inferior made their enslavement by the english possible.
but prejudice by itself did not create north american slavery.
for this institution to take root planters and government authorities had to be convinced that importing african slaves was the best way to solve their persistent shortage of labor.
during the seventeenth century the shipping of slaves from africa to the new world became a major international business.
but only a relative handful were brought to englands mainland colonies.
by the time plantation slavery became a major feature of life in english north america it was already well entrenched elsewhere in the western hemisphere.
by 1600 huge sugar plantations worked by slaves from africa had made their appearance in brazil a colony of portugal.
in the seventeenth century england holland denmark and france joined spain as owners of west indian islands.
english emigrants to the west indies outnumbered those to north america in the first part of the seventeenth century.
in 1650 the english population of the west indies exceeded that in all of north america.
generally the first settlers established mixed economies with small farms worked by white indentured servants.
but as sugar planters engrossed the best land they forced white farmers off island after island.
white indentured servants proved as discontented as elsewhere.
in 1629 when a spanish expedition attacked the british island of nevis servants in the local militia joined them shouting liberty joyful liberty with the indian population having been wiped out by disease and with the white indentured servants unwilling to do the back breaking monotonous work of sugar cultivation the massive importation of slaves cutting sugar cane an engraving from ten views in antigua published in 1823.
male and female slaves harvest and load the sugar crop while an overseer on horseback addresses a slave.
during the eighteenth century sugar was the chief crop produced by western hemisphere slaves.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 origins of american slavery an engraving from charles de rocheforts histoire naturelle et morale des les antilles de lamerique 1665 depicts a sugar mill powered by cattle with slaves feeding the cane into rollers which grind it to crush out the juice.
the text describes how the various parts of the machinery work.
from africa began.
in 1645 for example barbados a tiny island owned by england was home to around 11 000 white farmers and indentured servants and 5 000 slaves.
as sugar cultivation intensified planters turned increasingly to slave labor.
by 1660 the islands population had grown to 40 000 half european and half african.
ten years later the slave population had risen to 82 000 concentrated on some 750 sugar plantations.
meanwhile the white population stagnated.
by the end of the seventeenth century huge sugar plantations manned by hundreds of slaves dominated the west indian economy and on most of the islands the african population far outnumbered that of european origin.
sugar was the first crop to be mass marketed to consumers in europe.
before its emergence international trade consisted largely of precious metals like gold and silver and luxury goods aimed at an elite market like the spices and silks imported from asia.
sugar was by far the most important product of the british french and portugese empires and new world sugar plantations produced immense profits for planters merchants and imperial governments.
saint domingue todays haiti was the jewel of the french empire.
in 1660 barbados generated more trade than all the other english colonies combined.
compared to its rapid introduction in brazil and the west indies slavery developed slowly in north america.
slaves cost more than indentured servants and the high death rate among tobacco workers made it economically unappealing to pay for a lifetime of labor.
for decades servants from england formed the backbone of the chesapeake labor force and the number of africans remained small.
as late as 1680 there were only 4 500 blacks in the chesapeake a little over 5 percent of the regions population.
the most important social distinction in the seventeenth century chesapeake was not between black and white but between the white plantation owners who dominated politics and society and everybody else small farmers indentured servants and slaves.

slavery and the law centuries before the voyages of columbus spain had enacted las siete partidas a series of laws granting slaves certain rights relating to marriage the holding of property and access to freedom.
these laws were transferred to spains american empire.
they were often violated but nonetheless gave slaves opportunities to claim rights under the law.
moreover the catholic church often encouraged masters to free individual slaves.
the law of slavery in english north america would become far more repressive than in the spanish empire especially on the all important question of whether avenues existed by which slaves could obtain freedom.
for much of the seventeenth century however the legal status of chesapeake blacks remained ambiguous and the line between slavery and freedom more permeable than it would later become.
the first africans twenty in all arrived in virginia in 1619.
british pirates sailing under the dutch flag had seized them from a portuguese ship carrying slaves from angola on the southwestern coast of africa to modern day mexico.
small numbers followed in subsequent years.
although the first black arrivals were almost certainly treated as slaves it appears that at least some managed to become free after serving a term of years.
to be sure racial distinctions were enacted into law from the outset.
as early as the 1620s the law barred blacks from serving in the virginia militia.
the government punished sexual relations outside of marriage between africans and europeans more severely than the same acts involving two white persons.
in 1643 a poll tax a tax levied on individuals was imposed on african but not white women.
in both virginia and maryland however free blacks could sue and testify in court and some even managed to acquire land and purchase white servants or african slaves.
it is not known exactly how anthony johnson who apparently arrived in virginia as a slave during the 1620s obtained his freedom.
but by the 1640s he was the owner of slaves and of several hundred acres of land on virginias eastern shore.
blacks and whites labored side by side in the tobacco fields sometimes ran away together and established intimate relationships.
the rise of chesapeake slavery evidence of blacks being held as slaves for life appears in the historical record of the 1640s.
in registers of property for example white servants are listed by the number of years of labor while blacks with higher valuations have no terms of service associated with their names.
not until the 1660s however did the laws of virginia and maryland refer explicitly to slavery.
as tobacco planting spread and the demand for labor increased the condition of black and white servants diverged sharply.
authorities sought to in this scene depicted on an english handkerchief male and female slaves work in the tobacco fields alongside a white indentured servant right.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 origins of american slavery improve the status of white servants hoping to counteract the widespread impression in england that virginia was a death trap.
at the same time access to freedom for blacks receded.
a virginia law of 1662 provided that in the case of a child one of whose parents was free and one slave the status of the offspring followed that of the mother.
this provision not only reversed the european practice of defining a childs status through the father but also made the sexual abuse of slave women profitable for slaveholders since any children that resulted remained the owners property.
in 1667 the virginia house of burgesses decreed that religious conversion did not release a slave from bondage.
thus christians could own other christians as slaves.
moreover authorities sought to prevent the growth of the free black population by defining all offspring of interracial relationships as illegitimate severely punishing white women who begat children with black men and prohibiting the freeing of any slave unless he or she were transported out of the colony.
by 1680 even though the black population was still small notions of racial difference were well entrenched in the law.
in englands american empire wrote one contemporary these two words negro and slave have by custom grown homogenous and convertible in british north america unlike the spanish empire no distinctive mulatto or mixed race class existed the law treated everyone with african ancestry as black.
bacons land rebellion and labor in virginia virginias shift from white indentured servants to african slaves as the main plantation labor force was accelerated by one of the most dramatic confrontations of this era bacons rebellion of 1676.
governor william berkeley had for thirty years run a corrupt regime in alliance with an inner circle of the colonys wealthiest tobacco planters.
he rewarded his followers with land grants and lucrative offices.
at first virginias tobacco boom had benefited not only planters but also smaller farmers some of them former servants who managed to acquire farms.
but as tobacco farming spread inland planters connected with the governor engrossed the best lands leaving freed servants a growing population since virginias death rate was finally falling with no options but to work as tenants or to move to the frontier.
at the same time heavy taxes on tobacco and falling prices because of overproduction reduced the prospects of small farmers.
by the 1670s poverty among whites had reached levels reminiscent of england.
in addition the right to vote previously enjoyed by all adult men was confined to landowners in 1670.
governor berkeley maintained peaceful relations with virginias remaining native population.
his refusal to allow white settlement in areas reserved for indians angered many land hungry colonists.
as early as 1661 a virginia indentured servant was accused of planning an uprising among those who would be for liberty and free from bondage fifteen years later long simmering social tensions coupled with widespread resentment against the injustices of the berkeley regime erupted in bacons rebellion.
the spark was a minor confrontation between indians and colonists on virginias western frontier.
settlers now demanded that the governor authorize the extermination or removal of the colonys indians to open more land for whites.
fearing all out warfare and continu h o w w a s s l a v e r y e s t a b l i s h e d i n t h e we s t e r n a t l a n t i c w o r l d.
ing to profit from the trade with indians in deerskins berkeley refused.
an uprising followed that soon careened out of control.
beginning with a series of indian massacres it quickly grew into a full fledged rebellion against berkeley and his system of rule.
to some extent bacons rebellion was a conflict within the virginia elite.
the leader nathaniel bacon a wealthy and ambitious planter who had arrived in virginia in 1673 disdained berkeleys coterie as men of mean education and employments his backers included men of wealth outside the governors circle of cronies.
but bacons call for the removal of all indians from the colony a reduction of taxes at a time of economic recession and an end to rule by grandees rapidly gained support from small farmers landless men indentured servants and even some africans.
the bulk of his army consisted of discontented men who had recently been servants.
the end and its of the rebellion consequences bacon promised freedom including access to indian lands to all who joined his ranks.
his supporters invoked the tradition of english liberties and spoke of the poor being robbed and cheated by their social superiors.
in 1676 bacon gathered an armed force for an unauthorized and indiscriminate campaign against those he called the governors protected and darling indians he refused berkeleys order to disband and marched on jamestown burning it to the ground.
the governor fled and bacon became the ruler of virginia.
his forces plundered the estates of berkeleys supporters.
only the arrival of a squadron of warships from england restored order.
bacons rebellion was over.
twenty three of his supporters were hanged bacon himself had taken ill and died shortly after berkeleys departure.
the specter of a civil war among whites greatly frightened virginias ruling elite who took dramatic steps to consolidate their power and improve their image.
they restored property qualifications for voting which bacon had rescinded.
at the same time planters developed a new political style in which they cultivated the support of poorer neighbors.
meanwhile the authorities reduced taxes and adopted a more aggressive indian policy opening western areas to small farmers many of whom prospered from a rise in tobacco prices after 1680.
to avert the further rise of a rebellious population of landless former indentured servants virginias authorities accelerated the shift to slaves who would never become free on the tobacco plantations.
as virginia reduced the number of indentured servants it redefined their freedom dues to include fifty acres of land.
a slave society between 1680 and 1700 slave labor began to supplant indentured servitude on chesapeake plantations.
bacons rebellion was only one among several factors that contributed to this development.
as the death rate finally began to fall it became more economical to purchase a laborer for life.
improving conditions in england reduced the number of transatlantic migrants and the sir william berkeley governor of colonial virginia 1641 1652 and 1660 1677 in a portrait by sir peter lely.
berkeleys authoritarian rule helped to spark bacons rebellion.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 colonies in crisis opening of pennsylvania where land was readily available attracted those who still chose to leave for america.
finally the ending of a monopoly on the english slave trade previously enjoyed by the royal africa company opened the door to other traders and reduced the price of imported african slaves.
by 1700 blacks constituted more than 10 percent of virginias population.
fifty years later they made up nearly half.
recognizing the growing importance of slavery the house of burgesses in 1705 enacted a new slave code bringing together the scattered legislation of the previous century and adding new provisions that embedded the principle of white supremacy in the law.
slaves were property completely subject to the will of their masters and more generally of the white community.
they could be bought and sold leased fought over in court and passed on to ones descendants.
henceforth blacks and whites were tried in separate courts.
no black free or slave could own arms strike a white man or employ a white servant.
any white person could apprehend any black to demand a certificate of freedom or a pass from the owner giving permission to be off the plantation.
virginia had changed from a society with slaves in which slavery was one system of labor among others to a slave society where slavery stood at the center of the economic process.
notions of freedom one sentiment shared by europeans native americans and africans was fear of enslavement.
throughout history slaves have run away and in other ways resisted bondage.
they did the same in the colonial chesapeake.
colonial newspapers were filled with advertisements for runaway slaves.
these notices described the appearance and skills of the fugitive and included such comments as ran away without any cause or he has great notions of freedom some of the blacks brought to the region during the seventeenth century were the offspring of encounters between european traders and africans on the western coast of africa or the caribbean.
familiar with european culture and fluent in english they turned to the colonial legal system in their quest for freedom.
throughout the seventeenth century blacks appeared in court claiming their liberty at first on the basis of conversion to christianity or having a white father.
this was one reason virginia in the 1660s closed these pathways to freedom.
but although legal avenues to liberty receded the desire for freedom did not.
after the suppression of a slave conspiracy in 1709 alexander spotswood the governor of virginia warned planters to be vigilant.
the desire for freedom he reminded them can call together all those who long to shake off the fetters of slavery colonies in crisis king philips war of 1675 and bacons rebellion the following year coincided with disturbances in other colonies.
in maryland where the proprietor lord baltimore in 1670 had suddenly restricted the right to vote to owners of fifty acres of land or a certain amount of personal property a protestant uprising unsuccessfully sought to oust his government and restore the suffrage for all freemen.
in several colonies increasing settlement on the frontier led to resistance by alarmed indians.
a rebellion by westo indians what major social and political crises rocked the colonies in the late seventeenth century.
was suppressed in carolina in 1680.
the pueblo revolt of the same year discussed in chapter 1 indicated that the crisis of colonial authority was not confined to the british empire.
the glorious revolution turmoil in england also reverberated in the colonies.
in 1688 the long struggle for domination of english government between parliament and the crown reached its culmination in the glorious revolution which established parliamentary supremacy once and for all and secured the protestant succession to the throne.
under charles ii parliament had asserted its authority in the formation of national policy.
it expanded its control of finance influenced foreign affairs and excluded from political and religious power catholics and dissenters protestants who belonged to a denomination other than the official anglican church.
when charles died in 1685 he was succeeded by his brother james ii formerly the duke of york a practicing catholic and a believer that kings ruled by divine right.
in 1687 james decreed religious toleration for both protestant dissenters and catholics.
the following year the birth of jamess son raised the prospect of a catholic succession alarming those who equated popery with tyranny.
a group of english aristocrats invited the dutch nobleman william of orange the husband of jamess protestant daughter mary to assume the throne in the name of english liberties.
william arrived in england in november 1688 with an army of 21 000 men two thirds of them dutch.
as the landed elite and leaders of the anglican church rallied to williams cause james ii fled and the revolution was complete.
unlike the broad social upheaval that marked the english civil war of the 1640s the glorious revolution was in effect a coup engineered by a small group of aristocrats in alliance with an ambitious dutch prince.
they had no intention of challenging the institution of the monarchy.
but the overthrow of james ii entrenched more firmly than ever the notion that liberty was the birthright of all englishmen and that the king was subject to the rule of law.
to justify the ouster of james ii parliament in 1689 enacted a bill of rights which listed parliamentary powers such as control over taxation as well as rights of individuals including trial by jury.
these were the ancient and undoubted.
rights and liberties of all englishmen.
in the following year the toleration act allowed protestant dissenters but not catholics to worship freely although only anglicans could hold public office.
as always british politics were mirrored in the american colonies.
the period from the 1660s to the 1680s had been one of growing religious toleration in both regions succeeded by a tightening of religious control once william of orange a protestant became king.
indeed after the glorious revolution protestant domination was secured in most of the colonies with the established churches of england anglican and scotland presbyterian growing the fastest while catholics and dissenters suffered various forms of discrimination.
despite the new regimes language of liberty however religious freedom was far more advanced in some american colonies such as rhode island pennsylvania and carolina than in england.
nonetheless throughout english america the glorious revolution powerfully reinforced among the colonists the sense of sharing a proud legacy of freedom and protestantism with the mother country.

3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 the glorious colonies in crisis revolution in america the glorious revolution exposed fault lines in colonial society and offered local elites an opportunity to regain authority that had recently been challenged.
until the mid 1670s the north american colonies had essentially governed themselves with little interference from england.
governor berkeley ran virginia as he saw fit proprietors in new york maryland and carolina governed in any fashion they could persuade colonists to accept and new england colonies elected their own officials and openly flouted trade regulations.
in 1675 england established the lords of trade to oversee colonial affairs.
three years later the lords questioned the massachusetts government about its compliance with the navigation acts.
they received the surprising reply that since the colony had no representatives in parliament the acts did not apply to it unless the massachusetts general court approved.
in the 1680s england moved to reduce colonial autonomy.
shortly before his death charles ii revoked the massachusetts charter citing wholesale violations of the navigation acts.
hoping to raise more money from america in order to reduce his dependence on parliament james ii between 1686 and 1688 combined connecticut plymouth massachusetts new hampshire rhode island new york and east and west jersey into a single super colony the dominion of new england.
it was ruled by the former new york governor sir edmund andros who did not have to answer to an elected assembly.
these events reinforced the impression that james ii was an enemy of freedom.
in new england andross actions alienated nearly everyone not dependent on his administration for favors.
he appointed local officials in place of elected ones imposed taxes without the approval of elected representatives declared earlier land grants void unless approved by him and enforced religious toleration for all protestants.
his rule threatened both english liberties and the church state relationship at the heart of the puritan order.
the maryland uprising in 1689 news of the overthrow of james ii triggered rebellions in several american colonies.
in april the boston militia seized and jailed edmund andros and other officials whereupon the new england colonies reestablished the governments abolished when the dominion of new england was created.
in may a rebel militia headed by captain jacob leisler established a committee of safety and took control of new york.
two months later marylands protestant association overthrew the government of the colonys catholic proprietor lord baltimore.
all of these new regimes claimed to have acted in the name of english liberties and looked to london for approval.
but the degrees of success of these coups varied markedly.
most triumphant were the maryland rebels.
concluding that lord baltimore had mismanaged the colony william revoked his charter although the proprietor retained his land and rents and established a new protestant dominated government.
catholics retained the right to practice their religion but were barred from voting and holding office.
in 1715 after the baltimore family had converted to anglicanism proprietary power was restored.
but the events of 1689 transformed the what major social and political crises rocked the colonies in the late seventeenth century.
ruling group in maryland and put an end to the colonys unique history of religious toleration.
leislers rebellion the outcome in new york was far different.
the german born leisler one of the wealthiest merchants in the city was a fervent calvinist who feared that james ii intended to reduce england and its empire to popery and slavery although it was not his intention leislers regime divided the colony along ethnic and economic lines.
members of the dutch majority seized the opportunity to reclaim local power after more than two decades of english rule while bands of rebels ransacked the homes of wealthy new yorkers.
prominent english colonists joined by some wealthy dutch merchants and fur traders protested to london that leisler was a tyrant.
william refused to recognize leislers authority and dispatched a new governor backed by troops.
many of leislers followers were imprisoned and he himself was condemned to be executed.
the grisly manner of his death leisler was hanged and then had his head cut off and body cut into four parts reflected the depths of hatred the rebellion had inspired.
for generations the rivalry between leisler and anti leisler parties polarized new york politics.
changes in new england after deposing edmund andros the new england colonies lobbied hard in london for the restoration of their original charters.
most were successful but massachusetts was not.
in 1691 the crown issued a new charter that absorbed plymouth into massachusetts and transformed the political structure of the bible commonwealth.
town government remained intact but henceforth property ownership not church membership would be the requirement to vote in elections for the general court.
the governor was now appointed in london rather than elected.
thus massachusetts became a royal colony the majority of whose voters were no longer puritan saints moreover it was required to abide by the english toleration act of 1690 that is to allow all protestants to worship freely.
the demise of the new england way greatly benefited non puritan merchants and large landowners who came to dominate the new government.
these events produced an atmosphere of considerable tension in massachusetts exacerbated by raids by french troops and their indian allies on the northern new england frontier.
the advent of religious toleration heightened anxieties among the puritan clergy who considered other protestant denominations a form of heresy.
i would not have a hand in setting up their devil worship one minister declared of the quakers.
indeed not a few puritans thought they saw the hand of satan in the events of 1690 and 1691.
the prosecution of witches belief in magic astrology and witchcraft was widespread in seventeenthcentury europe and america existing alongside the religion of the clergy and churches.
many puritans believed in supernatural interventions in the affairs of the world.
they interpreted as expressions of gods will such events c h.

evil forces could also affect daily life.
witches were individuals usually women who were accused of having entered into a pact with the devil to obtain supernatural powers which they used to harm others or to interfere with natural processes.
when a child was stillborn or crops failed many believed that witchcraft was at work.
in europe and the colonies witchcraft was punishable by execution.
it is estimated that between the years 1400 and 1800 more than 50 000 people were executed in europe after being convicted of witchcraft.
witches were from time to time hanged in seventeenth century new england.
most were women beyond childbearing age who were outspoken economically independent or estranged from their husbands or who in other ways violated traditional gender norms.
the witchs alleged power challenged both gods will and the standing of men as heads of family and rulers of society.
the an illustration from cotton mathers 1692 account of witchcraft depicts a witch on her broomstick accompanied by satan.
salem witch trials until 1692 the prosecution of witches had been local and sporadic.
but in the heightened anxiety of that year a series of trials and executions took place in the town of salem that made its name to this day a byword for fanaticism and persecution.
the crisis began late in 1691 when several young girls began to suffer fits and nightmares attributed by their elders to witchcraft.
soon three witches had been named including tituba an indian from the caribbean who was a slave in the home of one of the girls.
since the only way to avoid prosecution was to confess and name others accusations of witchcraft began to snowball.
by the middle of 1692 hundreds of residents of salem had come forward to accuse their neighbors.
some it appears used the occasion to settle old scores within the salem community.
local authorities took legal action against nearly 150 persons the large majority of them women.
many confessed to save their lives but fourteen women and five men were hanged protesting their innocence to the end.
one man was pressed to death crushed under a weight of stones for refusing to enter a plea.
in salem accusations of witchcraft spread far beyond the usual profile of middle aged women to include persons of all ages one was a child of four and those with no previous history of assertiveness or marital discord.
as accusations and executions multiplied it became clear that something was seriously wrong with the colonys system of justice.
toward the end of 1692 the governor of massachusetts dissolved the salem court and ordered the remaining prisoners released.
at the same time the prominent clergyman increase mather published an influential treatise cases of conscience concerning evil spirits warning that juries should not take seriously either the testimony of those who claimed to be possessed or the confessions and accusations of persons facing execution.
the events in salem discredited the tradition of prosecuting witches and accelerated a commitment among prominent what were the directions of social and economic change in the eighteenth century colonies.
colonists to finding scientific explanations for natural events like comets and illnesses rather than attributing them to magic.
in future years only two accused witches would be brought to trial in massachusetts and both were found not guilty.
the growth of colonial america the salem witch trials took place precisely two centuries after columbuss initial voyage.
the western hemisphere was dramatically different from the world he had encountered.
powerful states had been destroyed and the native population decimated by disease and in some areas deprived of its land.
in north america three new and very different empires had arisen competing for wealth and power.
the urban based spanish empire with a small settler elite and growing mestizo population directing the labor of a large indian population still relied for wealth primarily on the gold and silver mines of mexico and south america.
the french empire centered on saint domingue martinique and guadeloupe plantation islands of the west indies.
on the mainland it consisted of a thinly settled string of farms and trading posts in the st lawrence valley.
in north america north of the rio grande the english colonies had far outstripped their rivals in population and trade.
as stability returned after the crises of the late seventeenth century english north america experienced an era of remarkable growth.
between 1700 and 1770 crude backwoods settlements became bustling provincial capitals.
even as epidemics continued in indian country the hazards of disease among colonists diminished agricultural settlement pressed westward and hundreds of thousands of newcomers arrived from the old world.
thanks to a high birthrate and continuing immigration the population of englands mainland colonies 265 000 in 1700 grew nearly tenfold to over 2 3 million seventy years later.
it is worth noting however that because of the decline suffered by the indians the north american population was considerably lower in 1770 than it had been in 1492.
a diverse population probably the most striking characteristic of colonial american society in the eighteenth century was its sheer diversity.
in 1700 the colonies were essentially english outposts.
relatively few africans had yet been brought to the mainland and the overwhelming majority of the white population close to 90 percent was of english origin.
in the eighteenth century african and non english european arrivals skyrocketed while the number emigrating from england declined see table 3 1.
as economic conditions in england improved the government began to rethink the policy of encouraging emigration.
no longer concerned with an excess population of vagabonds and masterless men authorities began to worry that large scale emigration was draining labor from the mother country.
about 40 percent of european immigrants to the colonies during the eighteenth century continued to arrive as bound laborers who had temporarily sacrificed their freedom to make the voyage c h.

but as the colonial economy prospered poor indentured migrants were increasingly joined by professionals and skilled craftsmen teachers ministers weavers carpenters whom england could ill afford to lose.
this brought to an end official efforts to promote english emigration.
attracting settlers yet while worrying about losing desirable members of its population the government in london remained convinced that colonial development enhanced the nations power and wealth.
to bolster the chesapeake labor force nearly 50 000 convicts a group not desired in britain were sent to work in the tobacco fields.
officials also actively encouraged protestant immigration from the non english and less prosperous parts of the british isles and from the european continent promising newcomers easy access to land and the right to worship freely.
a law of 1740 even offered european immigrants british citizenship after seven years of residence something that in the mother country could only be obtained by a special act of parliament.
the widely publicized image of america as an asylum for those whom bigots chase from foreign lands in the words of a 1735 poem was in many ways a byproduct of britains efforts to attract settlers from nonenglish areas to its colonies.
among eighteenth century migrants from the british isles the 80 000 english newcomers a majority of them convicted criminals were consider among the most striking features of eighteenth century colonial society was the racial and ethnic diversity of the population except in new england.
this resulted from increased immigration from the non english parts of the british isles and from mainland europe as well as the rapid expansion of the slave trade from africa.

scottish and scotch irish immigrants had a profound impact on colonial society.
mostly presbyterians they added significantly to religious diversity in north america.
their numbers included not only poor farmers seeking land but also numerous merchants teachers and professionals indeed a large majority of the physicians in eighteenth century america were of scottish origin.
the a german language illustrated family record from late seventeenth century pennsylvania.
numerous germans settled in the colony attracted by william penns generous policies about acquiring land and his promise of religious freedom.
german migration germans 110 000 in all formed the largest group of newcomers from the european continent.
most came from the valley of the rhine river which stretches through present day germany into switzerland.
in the eighteenth century germany was divided into numerous small states each with a ruling prince who determined the official religion.
those who found themselves worshiping the wrong religion lutherans in catholic areas catholics in lutheran areas and everywhere followers of small protestant sects such as mennonites moravians and dunkers faced persecution.
many decided to emigrate.
other migrants were motivated by persistent agricultural crises and the difficulty of acquiring land.
indeed the emigration to america represented only a small part of a massive reshuffling of the german population within europe.
millions of germans left their homes during the eighteenth century most of them migrating eastward to austriahungary and the russian empire which made land available to newcomers.
wherever they moved germans tended to travel in entire families.
english and dutch merchants created a well organized system whereby redemptioners as indentured families were called received passage in exchange for a promise to work off their debt in america.
most settled in frontier areas rural new york western pennsylvania and the southern backcountry where they formed tightly knit farming communities in which german for many years remained the dominant language.
their arrival greatly enhanced the ethnic and religious diversity of britains colonies.
religious diversity eighteenth century british america was not a melting pot of cultures.
ethnic groups tended to live and worship in relatively homogeneous communities.
but outside of new england which received few immigrants and retained its overwhelmingly english ethnic character american society had a far more diverse population than britain.
nowhere was this more evident than in the practice of religion.
in 1700 nearly all the churches in the what were the directions of social and economic change in the eighteenth century colonies.
colonies were either congregational in new england or anglican.
in the eighteenth century the anglican presence expanded considerably.
new churches were built and new ministers arrived from england.
but the number of dissenting congregations also multiplied.
apart from new jersey formed from east and west jersey in 1702 rhode island and pennsylvania the colonies did not adhere to a modern separation of church and state.
nearly every colony levied taxes to pay the salaries of ministers of an established church and most barred catholics and jews from voting and holding public office.
but increasingly de facto toleration among protestant denominations flourished fueled by the establishment of new churches by immigrants as well as new baptist methodist and other congregations created as a result of the great awakening a religious revival that will be discussed in chapter 4.
by the mideighteenth century dissenting protestants in most colonies had gained the right to worship as they pleased and own their churches although many places still barred them from holding public office and taxed them to support the official church.
a visitor to pennsylvania in 1750 described the colonys religious diversity we find there lutherans reformed catholics quakers menonists or anabaptists herrnhuters or moravian brethren pietists seventh day baptists dunkers presbyterians.
jews mohammedans pagans liberty of conscience wrote a german newcomer in 1739 was the chief virtue of british north america and on this score i do not repent my immigration equally important to eighteenth century immigrants however were other elements of freedom especially the availability of land the lack of a military draft and the absence of restraints on economic opportunity common in europe.
skilled workers were in great demand.
they earn what they want one emigrant wrote to his brother in switzerland in 1733 letters home by immigrants spoke of low taxes the right to enter trades and professions without paying exorbitant fees and freedom of movement.
in this country one wrote there are abundant liberties in just about all matters baptists were among the numerous religious denominations in the eigthteenthcentury colonies.

3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 indian the growth of colonial america life in transition the tide of newcomers who equated liberty with secure possession of land threatened to engulf the surviving indian populations.
by the eighteenth century indian communities were well integrated into the british imperial system.
indian warriors did much of the fighting in the centurys imperial wars.
their cultures were now quite different from what they had been at the time of first contact.
indian societies that had existed for centuries had disappeared the victims of disease and warfare.
new tribes like the catawba of south carolina and the creek confederacy which united dozens of indian towns in south carolina and georgia had been created from their remnants.
few indians chose to live among whites rather than in their own communities.
but they had become well accustomed to using european products like knives hatchets needles kettles and firearms.
alcohol introduced by traders created social chaos in many indian communities.
one cherokee told the governor of south carolina in 1753 the clothes we wear we cannot make ourselves they are made to us.
we use their ammunition with which we kill deer.
every necessary thing we must have from the white people while traders saw in indian villages potential profits and british officials saw allies against france and spain farmers and planters viewed indians as little more than an obstruction to their desire for land.
they expected indians to give way to white settlers.
the native population of the virginia and south carolina frontier had already been displaced when large numbers of settlers arrived.
in pennsylvania however the flood of german and scotch irish settlers into the backcountry upset the relatively peaceful indian white relations constructed by william penn.
at a 1721 conference a group of colonial and indian leaders reaffirmed penns chain of friendship.
but conflicts over land soon multiplied.
the infamous walking purchase of 1737 brought the fraudulent dealing so common in other colonies to pennsylvania.
the lenni lanape indians agreed to an arrangement to cede a tract of land bounded by the distance a man could walk in thirty six hours.
to their amazement governor james logan hired a team of swift runners who marked out an area far in excess of what the indians had anticipated.
by 1760 when pennsylvanias population a mere 20 000 in 1700 had grown to 220 000 indian colonist relations initially the most harmonious in british north america had become poisoned by suspicion and hostility.
one group of susquehanna indians declared that the white people had abused them and taken their lands from them and therefore they had no reason to think that they were now concerned for their happiness they longed for the days when old william penn treated them with fairness and respect.
regional diversity by the mid eighteenth century the different regions of the british colonies had developed distinct economic and social orders.
small farms tilled by family labor and geared primarily to production for local consumption predominated in new england and the new settlements of the backcountry the area stretching from central pennsylvania southward through the what were the directions of social and economic change in the eighteenth century colonies.
shenandoah valley of virginia and into upland north and south carolina.
the backcountry was the most rapidly growing region in north america.
in 1730 the only white residents in what was then called indian country were the occasional hunter and trader.
by the eve of the american revolution the region contained one quarter of virginias population and half of south carolinas.
most were farm families raising grain and livestock but slaveowning planters seeking fertile soil for tobacco farming also entered the area.
in the older portions of the middle colonies of new york new jersey and pennsylvania farmers were more oriented to commerce than on the frontier growing grain both for their own use and for sale abroad and supplementing the work of family members by employing wage laborers tenants and in some instances slaves.
because large landlords had engrossed so much desirable land new yorks growth lagged behind that of neighboring colonies.
what man will be such a fool as to become a base tenant wondered richard coote new yorks governor at the beginning of the eighteenth century when by crossing the hudson river that man can for a song purchase a good freehold with its fertile soil favorable climate initially peaceful indian relations generous governmental land distribution policy and rivers that facilitated long distance trading pennsylvania came to be known as the best poor mans country ordinary colonists there enjoyed a standard of living unimaginable in europe.

penns grandson thomas the proprietor of pennsylvania commissioned this romanticized painting from the artist benjamin west in 1771 by which time harmony between indians and colonists had long since turned to hostility.
in the nineteenth century many reproductions of this image circulated reminding americans that indians had once been central figures in their history.

trade integrated the british empire.
as the american colonies were drawn more and more fully into the system of atlantic commerce they shared in the eras consumer revolution.
in port cities and small inland towns shops proliferated and american newspapers were filled with advertisements for british goods.
british merchants supplied american traders with loans to enable them to import these products and traveling peddlers carried them into remote frontier areas.
consumerism in a modern sense the mass production advertising and sale of consumer goods did not exist in colonial america.
nonetheless eighteenth century estate inventories records of peoples possessions at the time of death revealed the wide dispersal in american homes of english and even asian products.
in the seventeenth century most colonists had lived in a pioneer world of homespun clothing and homemade goods.
now even modest farmers and artisans owned books ceramic plates metal cutlery and items made of imported silk and cotton.
tea once a luxury enjoyed only by the wealthy became virtually a necessity of life.
people that are least able to go to the expense one new yorker noted must have their tea though their families want bread this 1772 broadside offers a rare view of the interior of a philadelphia shop and lists some of the many european and west indian goods on sale including rum tea spices and gun powder a sign of the ongoing consumer revolution linked to international trade.
colonial cities britains mainland colonies were overwhelmingly agricultural.
nine tenths of the population resided in rural areas and made their livelihood from farming.
colonial cities like boston new york philadelphia and charleston were quite small by the standards of europe or spanish america.
in 1700 when the population of mexico city stood at 100 000 boston had 6 000 residents and new york 4 500.
as late as 1750 eight cities in spanish america exceeded in size any in english north america.
english american cities served mainly as gathering places for agricultural goods and for imported items to be distributed to the countryside.
nonetheless the expansion of trade encouraged the rise of port cities home to a growing population of colonial merchants and artisans skilled craftsmen as well as an increasing number of poor.
in 1770 with some 30 000 inhabitants philadelphia was the capital of the new world at least its british component and after london and liverpool the empires third busiest port.
the financial commercial and cultural center of british america its growth rested on economic integration with the rich agricultural region nearby.
philadelphia merchants organized the collection of farm goods supplied rural storekeepers and extended credit to consumers.
they exported flour bread and meat to the west indies and europe.

learning the trade.
the artisans skill which set him apart from the common laborers below him in the social scale was the key to his existence and it gave him a far greater degree of economic freedom than those dependent on others for a livelihood.
he that hath a trade hath an estate wrote benjamin franklin who had worked as a printer before achieving renown as a scientist and statesman.
despite the influx of british goods american craftsmen benefited from the expanding consumer market.
most journeymen enjoyed a reasonable chance of rising to the status of master and establishing a workshop of their own.
some achieved remarkable success.
born in new york city in 1723 myer myers a jewish silversmith of dutch ancestry became one of the citys most prominent artisans.
myers produced jewelry candlesticks coffeepots tableware and other gold and silver objects for the colonys elite as well as religious ornaments for both synagogues and protestant churches in new york and nearby colonies.
he used some of his profits to acquire land in new hampshire and connecticut.
myerss career reflected the opportunities colonial cities offered to skilled men of diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds.

sugar tobacco and other products of the western hemisphere were marketed as far away as eastern europe.
london bankers financed the slave trade between africa and portugese brazil.
spain spent its gold and silver importing goods from other countries.
as trade expanded the north american and west indian colonies became the major overseas market for british manufactured goods.
although most colonial output was consumed at this piece of china made in england and exported to new england celebrates the coronation of james ii in 1685.

virtually the entire chesapeake tobacco crop was marketed in britain with most of it then re exported to europe by british merchants.
most of the bread and flour exported from the colonies was destined for the west indies.
african slaves there grew sugar that could be distilled into rum a product increasingly popular among both north american colonists and indians who obtained it by trading furs and deerskins that were then shipped to europe.
the mainland colonies carried on a flourishing trade in fish and grains with southern europe.
ships built in new england made up one third of the british empires trading fleet.
membership in the empire had many advantages for the colonists.
most americans did not complain about british regulation of their trade because commerce enriched the colonies as well as the mother country and lax enforcement of the navigation acts allowed smuggling to flourish.
in a dangerous world moreover the royal navy protected american shipping.
and despite the many differences between life in england and its colonies eighteenth century english america drew closer and closer to and in some ways became more and more similar to the mother country across the atlantic.
social classes in the colonies the a 1732 portrait of daniel peter and andrew oliver sons of a wealthy boston merchant.
the prominent display of their delicate hands tells the viewer that they have never had to do manual labor.
colonial elite most free americans benefited from economic growth but as colonial society matured an elite emerged that while neither as powerful or wealthy as the aristocracy of england increasingly dominated politics and society.
indeed the gap between rich and poor probably grew more rapidly in the eighteenth century than in any other period of american history.
in new england and the middle colonies expanding trade made possible the emergence of a powerful upper class of merchants often linked by family or commercial ties to great trading firms in london.
there were no banks in colonial america.
credit and money were in short supply and mercantile success depended on personal connections as much as business talent.
by 1750 the colonies of the chesapeake and lower south were dominated by slave plantations producing staple crops especially tobacco and rice for the world market.
here great planters accumulated enormous wealth.
the colonial elite also included the rulers of proprietary colonies like pennsylvania and maryland.
how did patterns of class and gender roles change in eighteenth century america.
america had no titled aristocracy as in britain.
it had no system of legally established social ranks or family pedigrees stretching back to medieval times.
apart from the de lanceys livingstons and van rensselaers of new york the penn family in pennsylvania and a few southern planters it had no one whose landholdings in monetary value rivaled those of the british aristocracy.
but throughout british america men of prominence controlled colonial government.
in virginia the upper class was so tightknit and intermarried so often that the colony was said to be governed by a cousinocracy members of the gentry controlled the vestries or local governing bodies of the established anglican church dominated the county courts political as well as judicial institutions that levied taxes and enacted local ordinances and were prominent in virginias legislature.
in the 1750s seven members of the same generation of the lee family sat in the house of burgesses.
eighteenth century virginia was a far healthier environment than in the early days of settlement.
planters could expect to pass their wealth down to the next generation providing estates for their sons and establishing family dynasties.
nearly every virginian of note achieved prominence through family connections.
the days when self made men could rise into the virginia gentry were long gone by 1770 nearly all upper class virginians had inherited their wealth.
thomas jeffersons grandfather was a justice of the peace an important local official militia captain and sheriff and his father was a member of the house of burgesses.
george washingtons father grandfather and great grandfather had been justices of the peace.
the virginia gentry used its control of provincial government to gain possession of large tracts of land as western areas opened for settlement.
grants of 20 000 to 40 000 acres were not uncommon.
robert king carter a speaker of the house of burgesses acquired 300 000 acres of land and 1 000 slaves by the time of his death in 1732.
anglicization for much of the eighteenth century the american colonies had more regular trade and communications with britain than among themselves.
elites in different regions slowly developed a common lifestyle and sense of common interests.
but rather than thinking of themselves as distinctively american they became more and more english a process historians call anglicization wealthy americans tried to model their lives on british etiquette and behavior.
somewhat resentful at living in provincial isolation at the end of the world as one virginia aristocrat put it they sought to demonstrate their status and legitimacy by importing the latest london fashions and literature sending their sons to britain for education and building homes equipped with fashionable furnishings modeled on the country estates and town houses of the english gentry.
their residences included large rooms for entertainment display cases for imported luxury goods and elaborate formal gardens.
some members of the colonial elite like george washington even had coats of arms designed for their families in imitation of english upper class practice.
desperate to follow an aristocratic lifestyle many planters fell into debt.
william byrd iii lived so extravagantly that by 1770 he had accumulated a portrait of elijah boardman a merchant in new milford massachusetts.
boardman wears the attire of a gentleman and rests his arm on his counting desk.
in the rear bolts of cloth are visible.
but boardman chose to emphasize his learning not his wealth by posing with books including two plays of shakespeare john miltons paradise lost and the london magazine.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 built in the 1750s by carter burwell grandson of the original robert king carter carters grove near williamsburg virginia was a grand plantation mansion with large formal gardens in imitation of english landscape design.
social classes in the colonies a debt of 100 000 an amount almost unheard of in england or america.
but so long as the world market for tobacco thrived so did virginias gentry.
the south carolina aristocracy the richest group of mainland colonists were south carolina planters although planters in jamaica far outstripped them in wealth.
elite south carolinians often traveled north to enjoy summer vacations in the cooler climate of newport rhode island and they spent much of the remainder of their time in charleston the only real urban center south of philadelphia and the richest city in british north america.
here aristocratic social life flourished centered on theaters literary societies and social events.
like their virginia counterparts south carolina grandees lived a lavish lifestyle amid imported furniture fine wines silk clothing and other items from england.
they surrounded themselves with house slaves dressed in specially designed uniforms.
in 1774 the per capita wealth in the charleston district was 2 300 more than four times that of tobacco areas in virginia and eight times the figure for philadelphia or boston.
but wealth in south carolina was highly concentrated.
the richest 10 percent of the colony owned half the wealth in 1770 the poorest quarter less than 2 percent.
throughout the colonies elites emulated what they saw as englands balanced stable social order.
liberty in their eyes meant in part the power to rule the right of those blessed with wealth and prominence to dominate over others.
they viewed society as a hierarchical structure in which some men were endowed with greater talents than others and destined to rule.
the social order they believed was held together by webs of influence how did patterns of class and gender roles change in eighteenth century america.
that linked patrons and those dependent on them.
each place in the hierarchy carried with it different responsibilities and ones status was revealed in dress manners and the splendor of ones home.
superiority and dependence as one colonial newspaper put it were natural elements of any society.
an image of refinement served to legitimate wealth and political power.
colonial elites prided themselves on developing aristocratic manners cultivating the arts and making productive use of leisure.
indeed on both sides of the atlantic elites viewed work as something reserved for common folk and slaves.
freedom from labor was the mark of the gentleman.
poverty in the colonies at the other end of the social scale poverty emerged as a visible feature of eighteenth century colonial life.
although not considered by most colonists part of their society the growing number of slaves lived in impoverished conditions.
among free americans poverty was hardly as widespread as in britain where in the early part of the century between onequarter and one half of the people regularly required public assistance.
but as the colonial population expanded access to land diminished rapidly especially in long settled areas.
in new england which received few immigrants the high birthrate fueled population growth.
with the supply of land limited sons who could not hope to inherit farms were forced to move to other colonies or to try their hand at a trade in the regions towns.
by mid century tenants and wage laborers were a growing presence on farms in the middle colonies.
in colonial cities the number of propertyless wage earners subsisting at the poverty line steadily increased.
in boston one third of the population in 1771 owned no property at all.
in rural augusta county carved out of virginias shenandoah river valley in 1738 land was quickly engrossed by planters and speculators.
by the 1760s two thirds of the countys white men owned no land and had little prospect of obtaining it unless they migrated further west.
taking the colonies as a whole half of the wealth at mid century was concentrated in the hands of the richest 10 percent of the population.
attitudes and policies toward poverty in colonial america mirrored british precedents.
the better off colonists generally viewed the poor as lazy shiftless and responsible for their own plight.
both rural communities and cities did accept responsibility for assisting their own.
but to minimize the burden on taxpayers poor persons were frequently set to labor in workhouses where they produced goods that reimbursed authorities for part of their upkeep.
their children were sent to work as apprentices in local homes or workshops.
and most communities adopted stringent measures to warn out unemployed and propertyless newcomers who might become dependent on local poor relief.
this involved town authorities either expelling the unwanted poor from an area or formally declaring certain persons ineligible for assistance.
in essex county massachusetts the number of poor persons warned out each year rose from 200 in the 1730s to 1 700 in the 1760s.
many were members of families headed by widowed or abandoned women.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 the middle social classes in the colonies ranks the large majority of free americans lived between the extremes of wealth and poverty.
along with racial and ethnic diversity what distinguished the mainland colonies from europe was the wide distribution of land and the economic autonomy of most ordinary free families.
the anonymous author of the book american husbandry published in 1775 reported that little freeholders who live upon their own property made up the most considerable part of the people especially in the northern colonies and the nonplantation parts of the south.
altogether perhaps two thirds of the free male population were farmers who owned their own land.
england to be sure had no class of laborers as exploited as american slaves but threefifths of its people owned no property at all.
by the eighteenth century colonial farm families viewed landownership almost as a right the social precondition of freedom.
they strongly resented efforts whether by native americans great landlords or colonial governments to limit their access to land.
a dislike of personal dependence and an understanding of freedom as not relying on others for a livelihood sank deep roots in british north america.
these beliefs after all accorded with social reality a wide distribution of property that made economic independence part of the lived experience of large numbers of white colonists.
women and the household economy in the household economy of eighteenth century america the family was the center of economic life.
most work revolved around the home and all members men women and children contributed to the familys livelihood.
the independence of the small farmer depended in considerable measure on the labor of dependent women and children.
he that hath an industrious family shall soon be rich declared one colonial saying and the high birthrate in part reflected the need for as many hands as possible on colonial farms.
most farmers concentrated first on growing food for their own consumption and acquiring enough land to pass it along to their sons.
but the consumer revolution and expanding networks of atlantic trade drew increasing numbers of farmers into production for the market as well.
as the population grew and the death rate declined family life stabilized and more marriages became lifetime commitments.
free women were expected to devote their lives to being good wives and mothers.
already enshrined in law and property relations male domination took on greater and greater social reality.
in several colonies the law mandated primogeniture meaning that estates must be passed intact to the oldest son.
as colonial society became more structured opportunities that had existed for women in the early period receded.
in connecticut for example the courts were informal and unorganized in the seventeenth century and women often represented themselves.
in the eighteenth century it became necessary to hire a lawyer as ones spokesman in court.
women barred from practicing as attorneys disappeared from judicial proceedings.
because of the desperate need for labor men and women in the seventeenth century both did various kinds of work.
in the eighteenth century the division of labor visions of freedom the van bergen overmantel.
the opportunity to achieve economic independence was central to american colonists idea of freedom.
this section is part of a sevenfoot long painting by john heaten from around 1773 probably designed to hang above a wide fireplace in the home of marten van bergen a dutch farmer in colonial new york.
the house and farm buildings are in dutch style.
the painting offers a rare contemporary view of a prosperous colonial farm with its full granary and livestock.
native americans and african american slaves as well as workers who probably were indentured servants are among the individuals depicted by the artist.

what indications of prosperty are evident in the painting.
3 creating anglo america 1660 1750 this portrait of the cheney family by an unknown late eighteenth century artist illustrates the high birthrate in colonial america and suggests how many years of a womans life were spent bearing and raising children.
social classes in the colonies along gender lines solidified.
womens work was clearly defined including cooking cleaning sewing making butter and assisting with agricultural chores.
the work of farmers wives and daughters often spelled the difference between a familys self sufficiency and poverty.
womens work is never done this popular adage was literally true.
even as the consumer revolution reduced the demands on many women by making available store bought goods previously produced at home womens work seemed to increase.
lower infant mortality meant more time spent in child care and domestic chores.
the demand for new goods increased the need for all family members to contribute to family income.
for most women work was incessant and exhausting.
i am dirty and distressed almost wearied to death wrote mary cooper a long island woman in her diary in 1769.
this day she continued is forty years since i left my fathers house and come here and here have i seen little else but hard labor and sorrow north america at mid century by the mid eighteenth century the area that would become the united states was home to a remarkable diversity of peoples and different kinds of social organization from pueblo villages of the southwest to tobacco plantations of the chesapeake towns and small farms of new england landholdings in the hudson valley that resembled feudal estates and fur trading outposts of the northern and western frontier.
elites tied to imperial centers of power dominated the political and economic life of nearly every colony.
but large numbers of colonists enjoyed far greater opportunities for freedom access to the vote prospects of acquiring land the right to worship as they pleased and an escape from oppressive government than existed in europe.
free colonists probably enjoyed the highest per capita income in the world.
the colonies economic growth contributed to a high birthrate long life expectancy and expanding demand for consumer goods.
in the british colonies writes one historian lived thousands of the freest individuals the western world has ever known yet many others found themselves confined to the partial freedom of indentured servitude or to the complete absence of freedom in slavery.
both timeless longings for freedom and new and unprecedented forms of unfreedom had been essential to the north american colonies remarkable development.

what was the impact of the seven years war on imperial and indian white relations.
l s ometime in the mid 1750s olaudah equiano the eleven year old son of a west african village chief was kidnapped by slave traders.
he soon found himself on a ship headed for barbados.
after a short stay on that caribbean island equiano was sold to a plantation owner in virginia and then purchased by a british sea captain who renamed him gustavus vassa.
he accompanied his owner on numerous voyages on atlantic trading vessels.
while still a slave he enrolled in a school in england where he learned to read and write and then enlisted in the royal navy.
he fought in canada under general james wolfe in 1758 during the seven years war.
in 1763 however equiano was sold once again and returned to the caribbean.
three years later he was able to purchase his freedom.
equiano went on to live through shipwrecks took part in an english colonizing venture in central america and even participated in an expedition to the arctic circle.
equiano eventually settled in london and in 1789 he published the interesting narrative of the life of olaudah equiano or gustavus vassa the african which he described as a history of neither a saint a hero nor a tyrant but of a victim of slavery who through luck or fate ended up more fortunate than most of his people.
he condemned the idea that africans were inferior to europeans and therefore deserved to be slaves.
he urged the european reader to recall that his ancestors were once like the africans uncivilized and asked did nature make them inferior.
and should they too have been made slaves persons of all races he insisted were capable of intellectual improvement.
the book became the eras most widely read account by a slave of his own experiences.
equiano died in 1797.
recent scholars have suggested that equiano may actually have been born in the new world rather than africa.
in either case while his rich variety of experience was no doubt unusual his life illuminates broad patterns of eighteenth century american history.
as noted in the previous chapter this was a period of sustained development for british north america.
compared to england and scotland united to create great britain by the act of union of 1707 the colonies were growing much more rapidly.
some contemporaries spoke of british america as a rising empire that would one day eclipse the mother country in population and wealth.
it would be wrong however to see the first three quarters of the eighteenth century simply as a prelude to american independence.
as equianos life illustrates the atlantic was more a bridge than a barrier between the old and new worlds.
ideas people and goods flowed back and forth across the ocean.
even as the colonies populations became more diverse they were increasingly integrated into the british empire.
their laws and political institutions were extensions of those of britain their ideas about society and culture reflected british values their how did african slavery differ regionally in eighteenth century north america.
economies were geared to serving the empires needs.
as european powers jockeyed for advantage in north america colonists were drawn into an almost continuous series of wars with france and its indian allies which reinforced their sense of identification with and dependence on great britain.
equianos life also underscores the greatest irony or contradiction in the history of the eighteenth century the simultaneous expansion of freedom and slavery.
this was the era when the idea of the freeborn englishman became powerfully entrenched in the outlook of both colonists and britons.
more than any other principle liberty was seen as what made the british empire distinct.
yet the eighteenth century was also the height of the atlantic slave trade a commerce increasingly dominated by british merchants and ships.
one of the most popular songs of the period included the refrain britons never never never will be slaves but during the eighteenth century more than half the africans shipped to the new world as slaves were carried on british vessels.
most were destined for the plantations of the west indies and brazil but slaves also made up around 280 000 of the 585 000 persons who arrived in britains mainland colonies between 1700 and 1775.
although concentrated in the chesapeake and areas farther south slavery existed in every colony of british north america.
and unlike equiano very few slaves were fortunate enough to gain their freedom.
s l av e ry a n d e m p i r e of the estimated 7 7 million africans transported to the new world between 1492 and 1820 more than half arrived between 1700 and 1800.
the atlantic slave trade would later be condemned by statesmen and general opinion as a crime against humanity.
but in the eighteenth century it was a regularized business in which european merchants african traders and american planters engaged in complex bargaining over human lives all with the expectation of securing a profit.
the slave trade was a vital part of world commerce.
every european empire in the new world utilized slave labor and battled for control of this lucrative trade.
the asiento an the title page of olaudah equianos account of his life the best known narrative by an eighteenth century slave.
the portrait of equiano in european dress and holding a bible challenges stereotypes of blacks as savages incapable of becoming civilized.
