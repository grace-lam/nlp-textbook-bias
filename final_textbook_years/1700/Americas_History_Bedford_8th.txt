chapter 3 the british atlantic world 1660 1750 chapter 4 growth diversity and conflict 1720 1763 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 by 1660 the patterns of colonial enterprise in the americas were becoming clear.
for the colonies of england which became britain after the 1707 act of union with scotland the period from 1660 to 1763 was one of growth and diversification.
slave imports to plantation colonies exploded while a wide array of european peoples coming from ireland and continental europe as well as england wales and scotland jostled together in rapidly growing regions of neo european settlement.
yet a coherent imperial vision for these american holdings emerged slowly and the colonies remained largely independent of crown control.
after 1689 europe plunged into a century of warfare that had an enormous impact on the americas.
as wars spilled over into north america british french and spanish colonies all engaged more deeply with neighboring indians whom they often sought to employ as allies in their struggles to control north american territory.
native american polities were undergoing dramatic transformations in these same years reshaping themselves to function more effectively in relation to their european neighbors.
at the same time warfare immigration and trade laid the foundation for more intensive interactions across the atlantic.
these interactions and the cultural movements they supported helped to knit together the increasingly diverse colonies of british north america.
part 2 addresses these developments giving particular attention to the following three main concepts the diversification of british north america rise of the british atlantic world the american colonies of the various european nations gradually diverged from each other in character.
the tribute based societies at the core of spains empire developed into complex multiracial societies portuguese brazil was dominated by its plantation and mining enterprises the dutch largely withdrew their energies from the americas except for a few plantation colonies the french too developed several important plantation colonies in the west indies but struggled to populate their vast north american holdings.
the population of britains colonies by contrast grew and diversified after 1660.
britain came to dominate the atlantic slave trade and brought more than two million slaves to its american colonies.
the great majority went to jamaica barbados and the other sugar islands but half a million found their way to the mainland where by 1763 they constituted nearly 20 percent of the mainland colonies populations.
slavery was a growing and thriving institution in british north america.
non english europeans also crossed the atlantic in very large numbers.
the ethnic landscape of britains mainland colonies was dramatically altered by 115 000 migrants from ireland most of them scots irish presbyterians and 100 000 germans.
most immigrated to pennsylvania which soon had the most ethnically diverse population of europeans on the continent.
relations among these groups were often divisive as each struggled to maintain its identity and autonomy in a rapidly changing landscape.
these population movements were part of the larger growth and development of the atlantic world a phrase historians use to refer to the quickening pace of contacts and exchanges connecting europe africa and the americas.
the rise of the british atlantic was a layered phenomenon that began with the strength of britains transatlantic shipping networks which in turn laid the foundation for large scale population flows rising economic productivity and dramatic cultural transformations.
the growing power of its navy merchant marine and manufacturing sector allowed britain to dominate the eighteenth century atlantic.
much of the cultural impact of its maritime power derived from two further developments the print revolution which brought a vast array of ideas into circulation and the consumer revolution which flooded the atlantic world with a wide array of newly available merchandise.
the british atlantic world gave rise to four critically important cultural developments.
it spread enlightenment ideas and helped to create a transatlantic community of literati interested in science and rationalism it supported communities of pietists who promoted the revival and expansion of christianity it gave wellto do colonists access to genteel values and the finery needed to put them into action and by making such an abundance of consumer goods available it encouraged colonists to go further into debt than they ever had before.
part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 contact and conflict thematic understanding alongside the diversification of colonial populations and the rise of the british atlantic the eighteenth century was shaped by contact and conflict between colonies and their native american neighbors and also among rival european empires.
in europe the period after 1689 has sometimes been called the second hundred years war when britain france and their european allies went to war against each other repeatedly.
as these conflicts came to the north american theater they decisively influenced indian relations.
native american populations shrank dramatically or disappeared altogether during the seventeenth century devastated by the effects of the columbian exchange chapter 2.
the rise of imperial warfare encouraged the process of tribalization whereby indians regrouped into political structures called tribes by europeans that could deal more effectively with their colonial neighbors and strike alliances in times of war.
europeans in turn employed indian allies as proxy warriors in their conflicts over north american territory.
this pattern culminated in the great war for empire which began in the north american backcountry engaged thousands of provincial soldiers and native american warriors and reshaped the map of north america.
the treaty of paris of 1763 gave britain control of the entire continent east of the mississippi.
events would soon show what a mixed blessing that outcome would turn out to be.
this timeline organizes some of the important developments of this period into themes.
how did the demographic changes outlined under the theme peopling impact the developments that are listed under work exchange and technology.

crowds of colonies.
curious observers thronged lancasters streets and courthouse.
the conference grew out of a diplomatic system between the colonies and the iroquois designed to air grievances and resolve conflict the covenant chain.
participants welcomed each other exchanged speeches and negotiated agreements in public ceremonies whose minutes became part of the official record of the colonies.
at lancaster the colonies had much to ask of their iroquois allies.
for one thing they wanted them to confirm a land agreement.
the iroquois often began such conferences by resisting land deals as the cayuga orator gachradodon said you know very well when the white people came first here they were poor but now they have got our lands and are by them become rich and we are now poor what little we have had for the land goes soon away but the land lasts forever in the end however they had little choice but to accept merchandise in exchange for land since colonial officials were unwilling to take no for an answer.
the colonists also announced that britain was once again going to war with france and they requested military support from their iroquois allies.

coming into it the lancaster conference and dozens of others like it that occurred between 1660 and 1750 demonstrates that the british colonies like those of france and spain relied ever more heavily on alliances with native americans as they sought to extend their power in north america.
indian nations remade themselves in these same years creating political structures called tribes by europeans that allowed them to regroup in the face of population decline and function more effectively alongside neighboring colonies.
the colonies meanwhile were drawn together into an integrated economic sphere the south atlantic system that brought prosperity to british north america while they achieved a measure of political autonomy that became essential to their understanding of what it meant to be british subjects.

part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 colonies to empire 1660 1713 before 1660 england governed its new england and chesapeake colonies haphazardly.
taking advantage of that laxness and the english civil war local big men puritan magistrates and tobacco planters ran their societies as they wished.
following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 royal bureaucrats tried to impose order on the unruly settlements and enlisting the aid of indian allies warred with rival european powers.
the restoration colonies and imperial expansion charles ii r 1660 1685 expanded english power in asia and america.
in 1662 he married the portuguese princess catherine of braganza whose dowry included the islands of bombay present day mumbai.
then in 1663 charles initiated new outposts in america by authorizing eight loyal noblemen to settle carolina an area that had long been claimed by spain and populated by thousands of indians.
the following year he awarded the just conquered dutch colony of new netherland to his brother james the duke of york who renamed the colony new york and then regranted a portion of it called new jersey to another group of proprietors.
finally in 1681 charles granted a vast track to william penn pennsylvania or penns woods in a great land grab england had ousted the dutch from north america intruded into spains northern empire and claimed all the land in between.
the carolinas in 1660 english settlement was concentrated in new england and the chesapeake.
five corporate colonies coexisted in new england massachusetts bay plymouth connecticut new haven and rhode island.
connecticut absorbed new haven in 1662 while massachusetts bay became a royal colony and absorbed plymouth in 1692.
in the chesapeake virginia was controlled by the crown while maryland was in the hands of a lord proprietor.
like lord baltimores maryland the new settlements in carolina new york new jersey and pennsylvania the restoration colonies as historians call them were proprietorships the carolina and jersey grantees the duke of york and william penn owned all the land in their new colonies and could rule them as they wished provided that their laws conformed broadly to those of england table 3 1.
indeed in new york james ii refused to allow an elective assembly and ruled by decree.
the carolina proprietors envisioned a traditional european society there the fundamental constitutions of carolina 1669 legally established the church of england and prescribed a manorial system with a mass of serfs governed by a handful of powerful nobles.
the manorial system proved a fantasy.
the first north carolina settlers were a mixture of poor families and runaway servants from virginia and english quakers an equality minded protestant sect also known as the society of friends.
quakers think there is no difference between a gentleman and a labourer complained an anglican clergyman.
refusing to work on large manors the settlers raised corn hogs and tobacco on modest family farms.
inspired by bacons rebellion they rebelled in 1677 against taxes on tobacco and again in 1708 against taxes to support the anglican church.
through their stubborn independence residents forced the proprietors to abandon their dreams of a feudal society.
in south carolina the colonists also went their own way.
the leading white settlers there were migrants from overcrowded barbados.
hoping to re create that islands hierarchical slave society they used enslaved workers both africans and native americans to raise cattle and food crops for export to the west indies.
carolina merchants opened a lucrative trade in deerskins and indian slaves with neighboring peoples.
then around 1700 south carolina planters hit upon rice cultivation.
the swampy estuaries of the coastal low country could be modified with sluices floodgates and check dams to create ideal rice growing conditions and slaves could do the backbreaking work.
by 1708 white carolinians relied upon a few thousand slaves to work their coastal plantations thereafter the african population exploded.
blacks outnumbered whites by 1710 and constituted two thirds of the population by 1740.
william penn and pennsylvania in contrast to the carolinas which languished for decades with proprietors and colonists at odds william penns colony was marked by unity of purpose all who came hoped to create a prosperous neo european settlement that approximated the social and economic systems they knew at home.
in 1681 charles ii bestowed pennsylvania which included present day delaware on william penn as payment for a large debt owed to penns father.
the younger penn though born to wealth he owned substantial estates in ireland and england and lived lavishly joined the quakers who condemned extravagance.
penn designed pennsylvania as a refuge for his fellow quakers who were persecuted in england because they refused to serve in the military or pay taxes to support the church of england.

like the puritans the quakers sought to restore christianity to its early simple spirituality.
but they rejected the puritans pessimistic calvinist doctrines which restricted salvation to a small elect.
the quakers followed the teachings of two english visionaries george fox and margaret fell who argued that god had imbued all men and women with an inner light of grace or understanding.
reflecting the sects emphasis on gender equality 350 quaker women would serve as ministers in the colonies.
mindful of the catastrophic history of indian relations in the chesapeake and new england penn exhorted colonists to sit downe lovingly alongside the native american inhabitants of the delaware and susquehanna valleys.
he wrote a letter to the leaders of the iroquois confederacy alerting them to his intention to settle a colony and in 1682 he arranged a public treaty with the delaware indians to purchase the lands that philadelphia and the surrounding settlements would soon occupy.
penns frame of government 1681 applied the quakers radical beliefs to politics.
it ensured religious freedom by prohibiting a legally established church and it promoted political equality by allowing all property owning men to vote and hold office.
cheered by these provisions thousands of quakers mostly yeoman families from the northwest midland region of england flocked to pennsylvania.
to attract european protestants penn published pamphlets in germany promising cheap land and religious toleration.
in 1683 migrants from saxony founded germantown just outside philadelphia and thousands of other germans soon followed.
ethnic diversity pacifism and freedom of conscience made pennsylvania the most open and democratic of the restoration colonies.
from mercantilism to imperial dominion as charles ii distributed american land his ministers devised policies to keep colonial trade in english hands.
since the 1560s the english crown had pursued mercantilist policies using government subsidies and charters to stimulate english manufacturing and foreign trade.
now it extended these mercantilist strategies to the american settlements through the navigation acts table 3 2.
the navigation acts believing they had to control trade with the colonies to reap their economic benefits english ministers wanted agricultural goods and raw materials to be carried to english ports in english part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 william penns treaty with the indians 1771 benjamin west executed this famous picture of william penns 1683 meeting with the lenni lenapes who called themselves the common people.
a quaker pacifist penn refused to seize indian lands by force and negotiated their purchase.
but his son thomas penn probably had a political purpose when he commissioned the painting in 1771.

in reality dutch and french shippers were often buying sugar and other colonial products from english colonies and carrying them directly into foreign markets.
to counter this practice the navigation act of 1651 required that goods be carried on ships owned by english or colonial merchants.
new parliamentary acts in 1660 and 1663 strengthened the ban on foreign traders colonists could export sugar and tobacco only to england and import european goods only through england moreover three quarters of the crew on english vessels had place events in to be english.
to pay the cuscontext toms officials who enforced these how did the ambitions of laws the revenue act of 1673 charles ii and james ii imposed a plantation duty on remake english north american exports of sugar and america.
the english government backed these policies with military force.
in three wars between 1652 and 1674 the english navy drove the dutch from new netherland and contested hollands control of the atlantic slave trade by attacking dutch forts and ships along the west african coast.
meanwhile english merchants expanded their fleets which increased in capacity from 150 000 tons in 1640 to 340 000 tons in 1690.
this growth occurred on both sides of the atlantic by 1702 only london and bristol had more ships registered in port than did the town of boston.
though colonial ports benefitted from the growth of english shipping many colonists violated the navigation acts.
planters continued to trade with dutch shippers and new england merchants imported sugar and molasses from the french west indies.
the massachusetts bay assembly boldly declared the laws of chapter 3 the british atlantic world 1660 1750 table 3 2 navigation acts 1651 1751 purpose compliance act of 1651 cut dutch trade mostly ignored act of 1660 ban foreign shipping enumerate goods that go only to england partially obeyed act of 1663 allow european imports only through england partially obeyed staple act 1673 ensure enumerated goods go only to england mostly obeyed act of 1696 prevent frauds create vice admiralty courts mostly obeyed woolen act 1699 prevent export or intercolonial sale of textiles partially obeyed hat act 1732 prevent export or intercolonial sale of hats partially obeyed molasses act 1733 cut american imports of molasses from french west indies extensively violated iron act 1750 prevent manufacture of finished iron products extensively violated currency act 1751 end use of paper currency as legal tender in new england mostly obeyed maine part of mass.

during the reign of oliver cromwell james had grown up in exile in france and he admired its authoritarian king louis xiv.
james wanted stricter control over the colonies and targeted new england for his reforms.
in 1686 the lords of trade revoked the charters of connecticut and rhode island and merged them with massachusetts bay and plymouth to form a new royal province the dominion of new england.
as governor of the dominion james ii appointed sir edmund andros a hard edged former military officer.
two years later james ii added new york and new jersey to the dominion creating a vast colony that stretched from maine to pennsylvania map 3 1.

in 1679 it denied the claim of massachusetts bay to new hampshire and eventually established a separate royal colony there.
then in 1684 the lords of trade persuaded an english court to annul the massachusetts bay charter by charging the puritan government with violating the navigation acts and virtually outlawing the church of england.

during the glorious revolution in england politicians and ministers in boston and new york city led revolts that ousted dominion officials and repudiated their authority.
king william and queen mary replaced the dominion with governments that balanced the power held by imperial authorities and local political institutions.
part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 the dominion extended to america the authoritarian model of colonial rule that the english government had imposed on catholic ireland.
james ii ordered governor andros to abolish the existing legislative assemblies.
in massachusetts andros banned town meetings angering villagers who prized local self rule and advocated public worship in the church of england offending puritan congregationalists.
even worse from the colonists perspective the governor invalidated all land titles granted under the original massachusetts bay charter.
andros offered to provide new deeds but only if the colonists would pay an annual fee.
the glorious revolution in england and america fortunately for the colonists james ii angered english political leaders as much as andros alienated colonists.
the king revoked the charters of english towns rejected the advice of parliament and aroused popular opposition by openly practicing roman catholicism.
then in 1688 jamess spanish catholic wife gave birth to a son.
to forestall the outcome of having a catholic heir to the english throne protestant bishops and parliamentary leaders in the whig party invited william of orange a staunchly protestant dutch prince who was married to jamess protestant daughter mary stuart to come to england at the head of an invading army.
with their support william led a quick and nearly bloodless coup and king james ii was overthrown in an event dubbed the glorious revolution by its supporters.
whig politicians forced king william and queen mary to accept the declaration of rights creating a constitutional monarchy that enhanced the powers of the house of commons at the expense of the crown.
the whigs wanted political power especially the power to levy taxes to reside in the hands of the gentry merchants and other substantial property owners.
to justify their coup the members of parliament relied on political philosopher john locke.
in his two treatises on government 1690 locke rejected the divine right monarchy celebrated by james ii arguing that the legitimacy of government rests on the consent of the governed and that individuals have inalienable natural rights to life liberty and property.
lockes celebration of individual rights and representative government had a lasting influence in america where many political leaders wanted to expand the powers of the colonial assemblies.
rebellions in america the glorious revolution sparked rebellions by protestant colonists in massachusetts maryland and new york.
when news of the coup reached boston in april 1689 puritan leaders and 2 000 militiamen seized governor andros and shipped him back to england.
heeding american complaints of authoritarian rule the new monarchs broke up the dominion of new england.
however they refused to restore the old puritan dominated government of massachusetts bay instead creating in 1692 a new royal colony which included plymouth and maine.

in maryland the uprising had economic as well as religious causes.
since 1660 falling tobacco prices had hurt poorer farmers who were overwhelmingly protestant while taxes and fees paid to mostly catholic proprietary officials continued to rise.
when parliament ousted james ii a protestant association mustered 700 men and forcibly removed the catholic governor.
the lords of trade supported this protestant initiative they suspended lord baltimores proprietorship imposed royal government and made the church of england the legal religion in the colony.
this arrangement lasted until 1715 when benedict calvert the fourth lord baltimore converted to the anglican faith and the king restored the proprietorship to the calvert family.
in new york a dutchman named jacob leisler led the rebellion against the dominion of new england.

the glorious revolution of 1688 1689 began a new era in the politics of both england and its american colonies.
in england william and mary ruled as constitutional monarchs overseas they promoted an empire based on commerce.
they accepted the overthrow of jamess disastrous dominion of new england and allowed massachusetts under its new charter and new york to resume self government.
in 1696 parliament created a new body the board of trade to oversee part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 colonial affairs.
while the board of trade continued to pursue the mercantilist policies that made the colonies economically beneficial otherwise it permitted local elites to maintain a strong hand in colonial affairs.
as england plunged into a new era of european warfare its leaders had little choice but to allow its colonies substantial autonomy.
alliances with neighboring native americans who tried to turn the fighting to their own advantage.
although war brought money to the american colonies in the form of war contracts it also placed new demands on colonial governments to support the increasingly militant british empire.
to win wars in western europe the caribbean and far flung oceans british leaders created a powerful central state that spent three quarters of its revenue on military and naval expenses.
imperial wars and native peoples tribalization the price that england paid for bringing william of orange to the throne was a new commitment to warfare on the continent.
england wanted william because of his unambiguous protestant commitments william wanted england because of the resources it could bring to bear in european wars.
beginning with the war of the league of augsburg in 1689 england embarked on an era sometimes called the second hundred years war which lasted until the defeat of napoleon at waterloo in 1815.
in that time england britain after 1707 fought in seven major wars the longest era of peace lasted only twenty six years table 3 3.
imperial wars transformed north america.
prior to 1689 american affairs were distant from those of europe but the recurrent wars of the eighteenth century spilled over repeatedly into the colonies.
governments were forced to arm themselves and create new for native americans the rise of war intersected with a process scholars have called tribalization the adaptation of stateless peoples to the demands imposed on them by neighboring states.
in north america tribalization occurred in catastrophic circumstances.
eurasian diseases rapidly killed off broad swaths of native communities disproportionately victimizing the old and the very young.
in oral cultures old people were irreplaceable repositories of knowledge while the young were quite literally the future.
with populations in free fall many polities disappeared altogether.
by the eighteenth century the groups that survived had all been transformed.
many were polyglot peoples some new tribes like the catawbas had not existed before and were pieced together from remnants of formerly large groups.
other nations like the iroquois declined in numbers but sustained themselves by adopting many table 3 3 english wars 1650 1750 war date purpose result anglo dutch 1652 1654 control markets and african slave trade stalemate anglo dutch markets conquest england takes new amsterdam anglo dutch commercial markets england makes maritime gains king williams 1689 1697 maintain european balance of power stalemate in north america queen annes 1702 1713 maintain european balance of power british acquire hudson bay and nova scotia jenkinss ear 1739 1741 expand markets in spanish america english merchants expand influence king georges 1740 1748 maintain european balance of power capture and return of louisbourg chapter 3 war captives.
in the carolina borderlands a large number of muskogean speaking communities came together as a nation known to the british as the creek indians so named because some of them lived on ochese creek.
similarly the cherokees the delawares and other groups that were culturally linked but politically fragmented became coherent tribes to deal more effectively with their european neighbors.
the rise of imperial warfare exposed native american communities to danger but it also gave them newfound leverage.
the iroquois were radically endangered by imperial conflict a promised english alliance failed them and in 1693 a combined force of french soldiers militiamen and their indian allies burned all three mohawk villages to the ground.
thereafter the iroquois devised a strategy for playing french and english interests off against each other.
in 1701 they made alliances with both empires declaring their intention to remain neutral in future conflicts between the four indian kings in london 1710 after a failed invasion of canada in 1709 a colonial delegation went to london to ask the queen to try again.
they brought four indians with them three mohawks and a mahican and presented them in london as the four indian kings of the iroquois.
the four kings met queen anne dined with nobility attended the theater and toured the sites.
they sat for several portraits which were engraved for prints like this one.
the queen agreed to make another try for canada but the 1711 invasion failed again.

this did not mean that the iroquois stayed on the sideline iroquois warriors often participated in raids during wartime and iroquois spokesmen met regularly with representatives of new york and new france to affirm their alliances and receive diplomatic gifts that included guns powder lead clothing and rum from the british or brandy from the french.
their neutrality paradoxically made them more sought after as allies.
for example their alliance with new york known as the covenant chain soon became a model for relations between the british empire and other native american peoples.
imperial warfare also reshaped indian relations in the southeast.

beginning in 1704 a force of creek and yamasee warriors destroyed the remaining franciscan missions in northern florida attacked the spanish settlement at pensacola and captured a thousand apalachees whom they sold to south carolinian slave traders for sale in the west indies.
simultaneously a carolina supported creek expedition attacked the iroquois speaking tuscarora people of north carolina killing hundreds executing 160 male captives and sending 400 women and children into slavery.
the surviving tuscaroras joined the iroquois in new york who now became the six nations of the iroquois.
the carolinians having used the creeks to kill spaniards now died at the hands of their former allies when english traders demanded payment for trade debts in 1715 the creeks and yamasees revolted killing 400 colonists before being overwhelmed by the carolinians and their new indian allies the cherokees.

in response new england militia attacked french settlements and in 1710 joined with british naval forces to seize port royal in french acadia nova scotia.
however a major british new england expedition against the french stronghold at quebec inspired in part by the visit of four indian kings to london failed miserably.
stalemated militarily in america britain won major territorial and commercial concessions through its victories in europe.
in the treaty of utrecht 1713 britain obtained newfoundland acadia and the hudson bay region of northern canada from france as well as access through albany to the western indian trade.
from spain britain acquired the strategic fortress the imperial slave economy britains focus on america reflected the growth of a new agricultural and commercial order the south atlantic system that produced sugar tobacco rice and other tropical and subtropical products for an international market.
its plantation societies were ruled by european planter merchants and worked by hundreds of thousands of enslaved africans figure 3 1.
the south atlantic system the south atlantic system had its center in brazil and the west indies and sugar was its primary product.
before 1500 there were few sweet foods in europe mostly honey and fruits so when european planters developed vast sugarcane plantations in america they found a ready market for their crop.
the craving for the potent new sweet food was so intense that by 1900 sugar accounted for an astonishing 20 percent of the calories consumed by the worlds people.
european merchants investors and planters garnered the profits of the south atlantic system.
following mercantilist principles they provided the plantations with tools and equipment to grow and process the sugarcane and ships to carry it to europe.
but it was the atlantic slave trade that made the system run.
between 1520 and 1650 portuguese traders carried about 820 000 africans across the atlantic about 4 000 slaves a year before 1600 and 10 000 annually thereafter.
over the next half century the dutch dominated the atlantic slave trade then between 1700 and 1800 the british transported about 2 5 million of the total of 6 1 million africans carried to the americas.
england and the west indies england was a latecomer to the plantation economy but from the beginning the prospect of a lucrative cash crop drew large numbers of migrants.
on st kitts nevis montserrat and barbados most early settlers were small scale english farmers and their indentured servants who exported tobacco and livestock hides on this basis they created small but thriving colonies.
in 1650 there were more english residents in the west indies some 44 000 than in the chesapeake 20 000 and new england 23 000 colonies combined.

sugar and slavery are key to a full understanding of this map.
they explain the high value of exports produced by the tiny caribbean islands.
e w martinique 500 miles 500 kilometers map 3 2 britains american empire 1713 many of britains possessions in the west indies were tiny islands mere dots on the caribbean sea.
however in 1713 these small pieces of land were by far the most valuable parts of the empire.
their sugar crops brought wealth to english merchants commerce to the northern colonies and a brutal life and early death to the hundreds of thousands of african slaves working on the plantations.
after 1650 sugar transformed barbados and the other islands into slave based plantation societies a change facilitated by english capital combined with the knowledge and experience of dutch merchants.
by 1680 an elite group of 175 planters described by one antislavery writer of the time as inhumane and barbarous dominated barbadoss economy they owned more than half of the island thousands of indentured servants and half of its more than 50 000 slaves.
in 1692 exploited irish servants and island born african slaves staged a major uprising which was brutally suppressed.
the leading principle in a slave society declared one west indian planter was to instill fear among workers and a commitment to absolute coercive force among masters.
as social inequality and racial conflict increased hundreds of english farmers fled to south carolina and the large island of jamaica.
but the days of caribbean smallholders were numbered.
english sugar merchants soon invested heavily in jamaica by 1750 it had seven hundred large sugar plantations worked by more than 105 000 slaves and had become the wealthiest british colony.
sugar was a rich mans crop because it could be produced most efficiently on large plantations.
scores of slaves planted and cut the sugarcane which was then processed by expensive equipment crushing mills part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 number of africans arriving alive in the americas and europe 9 645 000 british north america 500 000 europe 175 000 dutch america 500 000 west indies spanish central america 1 500 000 portuguese brazil british 1 660 000 french 1 660 000 3 650 000 approx.

two thirds of the survivors ended up in brazil 3 65 million and the west indies 3 32 million where they worked primarily on sugar plantations.
half a million arrived directly from africa in the present day united states while many thousands more were traded to the mainland from the west indies.
boiling houses distilling apparatus into raw sugar molasses and rum.
the affluent planter merchants who controlled the sugar industry drew annual profits of more than 10 percent on their investment.
as scottish economist adam smith noted in his famous treatise the wealth of nations 1776 sugar was the most profitable crop grown in america or europe.
the impact on britain the south atlantic system brought wealth to the entire british and european economy and helped europeans achieve world economic leadership.
most british west indian plantations belonged to absentee owners who lived in england where they spent their profits and formed a powerful sugar lobby.
the explain navigation acts kept the british consequences sugar trade in the hands of how did the south atlantic british merchants who exported system affect the british it to foreign markets and by 1750 economy.
reshipments of american sugar and tobacco to europe accounted for half of british exports.
enormous profits also flowed into britain from the slave trade.
the value of the guns iron rum and cloth that were used to buy slaves was only about one tenth in the 1680s to one third by the 1780s of the value of the crops those slaves produced in america allowing english traders to sell slaves in the west indies for three to five times what they paid for them in africa.
these massive profits drove the slave trade.
at its height in the 1790s britain annually exported three hundred thousand guns to africa and a british ship carrying 300 to 350 slaves left an african port every other day.
this commerce stimulated the entire british economy.
english scottish and american shipyards built hundreds of vessels and thousands of people worked in trade related industries building port facilities and warehouses refining sugar and tobacco distilling rum from molasses and manufacturing textiles and iron products for the growing markets in africa and america.
more than one thousand british merchant ships were plying the atlantic by 1750 providing a supply of experienced sailors and laying the foundation for the supremacy of the royal navy.
africa africans and the slave trade as the south atlantic system enhanced european prosperity it imposed enormous costs on west and central africa.
between 1550 and 1870 the atlantic slave trade uprooted 11 million africans draining lands south of the sahara of people and wealth and changing african society map 3 3.
by directing commerce away from the savannas and the islamic world on the other side of the sahara the atlantic slave trade changed the economic and religious dynamics of the african interior.
it also fostered militaristic centralized states in the coastal areas.
africans and the slave trade warfare and slaving had been part of african life for centuries but the south atlantic system made slaving a favorite tactic of ambitious kings and plundering warlords.
whenever the king of barsally wants goods or brandy an observer noted the king goes and ransacks some of his enemies towns seizing the people and selling them supplying slaves became a way of life in the west african state of dahomey where the royal house monopolized the sale of slaves and used european guns to create a military despotism.
dahomeys army which included a contingent of 5 000 women raided the interior for captives between 1680 and 1730 dahomey annually exported 20 000 slaves from the chapter 3 trarza timbuktu rr.

with the rise of the slave trade some of these kingdoms became aggressive slavers.
dahomeys army for example seized tens of thousands of captives in wars with neighboring peoples and sold them to european traders.
about 14 percent of the captives died during the grueling middle passage the transatlantic voyage between africa and the americas.
most of the survivors labored on sugar plantations in brazil and the british and french west indies.
ports of allada and whydah.
the asante kings likewise used slaving to conquer states along the gold coast as well as muslim kingdoms in the savanna.
by the 1720s they had created a prosperous empire of 3 to 5 million people.
yet participation in the transatlantic slave trade remained a choice for africans not a necessity.
the powerful kingdom of benin famous for its cast bronzes and carved ivory prohibited for decades the export of all slaves male and female.
other africans atoned for their guilt for selling neighbors into slavery by building hidden shrines often in the household granary.
the trade in humans produced untold misery.
hundreds of thousands of young africans died and millions more endured a brutal life in the americas.
in part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 africa itself class divisions hardened as people of noble birth enslaved and sold those of lesser status.
gender relations shifted as well.
two thirds of the slaves sent across the atlantic were men partly because european planters paid more for men and stout men boys and partly because africans sold enslaved women locally and across the sahara as agricultural workers house servants and concubines.
the resulting sexual imbalance prompted african men to take several wives changing the meaning of marriage.
finally the expansion of the atlantic slave trade increased the extent of slavery in africa.
sultan mawlay ismail of morocco r 1672 1727 owned 150 000 black slaves obtained by trade in timbuktu and in wars he waged in senegal.
in africa as in the americas slavery eroded the dignity of human life.
the middle passage and beyond africans sold into the south atlantic system suffered the bleakest fate.
torn from their villages they were marched in chains to coastal ports their first passage in slavery.
then they endured the perilous middle passage to the new world in hideously overcrowded ships.
the captives had little to eat or drink and some died from dehydration.
the feces urine and vomit belowdecks prompted outbreaks of dysentery which took more lives.
i was so overcome by the heat stench and foul air that i nearly fainted reported a european doctor.
two views of the middle passage an 1846 watercolor on the right shows the cargo hold of a slave ship en route to brazil which imported large numbers of african slaves until the 1860s.
painted by a ships officer the work minimizes the brutality of the middle passage none of the slaves are in chains and captures the africans humanity and dignity.
the illustration on the left which was printed by englands abolitionist society shows the plan of a liverpool slave ship designed to hold 482 africans packed in with no more respect than that given to hogsheads of sugar and tobacco.
records indicate that the ship actually carried as many as 609 africans at once.

america c o m pa r e d olaudah equiano the brutal middle passage olaudah equiano claimed to have been born in igboland present day southern nigeria.
but vincent carretta of the university of maryland has discovered strong evidence that equiano was born in south carolina.
he suggests that equiano drew on conversations with african born slaves to create a fictitious account of his kidnapping at the age of eleven and a traumatic passage across the atlantic.
after being purchased by an english sea captain equiano bought his freedom in 1766.
in london he became an antislavery activist and in 1789 he published the memoir from which the following selections are drawn.
my father besides many slaves had a numerous family.
i was trained up from my earliest years in the art of war.
and my mother adorned me with emblems after the manner of our greatest warriors.
one day when all our people were gone out to their works as usual and only i and my dear sister were left to mind the house two men and a woman got over our walls and in a moment seized us both.
sold and carried through a number of places till.
at the end of six or seven months after i had been kidnapped i arrived at the sea coast.
i now saw myself deprived of all chance of returning to my native country.
i was soon put down under the decks and there i received such a salutation in my nostrils as i had never experienced in my life so that with the loathsomeness of the stench and crying together i became so sick and low that i was not able to eat nor had i the least desire to taste anything.
i now wished for the last friend death to relieve me but soon to my grief two of the white men offered me eatables and on my refusing to eat one of them held me fast by the hands and.
tied my feet while the other flogged me severely.
i had never experienced anything of this kind before and.
could i have got over the nettings i would have jumped over some slaves jumped overboard to drown rather than endure more suffering.
others staged violent shipboard revolts.
slave uprisings occurred on two thousand voyages roughly one of every ten atlantic passages.
nearly 100 000 slaves died in these insurrections and nearly 1 5 million others about 14 percent of those who were transported died of disease or illness on the month long journey america compared above.
for those who survived the atlantic crossing things only got worse as they passed into endless slavery.
life on the sugar plantations of northwestern brazil and the west indies was one of relentless the side.
one day when we had a smooth sea and moderate wind two of my wearied countrymen who were chained together.
preferring death to such a life of misery somehow made it through the nettings and jumped into the sea.
at last we came in sight of the island of barbados the white people got some old slaves from the land to pacify us.
they told us we were not to be eaten but to work and were soon to go on land where we should see many of our country people.
this report eased us much and sure enough soon after we were landed there came to us africans of all languages.
source the interesting narrative of the life of olaudah equiano or gustavus vassa the african written by himself london 1789 15 22 23 28 29.
questions for analysis 1.
what elements of equianos account might explain the average slave mortality rate of about 14 percent during the atlantic crossing.
assuming that carretta is correct and equiano was not born in africa why do you think he composed this fictitious narrative of his childhood instead of describing his own childhood in slavery.
exploitation.
slaves worked ten hours a day under the hot tropical sun slept in flimsy huts and lived on a starchy diet of corn yams and dried fish.
they were subjected to brutal discipline the fear of punishment is the principle we use.
to keep them in awe and order one planter declared.
when punishments came they were brutal.
flogging was commonplace some planters rubbed salt lemon juice or urine into the resulting wounds.
planters often took advantage of their power by raping enslaved women.
sexual exploitation was a largely unacknowledged but ubiquitous feature of part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 master slave relations something that many slave masters considered to be an unquestioned privilege of their position.
it was almost a constant practice with our clerks and other whites olaudah equiano wrote to commit violent depredations on the chastity of the female slaves thomas thistlewood was a jamaica planter who kept an unusually detailed journal in which he noted every act of sexual exploitation he committed.
in thirty seven years as a jamaica planter thistlewood recorded 3 852 sex acts with 138 enslaved women.
with sugar prices high and the cost of slaves low many planters simply worked their slaves to death and then bought more.
between 1708 and 1735 british planters on barbados imported about 85 000 africans however in that same time the islands black population increased by only 4 000 from 42 000 to 46 000.
the constant influx of new slaves kept the population thoroughly african in its languages religions and culture.
here wrote a jamaican observer each different nation of africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country.
and retain most of their native customs slavery in the chesapeake and south carolina west indian style slavery came to virginia and maryland following bacons rebellion.
taking advantage of the expansion of the british slave trade following the end of the royal african companys monopoly in 1698 elite planter politicians led a tobacco revolution and bought more africans putting these slaves to work on ever larger plantations.
by 1720 africans made up 20 percent of the chesapeake population by 1740 nearly 40 percent.
slavery had become a core institution no longer just one of several forms of unfree labor.
moreover slavery was now defined in racial terms.
virginia legislators prohibited sexual intercourse between english and africans and defined virtually all resident africans as slaves all servants imported or brought into this country by sea or land who were not christians in their native country shall be accounted and be slaves on the mainland as in the islands slavery was a system of brutal exploitation.
violence was common and the threat of violence always hung over masterslave relationships.
in 1669 virginias house of burgesses decreed that a master who killed a slave in the process of correcting him could not be charged with a felony since it would be irrational to destroy his own property.
from that point forward even the most extreme punishments were permitted by law.
slaves could not carry weapons or gather in large numbers.
slaveholders were especially concerned to discourage slaves from running away.
punishments for runaways commonly included not only brutal whipping but also branding or scarring to make recalcitrant slaves easier to identify.
virginia laws spelled out the procedures for capturing and returning runaway slaves in detail.
if a runaway slave was killed in the process of recapturing him the county would reimburse the slaves owner for his full value.
in some cases slave owners could choose to put runaway slaves up for trial if they were found guilty and executed the owner would be compensated for his loss thinking like a historian p 98.
despite the inherent brutality of the institution slaves in virginia and maryland worked under better conditions than those in the west indies.
many lived relatively long lives.
unlike sugar and rice which were killer crops that demanded strenuous labor in a tropical climate tobacco cultivation required steadier and less demanding labor in a more temperate environment.
workers planted young tobacco seedlings in spring hoed and weeded the crop in summer and in fall picked and hung the leaves to cure over the winter.
nor did diseases spread as easily in the chesapeake because plantation quarters were less crowded and more dispersed than those in the west indies.
finally because tobacco profits were lower than those from sugar planters treated their slaves less harshly than west indian planters did.
many tobacco planters increased their workforce by buying female slaves and encouraging them to have children.
in 1720 women made up more than onethird of the africans in maryland and the black population had begun to increase naturally.
be kind and indulgent to the breeding wenches one slave owner told his overseer and do not force them when with child upon any service or hardship that will be injurious to them by midcentury more than three quarters of the enslaved workers in the chesapeake were american born.
slaves in south carolina labored under much more oppressive conditions.
the colony grew slowly until 1700 when planters began to plant and export rice to southern europe where it was in great demand.
between 1720 and 1750 rice production increased fivefold.
to expand production planters imported thousands of africans some of them from rice growing societies.
by 1710 africans formed a majority of the total population eventually rising to 80 percent in ricegrowing areas figure 3 2.
most rice plantations lay in inland swamps and the work was dangerous and exhausting.
slaves planted weeded and harvested the rice in ankle deep mud.
chapter 3 40 000 blacks whites 30 000 black majority 20 000 10 000 figure 3 2 a black majority emerges in south carolina 1700 1740 between disease and the toll taken by the indian wars south carolinas white population hardly grew at all between 1690 and 1720.
but white planters imported thousands of enslaved africans to grow rice an extremely profitable plantation crop.
as early as 1705 the colony had a black majority which allowed the development among slaves of a strongly african influenced language and culture.
pools of stagnant water bred mosquitoes which transmitted diseases that claimed hundreds of african lives.
other slaves forced to move tons of dirt to build irrigation works died from exhaustion.
the labour required for growing rice is only fit for slaves a scottish traveler remarked and i think the hardest work i have seen them engaged in in south carolina as in the west indies and brazil there were many slave deaths and few births and the arrival of new slaves continually re africanized the black population.
an african american community emerges slaves came from many peoples in west africa and the central african regions of kongo and angola.
white planters welcomed ethnic diversity to deter slave revolts.
the safety of the plantations declared a widely read english pamphlet depends upon having negroes from all parts of guiny who do not understand each others languages and customs and cannot agree to rebel by accident or design most plantations drew laborers of many languages including kwa mande and kikongo.
among africans imported after the british atlantic world 1660 1750 1730 into the upper james river region of virginia 41 percent came from ethnic groups in present day nigeria and another 25 percent from west central africa.
the rest hailed from the windward and gold coasts senegambia and sierra leone.
in south carolina plantation owners preferred laborers from the gold coast and gambia who had a reputation as hardworking farmers.
but as african sources of slaves shifted southward after 1730 more than 30 percent of the colonys workers later came from kongo and angola.
initially the slaves did not think of themselves as africans or blacks but as members of a specific family clan or people wolof hausa ibo yoruba teke ngola and they sought out those who shared their language and customs.
in the upper james river region ibo men and women arrived in equal numbers married each other and maintained their ibo culture.
in most places though this was impossible.
slaves from varying backgrounds were thrown together and only gradually discovered common ground.
building community through painful trial and error slaves eventually discovered what limited freedoms their owners would allow them.
those who were not too rebellious or too recalcitrant were able to carve out precarious family lives though they were always in danger of being disrupted by sale or life threatening punishment and build the rudiments of a slave community.
one key to the development of families and communities was a more or less balanced sex ratio that encouraged marriage and family formation.
in south carolina the high death rate among slaves undermined ties of family and kinship but in the chesapeake after 1725 some slaves especially on larger plantations were able to create strong nuclear families and extended kin relations.
on one of charles carrolls estates in maryland 98 of the 128 slaves were members of two extended families.
these african american kin groups passed on family names traditions and knowledge to the next generation and thus a distinct culture gradually developed.
as one observer suggested blacks had created a separate world a nation within a nation as the slaves forged a new identity they carried on certain african practices but let others go.
many africans arrived in america with ritual scars that white compare and planters called country mark contrast ings these signs of ethnic iden how did the experiences of slaves in the chesatity fell into disuse on culturally peake differ from their diverse plantations.
ironically experiences in south on some plantations these afri carolina.
can markings were replaced by thinking like a historian servitude and slavery britains american colonies relied heavily on bound labor.
two forms predominated indentured servitude and african slavery.
the idea of being bound to a master is alien to most of us today the following texts allow us to glimpse some aspects of the experience.
in what ways were these two institutions similar and how did they differ.

ran away last night from james ringgold of eastern neck in kent county in the province of maryland the two following servant men one named james francis an indented servant for five years a middle sizd young fellow about 26 years of age of a smooth fair complexion his hair cut off is an englishman and speaks a little in the west country dialect was brought up to farming and husbandry had on a country kersey jacket and breeches blue fearnought jacket and an old dark colourd coat.
the other a lusty young mulatto fellow named toby a slave about the same age he is a well set clean limbd stout fellow neither a very bright or very dark mulatto has large nostrils is a likely fellow and when he talks drawls his words out in a very slow manner is no other way remarkable he had on the same sort of clothes with the other servant and one of them has a check or striped green and red everlasting jacket on or with them and perhaps the mulatto may set up for a cooper or carpenter having work at both those business and also understands plantation affairs.
whoever takes up and secures the above persons and gives notice so as their master gets them again shall have four pistoles reward for the white servant and six pistoles for the mulatto.
that this slave should runaway and attempt getting his liberty is very alarming as he has always been too kindly used if any thing by his master and one in whom his master has put great confidence and depended on him to overlook the rest of his slaves and he had no kind of provocation to go off.
it seems to be the interest at least of every gentleman that has slaves to be active in the beginning of these attempts.

brands or scars that identified them with their owners.
but other tangible markers of african heritage persisted including hairstyles motifs used in wood carvings and pottery the large wooden mortars and pestles used to hull rice and the design of houses in which rooms were arranged from front to back in a distinctive i pattern not side by side as was common in english dwellings.
musical instruments especially drums gourd rattles and a stringed instrument called a molo forerunner to the banjo helped africans preserve cultural traditions and eventually shape american musical styles.
african values also persisted.
some slaves passed down muslim beliefs and many more told their children of the spiritual powers of conjurers called obeah or ifa who knew the ways of the african gods.
enslaved yorubas consulted orunmila the god of fate and other africans a jamaican planter noted relied on obeah to revenge injuries and insults discover and punish thieves and adulterers and to predict the future resistance and accommodation slaves freedom of action was always dramatically circumscribed.
it became illegal to teach slaves to read and write and most slaves owned no property of their own.
because the institution of slavery rested on fear planters had to learn a ferocious form of cruelty.
slaves might be whipped restrained or maimed for any infraction large or small.
a female cook in a virginia household was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines she had one particularly on her head which locked her mouth so fast that she could scarcely speak and could not eat nor drink thomas jefferson who witnessed such punishments on his fathers virginia plantation noted that each generation of whites was nursed educated and daily exercised in tyranny and he concluded that the relationship between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most unremitting despotism on the one part and degrading submission on the other a fellow virginian planter george mason agreed every master is born a petty tyrant chapter 3 the british atlantic world 1660 1750 virginian luxuries c 1810 this painting by an unknown artist depicts the brutality and sexual exploitation inherent in a slave society.

the extent of white violence often depended on the size and density of the slave population.
as virginia planter william byrd ii complained of his slaves in 1736 numbers make them insolent in the northern colonies where slaves were few white violence was sporadic.
but plantation owners and overseers in the sugar and rice growing areas where africans outnumbered europeans eight or more to one routinely whipped assertive slaves.
they also prohibited their workers from leaving the plantation without special passes and called on their poor white neighbors to patrol the countryside at night.
despite the constant threat of violence some slaves ran away a very small number of them successfully.
in some parts of the americas for example in jamaica runaway slaves were able to form large independent maroon communities.
but on the mainland planters had the resources necessary to reclaim runaways and such communities were unusual and precarious.
more often slaves who spoke english and possessed artisanal skills fled to colonial towns where they tried to pass as free occasionally they succeeded.
slaves who did not run away were engaged in a constant tug of war with their owners over the terms of their enslavement.
some blacks bartered extra work for better food and clothes others seized a small privilege and dared the master to revoke it.
in this way sundays gradually became a day of rest asserted as a right rather than granted as a privilege.
when bargaining failed slaves protested silently by working slowly or stealing.
slave owners greatest fear trace change over was that their regime of terror time would fail and slaves would rise how much autonomy up to murder them in their could slaves attain and beds.
occasionally that fear was what did slave owners do realized.
in the 1760s in amherst to control them.
county virginia a slave killed four whites in elizabeth city county eight slaves strangled their master in bed.
but the circumstances of slavery made any larger scale uprising all but impossible.
to rebel against their masters slaves would have to be able to communicate secretly but effectively across long distances choose leaders they could trust formulate and disseminate strategy accumulate large numbers of weapons and ensure that no one betrayed their plans.
this was all but impossible in plantation slavery the preponderance of force was on the side of the slave owners and blacks who chose to rise up did so at their peril.
the stono rebellion the largest slave uprising in the mainland colonies south carolinas stono rebellion of 1739 illustrates the impossibility of success.
the catholic governor of spanish florida instigated the revolt by promising freedom to fugitive slaves.
by february 1739 at least 69 slaves had escaped to st augustine and rumors circulated that a conspiracy was formed by negroes in carolina to rise and make their way out of the province when war between england and spain broke out in september 75 africans rose in revolt and killed a number of whites near the part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 stono river.
according to one account some of the rebels were portuguese speaking catholics from the kingdom of kongo who hoped to escape to florida.
displaying their skills as soldiers decades of brutal slave raiding in kongo had militarized the society there the rebels marched toward florida with colours displayed and two drums beating though their numbers and organization were impressive the stono rebels were soon met by a wellarmed mounted force of south carolina militia.
in the ensuing battle 44 slaves were killed and the rebellion was suppressed preventing any general uprising.
in response frightened south carolinians cut slave imports and tightened plantation discipline.
the rise of the southern gentry as the southern colonies became full fledged slave societies life changed for whites as well as for blacks.
consider the career of william byrd ii 1674 1744.
byrds father a successful planter merchant in virginia hoped to marry his children into the english gentry.
to smooth his sons entry into landed society byrd sent him to england for his education.
but his statusconscious classmates shunned young byrd calling him a colonial a first bitter taste of the gradations of rank in english society.
other english rejections followed.
lacking aristocratic conidentify causes nections byrd was denied a how did the planter elite post with the board of trade maintain alliances with their smallholder passed over three times for the neighbors.
royal governorship of virginia and rejected as a suitor by a rich englishwoman.
in 1726 at age fifty two byrd finally gave up and moved back to virginia where he sometimes felt he was being buried alive accepting his lesser destiny as a member of the colonys elite byrd built an elegant brick mansion on the familys estate at westover sat in the best pew in the church and won an appointment to the governors council.
william byrd iis experience mirrored that of many planter merchants trapped in virginia and south carolina by their inferior colonial status.
they used their wealth to rule over white yeomen families and tenant farmers and relied on violence to exploit enslaved blacks.
planters used africans to grow food as well as tobacco to build houses wagons and tobacco casks and to make shoes and clothes.
by making their plantations self sufficient the chesapeake elite survived the depressed tobacco market between 1670 and 1720.
white identity and equality to prevent uprisings like bacons rebellion the chesapeake gentry found ways to assist middling and poor whites.
they gradually lowered taxes in virginia for example the annual head tax on each adult man fell from 45 pounds of tobacco in 1675 to just 5 pounds in 1750.
they also encouraged smallholders to improve their economic lot by using slave labor and many did so.
by 1770 60 percent of english families in the chesapeake owned at least one slave.
on the political front planters now allowed poor yeomen and some tenants to vote.
the strategy of the leading families the carters lees randolphs and robinsons was to bribe these voters with rum money and the promise of minor offices in county governments.
in return they expected the yeomen and tenants to elect them to office and defer to their rule.
this horse trading solidified the authority of the planter elite which used its control of the house of burgesses to limit the power of the royal governor.
hundreds of yeomen farmers benefitted as well tasting political power and garnering substantial fees and salaries as deputy sheriffs road surveyors estate appraisers and grand jurymen.
even as wealthy chesapeake gentlemen formed political ties with smallholders they took measures to set themselves apart culturally.
as late as the 1720s leading planters were boisterous aggressive men who lived much like the common folk hunting drinking gambling on horse races and demonstrating their manly prowess by forcing themselves on female servants and slaves.
as time passed however the planters began like william byrd ii to model themselves on the english aristocracy remaining sexual predators but learning from advice books how to act like gentlemen in other regards i must not sit in others places nor sneeze nor cough in peoples faces.
nor with my fingers pick my nose nor wipe my hands upon my clothes cultivating gentility a refined but elaborate lifestyle they replaced their modest wooden houses with mansions of brick and mortar.
planters educated their sons in london as lawyers and gentlemen.
but unlike byrds father they expected them to return to america marry local heiresses and assume their fathers roles managing plantations socializing with fellow gentry and running the political system.
wealthy chesapeake and south carolina women likewise emulated the english elite.
they read english newspapers and fashionable magazines wore the finest english clothes and dined in the english fashion including an elaborate afternoon tea.
to enhance their daughters gentility and improve their marriage prospects parents hired english tutors.
once married chapter 3 planter women deferred to their husbands reared pious children and maintained elaborate social networks in time creating a new ideal the southern gentlewoman.
using the profits generated by enslaved africans in the south atlantic system of commerce wealthy planters formed an increasingly well educated refined and stable ruling class.
the northern maritime economy the south atlantic system had a broad geographical reach.
as early as the 1640s new england farmers supplied the sugar islands with bread lumber fish and meat.
as a west indian explained planters had rather buy foode at very deare rates than produce it by labour soe infinite is the profitt of sugar works by 1700 the economies of the west indies and new england were closely interwoven.
soon farmers and merchants in new york new jersey and pennsylvania were also shipping wheat corn and bread to the caribbean.
by the 1750s about two thirds of new englands exports and half of those from the middle atlantic colonies went to the british and french sugar islands.
the sugar economy linked britains entire atlantic empire.
in return for the sugar they sent to england west indian planters received credit in the form of bills of exchange from london merchants.
the planters used these bills to buy slaves from africa and to pay north american farmers and merchants for their provisions and shipping services.
the mainland colonists then exchanged the bills for british manufactures primarily textiles and iron goods.
the urban economy the west indian trade created the first american merchant fortunes and the first urban industries.
merchants in boston newport providence philadelphia and new york invested their profits in new ships some set up manufacturing enterprises including twenty six refineries that processed raw sugar into finished loaves.
mainland distilleries turned west indian molasses into rum producing more than 2 5 million gallons in massachusetts alone by the 1770s.
merchants in salem marblehead and smaller new england ports built a major fishing industry by selling salted mackerel and cod to the sugar islands and to southern europe.
baltimore merchants transformed their town into a major the british atlantic world 1660 1750 port by developing a bustling export business in wheat while traders in charleston shipped deerskins indigo and rice to european markets map 3 4.
as transatlantic commerce expanded from five hundred voyages a year in the 1680s to fifteen hundred annually in the 1730s american port cities grew in size and complexity.
by 1750 the populations of newport and charleston were nearly 10 000 boston had 15 000 residents and new york had almost 18 000.
the largest port was philadelphia whose population by 1776 had reached 30 000 the size of a large european provincial city.
smaller coastal towns emerged as centers of the lumber and shipbuilding industries.
seventy sawmills lined the piscataqua river in new hampshire providing low cost wood for homes warehouses and especially shipbuilding.
hundreds of shipwrights turned out oceangoing vessels while other artisans made ropes sails and metal fittings for the new fleet.
by the 1770s colonial built ships made up one third of the british merchant fleet.

and wheat to carry to new york and philadelphia for export to the west indies and europe.
by the 1750s hundreds of professional teamsters in maryland were transporting 370 000 bushels of wheat and corn and 16 000 barrels of flour to urban markets each year more than 10 000 wagon trips.
to service this traffic entrepreneurs and artisans set up taverns horse stables and barrel making shops in towns along the wagon roads.
lancaster the town that hosted the iroquois conference described in the chapter opening in a prosperous wheat growing area of pennsylvania boasted more than 200 german and english artisans and a dozen merchants.
urban society wealthy merchants dominated the social life of seaport cities.
in 1750 about 40 merchants controlled more than 50 percent of philadelphias trade.
like the chesapeake gentry urban merchants imitated the british upper classes importing architectural design books from england and building georgian style mansions to display their wealth.
their wives strove to create a genteel culture by buying fine furniture and entertaining guests at elegant dinners.

however by 1750 american born merchants in boston new york and philadelphia had seized control of the commerce between the mainland and the west indies.
in addition newport traders played a small role in the slave trade from africa and boston and charleston merchants grew rich carrying fish and rice to southern europe.
artisan and shopkeeper families the middle ranks of seaport society made up nearly half the population.
innkeepers butchers seamstresses shoemakers weavers bakers carpenters masons and dozens of other skilled workers toiled to gain an income sufficient to maintain their families in modest comfort.
wives and husbands often worked as a team and taught the mysteries of the craft to their children.
some artisans aspired to wealth and status an entrepreneurial ethic that prompted them to hire apprentices and expand production.
however most artisans were not well todo.
during his working life a tailor was lucky to accumulate 30 worth of property far less than the 2 000 owned at death by an ordinary merchant or the 300 listed in the probate inventory of a successful blacksmith.
laboring men and women formed the lowest ranks of urban society.
merchants needed hundreds of dockworkers to unload manufactured goods and molasses from inbound ships and reload them with barrels of wheat fish and rice.
for these demanding jobs merchants used enslaved blacks and indentured servants who together made up 30 percent of the workforce in philadelphia and new york city until the 1750s otherwise they hired unskilled wageworkers.
poor white and black women eked out a living by washing clothes spinning wool or working as servants or prostitutes.
to make ends meet laboring families sent their children out to work.
periods of stagnant commerce threatened the financial security of merchants and artisans alike.
for laborers seamen and seamstresses whose chapter 3 the british atlantic world 1660 1750 the greenwood lee family 1747 born in massachusetts and apprenticed as an engraver john greenwood 1727 1792 painted dozens of commissioned works there before moving to surinam in 1752.

the sugar and slave based south atlantic system and cycles of imperial warfare brought economic uncertainty as well as opportunity to the people of the northern colonies.
the new politics of empire 1713 1750 the south atlantic system also changed the politics of empire.
british ministers pleased with the wealth produced by the trade in slaves sugar rice and tobacco ruled the colonies with a gentle hand.
the colonists took advantage of that leniency to strengthen their political institutions and eventually to challenge the rules of the mercantilist system.
the rise of colonial assemblies after the glorious revolution representative assemblies in america copied the english whigs and limited the powers of crown officials.
in massachusetts during the 1720s the assembly repeatedly ignored the kings instructions to provide the royal governor with a permanent salary and legislatures in north carolina new jersey and pennsylvania did the same.
using such tactics the legislatures gradually took control of taxation and appointments angering imperial bureaucrats and absentee proprietors.
the people in power in america complained william penn during a struggle with the pennsylvania assembly think nothing taller than themselves but the trees leading the increasingly powerful assemblies were mem identify causes bers of the colonial elite.
although what explains the increasing political autonomy of most property owning white men the colonies in the eighhad the right to vote only men teenth century.
of wealth and status stood for election.
in new jersey in 1750 90 percent of assemblymen came from influential political families figure 3 3.
in virginia seven members of the wealthy lee family sat in the house of burgesses and along with other powerful families dominated its major committees.
in new england affluent descendants of the original puritans formed a core of political leaders.
go into every village in new england john adams wrote in 1765 and you will find that the office of justice of the peace and even the place of representative have generally descended from generation to generation in three or four families at most however neither elitist assemblies nor wealthy property owners could impose unpopular edicts on the people.
purposeful crowd actions were a fact of colonial life.

by 1750 the percentage whose fathers or other relatives had served in the assembly reached 90 percent indeed some members had seven relatives who were or had been political leaders clear testimony of the emergence of powerful political families and an experienced governing elite.
however as the conflict with britain increased after 1765 voters in new jersey and elsewhere ousted lukewarm patriots and new families entered the political ranks.
dominion of new england in 1689.
in new york mobs closed houses of prostitution in salem massachusetts they ran people with infectious diseases out of town and in new jersey in the 1730s and 1740s mobs of farmers battled with proprietors who were forcing tenants off disputed lands.
when officials in boston restricted the sale of farm produce to a single public market a crowd destroyed the building and its members defied the authorities to arrest them.
if you touch one you shall touch all an anonymous letter warned the sheriff and we will show you a hundred men where you can show one these expressions of popular discontent combined with the growing authority of the assemblies created a political system that was broadly responsive to popular pressure and increasingly resistant to british control.
salutary neglect british colonial policy during the reigns of george i r 1714 1727 and george ii r 1727 1760 allowed for this rise of american self government as royal bureaucrats pleased by growing trade and import duties relaxed their supervision of internal colonial affairs.
in 1775 british political philosopher edmund burke would praise this strategy as salutary neglect.
salutary neglect was a by product of the political system developed by sir robert walpole the whig leader in the house of commons from 1720 to 1742.
by providing supporters with appointments and pensions walpole won parliamentary approval for his policies.
however his patronage appointments filled the british government including the board of trade and the colonial bureaucracy with do nothing political hacks.
when governor gabriel johnson arrived in north carolina in the 1730s he vowed to curb the powers of the assembly and make a mighty change in the face of affairs receiving little support from the board of trade johnson renounced reform and decided to do nothing which can be reasonably blamed and leave the rest to time and a new set of inhabitants walpoles tactics also weakened the empire by undermining the legitimacy of the political system.
radical whigs protested that walpole had betrayed the glorious revolution by using patronage the practice of giving offices and salaries to political allies and bribery to create a strong court or kingly party.
the country party whose members were landed gentlemen likewise warned that walpoles policies of high taxes and a bloated royal bureaucracy threatened british liberties.
heeding these arguments colonial legislators complained that royal governors abused their patronage powers.
to preserve american liberty the colonists strengthened the powers of the representative assemblies unintentionally laying the foundation for the american independence movement american voices p 108.
protecting the mercantile system in 1732 walpole provided a parliamentary subsidy for the new colony of georgia.
while georgias reformminded trustees envisioned the colony as a refuge for britains poor walpole had little interest in social reform he subsidized georgia to protect the valuable rice growing colony of south carolina.
the subsidy however did exactly the opposite.
britains expansion into georgia outraged spanish officials who were chapter 3 the british atlantic world 1660 1750 succession 1740 1748.
massive french armies battled british subsidized german forces in europe and french naval forces roamed the west indies vainly trying to conquer a british sugar island.
three thousand new england militiamen supported by a british naval squadron in 1745 captured louisbourg the french fort guarding the entrance to the st lawrence river.
to the dismay of new england puritans who feared invasion from catholic quebec the treaty of aix la chapelle 1748 returned louisbourg to france.
the treaty made it clear to colonial leaders that england would act in its own interests not theirs.
mercantilism and the american colonies sir robert walpole the kings minister all eyes are on the secretary of the treasury sir robert walpole left as he offers advice to the speaker of the house of commons.
a brilliant politician walpole used patronage to command a majority in the commons and also won the confidence of george i and george ii the german speaking monarchs from the duchy of hanover.
walpoles personal motto let sleeping dogs lie helps explain his colonial policy of salutary neglect.

already angry about the rising tide of smuggled british manufactures in new spain.
to counter britains commercial imperialism spanish naval forces stepped up their seizure of illegal traders in the process mutilating an english sea captain robert jenkins.
yielding to parliamentary pressure walpole declared war on spain in 1739.
the so called war of jenkinss ear 1739 1741 was a fiasco for britain.
in 1740 british regulars failed to capture st augustine because south carolina whites still shaken by the stono rebellion refused to commit militia units to the expedition.
a year later an assault on the prosperous seaport of cartagena in present day colombia also failed 20 000 british sailors and soldiers and 2 500 colonial troops died in the attack mostly from tropical diseases.
the war of jenkinss ear quickly became part of a general european conflict the war of the austrian though parliament prohibited americans from manufacturing textiles woolen act 1699 hats hat act 1732 and iron products such as plows axes and skillets iron act 1750 it could not prevent the colonies from maturing economically.
american merchants soon controlled over 75 percent of the transatlantic trade in manufactures and 95 percent of the commerce between the mainland and the british west indies see map 3 4 p 104.
moreover by the 1720s the british sugar islands could not absorb all the flour fish and meat produced by mainland settlers.
so ignoring britains intense rivalry with france colonial merchants sold their produce to the french sugar islands.
when american rum distillers began to buy cheap molasses from the french islands the west indian sugar lobby in london persuaded parliament to pass the molasses act of 1733.
the act placed a high tariff on french molasses so high that it would no longer be profitable for american merchants to import it.
colonists protested that the molasses act would cripple the distilling industry cut farm exports and by slashing colonial income reduce the mainlands purchases of british goods.
when parliament ignored these arguments american merchants smuggled in french molasses by bribing customs officials.
the lack of currency in the colonies prompted another conflict with british officials.
to pay for british manufactures american merchants used the bills of exchange and the gold and silver coins earned in the west indian trade.
these payments drained the colonial economy of money making it difficult for americans to borrow funds or to buy and sell goods among themselves.
to remedy the problem ten colonial assemblies established public land banks which lent paper money american voices the rise of colonial self government between 1700 and 1760 members of the representative assemblies in british north america gradually expanded their authority and power.
their success was the result of greater popular participation in politics and their own political skills.
however the shift in power from imperial appointees to colonial legislators occurred in a piecemeal fashion as the almost unconscious product of a series of small seemingly inconsequential struggles.
as you read the following correspondence among legislators governors and british officials look closely at the character of the disputes and how they were resolved.
alexander spotswood confronting the house of burgesses as a reward for his military service fighting the forces of louis xiv of france alexander spotswood became governor of virginia in 1710.
a contentious man spotswood was a controversial governor.
he told the house of burgesses to its face that the voters had mistakenly chosen a set of representatives whom heaven has not generally endowed with the ordinary intellectual or social qualifications requisite to legislators spotswood set out to reform the voting system that in his judgment produced such mediocre representatives.
his efforts to oust popular members of the gentry from the house of burgesses created few friends in 1722 his enemies in virginia used their influence in london to have him removed from office.
to ye council of trade virginia october 15 1712 my lords.
the indians continue their incursions in north carolina and the death of colo hyde their govr which happened the beginning of last month increases the misery of that province.
this unhappy state of her majts subjects in my neighbourhood is ye more affecting to me because i have very little hopes of being enabled to relieve them by our assembly which i have called to meet next week for the mob of this country having tried their strength in the late election and finding themselves able to carry whom they please have generally chosen representatives of their own class who as their principal recommendation have declared their resolution to raise no tax on the people let the occasion be what it will.
this is owing to a defect in the constitution which allows to every one tho but just out of the condition of a servant and that can but purchase half an acre of land an equal vote with the man of the best estate in the country.
the militia of this colony is perfectly useless without arms or ammunition and by an unaccountable infatuation no arguments i have used can prevail on these people to make their militia more serviceable or to fall into any other measures for the defence of their country.
from the journal of the virginia council december the 17th 1714 the governor this day laying before the council a letter from the right honorable the lords commissioners for trade dated the 23d of april 1713 directing him to advise with the council to recommend to the generall assembly to pass a law for qualifying the electors the persons elected burgesses to serve in the generall assembly of this colony in a more just equal manner than the laws now in force do direct.
the council declare that they cannot advise the governor to move for any alteration in the present method of electing of burgesses some being of opinion that this is not a proper time others that the present manner of electing of burgesses the qualifications of the elected is sufficiently provided for by the laws now in force.
to mr secretary james stanhope july 15 1715.
i cannot forbear regretting yt i must always have to do with ye representatives of ye vulgar people and mostly with such members as are of their stamp and understanding for so long as half an acre of land which is of small value in this country qualifys a man to be an elector the meaner sort of people will ever carry ye elections and the humour generally runs to choose such men as are their most familiar companions who very eagerly seek to be burgesses merely for the lucre of the salary and who for fear of not being chosen again dare in assembly do nothing that may be disrelished disapproved out of the house by ye common people.
hence it often happens yt what appears prudent and feasible to his majestys governors and council here will not pass with the house of burgesses upon whom they must depend for the means of putting their designs in execution.

george clinton a plea for assistance george clinton served as governor of new york from 1744 to 1752.
like many governors during the era of salutary neglect clinton owed his appointment to political connections in england.
as the second son of the seventh earl of lincoln he would inherit neither the familys estate nor his fathers position in the house of lords those went to his elder brother.
to provide an income for clinton his family traded its votes in parliament for patronage appointments.
however once clinton was installed as governor of new york he found himself dependent on the assembly for the payment of his salary and the salaries of all members of his administration.
my lords i have in my former letters informd your lordships what incroachments the assemblys of this province have from time to time made on his majestys prerogative authority in this province in drawing an absolute dependence of all the officers upon them for their saleries reward of their services by their taking in effect the nomination to all officers.
1stly that the assembly refuse to admit of any amendment to any money bill in any part of the bill so that the bill must pass as it comes from the assembly or all the supplies granted for the support of government the most urgent services must be lost.
2ndly it appears that they take the payment of the military forces passing of muster rolls into their own hands by naming the commissaries for those purposes in the act.
3rdly they by granting the saleries to the officers personally by name not to the officer for the time being intimate that if any person be appointed to any office his salery must depend upon their approbation of the appointment.
i must now refer it to your lordships consideration whether it be not high time to put a stop to these usurpations of the assembly on his majestys authority in this province and for that purpose may it not be proper that his majesty signify his disallowance of the act at least for the payment of saleries.

in 1745 a british naval squadron led a flotilla of colonial ships and thousands of new england militiamen in an attack on the french fort at louisbourg on cape breton island near the mouth of the st lawrence river.
after a siege of forty days the anglo american force captured the fort long considered impregnable.
the victory was bittersweet because the treaty of aix la chapelle 1748 returned the island to france.

to farmers who pledged their land as collateral for the loans.
farmers used the currency to buy tools or livestock or to pay creditors thereby stimulating trade.
however some assemblies particularly the legislature in rhode island issued huge quantities of paper money which consequently decreased in value and required merchants to accept it as legal tender.
english merchants and other creditors rightly complained about being forced to accept devalued money.
so in 1751 parliament passed the currency act which barred the new england colonies from establishing new land banks and prohibited the use of publicly issued paper money to pay private debts.
these conflicts over trade and paper money angered a new generation of english political leaders.
in 1749 charles townshend of the board of trade charged that the american assemblies had assumed many of the ancient and established prerogatives wisely preserved in the crown and he vowed to replace salutary neglect with more rigorous imperial control.
the wheel of empire had come full circle.
in the 1650s england had set out to create a centrally managed atlantic empire and over the course of a century achieved the military and economic aspects of that goal.
mercantilist legislation maritime warfare commercial expansion and the forced labor of a million african slaves brought prosperity to britain.
however internal unrest the glorious revolution and a policy of salutary neglect had weakened britains political authority over its american colonies.
recognizing the threat self government posed to the empire british officials in the late 1740s vowed to reassert their power in america an initiative with disastrous results.
summary in this chapter we examined processes of change in politics and society.
the political story began in the 1660s as britain imposed controls on its american possessions.
parliament passed the acts of trade and navigation to keep colonial products and trade in english hands.
then king james ii abolished representative institutions in the northern colonies and created the authoritarian dominion of new england.
following the glorious revolution the navigation acts remained in place and tied the american economy to that of britain.
but the uprisings of 1688 1689 overturned james iis policy of strict imperial control restored colonial self government and ushered in an era of salutary political neglect.
it also initiated a long era of imperial warfare in which native american peoples allied themselves to the colonies and often served as proxy warriors against frenchand spanish allied peoples pursuing their own goals in the process.
the social story centers on the development of the south atlantic system of production and trade which chapter 3 involved an enormous expansion in african slave raiding the atlantic slave trade and the cultivation of sugar rice and tobacco in america.
this complex system created an exploited african american labor force in the southern mainland and west indian colonies while it allowed european american farmers chapter review merchants and artisans on the north american mainland to prosper.
how would the two stories play out.
in 1750 slavery and the south atlantic system seemed firmly entrenched but the days of salutary neglect appeared numbered.

macallisters air of liberty did not last forever as the rapid increase in white settlers and the arrival of nearly 300 000 enslaved africans transformed life throughout mainland british north america.
long settled towns in new england became overcrowded and antagonistic ethnic and religious communities jostled uneasily with one another in the middle atlantic colonies in 1748 there were more than a hundred german lutheran and reformed congregations in quaker led pennsylvania.
by then the macallisters and thousands of other celtic and german migrants had altered the social landscape and introduced religious conflict into the southern backcountry.

part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 new englands freehold society in the 1630s the puritans had fled england where a small elite of nobles and gentry owned 75 percent of the arable land while tenants renters and propertyless workers farmed it.
in new england the puritans created a yeoman society of relatively equal landowning farm families.
but by 1750 the migrants numerous descendants had parceled out the best farmland threatening the future of the freehold ideal.
farm families women in the household economy the puritans vision of social equality did not extend to women and their ideology placed the husband firmly at the head of the household.
in the well ordered family 1712 the reverend benjamin wadsworth of boston advised women since he is thy husband god has made him the head and set him above thee it was a wifes duty to love and reverence her husband.
women learned this subordinate role throughout their lives.
understand small girls watched their mothers points of view defer to their fathers and as what ideas instituyoung women they were told to tions and responsibilities be silent in company they saw shaped new england farm the courts prosecute more women womens lives.
than men for the crime of fornication sex outside of marriage and they found that their marriage portions would be inferior to those of their brothers.
thus ebenezer chittendon of guilford connecticut left his land to his sons decreeing that each daughter shall have half so much as each son one half in money and the other half in cattle throughout the colonies women assumed the role of dutiful helpmeets helpmates to their husbands.
in addition to tending gardens farmwives spun thread and yarn from flax and wool and then wove it into cloth for shirts and gowns.
they knitted sweaters and stockings made candles and soap churned milk into butter fermented malt for beer preserved meats and mastered dozens of other household tasks.
notable women those who excelled at domestic arts won praise and high status thinking like a historian p 118.
bearing and rearing children were equally important tasks.
most women in new england married in their early twenties and by their early forties had given birth to six or seven children delivered with the help of a female neighbor or a midwife.
one massachusetts mother confessed that she had little time for religious activities because the care of my babes takes up so large a portion of my time and attention yet most puritan congregations were filled with women in a church of between three and four hundred communicants the eminent minister cotton mather noted there are but few more than one hundred men all the rest are women womens lives remained tightly bound by a web of legal and cultural restrictions.
ministers praised women for their piety but excluded them from an equal role in the church.
when hannah heaton a connecticut farmwife grew dissatisfied with her prudence punderson 1758 1784 the first second and last scenes of mortality this powerful image reveals both the artistic skills of colonial women in the traditional medium of needlework and the puritans continuing cultural concern with the inevitability of death.
prudence punderson the connecticut woman who embroidered this scene rejected a marriage proposal and followed her loyalist father into exile on long island in 1778.
sometime later she married a cousin timothy rossiter and bore a daughter sophia who may well be the baby in the cradle being rocked by jenny a slave owned by prudences father.
long worried by my ill state of health and perhaps now anticipating her own death prudence has inscribed her initials on the coffin and in creating this embroidery transformed her personal experience into a broader meditation on the progression from birth to motherhood to death.

chapter 4 congregationalist minister thinking him unconverted and a blind guide she sought out equality minded quaker and evangelist baptist churches that welcomed questioning women such as herself and treated saved women equally with men.
however by the 1760s many evangelical congregations had reinstituted mens dominance over women.
the government of church and state must be.
family government controlled by its king declared the danbury connecticut baptist association.
farm property inheritance by contrast european men who migrated to the colonies escaped many traditional constraints including the curse of landlessness.
the hope of having land of their own becoming independent of landlords is what chiefly induces people into america an official noted in the 1730s.
owning property gave formerly dependent peasants a new social identity.
unlike the adventurers seeking riches in other parts of the americas most new england migrants wanted farms that would provide a living for themselves and ample land for their children.
in this way they hoped to secure a competency for their families the ability to keep their households solvent and independent and to pass that ability on to the next generation.
parents who could not give their offspring land placed these children as indentured servants in more prosperous households.
when the indentures ended at age eighteen or twenty one propertyless sons faced a decadeslong climb up the agricultural ladder from laborer to tenant and finally to freeholder.
sons and daughters in well to do farm families were luckier they received a marriage portion when they were in their early twenties.
that portion land livestock or farm equipment repaid them for their past labor and allowed parents to choose their marriage partners.
parents security during old age depended on a wise choice of son or daughter in law.
although the young people could refuse an unacceptable match they did not have the luxury of falling in love with and marrying whomever they pleased.
marriage under eighteenth century english common law was not a contract between equals.
a bride relinquished to her husband the legal ownership of all her property.
after his death she received a dower right the right to use though not sell one third of the familys property.
on the widows death or remarriage her portion was divided among the children.
thus the widows property rights were subordinate to those of the family line which stretched across the generations.
growth diversity and conflict 1720 1763 a fathers duty was to provide inheritances for his children so that one day they could be for themselves men who failed to do so lost status in the community.
some fathers willed the family farm to a single son and provided other children with money an apprenticeship or uncleared frontier tracts.
other yeomen moved their families to the frontier where life was hard but land was cheap and abundant.
the squires house stands on the bank of the susquehannah traveler philip fithian reported from the pennsylvania backcountry in the early 1760s.
he tells me that he will be able to settle all his sons and his fair daughter betsy on the fat of the earth freehold society in crisis because of rapid natural increase new englands population doubled each generation from 100 000 in 1700 to nearly 200 000 in 1725 to almost 400 000 in 1750.
farms had been divided and then subdivided making them so small 50 acres or less that parents could provide only one child with an adequate inheritance.
in the 1740s the reverend samuel chandler of andover massachusetts was much distressed for land for his children seven of them young boys.
a decade later in nearby concord about 60 percent of the farmers owned less land than their fathers had.
because parents had less to give their sons and daughters they had less control over their childrens lives.
the traditional system of arranged marriages broke down as young people engaged in premarital sex and then used the urgency of pregnancy to win permission to marry.
throughout new england premarital conceptions rose dramatically from about 10 percent of firstborn children in the 1710s to more than 30 percent in the 1740s.
given another chance young people would do the same again an anglican minister observed because otherwise they could not obtain their parents consent to marry even as new england families changed they maintained the freeholder ideal.
some parents chose to have smaller families and used birth control to do so abstention identify causes coitus interruptus or primitive what factors threatened condoms.

connecticut and eventually new hampshire and vermont.
still others improved their farms productivity by replacing the traditional english crops of wheat and barley with high yielding potatoes thinking like a historian womens labor as these documents show women bore the responsibility for a wide variety of work from keeping up households to supporting themselves independently.

farmers plowed fields owned by artisans and shopkeepers who repaid them with shoes furniture or store credit.

they nevertheless struggled to populate their estates.
most tenant families hoped that with hard work and ample sales they could eventually buy their own farmsteads.
but preindustrial technology limited output.
a worker with a hand sickle could reap only half an acre of wheat rye or oats a day.
the cradle scythe a tool introduced during the 1750s doubled or tripled the amount of grain one worker could cut.
even so a family with two adult workers could reap only about 12 acres of grain or roughly 150 to 180 bushels of wheat.
after saving enough grain for food and seed the surplus might be worth 15 enough to buy salt and sugar tools and cloth but little else.

which type of colony tribute plantation or neo european was likely to have been most important to the french and dutch.
but the proprietors of each colony like the manor lords of new york had enormous land claims.
the first migrants lived simply in small one or two room houses with a sleeping loft a few benches or stools and some wooden platters and cups.
economic growth brought greater prosperity along with conflicts between ordinary settlers and the proprietors who tried to control their access to land resources and political power.
william penns early appeals to british quakers and continental protestants led to a boom in immigrants.
when these first arrivals reported that pennsylvania and new jersey were the best poor mans country in the world thousands more followed.
soon the proprietors of both colonies were overwhelmed by the demand for land.
by the 1720s many new migrants were forced to become squatters settling illegally on land they hoped eventually to be able to acquire on legal terms.
frustration over the lack of land led the penn family to perpetrate one of the most infamous land frauds of the eighteenth century the so called walking purchase of 1737 in which they exploited an old and probably part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 fraudulent indian deed to claim more than a million acres of prime farmland north of philadelphia.
this purchase while opening new lands to settlement poisoned indian relations in the colony.
delaware and shawnee migration to western pennsylvania and the ohio valley which was already under way accelerated rapidly in response.
immigrants flooded into philadelphia which grew from 2 000 people in 1700 to 25 000 by 1760.
many families came in search of land for them philadelphia was only explain a temporary way station.
other consequences migrants came as laborers includhow did rapid immigration and economic growth triging a large number of indentured ger conflict in the middle servants.
some were young colonies.
unskilled men but the colonys explosive growth also created a strong demand for all kinds of skilled laborers especially in the construction trades.
pennsylvania and new jersey grew prosperous but contentious.
new jersey was plagued by contested land titles and ordinary settlers rioted against the proprietors in the 1740s and the 1760s.
by the 1760s eastern pennsylvania landowners with large farms were using slaves and poor scots irish migrants to grow wheat.
other ambitious men were buying up land and dividing it into small tenancies which they lent out on profitable leases.
still others sold farming equipment and manufactured goods or ran mills.
these large scale farmers rural landlords speculators storekeepers and gristmill operators formed a distinct class of agricultural capitalists.
they built large stone houses for their families furnishing them with four poster beds and expensive mahogany tables on which they laid elegant linen and imported dutch dinnerware.
by contrast one half of the middle colonies white men owned no land and little personal property.
some were the sons of smallholding farmers and would eventually inherit some land.
but many were scots irish or german inmates single men or families explained a tax assessor such as live in small cottages and have no taxable property except a cow in the predominantly german township of lancaster pennsylvania a merchant noted an abundance of poor people who maintain their families with great difficulty by day labour although these workers hoped eventually to become landowners rising land prices prevented many from realizing their dreams.
cultural diversity the middle atlantic colonies were not a melting pot.
most european migrants held tightly to their traditions creating a patchwork of ethnically and religiously diverse communities figure 4 2.

emigration from germany peaked in the 1740s but the number of migrants from ireland scotland england and wales continued to increase during the 1760s and early 1770s.
most migrants including those from ireland were protestants.
chapter 4 in philadelphia including anglicans baptists quakers swedish and german lutherans mennonites scotsirish presbyterians and roman catholics.
migrants preserved their cultural identity by marrying within their ethnic groups.
a major exception was the huguenots calvinists who had been expelled from catholic france in the 1680s and resettled in holland england and the british colonies.
huguenots in american port cities such as boston new york and charleston quickly lost their french identities by intermarrying with other protestants.
more typical were the welsh quakers in chester county pennsylvania 70 percent of the children of the original welsh migrants married other welsh quakers as did 60 percent of the third generation.
in pennsylvania and western new jersey quakers shaped the culture because of their numbers wealth and social cohesion.
most quakers came from english counties with few landlords and brought with them growth diversity and conflict 1720 1763 traditions of local village governance popular participation in politics and social equality.
but after 1720 the growth of german and scots irish populations challenged their dominance.
the german influx the quaker vision of a peaceable kingdom attracted 100 000 german migrants who had fled their homelands because of military conscription religious persecution and high taxes.
first to arrive in 1683 were the mennonites religious dissenters drawn by the promise of freedom of worship.
in the 1720s a larger wave of german migrants arrived from the overcrowded villages of southwestern germany and switzerland.
wages were far better in pennsylvania heinrich schneebeli reported to his friends in zurich and one also enjoyed there a free unhindered exercise of religion a third wave of germans and swiss nearly 40 000 strong landed in philadelphia between 1749 and 1756.
to help pay a quaker meeting for worship quakers dressed plainly and met for worship in unadorned buildings sitting in silence until inspired by an inner light women spoke during meetings on terms of near equality to men a tradition that prepared quaker women to take a leading part in the nineteenth century womens rights movement.

the costs of the expensive trip from the rhine valley german immigrants pioneered the redemptioner system a flexible form of indentured servitude that allowed families to negotiate their own terms upon arrival.
families often indentured one or more children while their parents set up a household of their own.
germans soon dominated many districts in eastern pennsylvania and thousands more moved down the fertile shenandoah valley into the western backcountry of maryland virginia and the carolinas map 4 2.

they generally avoided politics except to protect their cultural practices for example they insisted that married women have the legal right to hold property and write wills as they did in germany.
scots irish settlers migrants from ireland who numbered about 115 000 were the most numerous of the incoming europeans.
some were irish and catholic but most were scots and presbyterian the descendants of the calvinist protestants sent to ireland during the seventeenth century to solidify english rule there.
once in ireland the scots faced hostility from both irish catholics and english officials and landlords.
the irish test act of 1704 restricted voting and office holding to members of the church of england english mercantilist regulations placed heavy import duties on linens made by scots irish weavers and farmers paid heavy taxes.

although ministers in pennsylvania could not invoke government authority to uphold religious values the result was not social anarchy.
instead religious sects enforced moral behavior through communal self discipline.
quaker families attended a weekly meeting for worship and a monthly meeting for business every three months a committee reminded parents to provide proper religious instruction.
the committee also supervised adult behavior a chester county meeting for example disciplined a member to reclaim him from drinking to excess and keeping vain company significantly quaker meetings allowed couples to marry only if they had land and livestock sufficient to support a family.

by the 1750s politics throughout the middle colonies roiled with conflict.
in new york a dutchman declared that he valued english law no more than a turd while in pennsylvania benjamin franklin disparaged the boorish character and swarthy complexion of german migrants.
yet there was broad agreement on the importance of economic opportunity and liberty of conscience.
the unstable balance between shared values and mutual mistrust prefigured tensions that would pervade an increasingly diverse american society in the centuries to come.

two great european cultural movements the enlightenment which emphasized the power of human reason to understand and shape the world and pietism an evangelical christian movement that stressed the individuals personal relationship with god reached america as a result.
at the same time an abundance of imported goods began to reshape material culture bringing new comforts into the lives of the middling sort while allowing prosperous merchants and landowners to set themselves apart from their neighbors in new ways.
n h l ontario l commerce culture and identity dutch german french quaker map 4 3 religious diversity in 1750 by 1750 religious diversity was on the rise not only in the multiethnic middle colonies but also in all of british north america.
baptists had increased their numbers in new england long the stronghold of congregationalists and would soon become important in virginia.
already there were considerable numbers of presbyterians lutherans and german reformed in the south where anglicanism was the established religion.
transportation and the print revolution in the eighteenth century improved transportation networks opened britains colonies in new ways and british shipping came to dominate the north atlantic.
in 1700 britain had 40 000 sailors by 1750 the number had grown to 60 000 while many more hailed from the colonies.
an enormous number of vessels plied atlantic waters in the late 1730s more than 550 ships arrived in boston annually.
about a tenth came directly from britain or ireland the rest came mostly from other british colonies either on the mainland or in the west indies.
a road network slowly took shape as well though roadbuilding was expensive and difficult.
in 1704 sarah kemble knight traveled from boston to new york on horseback.
the road was smooth and even in some places treacherous in others it took eight days of hard riding to cover 200 miles.
forty years later a physician from annapolis maryland traveled along much better roads to portsmouth new hampshire and back more than 1 600 miles in all.
he spent four months on the road stopping frequently to meet the locals and satisfy his curiosity.
by the mid eighteenth century the great wagon road carried migrating families down the shenandoah valley as far as the carolina backcountry.
all of these water and land routes carried people produce and finished merchandise.
they also carried information as letters newspapers pamphlets and crates of books began to circulate widely.
the trip across the atlantic took seven to eight weeks on average so chapter 4 the news arriving in colonial ports was not fresh by our standard but compared to earlier years the colonies were awash in information.
until 1695 the british government had the power to censor all printed materials.
in that year parliament let the licensing act lapse and the floodgates opened.
dozens of new printshops opened in london and britains provincial cities.
they printed newspapers and pamphlets poetry ballads and sermons and handbills tradesmans cards and advertisements.
larger booksellers also printed scientific treatises histories travelers accounts and novels.
the result was a print revolution.
in britain and throughout europe print was essential to the transmission of new ideas and both the enlightenment and pietism took shape in part through its growing influence.
all this material crossed the atlantic and filled the shops of colonial booksellers.
the colonies also began printing their own newspapers.
in 1704 the boston newsletter was founded by 1720 boston had five printing presses and three newspapers and by 1776 the thirteen colonies that united in declaring independence had thirty seven newspapers among them.
this world of print was essential to their ability to share grievances and join in common cause.
the enlightenment in america to explain the workings of the natural world some colonists relied on folk wisdom.
swedish migrants in pennsylvania attributed magical powers to the great white mullein a common wildflower and treated fevers by tying the plants leaves around their feet and arms.
traditionally christians believed that the earth stood at the center of the universe and god and satan intervened directly and continuously in human affairs.
the scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries challenged these ideas and educated people most of them christians began to modify their views accordingly.
the european enlightenment in 1543 the polish astronomer copernicus published his observation that the earth traveled around the sun not vice versa.
copernicuss discovery suggested that humans occupied a more modest place in the universe than christian theology assumed.
in the next century isaac newton in his principia mathematica 1687 used the sciences of mathematics and physics to explain the movement of the planets around the sun and invented calculus in the process.
though newton was himself profoundly religious in the long run his work growth diversity and conflict 1720 1763 undermined the traditional christian understanding of the cosmos.
in the century between the principia mathematica and the french revolution of 1789 the philosophers of the european enlightenment used empirical research and scientific reasoning to study all aspects of life including social institutions and human behavior.
enlightenment thinkers advanced four fundamental principles the lawlike order of the natural world the power of human reason the natural rights of individuals including the right to self government and the progressive improvement of society.
english philosopher john locke was a major contributor to the enlightenment.
in his essay concerning human understanding 1690 locke stressed the impact of environment and experience on human behavior and beliefs arguing that the character of individuals place events and societies was not fixed but in context could be changed through edu what conditions and ideas cation rational thought and lay behind the emergence purposeful action.
lockes two of the enlightenment in treatises of government 1690 america.
advanced the revolutionary theory that political authority was not given by god to monarchs as james ii had insisted see chapter 3.
instead it derived from social compacts that people made to preserve their natural rights to life liberty and property.
in lockes view the people should have the power to change government policies or even their form of government.
some clergymen responded to these developments by devising a rational form of christianity.
rejecting supernatural interventions and a vengeful calvinist god congregationalist minister andrew eliot maintained that there is nothing in christianity that is contrary to reason the reverend john wise of ipswich massachusetts used lockes philosophy to defend giving power to ordinary church members.
just as the social compact formed the basis of political society wise argued so the religious covenant among the lay members of a congregation made them not the bishops of the church of england or even ministers like himself the proper interpreters of religious truth.
the enlightenment influenced puritan minister cotton mather as well.
when a measles epidemic ravaged boston in the 1710s mather thought that only god could end it but when smallpox struck a decade later he used his newly acquired knowledge of inoculation gained in part from a slave who told him of the practices success in africa to advocate this scientific preventive for the disease.

franklins contributions benjamin franklin was the exemplar of the american enlightenment.
born in boston in 1706 to devout calvinists he grew to manhood during the print revolution.
apprenticed to his brother a boston printer franklin educated himself through voracious reading.
at seventeen he fled to philadelphia where he became a prominent printer and in 1729 he founded the pennsylvania gazette which became one of the colonies most influential newspapers.
franklin also formed a club of mutual improvement that met weekly to discuss morals politics or natural philosophy these discussions as well as enlightenment literature shaped his thinking.
as franklin explained in his autobiography 1771 from the different books i read i began to doubt of revelation god revealed truth like a small number of urban artisans wealthy virginia planters and affluent seaport merchants franklin became a deist.
deism was a way of thinking not an established religion.
my own mind is my own church said deist thomas paine.
i am of a sect by myself added thomas jefferson.
influenced by enlightenment science deists such as jefferson believed that a supreme being or grand architect created the world and then allowed it to operate by natural laws but did not intervene in peoples lives.
rejecting the divinity of christ and the authority of the bible deists relied on natural reason their innate moral sense to define right and wrong.
thus franklin a onetime slave owner came to question the morality of slavery repudiating it once he recognized the parallels between racial bondage and the colonies political bondage to britain.
franklin popularized the practical outlook of the enlightenment in poor richards almanack 1732 1757 an annual publication that was read by thousands.
he also founded the american philosophical society 1743 present to promote useful knowledge adopting this goal in his own life franklin invented bifocal lenses for eyeglasses the franklin stove and the lightning rod.
his book on electricity published in england in 1751 won praise as the greatest contribution to science since newtons discoveries.
inspired by chapter 4 growth diversity and conflict 1720 1763 with god pietism appealed to believers hearts rather than their minds american voices p 130.
in the 1720s german migrants carried pietism to america sparking a religious revival or renewal of religious enthusiasm in pennsylvania and new jersey where dutch minister theodore jacob frelinghuysen preached passionate sermons to german settlers and encouraged church members to spread the message of spiritual urgency.
a decade later william tennent and his son gilbert copied frelinghuysens approach and led revivals among scots irish presbyterians throughout the middle atlantic region.
benjamin franklins rise this portrait of benjamin franklin attributed to robert feke and executed around 1746 portrays franklin as a successful businessman.
his ruffled collar and cuffs his fashionably curly wig and his sober but expensive suit reveal his social ambitions.
in later portraits after he gained fame as an enlightenment sage he dispensed with the wig and chose more unaffected poses but in 1746 he was still establishing his credentials as a young philadelphia gentleman on the rise.

franklin ambitious printers in americas seaport cities published newspapers and gentlemens magazines the first significant nonreligious periodicals to appear in the colonies.
the european enlightenment then added a secular dimension to colonial cultural life foreshadowing the great contributions to republican political theory by american intellectuals of the revolutionary era john adams james madison and thomas jefferson.
american pietism and the great awakening as some colonists turned to deism thousands of others embraced pietism a christian movement originating in germany around 1700 and emphasizing pious behavior hence the name.
in its emotional worship services and individual striving for a mystical union new england revivalism simultaneously an american born pietist movement appeared in new england.
revivals of christian zeal were built into the logic of puritanism.
in the 1730s jonathan edwards a minister in northampton massachusetts encouraged a revival there that spread to towns throughout the connecticut river valley.
edwards guided and observed the process and then published an account entitled a faithful narrative of the surprising work of god printed first in london 1737 then in boston 1738 and then in german and dutch translations.
its publication history highlights the transatlantic network of correspondents that gave pietism much of its vitality.
whitefields great awakening english minister george whitefield transformed the local revivals of edwards and the tennents into a great awakening.
after whitefield had his personal awakening upon reading the german pietists he became a follower of john wesley the founder of english methodism.
in 1739 whitefield carried wesleys fervent message to america where he attracted huge crowds from georgia to massachusetts.
whitefield had a compelling presence.
he looked almost angelical a young slim slender youth.
cloathed with authority from the great god wrote a connecticut farmer.
like most evangelical preachers whitefield did not read his sermons but spoke from memory.
more like an actor than a theologian he gestured eloquently raised his voice for dramatic effect and at times assumed a female persona as a woman in labor struggling to deliver the word of god.
when the young preacher told his spellbound listeners that they had sinned and must seek salvation some suddenly felt a new light within them.
as the power of god come down hannah heaton recalled my knees smote together.
and it seemed to me i was a sinking down into hell.
but then i resigned my distress and was perfectly easy quiet and calm.
and it seemed as american voices evangelical religion and enlightenment rationalism two great historical movements enlightenment thought and pietistic religion swept across british north america in the eighteenth century and offered radically different indeed almost completely contradictory worldviews.
pietism sparked religious revivals based on passion and emotion while enlightenment rationalism encouraged personal restraint and intellectual logic.
both movements shaped american cultural development pietism transformed american religious life and enlightenment thinking influenced the principles of the american government.

i believe in christ and i know that i put my whole trust in him and he that believeth in him shall not be ashamed nor be confounded.
why do you mourn when i rejoice.
you should not it is no more for me to die and leave my friends for the great love i have for christ than for me to go to sleep.
i have no fears of death in my mind.
christ has the keys of death and hell and blessed are the dead that die in the lord.

he struggled for two years before coming to believe that he was saved.
franklin stood at the center of the american enlightenment.
in his autobiography he outlined his religious views and his human centered moral principles.
after hearing whitefield i began to think i was not elected and that god made some for heaven and me for hell.
and i thought god was not just in so doing.
my heart then rose against god exceedingly for his making me for hell now this distress lasted almost two years the importance of a virtuous life my parents had early given me religious impressions and brought me through my childhood piously in the dissenting way.
but i was scarce 15 when after doubting by turns of several points as i found them disputed in the different books i read i began to doubt of revelation itself.
some books against deism fell into my hands.
it happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them for the arguments of the deists that were quoted in those books appeared to me much stronger than the refutations.
in short i soon became a thorough deist.
i grew convincd that truth sincerity integrity in dealings between man man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life and i formd written resolutions which still remain in my journal book to practice them ever while i lived.
about the year 1734.
there arrived among us from ireland a young presbyterian preacher named hemphill who delivered with a good voice apparently extempore most excellent discourses which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions who joind in admiring them.
among the rest i became one of his constant hearers his sermons pleasing me as they had little of the dogmatical kind but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue or what in the religious stile are called good works.
those however of our congregation who considered themselves as orthodox presbyterians disapprovd his doctrine and were joind by most of the old clergy who arraignd him of heterodoxy before the synod in order to have him silencd.
i became his zealous partisan.
i never was without some religious principles i never doubted for instance the existance of the deity that he made the world governd it by his providence that the most acceptable service of god was the doing good to man that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be punished virtue rewarded either here or hereafter these i esteemd the essentials of every religion.
and government.
i shall consider man in a state of natural being as a free born subject under the crown of heaven and owing homage to none but god himself.
it is certain civil government in general is a very admirable result of providence and an incomparable benefit to mankind yet must needs be acknowledged to be the effect of humane free compacts and not of divine institution it is the produce of mans reason of humane and rational combinations and not from any direct orders of infinite wisdom.
the prime immunity in mans state is that he is most properly the subject of the law of nature.
he is the favourite animal on earth in that this part of gods image viz.
reason is congenate with his nature wherein by a law immutable instampt upon his frame god has provided a rule for men in all their actions obliging each one to the performance of that which is right not only as to justice but likewise as to all other moral vertues which is nothing but the dictate of right reason founded in the soul of man.
the second great immunity of man is an original liberty instampt upon his rational nature.
he that intrudes upon this liberty violates the law of nature.
the third capital immunity belonging to mans nature is an equality amongst men which is not to be denyed by the law of nature till man has resigned himself with all his rights for the sake of a civil state and then his personal liberty and equality is to be cherished and preserved to the highest degree.

benjamin franklin published the first edition of this journal of his voyage in philadelphia in 1739 the copy pictured here was printed a year later.
texts like this one highlight the importance of the print revolution to eighteenth century culture whitefield was utterly unknown in north america until he began publicizing his ministry and his travels through such works.
enlightenment ideas too were conveyed to large and far flung audiences in books magazines and newspapers.

the rise of print intersected with this enthusiasm.
religion is become the subject of most conversations the pennsylvania gazette reported.
no books are in request but those of piety and devotion whitefield and his circle did their best to answer the demand for devotional reading.
as he traveled whitefield regularly sent excerpts of his journal to be printed in newspapers.
franklin printed whitefields sermons and journals by subscription and found them to be among his best selling titles.
printed accounts of whitefields travels conversion narratives sermons and other devotional literature helped to confirm pietists in their faith and strengthen the communication networks that sustained them.

but the new lights refused to be silenced.

the great awakening undermined legally established churches and their tax supported ministers.
in new england new lights left the congregational church and founded 125 separatist churches that supported their ministers through voluntary contributions figure 4 3.
other religious dissidents joined baptist congregations which also condemned government support of churches god never allowed any civil state upon earth to impose religious taxes declared baptist preacher isaac backus.
in new york and new jersey the dutch reformed church split in two as new lights refused to accept doctrines imposed by conservative church authorities in holland.

by 1780 however largely because of their enthusiastic evangelical message presbyterian and baptist congregations outnumbered those of the anglicans.
the growth of immigrant denominations such as the german reformed and lutheran was equally impressive.
anglican congregations half the pulpits were empty.
in this circumstance itinerant preachers who stressed the power of heart religion and downplayed the importance of formal ministerial training found a ready audience.
the great awakening challenged the authority of all ministers whose status rested on respect for their education and knowledge of the bible.
in an influential pamphlet the dangers of an unconverted ministry 1740 gilbert tennent asserted that ministers authority should come not from theological knowledge but from the conversion experience.
reaffirming martin luthers belief in the priesthood of all christians tennent suggested that anyone who had felt gods redeeming grace could speak with ministerial authority.

traditionally planters and their well dressed families arrived at anglican services in fancy carriages drawn by well bred horses and flaunted their power by sitting in the front pews.
such ritual displays of the gentrys superiority were meaningless if freeholders attended other churches.
moreover religious pluralism threatened the tax supported status of the anglican church.
to halt the spread of new light ideas virginia governor william gooch denounced them as false teachings and anglican justices of the peace closed presbyterian churches.

however in the 1760s native born african americans in virginia welcomed the baptists message that all people were equal in gods eyes.
sensing a threat to the system of racial slavery the house of burgesses imposed heavy fines on baptists who preached to slaves without their owners permission.
baptists threatened gentry authority because they repudiated social distinctions and urged followers to call one another brother and sister they also condemned the planters decadent lifestyle.

by 1775 about 15 percent of virginias whites and hundreds of enslaved blacks had joined baptist baptism in the schuylkill river the baptist movement which made adult baptism central to its religious practice gained enormous influence during the great awakening.
baptists presented a challenge to the social order in new england where isaac backus and other leaders vigorously opposed the power of established congregationalist churches.
they presented an even graver threat to established authority in virginia where they ministered to african american slaves and ridiculed the pretensions of the gentry.

the midcentury challenge war trade and social conflict 1750 1763 between 1750 and 1763 three significant events transformed colonial life.
first britain went to war against the french in america sparking a worldwide conflict the great war for empire.
second a surge in trade boosted colonial consumption but caused americans to become deeply indebted to british creditors.
third westward migration sparked warfare with indian peoples violent disputes between settlers and land speculators and backcountry rebellions against easterncontrolled governments.
the french and indian war in 1754 overlapping french and british claims in north america came to a head map 4 4.
the french maintained their vast claims through a network of forts and trading posts that sustained alliances with neighboring indians.
the soft underbelly of this sprawling empire was the ohio valley where french claims were tenuous.
native peoples were driven out of the valley by iroquois attacks in the seventeenth century but after 1720 displaced indian populations especially delawares and shawnees from pennsylvania resettled there in large numbers.
in the 1740s british traders from pennsylvania began traveling down the ohio growth diversity and conflict 1720 1763 river.
they traded with delawares and shawnees in the upper valley and began to draw french allied indians into their orbit and away from french posts.
then in 1748 the ohio company of virginia a partnership of prominent colonial planters and london merchants received a 200 000 acre grant from the crown to establish a new settlement on the upper ohio threatening french claims to the region.
conflict in the ohio valley by midcentury britain relied on the iroquois confederacy as its partner in indian relations throughout the northeast.
by extending the covenant chain the iroquois had become a kind of indian empire in their own right claiming to speak for other groups throughout the region based on their seventeenth century conquests.
the delawares shawnees and other groups who repopulated the ohio valley did so in part to escape the iroquois yoke.
to maintain influence on the ohio the iroquois sent two half kings tanaghrisson an adopted seneca and scarouady an oneida to the native settlement of logstown a trading town on the upper ohio where britain recognized them as leaders.
french authorities alarmed by british inroads built a string of forts from lake erie to the headwaters of the ohio culminating with fort duquesne on the site of present day pittsburgh.
to reassert british claims governor dinwiddie dispatched an expedition led by colonel george washington a twenty twoyear old virginian whose half brothers were ohio company stockholders.
washington discovered that most of the ohio indians had decided to side with the french only the iroquois half kings and a few of their followers supported his efforts.
after washingtons party fired on a french detachment tanaghrisson rushed in and killed a french officer to ensure war a prospect that would force british arms to support iroquois interests in the valley.
washingtons party was soon defeated by a larger french force.
the result was an international incident that prompted virginian and british expansionists to demand war.
but war in north america was a worrisome prospect the colonies were notoriously incapable of cooperating in their own defense and the covenant chain was badly in need of repair.
the albany congress the iroquois confederacy was unhappy with its british alliance and believed that the british were neglecting the iroquois while settlers from new york pressed onto their lands.
moreover the ohio indians france and britain were all acting in the ohio valley without consulting them.

as a british official remarked to preserve the ballance between us and the french is the great ruling principle of modern indian politics when britain expelled france from north america in 1763 indians had to face encroaching anglo american settlers on their own.

his speech at the albany congress of 1754 in which he urged great britain toward war was reported in newspapers in britain and the colonies and made him a transatlantic celebrity.
this print was advertised for sale in london bookstalls just as his death at the battle of lake george 1755 was being reported in newspapers there.

in june 1755 british and new england troops captured fort beausjour in the disputed territory of nova scotia which the french called acadia.
soldiers from puritan massachusetts then forced nearly 10 000 french settlers from their lands arguing they were rebels without property rights and deported them to france the west indies and louisiana where acadians became cajuns.
english and scottish protestants took over the farms the french catholics left behind.
this anglo american triumph was quickly offset by a stunning defeat.
in july 1755 general edward braddock advanced on fort duquesne with a force of 1 500 british regulars and virginia militiamen.
braddock alienated potential allies by treating indians including tanaghrisson dismissively and denying the privilege of rank to colonial officers like george washington.
persuaded that british arms could easily triumph in the american backcountry he was instead routed by a french and indian force.
braddock was killed and more than half his troops were killed or wounded.
we have been beaten most shamefully beaten by a handfull of men george washington complained bitterly as he led the survivors back to virginia.
the great war for empire by 1756 the american conflict had spread to europe where it was known as the seven years war and pitted britain and prussia against france spain and austria.

as braddock neared the fort the french garrison of 200 troops and about 600 indian allies mostly potawatomis ottawas shawnees and delawares set out to ambush his force.
instead they unexpectedly met the british along a narrow roadway.
as the french and indians fanned out to attack from the woods the british troops george washington reported were struck with such a panic that they behaved with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive.
the officers behaved gallantly in order to encourage their men for which they suffered greatly the british casualties 450 killed 500 wounded included general braddock pictured above who later died from his wounds.

when britain mounted major offensives in india west africa and the west indies as well as in north america the conflict became the great war for empire.
william pitt emerged as the architect of the british war effort.
pitt was a committed expansionist with a touch of arrogance.
i know that i can save this country and that i alone can he boasted.
a master strategist he planned to cripple france by seizing its colonies.
in north america he enjoyed a decisive demographic advantage since george iis 2 million subjects outnumbered the french 14 to 1.
to mobilize the colonists pitt paid half the cost of their troops and supplied them with arms and equipment at a cost of 1 million a year.
he also committed a fleet of british ships and 30 000 british soldiers to the conflict in america.
beginning in 1758 the powerful anglo american forces moved from one triumph to the next in part because they brought indian allies back into the fold.
they forced the french to abandon fort duquesne renamed fort pitt and then captured fort louisbourg a stronghold at the mouth of the st lawrence.
in 1759 an armada led by british general james wolfe sailed down the st lawrence and took quebec the heart of frances american empire.

in 1758 british and colonial troops attacked the heartland of new france capturing quebec in 1759 and montreal in 1760.
this conquest both united and divided the allies.
colonists celebrated the great victory the illuminations and fireworks exceeded any that had been exhibited before reported the south carolina gazette.
however british officers had little respect for colonial soldiers.
said one they are the dirtiest most contemptible cowardly dogs you can conceive ousted french traders from india and british forces seized french senegal in west africa.
they also captured the rich sugar islands of martinique and guadeloupe in the french west indies but at the insistence of the west indian sugar lobby which wanted to protect its monopoly the ministry returned the islands to france in the treaty of paris of 1763.
despite that controversial decision the treaty confirmed britains triumph.
it granted britain sovereignty over half of north america including french canada all french territory east of the mississippi river spanish florida and the recent conquests in africa and india.
britain had forged a commercial and colonial empire that was nearly worldwide.
though britain had won cautious support from some native american groups in the late stages of the war its territorial acquisitions alarmed many native peoples from new york to the mississippi who preferred the presence of a few french traders to an influx of thousands of anglo american settlers.

following his example indians throughout the great lakes and ohio valley seized nearly every british military garrison west of fort niagara besieged fort pitt and killed or captured more than 2 000 settlers.
part 2 british north america and the atlantic world 1660 1763 british military expeditions defeated the delawares near fort pitt and broke the siege of detroit but it took the army nearly two years to reclaim all the posts it had lost.
in the peace settlement pontiac and his allies accepted the british as their new political fathers the british ministry having learned how expensive it was to control the trans appalachian west issued the royal proclamation of 1763 which confirmed indian control of the region and declared it off limits to colonial settlement.
it was an edict that many colonists would ignore.
british industrial growth and the consumer revolution britain owed its military and diplomatic success to its unprecedented economic resources.
since 1700 when it had wrested control of many oceanic trade routes from the dutch britain had become the dominant commercial power in the atlantic and indian oceans.
by 1750 it was also becoming the first country to use new manufacturing technology and work discipline to expand output.
this combination of commerce and industry would soon make britain the most powerful nation in the world.
mechanical power was key to britains industrial revolution.
british artisans designed and built water mills and steam engines that efficiently powered a wide array of machines lathes for shaping wood jennies and looms for spinning and weaving textiles and hammers for forging iron.
compared with traditional manufacturing methods the new power driven machinery produced woolen and linen textiles iron tools furniture and chinaware in greater quantities and at lower cost.
moreover the entrepreneurs running the new workshops drove their employees hard forcing them to keep pace with the machines and work long hours.
to market the abundant factory produced goods english and scottish merchants extended credit to colonial shopkeepers for a full year instead of the traditional six months.
americans soon were purchasing 30 percent of all british exports.

by the late 1750s settlers from connecticut and pennsylvania were at war burning down their rivals houses and barns.
delawares with their own claim to the valley were caught in the crossfire.
in april 1763 the delaware headman teedyuscung was burned to death in his cabin in retaliation teedyuscungs son captain bull led a war party that destroyed a community of connecticut settlers.
simultaneously three distinct but related land disputes broke out in the hudson river valley map 4 6.
dutch tenant farmers wappinger indians and migrants from massachusetts asserted ownership rights to lands long claimed by manorial families such as the van rensselaers and the livingstons.
when the manor lords turned to the legal system to uphold their claims dutch and english farmers in westchester dutchess and albany counties rioted to close the courts.
in response new yorks royal governor ordered british troops to assist local sheriffs and manorial bailiffs they suppressed the tenant uprisings intimidated the wappingers and evicted the massachusetts squatters.
other land disputes erupted in new jersey and the southern colonies where landlords and english aristocrats had successfully revived legal claims based on long dormant seventeenth century charters.
one although britains consumer revolution raised living standards it landed many consumers and the colonies as a whole in debt figure 4 4.
even during the wartime boom of the 1750s exports paid for only 80 percent of british imports.
britain financed the remaining 20 percent the americans trade deficit through the extension of credit and pitts military expenditures.
when the military subsidies ended in 1763 the colonies fell into an economic recession.
merchants looked anxiously at their overstocked warehouses and feared bankruptcy.
i think we have a gloomy prospect before us a philadelphia trader noted in 1765.
