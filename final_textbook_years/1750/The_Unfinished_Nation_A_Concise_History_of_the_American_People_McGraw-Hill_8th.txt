136 chapter 6 compromise the delegates bickered for weeks.
by the end of june with both temperature and tempers rising the convention seemed in danger of collapsing.
finally on july 2 the convention created a grand committee comprised of one delegate from each state which produced the great compromise a proposal that became the basis of the great compromise it called for a two house legislature.
in the lower house the states would be represented on the basis of population each slave would be counted as three fifths of a free person in determining the basis for both representation and direct taxation.
in the upper house the states would be represented equally with two members apiece.
on july 16 1787 the convention voted to accept the compromise.
in the next few weeks the convention agreed to another important compromise.
to placate southern delegates who feared the new government would interfere with slavery the convention agreed to bar the new government from stopping the slave trade for twenty years.
some significant issues remained unaddressed.
the constitution provided no definition of citizenship.
nor did it resolve the status of native american tribes.
most important to unresolved issues many americans was the absence of a list of individual rights which would restrain the powers of the national government.
madison opposed the idea arguing that specifying rights that were reserved to the people would in effect limit those rights.
others however feared that without such protections the national government might abuse its new authority.
the constitution of 1787 many people contributed to the creation of the american constitution but the most important person in the process was james madison.
madison had devised the virginia plan and he did most of the drafting of the constitution itself.
madisons most important achievement however was in helping resolve two important philosophical questions the the question of sovereignty question of sovereignty and the question of limiting power.
for historians evolving views on the constitutions purpose see debating the past the meaning of the constitution how could a national government exercise sovereignty concurrently with state governments.
where did ultimate sovereignty lie.
the answer madison and his contemporaries decided was that all power at all levels of government flowed ultimately from the people.
thus neither the federal government nor the state governments were truly sovereign.
all of them derived their authority from below.
the resolution of the problem of sovereignty made possible one of the distinctive features of the constitution its federalism or division of powers between the national and state governments.
the constitution and the government it created were to be the supreme law of the land.
at the same time however the constitution left important powers in the hands of the states.
in addition to solving the question of sovereignty the constitution produced a distinctive solution to the problem of concentrated authority.
drawing from the ideas of the french philosopher baron de montesquieu most americans had long believed that the best way to avoid tyranny was to keep government close to the people.
a large nation would breed corruption and despotism because distant rulers could not be controlled by the people.
madison however helped break the grip of these assumptions by arguing that a large republic would be less likely to produce tyranny because no single group would ever be able to dominate it.
the idea of many centers of power checking one another and preventing any single despotic authority from emerging also helped shape the the constitution and the new republic 137 internal structure of the federal government.
the constitutions most distinctive feature was its separation of powers within the government managed by a system of checks and balances among the legislative executive and judicial branches.
the forces within the government would constantly compete with one another.
congress would have two chambers each checking the other since both would have to agree before any law could be passed.
the president would have the power to veto acts of congress.
the federal courts would be protected from both the executive and the legislature because judges would serve for life.
the federal structure of the government was designed to protect the united states from the kind of despotism that americans believed had emerged in england.
but it was also designed to protect the nation from another kind of despotism the tyranny of the people.
shayss rebellion most of the founders believed had been only one example of what could happen if a nation did not defend itself against the unchecked exercise of popular will.
thus in the new government only the members checks on exercise of popular will of the house of representatives would be elected directly by the people.
senators would be chosen by state legislators.
the president would be chosen by an electoral college.
federal judges would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate.
on september 17 1787 thirty nine delegates signed the constitution.
the constitution of 1787 was a document that established a democratic republic for white people mostly white men.
native americans and african americans the two largest population groups sharing the lands of the united states with anglo americans enjoyed virtually none of the rights and privileges offered to the white population.
limited democracy native americans had at least the semblance of a legal status within the nation through treaties that assured them lands that would be theirs forever.
but most of these treaties did not survive for long and native groups found themselves driven farther and farther west without very much of the protection that the government had promised them.
among the white leaders of the united states there were eminent figures who believed native americans could in fact join the republic as citizens.
thomas jefferson was among them believing that they could be taught the ways of civilization jefferson sought to teach the native americans to live as white americans did.
efforts to teach them anglo farming methods were based on sedentary farms that relied on men doing the farming and women caring for the home.
native americans had no interest in such ways and preferred to retain their own traditional cultures.
their repudiation of white civilization contributed to the erosion of support among white americans.
they were not granted citizenship of the united states until the 1920s.
far more removed from the guarantees of the constitution were enslaved african americans who were given virtually none of the rights and protections that the new government provided to white people.
they were not one southern official noted constituent members of our society the french canadian writer hector st john de crvecoeur who after the revolution settled in the united states wrote a famous book in 1782 titled letters from an american farmer.
in it he posed what became a famous question what then is the american this new man.
crvecoeur answered his own question by noting that individuals of all nations would become melted into a common citizenry.
but he saw no room for african americans in the new community.
indeed among the first laws passed by the new united states under the constitution was the naturalization act of 1790 which helped legalize the stream of immigrants coming into the country and allowed them to become citizens.
but it defined citizenry as a status available only to white people.
even free black people were barred from inclusion.
debating the past the meaning of the constitution the constitution of the united states inspired debate from the moment it was drafted.
some argue that the constitution is a flexible document intended to evolve in response to societys evolution.
others counter that it has a fixed meaning rooted in the original intent of the framers and that to move beyond that is to deny its value.
historians too disagree about why the constitution was written and what it meant.
to some scholars the creation of the federal system was an effort to preserve the ideals of the revolution and to create a strong national government capable of exercising real authority.
to others the constitution was an effort to protect the economic interests of existing elites even at the cost of betraying the principles of the revolution.
and to still others the constitution was designed to protect individual freedom and to limit the power of the federal government.
the first influential exponent of the heroic view of the constitution as the culmination of the revolution was john fiske whose book the critical period of american history 1888 painted a grim picture of political life under the articles of confederation.
many problems including economic difficulties the weakness and ineptitude of the national government threats from abroad interstate jealousies and widespread lawlessness beset the new nation.
fiske argued that only the timely adoption of the constitution saved the young republic from disaster.
in an economic interpretation of the constitution of the united states 1913 charles a.
beard presented a powerful challenge to fiskes view.
according to beard the 1780s had been a critical period primarily for conservative business interests who feared 138 that the decentralized political structure of the republic imperiled their financial position.
such men he claimed wanted a government able to promote industry and trade protect private property and perhaps most of all make good the public debt much of which was owed to them.
the constitution was beard claimed an economic document drawn with superb skill by men whose property interests were immediately at stake and who won its ratification over the opposition of a majority of the people.
a series of powerful challenges to beards thesis emerged in the 1950s.
the constitution many scholars now began to argue was not an effort to preserve property but an enlightened effort to ensure stability and order.
robert e brown for example argued in 1956 that absolutely no correlation could be shown between the wealth of the delegates to the constitutional convention and their position on the constitution.
examining the debate between the federalists and the antifederalists forrest mcdonald in we the people 1958 also concluded that there was no consistent relationship between wealth and property and support for the constitution.
instead opinion on the new system was far more likely to reflect local and regional interests.
these challenges greatly weakened beards argument few historians any longer accept his thesis without reservation.
in the 1960s scholars began again to revive an economic interpretation of the constitution but one that differed from beards and nevertheless emphasized social and economic factors as motives for supporting the federal system.
jackson turner main argued in the anti federalists 1961 that supporters of the constitution were national archives and records administration cosmopolitan commercialists eager to advance the economic development of the nation the antifederalists by contrast were agrarian localists fearful of centralization.
gordon wood in the creation of the american republic 1969 suggested that the debate over the state constitutions in the 1770s and 1780s reflected profound social divisions and that those same divisions helped shape the argument over the federal constitution.
the federalists wood suggested were largely traditional aristocrats who had become deeply concerned by the instability of life under the articles of confederation and were particularly alarmed by the decline in popular deference toward social elites.
the creation of the constitution was part of a larger search to create a legitimate political leadership based on the existing social hierarchy it reflected the efforts of elites to contain what they considered the excesses of democracy.
more recently historians have continued to examine the question of intent did the framers intend a strong centralized political system or did they intend to create a decentralized system with a heavy emphasis on individual rights.
the answer according to jack rakove in original meanings 1996 and revolutionaries 2010 is both and many other things as well.
the constitution he argues was the result of a long and vigorous debate through which the views of many different groups found their way into the document.
james madison generally known as the father of the constitution was a strong nationalist as was alexander hamilton.
they believed that only a powerful central government could preserve stability in a large nation and they saw the constitution as a way to protect order and property and defend the nation against the dangers of too much liberty.
but if madison and hamilton feared too much liberty they also feared too little.
and that made them receptive to the demands of the antifederalists for protections of individual rights which culminated in the bill of rights.
the framers differed as well in their views of the proper relationship between the federal government and the state governments.
madison favored unquestioned federal supremacy while many others who wanted to preserve the rights of the states saw in the federal system and in its division of sovereignty among different levels and branches of government a guarantee against too much national power.
the constitution is not rakove argues infinitely malleable but neither does it have a fixed meaning that can be an inflexible guide to how we interpret it today.

139 140 chapter 6 jefferson who had briefly tried without result to give indians a legal status within the new nation had no such aspirations for african americans.
he was an uneasy defender of slavery worrying about excluding a whole race of men from the natural rights that jefferson himself had done much to promote.
but he could never accept the idea that black men and women could attain the level of knowledge and intelligence of white people.
jeffersons long romantic relationship with a black woman sally hemmings did nothing to change his mind.
hemmings was a light skinned woman who was a slave on jeffersons plantation in virginia.
he lived with her after the death of his wife and fathered several of the hemmings family her children.
but his intimate relationship with the hemmings family did not ultimately change his position on slavery.
unlike george washington who freed his slaves after his death jefferson deeply in debt required his heirs to sell his slaves after he died after liberating the hemmings family.
not until the end of the civil war were black men and women eligible to live as citizens in the united states and even then with only partial rights until a century later.
for almost a hundred years the united states constitution was a document that protected white people only.
adoption and adaptation the delegates at philadelphia had greatly exceeded their instructions from congress and the states.
instead of making simple revisions in the articles of confederation they had produced a plan for a completely different form of government.
they feared that the constitution would not be ratified under the rules of the articles of confederation which required unanimous approval by the state legislatures.
so the convention changed the rules proposing that the new government would come into being when nine of the thirteen states ratified the constitution and recommending that state conventions not state legislatures be called to ratify it.
federalists and antifederalists the congress in new york accepted the conventions work and submitted it to the states for approval.
all the state legislatures except rhode island elected delegates to ratifying conventions most of which began meeting in early 1788.
even before the ratifying conventions convened however a great national debate on the new constitution had begun.
supporters of the constitution had a number of advantages.
better organized than their opponents they seized an appealing label for themselves federalists a term that opponents of centralization had once used to describe themselves thus implying that they were less committed to a nationalist government than in fact they were.
in addition the federalists had the support of not only the two most eminent men in america franklin and washington but also the ablest political philosophers of their time alexander hamilton james madison and john jay.
under the joint pseudonym publius these three men wrote a series of essays widely published in newspapers throughout the nation explaining the meaning and virtues of the constitution.
the essays were later gathered together and the federalist papers published as a book known today as the federalist papers.
the federalists called their critics antifederalists suggesting that their rivals had the antifederalists nothing to offer except opposition.
but the antifederalists too led by such distinguished revolutionary leaders as patrick henry and samuel adams had serious and intelligent arguments.
they were they believed the defenders of the true principles the constitution and the new republic 141 of the revolution.
they believed that the constitution would increase taxes weaken the states wield dictatorial powers favor the well born over the common people and abolish individual liberty.
but their biggest complaint was that the constitution lacked a bill of rights.
only by enumerating the natural rights of the people they argued could there be any certainty that those rights would be protected.
despite the efforts of the antifederalists ratification proceeded quickly during the winter of 1787 1788.
the delaware convention the first to act ratified the constitution unanimously as did the new jersey and georgia conventions.
and in june 1788 ratification of the constitution new hampshire the critical ninth state ratified the document.
it was now theoretically p ossible for the constitution to go into effect.
but a new government could not hope to succeed without virginia and new york the largest states whose conventions remained closely divided.
by the end of june first virginia and then new york consented to the constitution by narrow margins on the assumption that a bill of rights would be added in the form of amendments to the constitution.
north carolinas convention adjourned without taking action waiting to see what happened to the amendments.
rhode island controlled by staunch opponents of centralized government did not even consider ratification.
completing the structure the first elections under the constitution were held in the early months of 1789.
there was never any doubt about who would be the first president.
george washington had presided at the constitutional convention and many who had favored ratification did so only because they expected him to preside over the new government as well.
washington received the votes of all the presidential electors.
john adams a leading federalist became vice president.
after a journey from his estate at mount vernon virginia marked by elaborate celebrations along the way washington was inaugurated in new york on april 30 1789.
washington was in his first term as president in 1790 when an anonymous folk artist painted this view of his home at mount vernon virginia.
washington appears in uniform along with members of his family on the lawn.
after he retired from office in 1797 washington returned happily to his plantation and spent the two years before his death in 1799 amusing myself in agricultural and rural pursuits he also played host to an endless stream of visitors from throughout the country and europe.
courtesy national gallery of art washington d c george washington at mount vernon 142 chapter 6 the first congress served in many ways as a continuation of the constitutional convention.
its most important task was drafting a bill of rights.
by early 1789 even madison had come to agree that some sort of bill of rights would be essential to legitimize the new government.
on september 25 1789 congress approved twelve amendments ten of which were ratified by the states by the end of 1791.
these first ten amendments to the the bill of rights constitution comprise what we know as the bill of rights.
nine of them placed limitations on the new government by forbidding it to infringe on certain fundamental rights freedom of religion speech and the press immunity from arbitrary arrest trial by jury and others.
the bill of rights had very specific terms provisions for the judiciary branch were more vague.
the constitution said only the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish it was left to congress to determine the number of supreme court judges to be appointed and the kinds of lower courts to be organized.
in the judiciary act of 1789 congress provided for a supreme court of six members and a system of lower district courts and courts of appeal.
it also gave the supreme court the power to make the final decision in cases involving the constitutionality of state laws.
the constitution also said little about the organization of the executive branch.
it referred indirectly to executive departments but did not specify which ones or how many there should be.
the first congress created three such departments state treasury and war and also established the offices of the attorney general and postmaster general.
to organizing the executive branch the office of secretary of the treasury washington appointed alexander hamilton of new york.
for secretary of war he chose a massachusetts federalist general henry knox.
he named edmund randolph of virginia as attorney general and chose another virginian thomas jefferson for secretary of state.
federalists and republicans the framers of the constitution had dealt with many controversies by papering them over with a series of vague compromises as a result the disagreements survived to plague the new government.
at the heart of the controversies of the 1790s was the same basic difference in philosophy that had fueled the debate over the constitution.
on one side stood a powerful group who envisioned america as a genuine nation state with centralized authority and a complex commercial economy.
on the other side stood another group whose members envisioned a more modest national government.
rather than aspire to be a highly commercial or urban nation it should remain predominantly rural and agrarian.
the centralizers became known as the federalists and gravitated to the leadership of alexander hamilton.
their opponents acquired the name republicans and admired the views of thomas jefferson as well as james madison who grew skeptical of federalist rule.
hamilton and the federalists for twelve years the federalists retained firm control of the new government.
that was in part because george washington had always envisioned a strong national government.
but the president washington believed should stand above political controversies and so he avoided personal involvement in the deliberations of congress.
as a result the the constitution and the new republic 143 dominant figure in his administration became alexander hamilton.
of all the national leaders of his time hamilton was one of the most aristocratic in his political philosophy he believed that a stable and effective government required an elite ruling class.
thus the new government needed the support of the wealthy and powerful and to get that it needed to give elites a stake in its success.
hamilton proposed hamiltons funded debt proposal therefore that the existing public debt be funded that the various certificates of indebtedness that the old congress had issued during and after the revolution many of them now in the possession of wealthy speculators be called in and exchanged for interestbearing bonds.
he also recommended that the states revolutionary debts be assumed taken over to cause state bondholders also to look to the central government for eventual payment.
hamilton wanted to create a permanent national debt with new bonds being issued as old ones were paid off.
he hoped to motivate the wealthy classes who were the most likely to lend money to the government to support perpetually the survival of that centralized state.
hamilton also wanted to create a national bank.
it would provide loans and currency to businesses give the government a safe place for the deposit of federal funds facilitate the collection of taxes and the disbursement of the governments expenditures and provide a stable center to the nations small and feeble banking system.
the bank would be chartered by the federal government but much of its capital would come from private investors.
the funding and assumption of debts would require new sources of revenue.
hamilton recommended two kinds of taxes to complement the receipts anticipated from the sales of public land.
one was an excise tax on alcoholic beverages a tax that would be most burdensome to the whiskey distillers of the backcountry small farmers who converted part of their corn and rye crops into whiskey.
the other was a tariff on imports which hamilton saw not only as a way to raise money but as a way to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.
in his famous report on manufactures of report on manufactures 1791 he outlined a plan for stimulating the growth of industry and spoke glowingly of the advantages to society of a healthy manufacturing sector.
the federalists in short offered more than a vision of a stable new government.
they offered a vision of the sort of nation america should become a nation with a wealthy enlightened ruling class a vigorous independent commercial economy and a thriving manufacturing sector.
enacting the federalist program few members of congress objected to hamiltons plan for funding the national debt but many did oppose his proposal to exchange new bonds for old certificates of indebtedness on a dollar for dollar basis.
many of the original holders had been forced to sell during the hard times of the 1780s to speculators who had bought them at a fraction of their face value.
james madison now a representative from virginia argued for a plan by which the new bonds would be divided between the original purchasers and the speculators.
but hamiltons allies insisted that the honor of the government required a literal fulfillment of its earlier promises to pay whoever held the bonds.
congress finally passed the funding bill hamilton wanted.
hamiltons proposal that the federal government assume the state debts encountered greater difficulty.
its opponents argued that if the federal government took over the state debts the states with small debts would have to pay taxes to service the states with large ones.
144 chapter 6 massachusetts for example owed much more money than did virginia.
only by striking a bargain with the virginians were hamilton and his supporters able to win passage of the assumption bill.
the deal involved the location of the national capital which the virginians wanted near them in the south.
hamilton and jefferson met and agreed to exchange northern bargaining and the national capital support for placing the capital in the south for virginias votes for the assumption bill.
the bargain called for the construction of a new capital city on the banks of the potomac river which divided maryland and virginia on land to be selected by george washington.
hamiltons bank bill produced the most heated debates.
madison jefferson randolph and others argued that because the constitution made no provision for a national bank congress had no authority to create one.
but congress agreed to hamiltons bill despite these objections and washington signed it.
the bank of the united states began operations in 1791.
hamilton also had his way with the excise tax although protests from farmers later forced revisions to reduce the burden on the smaller distillers.
he failed to win passage of a tariff as highly protective as he had hoped for but the tariff law of 1792 did raise the rates somewhat.
once enacted hamiltons program won the support of manufacturers creditors and other influential segments of the population.
but others found it less appealing.
small farmers complained that they were being taxed excessively.
they and others began to argue that the federalist program served the interests of a small number of wealthy elites rather than the people at large.
from these sentiments an organized political opposition arose.
the republican opposition the constitution made no reference to political parties.
most of the framers believed that organized parties were dangerous factions to be avoided.
disagreement was inevitable on particular issues but they believed that such disagreements need not and should not lead to the formation of permanent factions.
yet not many years had passed after the ratification of the constitution before madison and others became convinced that hamilton and his followers had become dangerous and self interested.
the federalists had used the powers of their offices to reward their supporters and win additional allies.
they were doing many of the same things their opponents believed that the corrupt british governments of the early eighteenth century had done.
because the federalists appeared to their critics to be creating such a menacing and tyrannical structure of power there was no alternative but to organize a vigorous opposition.
the result was the emergence of an alternative political organization whose members called themselves republicans these first republicans are not institutionally related to the modern republican party which was created in the 1850s.
by the late 1790s the formation of the first party system republicans were going to even greater lengths than the federalists to create vehicles of partisan influence.
in every state they formed committees societies and caucuses republican groups banded together to influence state and local elections.
neither side was willing to admit that it was acting as a party nor would either concede the right of the other to exist.
this institutionalized factionalism is known to historians as the first party system from the beginning the preeminent figures among the republicans were thomas jefferson and james madison.
the most prominent spokesman for the cause jefferson the constitution and the new republic 145 the jeffersonian idyll american artists in the early nineteenth century were drawn to tranquil rural scenes symbolic of the jeffersonian vision of a nation of small independent farmers.
by 1822 when francis alexander painted this depiction of ralph wheelocks farm the simple agrarian republic was already being transformed by rapid economic growth.
courtesy national gallery of art washington d c promoted a vision of an agrarian republic in which most citizens would farm their own land.
jefferson did not scorn commercial or industrial activity.
but he believed that the nation should be wary of too much urbanization and industrialization.
although both parties had supporters across the country and among all classes there were regional and economic differences.
the federalists regional and economic differences were most numerous in the commercial centers of the northeast and in such southern seaports as charleston the republicans were stronger in the rural areas of the south and the west.
the difference in their philosophies was visible in among other things their reactions to the progress of the french revolution.
as that revolution grew increasingly radical in the 1790s the federalists expressed horror.
but the republicans applauded the democratic antiaristocratic spirit they believed the french revolution embodied.
when the time came for the nations second presidential election in 1792 both jefferson and hamilton urged washington to run for a second term.
the president reluctantly agreed.
but while washington had the respect of both factions he was in reality more in sympathy with the federalists than with the republicans.
establishing national sovereignty the federalists consolidated their position by acting effectively in managing the western territories and diplomacy.
securing the west despite the northwest ordinance the old congress had largely failed to tie the outlying western areas of the country firmly to the national government.
farmers in western massachusetts had rebelled settlers in vermont kentucky and tennessee had flirted with seceding from the union.
and at first the new government under the constitution faced similar problems.
co ns ider t he s o urc e washingtons farewell address american daily advertiser september 19 1796 in this open letter to the american people president washington defended the young constitution and warned against disunity among the nations various states and politi cal factions.
here he cautions citizens about another threat to the republic entangling engagements abroad.
observe good faith and justice toward all nations.
cultivate peace and harmony with all.
religion and morality enjoin this conduct.
and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it.
it will be worthy of a free enlightened and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence.
in the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated.
the nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.
it is a slave to its animosity or to its affection either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest.
the nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy.
the government sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through passion what reason would reject.
so likewise a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils.
sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities of the other betrays the former 146 into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification.
as avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot.
how many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions to practice the arts of seduction to mislead public opinion to influence or awe the public councils.
such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter.
against the insidious wiles of foreign influence i conjure you to believe me fellow citizens the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.
the great rule of conduct for us in r egard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relation to have with them as little political connection as possible.
so far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.
here let us stop.
europe has a set of primary interests which to us have no or a very remote relation.
hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.
hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.
our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course.
if we remain one people under an efficient government the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard giving us provocation when we may choose peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall counsel.
why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation.
why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground.
why by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of europe entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of european ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice.
it is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world so far i mean as we are now at liberty to do it.
for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements.
i hold the maxim of less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always the best policy.
i repeat therefore let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense.
but in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them.
taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.
harmony liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy humanity and interest.
but even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences.
constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one n ation to look for disinterested favors from another that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character that by such acceptance it may place itself in the c ondition of having given equivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more.
there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation.
it is an illusion which experience must cure which a just pride ought to discard.

what advice did george washington offer on foreign policy.
did washington advocate the complete isolation of the united states from europe.
how did washington characterize europe.
what circumstances of the 1790s may have inspired this assessment.
in 1794 farmers in western pennsylvania raised a major challenge to federal authority when they refused to pay the new whiskey excise tax and began terrorizing tax collectors in the region.
but the federal government did not leave settlement of the so called whiskey rebellion to the authorities of pennsylvania.
at hamiltons urging whiskey rebellion washington called out the militias of three states and assembled an army of nearly 15 000 and he personally led the troops into pennsylvania.
at the approach of the militiamen the rebellion quickly collapsed.
the federal government won the allegiance of the whiskey rebels through intimidation.
it secured the loyalties of other western people by accepting new states as members of the union.
the last two of the original thirteen colonies joined the union once the bill of rights had been appended to the constitution north carolina in 1789 and rhode 147 148 chapter 6 island in 1790.
vermont became the fourteenth state in 1791 after new york and new hampshire agreed to give up their rights to it.
next came kentucky in 1792 when virginia relinquished its claim to that region.
after north carolina ceded its western lands to the union tennessee became a state in 1796.
the new government faced a greater challenge in more distant areas of the northwest and the southwest.
the ordinances of 1784 1787 establishing the terms of white settlement in the west had produced a series of border conflicts with native tribes.
the new government inherited these tensions which continued with few interruptions for nearly a decade.
such clashes revealed another issue the constitution had done little to resolve the place of native americans within the new federal structure.
the constitution gave congress power to regulate commerce.
with the indian tribes and it bound the new government to respect treaties negotiated by the confederation most of which had been with the tribes.
but none of this did very much to clarify the precise legal standing of indians within the united states.
the tribes received no direct representation in the native americans ambiguous status new government.
above all the constitution did not address the major issue of land.
native americans lived within the boundaries of the united states yet they claimed and the white government at times agreed that they had some measure of sovereignty over their own land.
but neither the constitution nor common law offered any clear guide to the rights of a nation within a nation or to the precise nature of tribal sovereignty.
maintaining neutrality a crisis in anglo american relations emerged in 1793 when the revolutionary french government went to war with great britain.
both the president and congress took steps to establish american neutrality in the conflict but that neutrality was severely tested.
early in 1794 the royal navy began seizing hundreds of american ships engaged in trade in the french west indies.
hamilton was deeply concerned.
war would mean an end to imports from england and most of the revenue for maintaining his financial system came from duties on those imports.
hamilton and the federalists did not trust the state department now in the hands of the ardently pro french edmund randolph to find a solution to the crisis.
so they persuaded washington to name a special commissioner the chief justice of the supreme court john jay to go to england and negotiate a solution.
jay was instructed to secure compensation for the recent british assaults on american shipping to demand withdrawal of british forces from their posts on the frontier of the united states and to negotiate a commercial treaty with britain.
the long and complex treaty jay negotiated in 1794 failed to achieve all these goals.
but it settled the conflict with britain avoiding a likely war.
it provided for undisputed american sovereignty over the entire northwest and produced a reasonably satisfactory jays treaty commercial relationship.
nevertheless when the terms became known in america criticism was intense.
opponents of the treaty went to great lengths to defeat it but in the end the senate ratified what was by then known as jays treaty.
jays treaty paved the way for a settlement of important american disputes with spain.
pinckneys treaty under pinckneys treaty negotiated by thomas pinckney and signed in 1795 spain recognized the right of americans to navigate the mississippi to its mouth and to deposit goods at new orleans for reloading on oceangoing ships agreed to fix the northern boundary of florida along the 31st parallel and commanded its authorities to the constitution and the new republic 149 prevent native americans in florida from launching raids north across that border.
for president washingtons views on such matters of foreign policy see consider the source washingtons farewell address the downfall of the federalists since almost everyone in the 1790s agreed that there was no place in a stable republic for organized parties the emergence of the republicans as a powerful and apparently permanent opposition seemed to the federalists a grave threat to national stability.
and so when international perils confronted the government in the 1790s hamilton and his followers moved forcefully against what they considered illegitimate dissent.
the election of 1796 george washington refused to run for a third term as president in 1796.
jefferson was the obvious presidential candidate of the republicans that year but the federalists faced a more difficult choice.
hamilton had created too many enemies to be a credible candidate.
vice president john adams who was not directly associated with any of the controversial federalist achievements received the partys nomination for president at a caucus of the federalists in congress.
the federalists were still clearly the dominant party.
but without washington to mediate they fell victim to fierce factional rivalries.
adams defeated jefferson by john adams elected only three electoral votes and assumed the presidency as head of a divided party facing a powerful opposition.
jefferson became vice president by finishing second.
not until the adoption of the twelfth amendment in 1804 did electors vote separately for president and vice president.
the quasi war with france american relations with great britain and spain improved as a result of jays and pinckneys treaties.
but the nations relations with revolutionary france quickly deteriorated.
french vessels captured american ships on the high seas.
the french government refused to receive charles cotesworth pinckney when he arrived in paris as the new american minister.
in an effort to stabilize relations adams appointed a bipartisan commission to negotiate with france.
when the americans arrived in paris in 1797 three agents of the french foreign minister prince talleyrand demanded a loan for france and a bribe for french officials before any negotiations could begin.
pinckney a member of the commission responded no.
not a sixpence when adams heard of the incident he sent a message to congress urging preparations for war.
before giving the commissioners report to congress he deleted the names of the three french agents and designated them only as messrs x y and z.
when the report was published the xyz affair as it quickly became known provoked the xyz affair widespread popular outrage at frances actions and strong popular support for the federalists response.
for nearly two years 1798 and 1799 the united states found itself engaged in an undeclared quasi war.
adams persuaded congress to cut off all trade with france to abrogate the treaties of 1778 and to authorize american vessels to capture french armed ships on the high seas.
150 chapter 6 in 1798 congress created the department of the navy.
the navy soon won a number of battles and captured a total of eighty five french ships.
the united states also began cooperating closely with the british.
at last the french began trying to conciliate the united states.
adams sent another commission to paris in 1800 and the new french government headed now by first consul napoleon bonaparte agreed to a treaty with the united states that canceled the old agreements of 1778 and established new commercial arrangements.
as a result the war came to a reasonably peaceful end.
repression and protest the conflict with france helped the federalists increase their majorities in congress in 1798.
they now began to consider ways to silence the republican opposition.
the result was some of the most controversial legislation in american history the alien and sedition acts.
the alien act placed new obstacles in the way of foreigners who wished to become the alien and sedition acts american citizens.
the sedition act allowed the government to prosecute those who engaged in sedition against the government.
in theory only libelous or treasonous activities were subject to prosecution but since such activities had no clear definition the law in effect gave the government authority to stifle virtually any opposition.
the republicans interpreted the new laws as part of a federalist campaign to destroy them.
president adams signed the new laws but was cautious in implementing them.
he did not deport any aliens and he prevented the government from launching a broad crusade against the republicans.
but the alien act discouraged immigration and encouraged some foreigners already in the country to leave.
and the administration used the sedition act to arrest and convict ten men most of them republican newspaper editors whose only crime had been criticism of the federalists in government.
republican leaders began to look for ways to reverse the alien and sedition acts.
some looked to the state legislatures for help.
they developed a theory to justify action by the states against the federal government in two sets of resolutions of 1798 1799 one written anonymously by jefferson and adopted by the kentucky legislavirginia and kentucky resolutions ture and the other drafted by madison and approved by the virginia legislature.
the virginia and kentucky resolutions as they were known used the ideas of john locke and the tenth amendment to the constitution to argue that the federal government had been formed by a compact or contract among the states and possessed only certain delegated powers.
whenever a state decided that the central government had exceeded those powers it had the right to nullify the appropriate laws.
the republicans did not win wide support for the nullification idea they did however succeed in elevating their dispute with the federalists to the level of a national crisis.
by the late 1790s the entire nation was deeply and bitterly politicized.
state legislatures at times resembled battlegrounds.
even the united states congress was plagued with violent disagreements.
in one celebrated incident in the chamber of the house of representatives matthew lyon a republican from vermont responded to an insult from roger griswold a federalist from connecticut by spitting in griswolds eye.
griswold attacked lyon with his cane lyon fought back with a pair of fire tongs and soon the two men were wrestling on the floor.
the constitution and the new republic 151 congressional brawlers 1798 this cartoon was inspired by the celebrated fight on the floor of the house of representatives between matthew lyon a republican representative from vermont and roger griswold a federalist from connecticut.
griswold at right attacks lyon with his cane and lyon retaliates with fire tongs.
other members of congress are portrayed enjoying the battle.
the library of congress the revolution of 1800 these bitter controversies shaped the presidential election of 1800.
the presidential candidates were the same as four years earlier adams for the federalists election of 1800 jefferson for the republicans.
but the campaign of 1800 was very different from the one preceding it.
adams and jefferson themselves displayed reasonable dignity but their supporters showed no such restraint.
the federalists accused jefferson of being a dangerous radical whose followers were wild men who if they should come to power would bring on a reign of terror comparable to that of the french revolution.
the republicans portrayed adams as a tyrant conspiring to become king and they accused the federalists of plotting to impose slavery on the people.
the election was close and the crucial c ontest was in new york.
there aaron burr mobilized an organization of revolutionary war veterans the tammany society to serve as a republican political machine.
through tammanys efforts the party carried the city by a large majority and with it the state.
jefferson was apparently elected.
but an unexpected complication soon jeopardized the republican victory.
the constitution called for each elector to vote by ballot for two persons the expectation was that an elector would cast one vote for his partys presidential candidate and the other for his partys vice presidential candidate.
to avoid a tie the republicans had intended that one elector would refrain from voting for the partys vice presidential candidate aaron burr.
but when the votes were counted jefferson and burr each had 73.
no candidate had a majority and the house of representatives had to choose between the two top candidates jefferson and burr.
each state delegation would cast a single vote.
the new congress elected in 1800 with a republican majority was not to convene until after the inauguration of the president so it was the federalist congress that had to decide the question.
after a long deadlock several leading federalists concluded following 152 chapter 6 hamiltons advice that burr was too unreliable to trust with the presidency.
on the thirtysixth ballot jefferson was elected.
after the election of 1800 the only branch of the federal government left in federalist hands was the judiciary.
the adams administration spent its last months in office taking the judiciary act of 1801 steps to make the partys hold on the courts secure.
with the judiciary act of 1801 the federalists reduced the number of supreme court justiceships by one but greatly increased the number of federal judgeships as a whole.
adams quickly appointed federalists to the newly created positions.
he also appointed a leading federalist john marshall to be chief justice of the supreme court a position marshall held for 34 years.
indeed there were charges that he stayed up until midnight on his last day in office to finish signing the new judges commissions.
these officeholders became known as the midnight appointments even so the republicans viewed their victory as almost complete.
the nation had they believed been saved from tyranny.
the exuberance with which the victors viewed the future and the importance they ascribed to the defeat of the federalists was evident in the phrase jefferson himself later used to describe his election.
he called it the revolution of 1800 conclusion the constitution of 1787 created a federal system of dispersed authority authority divided among national and state governments and among an executive a legislature and a judiciary.
the young nation thus sought to balance its need for an effective central government against its fear of concentrated and despotic power.
the ability of the delegates to the constitutional convention to compromise revealed their yearning for a stable political system.
the same willingness to compromise allowed the greatest challenge to the ideals of the new democracy slavery to survive intact.
the writing and ratifying of the constitution settled some questions about the shape of the new nation.
the first twelve years under the government created by the constitution solved others.
and yet by the year 1800 a basic disagreement about the future of the nation remained unresolved and was creating bitter divisions and conflicts within the political world.
the election of thomas jefferson to the presidency that year opened a new chapter in the nations public history.
it also brought to a close at least temporarily savage political conflicts that had seemed to threaten the nations future.

how did the napoleonic wars affect the united states.
what events and issues led to the war of 1812.
thomas jefferson and his followers assumed control of the national government in 1801 as the champions of a distinctive vision of america.
they favored a society of sturdy independent farmers happily free from the workshops the industrial towns and the urban mobs of europe.
they celebrated localism and republican simplicity.
above all they proposed a federal government of sharply limited power.
almost nothing worked out as they had planned for during their years in power the young republic was developing in ways that made much of their vision obsolete.
the american economy became steadily more diversified and complex making the ideal of a simple agrarian society impossible to maintain.
american cultural life was dominated by a vigorous and ambitious nationalism.
jefferson himself contributed to the changes by exercising strong national authority at times and by arranging the greatest single increase in the size of the united states in its history.
154 the rise of cultural nationalism in many respects american cultural life in the early nineteenth century reflected the republican vision of the nations future.
opportunities for education increased the nations literary and artistic life began to free itself from european influences and american religion began to adjust to the spread of enlightenment rationalism.
in other ways however the new culture was posing a serious challenge to republican ideals.
educational and literary nationalism central to the republican vision of america was the concept of a virtuous and enlightened citizenry.
republicans believed therefore in the creation of a nationwide system of public schools in which all male citizens would receive free education.
such hopes were not fulfilled.
schooling remained primarily the responsibility of private institutions most of which were open only to those who could afford to pay for them.
in the south and in the mid atlantic states most schools were run by religious groups.
in new england private academies were often more secular many of them modeled on those founded by the phillips family at andover massachusetts in 1778 and at exeter new hampshire three years later.
many were frankly aristocratic in outlook.
some educational institutions were open to the poor but not nearly enough to accommodate everyone and the education they offered was usually clearly inferior to that provided for more prosperous students.
private secondary schools such as those in new england generally accepted only male students even many public schools excluded females from the classroom.

86 chapter 4 the iroquois maintained their autonomy by trading successfully with both the french and the english and astutely played them against each other.
anglo french conflicts as long as peace and stability in the north american interior lasted english and french colonists coexisted without serious difficulty.
but after the glorious revolution in england a complicated series of anglo french wars erupted in europe and continued intermittently for nearly eighty years creating important repercussions in america.
king williams war 1689 1697 produced only a few indecisive clashes between the english and the french in northern new england.
queen annes war which began in 1701 and continued for nearly twelve years generated more substantial conflicts.
the treaty of utrecht which brought the conflict to a close in 1713 transferred substantial territory from the french to the english in north america including acadia nova scotia and newfoundland.
two decades later disputes over british trading rights in the spanish colonies produced a conflict between england and spain that soon grew into a much larger european war.
the english colonists in america were drawn into the struggle which they called king georges war 1744 1748.
new englanders captured the french bastion at louisbourg on cape breton island in nova scotia but the peace treaty that finally ended the conflict forced them to abandon it.
in the aftermath of king georges war relations among the english french and iroquois in north america quickly deteriorated.
the iroquois in what appears to have been a major blunder granted trading concessions in the interior to english merchants for the first time.
the french feared probably correctly that the english were using the concessions as a first step toward expansion into french lands.
they began in 1749 to construct new fortresses in the ohio valley.
the english responded by increasing their military forces and building fortresses of their own.
the balance of power that the iroquois had carefully maintained for so long rapidly disintegrated.
for the next five years tensions between the english and the french increased.
in the summer of 1754 the governor of virginia sent a militia force under the command of an inexperienced young colonel george washington into the ohio valley to challenge fort necessity french expansion.
washington built a crude stockade fort necessity not far from frances fort duquesne on the site of what is now pittsburgh.
after the virginians staged an unsuccessful attack on a french detachment the french countered with an assault on fort necessity trapping washington and his soldiers inside.
after one third of them died in the fighting washington surrendered.
the clash marked the beginning of the french and indian war.
the great war for the empire the french and indian war lasted nearly nine years and it moved through three distinct phases.
the first phase from the fort necessity debacle in 1754 until the expansion of the war to europe in 1756 was primarily a local north american conflict.
the iroquois remained largely passive in the conflict.
but virtually all the other tribes were allied with the french.
they launched a series of raids on western english settlements.
the english colonists fought to defend themselves against those raids.
by late 1755 many english settlers along the frontier had withdrawn to the east of the allegheny mountains to escape the hostilities.
french and indian war the empire in transition 87 the second phase of the struggle began in 1756 when the seven years war began in europe and beyond.
see america in the world the first global war seven years war the fighting now spread to the west indies india and europe itself.
but the principal struggle remained the war in north america where so far england had suffered nothing but frustration and defeat.
beginning in 1757 william pitt the english secretary william pitt of state and future prime minister brought the war fully under british control.
he planned military strategy appointed commanders and issued orders to the colonists.
british commanders began forcibly enlisting colonists into the army a practice known as impressment.
officers also seized supplies from local farmers and tradesmen and compelled colonists to offer shelter to british troops all generally without compensation.
the americans resented these new impositions and firmly resisted them.
by early 1758 the friction between the british authorities and the colonists was threatening to bring the war effort to a halt.
beginning in 1758 pitt initiated the third and final phase of the war by relaxing many of the policies that americans had found obnoxious.
he agreed to reimburse the colonists for all supplies requisitioned by the army.
he returned control over recruitment to the colonial assemblies.
and he dispatched large numbers of additional british troops to america.
these moves turned the tide of battle in englands favor.
the french had always been outnumbered by the british colonists.
after 1756 moreover the french suffered from a series of poor harvests and were unable to sustain their early military successes.
by mid 1758 british regulars and colonial militias were seizing one french stronghold after another.
two brilliant english generals jeffrey amherst and james wolfe captured the fortress at louisbourg in july 1758 a few months later fort duquesne fpo the fortress of louisbourg on cape breton island in nova scotia was one of the principal french outposts in eastern canada during the french and indian war.
it took a british fleet of 157 ships nearly two months to force the french garrison to surrender.
private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman images the siege of louisbourg 1758 america in the world the first global war the french and indian war in north america was only a small part of a much larger conflict.
known in europe as the seven years war it was one of the longest most widespread and most important wars in modern history.
the war thrust great britain into conflicts across europe and north america.
winston churchill once wrote of it as the first world war in north america the war was a result of tensions along the frontiers of the british empire.
but it arose more broadly from larger conflicts among the great powers in europe.
it began in the 1750s with what historians have called a diplomatic revolution well established alliances between britain and the austro hungarian empire and between france and prussia collapsed replaced by a new set of alliances setting britain and prussia against france and austria.
the instability that these changing alliances produced helped speed the european nations toward war.
the austrian british alliance collapsed because austria suffered a series of significant defeats at the hands of the prussians.
to the british government these failures suggested that the austro hungarian empire was now too weak to help britain balance french power.
as a result england launched a search for new partnerships with the rising powers of northern germany austrias enemies.
in response the austrians sought an alliance with france to help protect them from the power of their former british allies.
one later result of this new alliance was the 1770 marriage of the future french king louis xvi to the austrian princess marie antoinette.
in the aftermath of these realignments austria sought again to defeat the prussian hanover forces in germany.
in the process russia became concerned about the austro hungarian 88 empires possible dominance in central europe and allied itself with the british and the prussians.
these complicated realignments eventually led to the seven years war which soon spread across much of the world.
the war engaged not only most of the great powers in europe from england to russia but also the emerging colonial worlds india west africa the caribbean and the philippines as the powerful british navy worked to strip france and eventually spain of its valuable colonial holdings.
like most modern conflicts the seven years war was at heart a struggle for economic power.
colonial possessions many european nations believed were critical to their future wealth and well worth fighting for.
the wars outcome affected not only the future of america but also the distribution of power throughout much of the world.
it destroyed the french navy and much of the french empire and it elevated great britain to undisputed preeminence among the colonizing powers especially when at the conclusion of the war india and all of eastern north america fell firmly under english control.
the war also reorganized the balance of power in europe with britain now preeminent among the great powers and prussia later to become the core of modern germany rapidly rising in wealth and military power.
the seven years war was not only one of the first great colonial wars but also one of the last great wars of religion and it extended the dominance of protestantism in europe.
in what is now canada the war replaced french with british rule and thus replaced catholic with protestant dominance.
the vatican no longer a military power itself had relied on the great catholic empires spain france and austriahungary as bulwarks of its power and influence.

celebrating the peace of paris governments in europe and north america weakened the catholic church and reduced its geopolitical influence.
the conclusion of the seven years war strengthened britain and germany and weakened france.
but it did not provide any lasting solution to the rivalries among the great colonial powers.
in north america a dozen years after the end of the conflict the american revolution the origins of which were in many ways a direct result of the seven years war stripped the british empire of one of its most important and valuable colonial appendages.
by the time the american revolution came to an end the french revolution had sparked another lengthy period of war culminating in the napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century which once again redrew the map of europe and for a while the world.

the next year at the end of a siege of quebec the army of general wolfe struggled up a hidden ravine under cover of darkness surprised the larger forces of the marquis de montcalm and defeated them in a battle in which both commanders were killed.
the dramatic fall of quebec on september 13 1759 marked the beginning of the end of the american phase of the war.
a year later in september 1760 the french army formally surrendered to amherst in montreal.
peace finally came in 1763 with the 89 90 chapter 4 peace of paris by which the french ceded to great britain some of their west indian islands most of their colonies in india and canada and all other french territory in north america east of the mississippi.
the french then ceded new orleans and their claims west of the mississippi to spain surrendering all title to the mainland of north america.
the french and indian war greatly expanded englands territorial claims in the new world.
at the same time the cost of the war greatly enlarged britains debt and substantially increased effects of the conflict british resentment of the americans.
english leaders were contemptuous of the colonists for what they considered american military ineptitude during the war they were angry that the colonists had made so few financial contributions to a struggle waged they believed largely for american benefit they were particularly bitter that colonial merchants had been selling food and other goods to the french in the west indies throughout the conflict.
all these factors combined to persuade many english leaders that a major reorganization of the empire would be necessary.
london wanted increased authority over the colonies.
the war had an equally profound effect on the american colonists.
it was an experience that forced them for the first time to act in concert against a common foe.
the 1758 return of authority to the colonial assemblies seemed to many americans to confirm the illegitimacy of english interference in local affairs.
for the indians of the ohio valley the british victory was disastrous.
those tribes that had allied themselves with the french had earned the enmity of the victorious english.
the iroquois confederacy which had not allied with the french fared only slightly better.
consequences for native americans english officials saw the passivity of the iroquois during the war as evidence of duplicity.
in the aftermath of the peace settlement the fragile iroquois alliance with the british quickly unraveled.
the tribes would continue to contest the english for control of the ohio valley for another fifty years but were increasingly divided and increasingly outnumbered.
they would seldom again be in a position to deal with their european rivals on terms of military or political equality.
the new imperialism with the treaty of 1763 england found itself truly at peace for the first time in more than fifty years.
as a result the british government could now turn its attention to the organization of its empire.
saddled with enormous debts from the many years of war england was desperately in need of new revenues.
responsible for vast holdings in the new world the imperial government believed it must increase its administrative capacities in america.
the result was a dramatic and for england disastrous redefinition of the colonial relationship.
burdens of empire the experience of the french and indian war should have suggested that increasing imperial control over the colonies would not be easy.
not only had the resistance of the colonists forced pitt to relax his policies in 1758 but the colonial assemblies continued to defy imperial trade regulations and other british demands.
but the most immediate britains staggering war debt problem for london was its staggering war debt.
landlords and merchants in england were objecting strenuously to any further tax increases and the colonial assemblies had repeatedly demonstrated their unwillingness to pay for the war effort.
many officials in england believed that only by taxing the americans directly could the empire effectively meet its financial needs.
the empire in transition 91 at this crucial moment in anglo american relations the government of england was thrown into turmoil by the 1760 accession to the throne of george iii.
he george the third brought two particularly unfortunate qualities to the position.
first he was determined to reassert the authority of the monarchy.
he removed from power the relatively stable coalition of whigs that had governed for much of the century and replaced it with a new and very unstable coalition of his own.
the weak new ministries that emerged as a result each lasted in office an average of only about two years.
second the king had serious intellectual and psychological limitations.
he suffered apparently from a rare mental disease that produced intermittent bouts of insanity.
indeed in the last years of his long reign he was according to most accounts unable to perform any official hudsons bay company quebec quebec.

yet even when george iii was lucid which was most of the time in the 1760s and 1770s he was painfully immature and insecure.
the kings personality therefore contributed both to the instability and to the rigidity of the british government during these critical years.
more directly responsible for the problems that soon emerged with the colonies george grenville however was george grenville whom the king made prime minister in 1763.
grenville shared the prevailing opinion within britain that the colonists should be compelled to pay a part of the cost of defending and administering the empire.
the british and the tribes with the defeat of the french frontiersmen from the english colonies began immediately to move over the mountains and into tribal lands in the upper ohio valley.
an alliance of indian tribes under the ottawa chieftain pontiac struck back.
fearing that an escalation of the fighting proclamation of 1763 might threaten western trade the british government in the proclamation of 1763 forbade settlers to advance beyond the appalachian mountains.
many indian groups supported the proclamation as the best bargain available to them.
the cherokee in particular worked actively to hasten the drawing of the boundary hoping finally to put an end to white movements into their lands.
relations between the western tribes and the british improved for a time partly as a result of the work of the sympathetic indian superintendents the british appointed.
in the end however the proclamation of 1763 was ineffective.
white settlers continued to swarm across the boundary and to claim lands farther and farther into the ohio valley.
the british authorities failed to enforce limits to the expansion.
in 1768 new agreements with the western tribes pushed the permanent boundary farther west.
but these treaties and subsequent ones also failed to stop the white advance.
battles over trade and taxes the grenville ministry tried to increase its authority in the colonies in other ways as well.
regular british troops were stationed permanently in america and under the mutiny act of 1765 the colonists were required to help provision and maintain the army.
ships of the british navy patrolled american waters to search for smugglers.
the customs service was reorganized and enlarged.
royal officials were required to take up their colonial posts in person instead of sending substitutes.
colonial manufacturing was restricted so that it would not compete with rapidly expanding industries in great britain.
the sugar act of 1764 raised the duty on sugar while lowering the duty on molasses.
sugar and currency acts it also established new vice admiralty courts in america to try accused smugglers thus cutting them off from sympathetic local juries.
the currency act of 1764 required that the colonial assemblies stop issuing paper money.
at first it was difficult for the colonists to resist these unpopular new laws.
that was partly because americans continued to harbor as many grievances against one another as they did against the authorities in london.
in 1763 for example a band of pennsylvania frontiersmen known as the paxton boys descended on philadelphia to demand tax relief and financial support for their defense against indians.
bloodshed was averted only by concessions from the colonial assembly.
in 1771 a small scale civil war broke out in north carolina when the paxton boys and regulators regulators farmers of the interior organized and armed themselves to resist high taxes.
the colonial governor appointed sheriffs to enforce the levies.
an army of militiamen most of them from the eastern counties crushed the regulator revolt.
mutiny act the empire in transition 93 the unpopularity of the grenville program helped the colonists overcome their internal conflicts and see that the policies from london were a threat to all americans.
northern merchants would suffer from restraints on their commerce.
the closing of the west to land speculation and fur trading enraged many colonists.
others were angered by the restriction of opportunities for manufacturing.
southern planters in debt to english merchants would be unable to ease their debts by speculating in western land.
small farmers would suffer from the abolition of paper money which had been the source of most of their loans.
workers in towns faced the prospect of narrowing opportunities particularly because of the restraints on manufacturing and currency.
everyone stood to suffer from increased taxes.
most americans soon found ways to live with the new british laws without terrible economic hardship.
but their political grievances remained.
americans were accustomed to wide latitude in self government.
they believed that colonial assemblies had the sole right to control appropriations for the costs of government within the colonies.
by attempting to raise extensive revenues directly from the public the british government was challenging the basis of colonial political power.
stirrings of revolt by the mid 1760s a hardening of positions had begun in both england and america.
the result was a progression of events that more rapidly than imagined destroyed the british empire in america.
the stamp act crisis grenville could not have devised a better method for antagonizing and unifying the colonies than the stamp act of 1765.
unlike the sugar act of a year earlier the stamp act which affected only a few new england merchants the new tax fell on everyone.
it levied taxes on every printed document in the colonies newspapers almanacs pamphlets deeds wills licenses.
british officials were soon collecting more than ten times as much revenue in america as they had been before 1763.
more alarming than these taxes however was the precedent they seemed to create.
in the past taxes and duties on colonial trade had always been designed to regulate commerce.
the stamp act however was clearly an attempt by england to raise revenue from the colonies without the consent of the colonial assemblies.
few colonists believed that they could do anything more than grumble until the virginia house of burgesses aroused americans to action.
patrick henry made a dramatic speech to the house in may 1765 concluding with a vague prediction that if present policies were not revised george iii like earlier tyrants might lose his head.
amid shocked cries of treason henry introduced a set of resolutions only some of which the assembly passed declaring that americans possessed the same rights as the english especially the right to be taxed only by their virginia resolves own representatives that virginians should pay no taxes except those voted by the virginia assembly and that anyone advocating the right of parliament to tax virginians should be deemed an enemy of the colony.
henrys resolutions were printed and circulated as the virginia resolves co ns ider t he s o urc e benjamin franklin testimony against the stamp act 1766 in 1765 parliament passed the first internal tax on the colonists known as the stamp act.
benjamin franklin was a colonial agent in london at the time and as colonial opposition to the act grew he found himself representing these views to the british government.
in his testimony from parliament he describes the role of taxes in pennsylvania and the economic r elationship between the colonies and the mother country.
what is your name and place of abode.
a franklin of philadelphia.
do the americans pay any considerable taxes among themselves.
certainly many and very heavy taxes.
what are the present taxes in pennsylvania laid by the laws of the colony.
there are taxes on all estates real and personal a poll tax a tax on all offices professions trades and businesses according to their profits an excise on all wine rum and other spirit and a duty of ten pounds per head on all negroes imported with some other duties.
for what purposes are those taxes laid.
for the support of the civil and military establishments of the country and to discharge the heavy debt contracted in the last seven years war.
are not all the people very able to pay those taxes.
the frontier counties all along the continent have been frequently ravaged by the enemy and greatly impoverished are able to pay very little tax.
are not the colonies from their circumstances very able to pay the stamp duty.
in my opinion there is not gold and silver enough in the colonies to pay the stamp duty for one year.
94 q dont you know that the money arising from the stamps was all to be laid out in america.
a i know it is appropriated by the act to the american service but it will be spent in the conquered colonies where the soldiers are not in the colonies that pay it.
do you think it right that america should be protected by this country and pay no part of the expense.
that is not the case.
the colonies raised clothed and paid during the last war near 25 000 men and spent many millions.
were you not reimbursed by parliament.
we were only reimbursed what in your opinion we had advanced beyond our proportion or beyond what might reasonably be expected from us and it was a very small part of what we spent.
pennsylvania in particular disbursed about 500 000 pounds and the reimbursements in the whole did not exceed 60 000 pounds.
do you think the people of america would submit to pay the stamp duty if it was moderated.
no never unless compelled by force of arms.
what was the temper of america towards great britain before the year 1763.
the best in the world.
they submitted willingly to the government of the crown and paid in all their courts obedience to acts of parliament.
what is your opinion of a future tax imposed on the same principle with that of the stamp act.
how would the americans receive it.
just as they do this.
they would not pay it.
have not you heard of the resolutions of this house and of the house of lords asserting the right of parliament relating to america including a power to tax the people there.
yes i have heard of such resolutions.
what will be the opinion of the americans on those resolutions.
they will think them unconstitutional and unjust.
was it an opinion in america before 1763 that the parliament had no right to lay taxes and duties there.
a i never heard any objection to the right of laying duties to regulate commerce but a right to lay internal taxes was never supposed to be in parliament as we are not represented there.
did the americans ever dispute the controlling power of parliament to regulate the commerce.
can anything less than a military force carry the stamp act into execution.
a i do not see how a military force can be applied to that purpose.
why may it not.
suppose a military force sent into america they will find nobody in arms what are they then to do.
they cannot force a man to take stamps who chooses to do without them.
they will not find a rebellion they may indeed make one.
if the act is not repealed what do you think will be the consequences.
a total loss of the respect and affection the people of america bear to this country and of all the commerce that depends on that respect and affection.
how can the commerce be affected.
you will find that if the act is not repealed they will take very little of your manufactures in a short time.
is it in their power to do without them.
a i think they may very well do without them.
is it their interest not to take them.
the goods they take from britain are either necessaries mere conveniences or superfluities.
the first as cloth etc with a little industry they can make at home the second they can do without till they are able to provide them among themselves and the last which are mere articles of fashion purchased and consumed because of the fashion in a respected country but will now be detested and rejected.
the people have already struck off by general agreement the use of all goods fashionable in mourning.
if the stamp act should be repealed would it induce the assemblies of america to acknowledge the right of parliament to tax them and would they erase their resolutions against the stamp act.
is there no means of obliging them to erase those resolutions.
none that i know of they will never do it unless compelled by force of arms.
is there a power on earth that can force them to erase them.
no power how great so ever can force men to change their opinions.
what used to be the pride of the americans.
to indulge in the fashions and manufactures of great britain.
what is now their pride.
to wear their old clothes over again till they can make new ones.

95 96 chapter 4 in massachusetts at about the same time james otis persuaded his fellow members of the colonial assembly to call an intercolonial congress to take action against the new tax.
and in october 1765 the stamp act congress as it was called met in new york with delegates from nine colonies.
in a petition to the british government the congress denied that the colonies could rightfully be taxed except through their own provincial assemblies.
across the ocean colonial agent benjamin franklin articulated such grievances before parliament.
see consider the source testimony against the stamp act meanwhile in the summer of 1765 mobs were rising up in several colonial cities against the stamp act.
the largest was in boston where men belonging to the newly organized sons of liberty terrorized stamp agents and burned stamps.
the mob also attacked such supposedly pro british aristocrats as the lieutenant governor thomas hutchinson who had privately opposed passage of the stamp act but who felt obliged to support it once it became law.
hutchinsons elegant house was pillaged and virtually destroyed.
the crisis finally subsided largely because england backed down.
the authorities in london were less affected by the political protests than by economic pressure.
many new stamp act repealed englanders had stopped buying english goods to protest the sugar act of 1764 and the stamp act caused the boycott to spread.
with pressure from english merchants parliament under a new prime minister the marquis of rockingham repealed the unpopular law on march 18 1766.
to satisfy his strong and vociferous opponents rockingham also pushed through the declaratory act which confirmed parliamentary authority over the colonies in all cases whatsoever but in their rejoicing over the stamp act repeal most americans paid little attention to this sweeping declaration of power.
internal rebellions the conflicts with britain were not the only uprisings emerging in the turbulent years of the 1760s.
in addition to the stamp act crisis and other challenges to london there were internal rebellions that had their roots in the class system in new york and new england.
in the hudson valley in new york great estates had grown up in which owners had rented out their land to small farmers.
the revolutionary fervor of the time led many of these tenants to demand ownership of the land they worked.
to emphasize their determination they stopped paying rents.
the rebellion soon failed but other challenges continued.
in vermont which still was governed by new york insurgent farmers challenged landowners many of them the same owners whom tenants had challenged on the hudson by taking up arms and demanding ownership of the land they worked.
ethan allen later a hero of the revolutionary war and himself a land speculator took up the cause of the green mountain farmers and accused the landowners of trying to enslave a free people allen eventually succeeded in making vermont into a separate state which broke up some of the large estates.
the townshend program when the rockingham governments policy of appeasement met substantial opposition in england the king dismissed the ministry and replaced it with a new government led by the aging but still powerful william pitt who was now lord chatham.
chatham had in the past been sympathetic toward american interests.
once in office however he was at times so incapacitated by mental illness that leadership of his administration fell to the chancellor of the exchequer charles townshend.
the empire in transition 97 with the stamp act repealed the greatest remaining american grievance involved the mutiny or quartering act of 1765 which required colonists to shelter and supply british troops.
the colonists objected not so much to the actual burden as to being required by london to do so.
the massachusetts and new york assemblies went so far as to refuse to grant the mandated supplies to the troops.
townshend responded in 1767 by disbanding the new york assembly until the colonists agreed to obey the mutiny act.
by singling out new york he believed he would avoid antagonizing all the colonies at once.
he also imposed new taxes known as the townshend duties on various goods imported to the colonies from england lead paint townshend duties paper and tea.
townshend assumed that since these were taxes purely on external transactions imports from overseas as opposed to the internal transactions the stamp act had taxed the colonists would not object.
but all the colonies resented the suspension of the new york assembly believing it to be a threat to every colonial government.
and all the colonies rejected townshends careful distinction between external and internal taxation.
townshend also established a board of customs commissioners in america.
the new commissioners established their headquarters in boston.
they virtually ended smuggling in boston although smugglers continued to carry on a busy trade in other colonial seaports.
the boston merchants angry that the new commission was diverting the lucrative smuggling trade elsewhere helped organize a boycott of british goods that were subject to the townshend duties.
merchants in philadelphia and new york joined them in a nonimportation agreement in 1768 and later some southern nonimportation agreement merchants and planters also agreed to cooperate.
throughout the colonies american homespun and other domestic products became suddenly fashionable.
late in 1767 charles townshend died.
in march 1770 the new prime minister lord north hoping to end the american boycott repealed all the townshend duties except the tea tax.
the boston massacre before news of the repeal reached america an event in massachusetts inflamed colonial opinion.
the harassment of the new customs commissioners in boston had grown so intense that the british government had placed four regiments of regular troops in the city.
many of the poorly paid british soldiers looked for jobs in their off duty hours and thus competed with local workers.
clashes between the two groups were frequent.
on the night of march 5 1770 a mob of dockworkers liberty boys and others began pelting the sentries at the customs house with rocks and snowballs.
hastily captain thomas preston of the british regiment lined up several of his men in front of the building to protect it.
there was some scuffling one of the soldiers was knocked down and in the midst of it all apparently several british soldiers fired into the crowd killing five people.
this murky incident almost certainly the result of panic and confusion was quickly transformed by local resistance leaders into the boston the boston massacre in popular culture massacre it became the subject of such lurid and inaccurate accounts as the widely circulated pamphlet innocent blood crying to god from the streets of boston.
a famous engraving by paul revere portrayed the massacre as a calculated assault on a peaceful crowd.
the british soldiers tried before a jury of bostonians were found guilty only of manslaughter and given token punishment.
but colonial pamphlets and newspapers convinced many americans that the soldiers were guilty of official murder.
the leading figure in fomenting public outrage over the boston massacre was samuel adams.
england he argued had become a morass of sin and corruption only 98 chapter 4 the boston massacre 1770 by paul revere this sensationalized engraving of the conflict between british troops and boston laborers is one of many important propaganda documents by revere and others for the patriot cause in the 1770s.
among the victims of the massacre listed by revere was crispus attucks probably the first black man to die in the struggle for american independence.
the library of congress in america did public virtue survive.
in 1772 he proposed the creation of a committee of correspondence in boston to publicize the grievances against england.
other colonies followed massachusettss lead and a loose intercolonial network of political organizations was soon established that kept the spirit of dissent alive through the 1770s.
committee of correspondence the philosophy of revolt although a superficial calm settled on the colonies after the boston massacre the crises of the 1760s had helped arouse enduring ideological challenges to english authority and had produced powerful instruments for publicizing colonial grievances.
gradually a political outlook gained a following in america that would ultimately serve to justify revolt.
the ideas that would support the revolution emerged from many sources.
some were drawn from religious particularly puritan sources or from the political experiences of the colonies.
others came from abroad.
most important perhaps were the radical ideas the empire in transition 99 of the political opposition in great britain.
some were scots who considered the english state tyrannical.
others were embittered country whigs who felt excluded from power and considered the existing system corrupt and oppressive.
drawing from some of the great philosophical minds of earlier generations most notably john locke these english dissidents framed a powerful argument against their government.
central to this emerging ideology was a new concept of what government should be.
because humans were inherently corrupt and selfish government was necessary to protect individuals from the evil in one another.
but because any government was run by corruptible leaders the people needed safeguards against its possible abuses of power.
most people in both england and america considered the english constitution the best system ever devised to meet these necessities.
by distributing power among the three elements of society the monarchy the aristocracy and the common people the english political system had ensured that no individual or group could exercise unchecked authority.
yet by the mid seventeenth century dissidents in both england and america had become convinced that the constitution was in danger.
a single center of power the king and his ministers was becoming so powerful that it could not be effectively checked.
such arguments found little sympathy in most of england.
the english constitution was not a written document or a fixed set of unchangeable rules.
it was a general sense of the way things are done and most people in england were willing to accept changes in it.
americans by contrast drew from their experience with colonial charters in which the shape and powers of government were permanently inscribed on paper.
they resisted the idea of a flexible changing set of basic principles.
one basic principle americans believed was the right of people to be taxed only with their own consent a belief that gradually took shape in no taxation without representation the popular slogan no taxation without representation whatever the nature of a tax it could not be levied without the consent of the colonists themselves.
this clamor about representation made little sense to the english.
according to english constitutional theory members of parliament did not represent individuals or particular geographical areas.
instead each member represented the interests of the whole nation and indeed the whole empire.
the many boroughs of england that had no representative in parliament the whole of ireland and the colonies thousands of miles away all were thus represented in the parliament at london even though they elected no representatives of their own.
this was the theory of virtual representation.
but americans drawing from their experiences with their town meetings and their colonial assemblies believed in actual representation.
every community was entitled to its own representative elected by the people of that community.
since the colonists had none of their own representatives in parliament it followed that they were not represented there.
americans believed that the colonial assemblies played the same role within the colonies as parliament did within england.
the empire the americans argued was a sort of federation of commonwealths each with its own legislative body all tied together by loyalty to the king.
such ideas illustrated a fundamental difference of opinion between england and america over the question of where ultimate power lay.
by arguing that parliament had the right to legislate for the empire as a whole but that only the provincial assemblies could legislate for the individual colonies americans were in effect arguing for a division of sovereignty debated sovereignty.
parliament would be sovereign in some matters the assemblies in others.
to the british such an argument was absurd.
in any system of government there must be a single ultimate authority.
and since the empire was in their view a single undivided unit there could be only one authority within it the english government of king and parliament.
patterns of popular culture taverns in revolutionary massachusetts in colonial massachusetts as in many other american colonies in the 1760s and 1770s taverns or public houses as they were often known were crucial to the development of popular resistance to british rule.
the puritan culture of new england created some resistance to taverns and reformers tried to regulate or close them to reduce the problems caused by public drunkenness lewd behavior and anarchy but as the commercial life of the colonies expanded and more people began living in towns and cities taverns became a central institution in american social life and eventually in its political life as well.
taverns were appealing of course because they provided alcoholic drinks in a culture where the craving for alcohol and the extent of drunkenness was very high.
but taverns had other attractions as well.
they were one of the few places where people could meet and talk openly in public indeed many colonists considered the life of the tavern as the only vaguely democratic experience available to them.
the tavern was a mostly male institution just as politics was considered a mostly male concern.
and so the fusion of male camaraderie and political discourse emerged naturally out of the tavern culture.
as the revolutionary crisis deepened taverns and pubs became the central meeting places for airing the ideas that fueled resistance to british policies.
educated and uneducated men alike joined in 100 a nimated discussions of events.
those who could not read and there were many could learn about the contents of revolutionary pamphlets from listening to tavern conversations.
they could join in the discussion of the new republican ideas emerging in america by participating in tavern celebrations of for example the anniversaries of resistance to the stamp act.
those anniversaries inspired elaborate toasts in public houses throughout the colonies.
in an age before wide distribution of newspapers taverns and tavernkeepers were important sources of information about the political and social turmoil of the time.
taverns were also the settings for political events.
in 1770 for example a report circulated through the taverns of danvers massachusetts about a local man who was continuing to sell tea despite the colonial boycott.
the sons of liberty brought the seller to the bell tavern and persuaded him to sign a confession and apology before a crowd of defiant men in the public room.
almost all politicians who wanted any real contact with the public found it necessary to visit taverns in colonial massachusetts.
samuel adams spent considerable time in the public houses of boston where he sought to encourage resistance to british rule while taking care to drink moderately so as not to erode his stature as a leader.
his cousin john adams although somewhat more skeptical of taverns and more sensitive to the vices they encouraged also r ecognized their political value.
in taverns he once said bastards and legislatores are frequently begotten understand analyze evaluate 1.
why were taverns so important in edu cating colonists about the relationship with britain.
what gathering places today serve the same purposes as taverns did in colonial america.
taverns and politics the green dragon tavern is where protesters planned the boston tea party.
granger nyc all rights reserved.
sites of resistance colonists kept the growing spirit of resistance alive in many ways but most of all through writing and talking.
dissenting leaflets pamphlets and books circulated widely through the colonies.
in towns and cities men gathered in churches schools town squares and above all taverns to discuss politics.
taverns were also places where resistance pamphlets and leaflets could be distributed and where meetings for the planning of protests and demonstrations could be held.
massachusetts had the most elaborately developed tavern culture which was perhaps one reason why the spirit of resistance grew more quickly there than anywhere else.
see patterns of popular culture taverns in revolutionary massachusetts the apparent calm in america in the 1770s hid a growing sense of resentment about the continued enforcement of the navigation acts.
popular anger was visible in occasional acts of rebellion.
at one point colonists seized a british revenue ship on gaspe incident the lower delaware river.
in 1772 angry residents of rhode island boarded the british schooner gaspe set it afire and sank it.
the tea excitement the revolutionary fervor of the 1760s intensified as a result of a new act of parliament one that involved the business of selling tea.
in 1773 britains east india company on the verge of bankruptcy was sitting on large stocks of tea that it could not sell in england.
in an effort to save it the government passed the tea act of 1773 which gave the tea act the company the right to export its merchandise directly to the colonies without paying any of the regular taxes that were imposed on colonial merchants who had traditionally served as the intermediaries in such transactions.
with these privileges the company could undersell american merchants and monopolize the colonial tea trade.
the act angered influential colonial merchants and more important revived american passions about the issue of taxation without representation.
the law provided no new tax on tea.
but the original townshend duty on the commodity survived and the east india company was now exempt from paying it.
lord north had assumed that most colonists would welcome the new law because it would reduce the price of tea to consumers by removing the intermediaries.
but resistance leaders in america argued that the law in effect represented an unconstitutional tax on american merchants.
the colonists responded by boycotting tea.
101 102 chapter 4 unlike earlier protests most of which had involved relatively small numbers of people the tea boycott mobilized large segments of the population.
it also helped link the colonies together in a common experience of mass popular protest.
particularly important to the movement were the activities of colonial women who led the boycott.
the daughters of daughters of liberty liberty a recently formed womens patriotic organization proclaimed rather than freedom well part with our tea in the last weeks of 1773 with strong popular support some colonial leaders made plans to prevent the east india company from landing its cargoes.
in philadelphia and new york determined colonists kept the tea from leaving the companys ships and in charles town south carolina they stored it away in a public warehouse.
in boston local patriots staged a spectacular drama.
on the evening of december 16 1773 three companies of fifty men each masquerading as mohawk indians went aboard three the boston tea party ships broke open the tea chests and heaved them into the harbor.
as the electrifying news of the boston tea party spread colonists in other seaports staged similar acts of resistance.
parliament retaliated in four acts of 1774 closing the port of boston drastically reducing the powers of self government in massachusetts permitting royal officers in america to be tried for crimes in other colonies or in england and providing for the quartering of troops by the colonists.
these coercive acts were more widely known in america as the intolerable acts the coercive acts backfired.
far from isolating massachusetts they made it a m artyr in the eyes of residents of other colonies and sparked new resistance up and down the coast.
colonial legislatures passed a series of resolves supporting massachusetts.
consequences of the coercive acts womens groups mobilized to extend the boycotts of british goods and to create substitutes for the tea textiles and other commodities they were shunning.
in edenton north carolina fifty one women signed an agreement in october 1774 declaring their sincere adherence to the anti british resolutions of their provincial assembly and proclaiming their duty to do every thing as far as lies in our power to support the publick good cooperation and war beginning in 1765 colonial leaders developed a variety of organizations for converting popular discontent into action organizations that in time formed the basis for an independent government.
new sources of authority the passage of authority from the royal government to the colonists themselves began on the local level.
in colony after colony local institutions responded to the resistance movement by simply seizing authority.
at times entirely new institutions emerged.
the most effective of these new groups were the committees of correspondence.
virginia established the first intercolonial committees of correspondence which helped make possible continuous cooperation among the colonies.
after the royal governor dissolved the assembly in 1774 colonists met in the raleigh tavern at williamsburg declared that the intolerable acts menaced the liberties of every colony and issued a call for a continental congress.
the empire in transition 103 delegates from all the colonies except georgia were present when in september 1774 the first continental congress convened in philadelphia.
they made the first continental congress five major decisions.
first they rejected a plan for a colonial union under british authority.
second they endorsed a relatively moderate statement of grievances which addressed the king as most gracious sovereign but which also included a demand for the repeal of all oppressive legislation passed since 1763.
third they approved a series of resolutions recommending that military preparations be made for defense against possible attack by the british troops in boston.
fourth they agreed to a series of boycotts that they hoped would stop all trade with great britain and they formed a continental association to see that these agreements were enforced.
fifth the delegates agreed to meet again the following spring.
during the winter the parliament in london debated proposals for conciliating the colonists and early in 1775 lord north finally won approval for a series of measures known as the conciliatory propositions.
parliament proposed that the colonies would tax themselves at parliaments demand.
with this offer lord north hoped to separate the american moderates whom he believed represented the views of the majority from the extremist minority.
but his offer was too little and too late.
it did not reach america until after the first shots of war had been fired.
lexington and concord for months the farmers and townspeople of massachusetts had been gathering arms and ammunition and preparing minutemen to fight on a moments notice.
the minutemen continental congress had approved preparations for a defensive war and the citizensoldiers waited only for an aggressive move by the british regulars in boston.
there general thomas gage commanding the british garrison considered his army too small to do anything without reinforcements.
he resisted the advice general thomas gage of less cautious officers who assured him that the americans would back down quickly before any show of british force.
when general gage received orders to arrest the rebel leaders sam adams and john hancock known to be in the vicinity of lexington he still hesitated.
but when he heard that the minutemen had stored a large supply of gunpowder in concord eighteen miles from boston he decided to act.
on the night of april 18 1775 he sent a detachment of about 1 000 men out toward lexington hoping to surprise the colonials and seize the illegal supplies without bloodshed.
but patriots in boston were watching the british movements closely and during the night two horsemen william dawes and paul revere rode out to warn the villages and farms.
when the redcoats arrived in lexington the next day several dozen minutemen awaited them on the town common.
shots were fired and minutemen fell eight were killed and ten wounded.
advancing to concord the british discovered that the americans had hastily removed most of the powder supply.
all along the road back to boston the british were harassed by the gunfire of farmers hiding behind trees rocks and stone walls.
by the end of the day the british had lost almost three times as many men as the americans.
the first shots the shots heard round the world as americans later called them had been fired.
but who had fired them first.
according to one of the minutemen at lexington the british commander major thomas pitcairn had shouted to the colonists on his arrival disperse ye rebels when they ignored him he ordered his troops to fire.
british officers and soldiers claimed that the minutemen had fired first.
whatever the truth the rebels succeeded in circulating their account well ahead of the british version adorning it with tales of british atrocities.
the effect was to rally thousands of colonists to the rebel cause.

on the night of april 18 1775 paul revere and william dawes rode out from boston to warn the outlying towns of the approach of british troops.
revere was captured just west of lexington but dawes escaped and returned to boston.
the next morning british forces moved out of boston toward lexington where they met armed american minutemen on the lexington common and exchanged fire.
the british dispersed the americans in lexington.
but they next moved on to concord where they encountered more armed minutemen clashed again and were driven back toward boston.
all along their line of march they were harassed by riflemen.
what impact did the battles of lexington and concord and the later battle of bunker hill also shown on this map have on colonial sentiment toward the british.
it was not immediately clear at the time that the skirmishes at lexington and concord were the first battles of a war.
but whether people recognized it at the time or not the war for independence had begun.
the war begins conclusion when the french and indian war ended in 1763 it might have seemed reasonable to expect that relations between the english colonists in america and great britain itself would have been cemented more firmly than ever.
but in fact the resolution of that conflict altered the imperial relationship forever in ways that ultimately drove americans to rebel against english rule and begin a war for independence.
to the british the lesson of the french and indian war was that the colonies in america needed firmer control from london.
the empire was now much bigger and it needed better administration.
the war had produced great debts and the americans among the principal beneficiaries of the war should help pay them.
and so for more than a decade after the end of the fighting the british tried one strategy after another to tighten control over and extract money from the colonies.
the empire in transition 105 to the colonists this effort to tighten imperial rule seemed both a betrayal of the sacrifices they had made in the war and a challenge to their long developing assumptions about the rights of english people to rule themselves.
gradually white americans came to see in the british policies evidence of a conspiracy to establish tyranny in the new world.
and so throughout the 1760s and 1770s the colonists developed an ideology of resistance and defiance.
by the time the first shots were fired in the american revolution in 1775 britain and america had come to view each other as two very different societies.
their differences which soon appeared irreconcilable propelled them into a war that would change the course of history for both sides.

how successful were these strategies during each phase.
how did the american revolution become an international conflict not just a colonial war against the british.
how did the new national government of the united states reflect the assumptions of republicanism.
two struggles occurred simultaneously during the seven years of war that began in april 1775.
the first was the military conflict with great britain.
the second was a political conflict within america.
the military conflict was by the standards of later wars a relatively modest one.
by the standards of its own day however it was an unusually savage conflict pitting not only army against army but the civilian population against a powerful external force.
the shift of the war from a traditional conventional struggle to a new kind of conflict a revolutionary war for liberation is what made it possible for the united states to defeat the more powerful british.
at the same time americans were wrestling with the great political questions that the conflict necessarily produced first whether to demand independence from britain second how to structure the new nation they had proclaimed and third how to deal with questions that the revolution had raised about slavery the rights of indians the role of women and the limits of religious tolerance in the new american society.
106 the states united time line although some americans had long expected a military conflict with britain the actual beginning of hostilities in 1775 found the colonies generally unprepared for war against the worlds greatest armed power.
defining american war aims three weeks after the battles of lexington and concord when the second continental congress met in philadelphia delegates from every colony except georgia which had not yet sent a representative agreed to support the war.
but they disagreed about its purpose.
at one extreme was a group led by the adams cousins john and samuel richard henry lee of virginia and others who already favored independence at the other extreme was a group led by such moderates as john dickinson of pennsylvania who hoped for a quick reconciliation with great britain.
most americans believed at first that they were fighting not for independence but for a resolution of grievances against the british empire.
during the first year of fighting however many colonists began to change their minds.
the costs of the war were so high that the original war aims began to seem too modest to justify them.
many colonists were enraged when the british began trying to recruit indians african slaves and german mercenaries the hated hessians against them.
when the british government blockaded colonial ports and rejected all efforts at conciliation many colonists concluded that independence was the only remaining option.
thomas paines impassioned pamphlet common sense crystallized these feelings in january 1776.
paine who had emigrated from england less than two years before wanted to turn the anger of americans away from particular parliamentary measures and toward what he considered the root of the problem the english constitution itself.

one sees the revolution largely as a political and intellectual event the other as a social and economic phenomenon.
the revolutionary generation itself portrayed the conflict as a struggle over ideals and this interpretation prevailed through most of the nineteenth century.
but in the early twentieth century historians influenced by the reform currents of the progressive era began to identify social and economic forces that they believed had contributed to the rebellion.
carl becker for example wrote in a 1909 study of new york that two questions had shaped the revolution the first was the question of home rule the second was the question.
of who should rule at home the colonists were not only fighting the british but also were engaged in a kind of civil war a contest between radicals and conservatives.
other historians elaborated on beckers thesis.
j franklin jameson writing in 1926 argued many economic desires many social aspirations were set free by the political struggle many aspects of society profoundly altered by the forces thus let loose arthur m schlesinger maintained in a 1917 book that colonial merchants motivated by their own interest in escaping the restrictive policies of british mercantilism aroused american resistance in the 1760s and 1770s.
beginning in the 1950s a new generation of scholars began to reemphasize the role of ideology and de emphasize the role of economic interests.
robert e brown in 1955 and edmund s morgan in 1956 108 both argued that most eighteenth century americans shared common political principles and that the social and economic conflicts other historians had identified were not severe.
the rhetoric of the revolution they suggested was not propaganda but a real reflection of the ideas of the colonists.
bernard bailyn in the ideological origins of the american revolution 1967 demonstrated the complex roots of the ideas behind the revolution and argued that this carefully constructed political stance was not a disguise for economic interests but a genuine ideology rooted in deeply held convictions about rights and power.
the revolution he exclaimed was above all an ideological constitutional political struggle and not primarily a controversy between social groups undertaken to force changes in the organization of the society or the economy by the late 1960s a new generation of historians many influenced by the new left were reviving economic interpretations of the revolution by exploring the social and economic tensions that they claimed shaped the revolutionary struggle.
historians cited economic distress and the actions of mobs in colonial cities the economic pressures on colonial merchants and other changes in the character of american culture and society as critical prerequisites for the growth of the revolutionary movement.
gary nash attempting to reconcile the emphasis on economic interests with the role of ideology argued that the two things were not incompatible.
everyone has economic interests he claimed and everyone.

general cornwallis the commander of british forces in virginia did not himself attend the surrender.

mpi hulton archive getty images the british surrender ability to understand either.
also as linda kerber and others have argued the newer social interpretations have raised increasing interest in the experience of workers slaves women native americans and other groups previously considered marginal to public life as part of the explanation of the revolutionary struggle.
finally gordon wood in the radicalism of the american revolution 1992 revived an idea once popular and recently unfashionable that the revolution was a genuinely radical event that led to the breakdown of such long standing characteristics of society as deference patriarchy and traditional gender relations.
class conflict may not have caused the revolution he argued but the revolution had a profound even radical effect on society nevertheless.

110 chapter 5 it was simple common sense paine wrote for americans to break completely with a political system that could inflict such brutality on its own people.
common sense sold more than 100 000 copies in only a few months and helped build support for the idea of independence in the early months of 1776.
for more on the origins of the rebellion see debating the past the american revolution the declaration of independence in the meantime the continental congress in philadelphia was moving toward a complete break with england.
at the beginning of the summer it appointed a committee to draft a formal declaration of independence and on july 2 1776 it adopted a resolution that these independence declared united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connexion between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved two days later on july 4 congress approved the declaration of independence itself which provided formal justifications for this resolution.
the declaration launched a period of energetic political innovation as one colony after another reconstituted itself as a state by 1781 most states had produced written constitutions for themselves.
at the national level however the process was more uncertain.
in articles of confederation november 1777 finally congress adopted a plan for union the articles of confederation.
the document confirmed the existing weak decentralized system.
thomas jefferson a thirty three year old virginian wrote most of the declaration with thomas jefferson help from benjamin franklin and john adams.
the declaration expressed concepts that had been circulating throughout the colonies over the previous few months in the form of at least ninety other local declarations of independence declarations drafted up and down the coast by town meetings artisan and militia organizations county officials grand juries sons of liberty and colonial assemblies.
jefferson borrowed heavily from these texts.
the final document had two parts.
in the first the declaration restated the familiar contract theory of john locke that governments were formed to protect what jefferson called life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the second part it listed the alleged crimes of the king who with the backing of parliament had violated his contract with the colonists and thus had forfeited all claim to their loyalty.
mobilizing for war financing the war was difficult.
congress had no authority to levy taxes on its own and when it requisitioned money from the state governments none contributed more than a small part of its expected share.
congress had little success borrowing from the public since few americans could afford to buy bonds.
instead congress issued paper money.
printing presses turned out enormous amounts of continental currency and the states printed currencies of their own.
the result predictably was soaring inflation and congress soon found that the continental currency was virtually worthless.
ultimately congress financed the war mostly by borrowing from other nations.
after a first surge of patriotism in 1775 volunteer soldiers became scarce.
states had to pay bounties or use a draft to recruit the needed men.
at first the militiamen remained under the control of their respective states.
but congress recognized the need for a centralized military command and it created a continental army with a single commander in the american revolution 111 jean baptist de verger a french officer serving in america during the revolution kept an illustrated journal of his experiences.
here he portrays four american soldiers carrying different kinds of arms a black infantryman with a light rifle a musketman a rifleman and an artilleryman.
brown university library providence rhode island usa bridgeman images revolutionary soldiers chief george washington.
washington an early advocate of independence with considerable military experience was admired respected and trusted by nearly all patriots.
he took command of the new army in june 1775.
with the aid of foreign military experts such as the marquis de lafayette from france and the baron von steuben from prussia he built a force that prevailed against the mightiest power in the world.
even more important perhaps washingtons steadiness courage and dedication to his cause washington takes command provided the army and the people with a symbol of stability around which they could rally.
the war for independence as the war for independence began the british seemed to have overwhelming advantages the greatest navy and the best equipped army in the world the resources of an empire a coherent structure of command.
yet the united states had advantages too.
americans were fighting on their own ground.
they were more committed to the conflict than were the british.
and beginning in 1777 they received substantial aid from abroad.
but the american victory was also a result of a series of early blunders and miscalculations by the british.
it was finally a result of the transformation of the war through three distinct phases into a new kind of conflict that the british military for all its strength was unable to win.
the first phase new england for the first year of the conflict from the spring of 1775 to the spring of 1776 many english authorities thought that british forces were not fighting a real war but simply quelling pockets of rebellion in the contentious area around boston.

in the meantime american forces moved north in an effort to capture british strongholds in montreal and quebec with little success.
why would the british have considered new york a better base than boston.
withdrew from lexington and concord in april american forces besieged them in boston.
in the battle of bunker hill actually fought on breeds hill on june 17 1775 the patriots suffered severe casualties and withdrew.
but they inflicted even greater losses on the enemy.
the siege continued.
early in 1776 finally the british decided that boston was a poor place from which to fight.
it was in the center of the most anti british part of america and tactically difficult to defend because it was easily isolated and surrounded.
and so on march 17 1776 the redcoats evacuated boston for halifax nova scotia with hundreds of loyalist refugees americans still loyal to england and the king.
in the meantime a band of southern patriots at moores creek bridge in north carolina crushed an uprising of loyalists on february 27 1776.
and to the north the americans invasion of canada began an invasion of canada.
generals benedict arnold and richard montgomery unsuccessfully threatened quebec in late 1775 and early 1776 in a battle in which montgomery was killed and arnold was wounded.
by the spring of 1776 it had become clear to the british that the conflict was not just a local phenomenon.
the american campaigns in canada the agitation in the south and the growing evidence of colonial unity all suggested that england must prepare to fight a much larger conflict.
bunker hill the second phase the mid atlantic region during the next phase of the war which lasted from 1776 until early 1778 the british were in a good position to win.
indeed had it not been for a series of blunders and misfortunes they probably would have crushed the rebellion.
the american revolution 113 the british regrouped quickly after their retreat from boston.
during the summer of 1776 hundreds of british ships and 32 000 british soldiers arrived in new york under the command of general william howe.
he offered congress a choice william howe surrender with royal pardon or face a battle against apparently overwhelming odds.
to oppose howes great force washington could muster only about 19 000 soldiers he had no navy at all.
even so the americans rejected howes offer.
the british then pushed the patriot forces out of manhattan and off long island and drove them in slow retreat over the plains of new jersey across the delaware river and into pennsylvania.
the british settled down for the winter in northern and central new jersey with an outpost of hessians at trenton on the delaware river.
but washington did not sit still.
on christmas night 1776 he daringly recrossed the icy delaware river surprised and scattered the hessians and occupied trenton.
then he advanced to trenton and princeton princeton and drove a force of redcoats from their base in the college there.
but washington was unable to hold either princeton or trenton and finally took refuge in the hills around morristown.
still the campaign of 1776 came to an end with the americans having triumphed in two minor battles and with their main army still intact.
for the campaigns of 1777 the british devised a strategy to divide the united states in two.

the large map on the left shows the two prongs of the british strategy first a movement of british forces south from canada into the hudson valley and second a movement of other british forces under general william howe out from new york.
the strategy was designed to trap the american army between the two british movements.
what movements of howe helped thwart that plan.
the two smaller maps on the right show a detailed picture of some of the major battles.
the upper one reveals the surprising american victory at saratoga.
the lower one shows a series of inconclusive battles between new york and philadelphia in 1777 and 1778.
the revolution in the middle colonies 1776 1778 114 chapter 5 would come down from canada to meet him.
john burgoyne commander of the northern force began a two pronged attack to the south along both the mohawk and the upper hudson approaches to albany.
but having set the plan in motion howe strangely abandoned his part of it.
instead of moving north to meet burgoyne he went south and captured philadelphia hoping that his seizure of the rebel capital would bring the war to a speedy conclusion.
philadelphia fell with little resistance and the continental congress moved into exile in york pennsylvania.
after launching an unsuccessful attack against the british on october 4 at germantown just outside philadelphia washington went into winter quarters at valley forge.
howes move to philadelphia left burgoyne to carry out the campaign in the north alone.
he sent colonel barry st leger up the st lawrence river toward lake ontario.
burgoyne himself advanced directly down the upper hudson valley and easily seized fort ticonderoga.
but burgoyne soon experienced two staggering defeats.
in one of them at oriskany new york on august 6 patriots held off st legers force of indians and loyalists.
that allowed benedict arnold to close off the mohawk valley to st legers advance.
in the other battle at bennington vermont on august 16 new england militiamen mauled a detachment that burgoyne had sent to seek supplies.
short of materials with all help cut off burgoyne fought several costly engagements and then withdrew to patriot victory at saratoga saratoga where general horatio gates surrounded him.
on october 17 1777 burgoyne surrendered.
the campaign in upstate new york was not just a british defeat.
it was a setback for the ambitious efforts of several iroquois leaders.
although the iroquois confederacy had declared its neutrality in the revolutionary war in 1776 some of its members allied themselves with the british among them a mohawk brother and sister joseph and mary brant.
this ill fated alliance further divided the already weakened joseph and mary brant iroquois confederacy because only three of the iroquois nations the mohawk the seneca and the cayuga followed the brants in support of the british.
a year after the defeat at oriskany iroquois forces joined british troops in a series of raids on white settlements in upstate new york.
patriot forces under the command of general john sullivan harshly retaliated wreaking such destruction on indian settlements that large groups of iroquois fled north into canada to seek refuge.
many never returned.
john burgoyne securing aid from abroad the leaders of the american effort knew that victory would not be likely without aid from abroad.
their most promising allies they realized were the french who stood to gain from seeing britain lose a crucial part of its empire.
at first france provided the united states with badly needed supplies.
but they remained reluctant to formally acknowledge the new nation despite the efforts of benjamin franklin in paris to lobby for aid and diplomatic recognition.
frances foreign minister the count de vergennes wanted evidence that the americans had a real chance of winning.
the british defeat at saratoga he believed offered that evidence.
when the news from saratoga arrived in london and paris in early december 1777 a shaken lord north made a new peace offer complete home rule within the empire for americans if they would quit the war.
vergennes feared the americans might accept the french diplomatic recognition offer and thus destroy frances opportunity to weaken britain.
encouraged by franklin he agreed on february 6 1778 to give formal recognition to the united states and to provide it with greatly expanded military assistance.
the american revolution 115 frances decision made the war an international conflict which over the years pitted france spain and the netherlands against great britain.
that helped reduce the resources available for the english effort in america.
but france remained americas most important ally.
the final phase the south the american victory at saratoga and the intervention of the french transformed the war.
instead of mounting a full scale military struggle against the american army the british now tried to enlist the support of those elements of the american britains southern strategy population who were still loyal to the crown.
since loyalist sentiment was strongest in the south and since the english also hoped slaves would rally to their cause the main focus of the british effort shifted there.
the new strategy failed dismally.
british forces spent three years from 1778 to 1781 moving through the south.
but they had badly overestimated the extent of loyalist sentiment.
and they had underestimated the logistical problems they would face.

what errors led the british to their surrender at yorktown.
america in the world the age of revolutions the american revolution was a result of tensions and conflicts between imperial britain and its north american colonies.
but it was also both a part and a cause of what historians have come to call an age of revolutions which spread through much of the western world in the last decades of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth.
the modern idea of revolution the overturning of old systems and regimes and the creation of new ones was to a large degree a product of the ideas of the enlightenment.
among those ideas was the notion of popular sovereignty articulated by among others the english philosopher john locke.
locke argued that political authority did not derive from the divine right of kings or the inherited authority of aristocracies but from the consent of the governed.
a related enlightenment idea was the concept of individual freedom which challenged the traditional belief that governments had the right to prescribe the way people act speak and even think.
champions of individual freedom in the eighteenth century among them the french philosopher voltaire advocated religious toleration and freedom of thought and expression.
the enlightenment also helped spread the idea of political and legal equality for all people the end of special privileges for aristocrats and elites and the right of all citizens to participate in the formation of policies and laws.
jean jacques rousseau a swissfrench theorist helped define these new ideas of equality.
together enlightenment ideas formed the basis for challenges to existing social orders in many parts of the western world and eventually beyond it.
the american revolution was the first and in many ways most influential of the enlightenment derived uprisings against 116 e stablished orders.
it served as an inspiration to people in other lands who opposed unpopular regimes.
in 1789 a little over a decade after the beginning of the american revolution dissenters rebelled in france at first through a revolt by the national legislature against the king and then through a series of increasingly radical challenges to established authority.
the monarchy was abolished and the king and queen publicly executed in 1793 the authority of the catholic church was challenged and greatly weakened and at the peak of revolutionary chaos during the jacobin period 1793 1794 over 40 000 suspected enemies of the revolution were executed and hundreds of thousands of others imprisoned.
the radical phase of the revolution came to an end in 1799 when napoleon bonaparte a young general seized power and began to build a new french empire.
but frances ancien regime of king and aristocracy never wholly revived.
together the french and american revolutions helped inspire uprisings in many other parts of the atlantic world.
in 1791 a major slave revolt began in haiti and soon attracted over 100 000 rebels.
the army of enslaved people defeated both the white settlers of the island and the french colonial armies sent to quell their rebellion.
under the leadership of toussaint louverture they began to agitate for independence which they obtained on january 1 1804 a few months after toussaints death.
the ideas of these revolutions spread next into spanish and portuguese colonies in the americas particularly among the so called creoles people of european ancestry born in the americas.
in the late eighteenth century they began to resist the continuing authority of colonial officials from spain and portugal and to demand a greater say in governing their own lands.
when napoleons french armies this painting portrays the storming of the great parisian fortress and prison the bastille on july 14 1789.
the bastille was a despised symbol of royal tyranny to many of the french because of the arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned people who were sent there.
the july assault was designed to release the prisoners but in fact the revolutionaries found only seven people in the vast fortress.
even so the capture of the bastille which marked one of the first moments in which ordinary frenchmen joined the revolution became one of the great moments in modern french history.
the anniversary of the event bastille day remains the french national holiday.

in the years that followed revolutions swept through much of latin america.
mexico became an independent nation in 1821 and provinces of central america that had once been part of mexico guatemala el salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica established their independence three years later.
simn bolvar modeling his efforts on those of george washington movement that helped inspire revolutionary campaigns in venezuela ecuador and peru all of which won their independence in the 1820s.
at about the same time greek patriots drawing from the examples of other revolutionary nations launched a movement to win their independence from the ottoman empire which finally succeeded in 1830.
the age of revolutions left many new independent nations in its wake.
it did not however succeed in establishing the ideals of popular sovereignty individual freedom and political equality in all the nations it affected.
slavery survived in the united states and in many areas of latin america.
new forms of aristocracy and even monarchy emerged in france mexico brazil and elsewhere.
women many of whom had hoped the revolutionary age would win them new rights made few legal or political gains in this era.
but the ideals that the revolutionary era introduced to the western world continued to shape the histories of nations throughout the nineteenth century and beyond.

the british by contrast suffered all the disadvantages of an army in hostile territory.
it was this phase of the conflict that made the war revolutionary not only because revolutionary phase it introduced a new kind of warfare but because it had the effect of mobilizing and politicizing large groups of the population.
with the war expanding into previously isolated communities and with many civilians forced to involve themselves whether they liked it or not the political climate of the united states grew more heated than ever.
and support for independence far from being crushed greatly increased.
in the north the fighting settled into a stalemate.
sir henry clinton replaced the unsuccessful william howe in may 1778 and moved what had been howes army from philadelphia back to new york.
the british troops stayed there for more than a year.
in the meantime george rogers clark led a patriot expedition over the appalachian mountains and captured settlements in the illinois country from the british and their indian allies.
on the whole however there was relatively little military activity in the north after 1778.
there was however considerable intrigue.
in the fall of 1780 american forces benedict arnolds betrayal were shocked by the exposure of treason on the part of general benedict arnold.
convinced that the american cause was hopeless arnold conspired with british agents to betray the patriot stronghold at west point on the hudson river.
when the scheme was exposed and foiled arnold fled to the safety of the british camp where he spent the rest of the war.
the british did have some significant military successes during this period.
on december 29 1778 they captured savannah georgia.
after taking the port of charleston south carolina on may 12 1780 they advanced into the interior.
although the british were able to win conventional battles they faced constant harrassment from such patriot guerrillas as thomas sumter andrew pickens and francis marion the swamp fox penetrating to camden south carolina lord cornwallis whom clinton named british commander in the south met and crushed a patriot force under horatio gates on august 16 1780.
congress recalled gates and washington replaced him with nathanael greene one of the ablest american generals of his time.
even before greene arrived in the south the tide of battle had begun to turn against cornwallis.
at kings mountain near the north carolina south carolina border on october 7 1780 a band of patriot riflemen from the backwoods killed wounded or captured every man in a force of 1 100 new york and south carolina loyalists upon whom cornwallis had depended.
once greene arrived he confused and exasperated cornwallis by dividing the american forces into fast moving contingents while avoiding open conventional battles.
one of the contingents inflicted what cornwallis admitted was a very unexpected and severe blow at cowpens on january 17 1781.
finally after receiving reinforcements greene combined all his forces and maneuvered to meet the british at guilford court house north carolina.
after a hard fought battle there on march 15 1781 greene was driven from the field but cornwallis had lost so many men that he decided to abandon the carolina campaign.
instead he moved north hoping to conduct raids in the interior of virginia.
but clinton fearful that the southern army might be destroyed ordered him to take up a defensive position at yorktown.
american and french forces quickly descended on yorktown.
washington and the yorktown count de rochambeau marched a french american army from new york to join the marquis de lafayette in virginia while admiral de grasse took a french fleet with additional troops up chesapeake bay to the york river.
these joint operations caught cornwallis between land and sea.
after a few shows of resistance he surrendered on october 17 1781.
two days later as a military band played the world turned upside down he surrendered his whole army of more than 7 000.
the american revolution 119 winning the peace cornwalliss defeat provoked outcries in england against continuing the war.
lord north resigned as prime minister lord shelburne emerged from the political wreckage to succeed him and british emissaries appeared in france to talk informally with the american diplomats there benjamin franklin john adams and john jay.
the americans were under instructions to cooperate with france in their negotiations with england.
but vergennes insisted that france could not agree to any settlement with england until its ally spain had achieved its principal war aim winning back gibraltar from the british.
there was no real prospect of that happening soon and the americans began to fear that the alliance with france might keep them at war indefinitely.
as a result the americans began proceeding on their own without informing vergennes and soon drew up a preliminary treaty with great britain which was signed on november 30 1782.
benjamin franklin in the meantime skillfully pacified vergennes franklins diplomacy and avoided an immediate rift in the french american alliance.
the final treaty signed september 3 1783 was on the whole remarkably favorable to the united states.
it provided a clear cut recognition of independence and a large though ambiguous cession of territory to the new nation from the southern boundary of canada to the northern boundary of florida and from the atlantic to the mississippi.
the american people had good reason to celebrate as the last of the british occupation forces embarked from new york.
dissenters around the world too found inspiration in news of the revolution.
see america in the world the age of revolutions war and society historians have long debated whether the american revolution was a social as well as a political revolution.
but whatever the intention of those who launched and fought the war the conflict transformed american society.
loyalists and minorities estimates differ as to how many americans remained loyal to england during the revolution but it is clear that there were many at least one fifth and some estimate as much as one third of the white population.
some were officeholders in the imperial government.
others were merchants whose trade was closely tied to the imperial system.
still others were people who lived in relative isolation and had simply retained their traditional loyalties.
and there were those who expecting the british to win the war were currying favor with the anticipated victors.
many of these loyalists were hounded by patriots in their communities and harassed by legislative and judicial actions.
up to 100 000 fled the country.
those who could afford it moved to england.
others moved to canada establishing the first the loyalists plight english speaking community in the french speaking province of quebec.
some returned to america after the war and gradually reentered the life of the nation.
the war weakened other groups as well.
the anglican church many of whose members were loyalists lost its status as the official religion of virginia and maryland.
by the time the fighting ended many anglican parishes could no longer even afford clergymen.
also weakened were the quakers whose pacifism gave them widespread unpopularity.
120 chapter 5 other protestant denominations however grew stronger.
presbyterian congregational and baptist churches successfully tied themselves to the patriot cause.
most american catholics also supported the patriots and won increased popularity as a result.
shortly after the peace treaty was signed the vatican provided the united states with its own hierarchy and in 1789 its first bishop.
the war and slavery for some african americans the war meant freedom because the british enabled many escaped slaves to leave the country as a way of disrupting the american war effort.
in south carolina for example nearly one third of all slaves defected during the war.
for other african americans the revolution meant an increased exposure to the exposure to revolutionary ideas concept although seldom to the reality of liberty.
most african americans could not read but few could avoid the new and exciting ideas circulating through the towns and cities and even the plantations where they lived.
in several communities slaves exposed to revolutionary ideas engaged in open resistance to white control.
in charleston south carolina for example thomas jeremiah a free black man was executed after white authorities learned of elaborate plans for a slave uprising.
slaveowners opposed the british efforts to emancipate their slaves but they also feared that the revolution itself would foment slave rebellions.
although the ideals of the revolution produced occasional challenges to slavery by white southerners including laws in virginia and maryland permitting slaveowners to free manumit their slaves if they wished white support for slavery survived.
southern churches some of which flirted briefly with voicing objections to the system quickly rejected the antislavery ideas of the north and worked instead to reinforce white superiority.
in much of the north by contrast the combination of revolutionary sentiment and evangelical christian fervor helped spread antislavery sentiments widely through society.
the first target was the slave trade which was prohibited by several states pennsylvania rhode island and connecticut among them.
the antislavery movement next attacked state laws forbidding owners from freeing their slaves.
quakers and other antislavery activists succeeded in pressuring legislatures to allow legal emancipation in all the northern states and even in kentucky and tennessee before the end of the revolution.
the final step was emancipation of all slaves in a state.
pennsylvania was the first state in 1780 to declare slavery illegal within its borders again in part because of the influence of the gradual emancipation in the north fiercely antislavery quakers.
one by one all the northern states except new york and new jersey abolished slavery before the end of the revolution.
new york followed in 1799 and new jersey in 1804.
but northern emancipation was a gradual process in most states despite changes in the law.
a significant although steadily dwindling number of slaves remained in the north for several decades.
the revolution exposed the continuing tension between the nations commitment to liberty and its simultaneous commitment to slavery.
to people in our time and even to some people in revolutionary times liberty and slavery seem incompatible with each other.
but to many white americans in the eighteenth century especially in the south that did not seem obvious.
many white southerners believed in fact that enslaving africans whom they considered inferior and unfit for citizenship was the best way to ensure liberty for white people.
they feared that without slaves it would be necessary to recruit a servile white workforce in the south and that the resulting inequalities would jeopardize the survival of liberty.
one of the ironies of the american revolution was that the american revolution 121 many white americans were fighting both to secure freedom for themselves and to preserve slavery for others.
native americans and the revolution indians also viewed the american revolution with considerable uncertainty.
most tribes ultimately chose to stay out of the war.
but many indians feared that the revolution would replace a somewhat trustworthy ruling group the british who had tried to limit the expansion of white settlement into tribal land with one they considered generally hostile to them the patriots who had spearheaded the expansion.
thus some indians chose to join the english cause.
still others took advantage of the conflict to launch attacks of their own.
in the western carolinas and virginia cherokee led by chief dragging canoe launched a series of attacks on outlying white settlements in the summer of 1776.
patriot militias responded in great force ravaging cherokee lands and forcing the chief and many of his followers to flee west across the tennessee river.
those cherokee who remained behind agreed to a new treaty by which they gave up still more land.
some iroquois despite the setbacks at oriskany continued to wage war against americans in the west and caused widespread destruction in agricultural areas of new york and pennsylvania.
the retaliating american armies inflicted heavy losses on the indians but the attacks continued.
in the end the revolution generally weakened the position of native americans in several ways.
the patriot victory increased white demand for western lands.
many whites resented the assistance such nations as the mohawk had given the british and insisted on treating them as conquered people.
others drew from the native american position weakened revolution a paternalistic view of the tribes.
thomas jefferson for example came to view the indians as noble savages uncivilized in their present state but redeemable if they were willing to adapt to the norms of white society.
the triumph of the american patriots in the revolution contributed to the ultimate defeat of the indian tribes.
to white americans independence meant among other things their right to move aggressively into the western lands despite the opposition of the indians.
to the indians american independence was the greatest blow that could have been dealt us one tribal leader warned.
womens rights and roles the long revolutionary war had a profound effect on american women.
the departure of so many men to fight in the patriot armies left women in charge of farms and businesses.
often women handled these tasks with great success.
but in other cases inexperience inflation the unavailability of male labor or the threat of enemy troops led to failure.
some women whose husbands or fathers were called away to war did not have even a farm or shop to fall back on.
cities and towns had significant populations of impoverished women who on occasion led protests against price increases rioted or looted food.
at other times women launched attacks on occupying british troops whom they were required to house and feed at considerable expense.
not all women stayed behind when the men went off to war.
some joined their male relatives in the camps of the patriot armies.
these female camp followers increased army morale and provided a ready source of volunteers to cook launder nurse and do other necessary tasks.
in the rough environment of the camps traditional gender distinctions proved difficult to maintain.
considerable numbers of women became involved at least intermittently in combat.
a few women even disguised themselves as men to be able to fight.
co ns ider t he s o urc e the correspondence of abigail adams on womens rights 1776 between march and may 1776 abigail adams exchanged letters with her husband john and with mercy otis warren one of the few female political writers of the day.
in these notes the correspondents discussed the matter of womens rights in revolutionary america.
abigail adams to john adams march 31 1776 i long to hear that you have declared an independancy sic and by the way in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i would desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors.
do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.
remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
if particuliar care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebelion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.
that your sex are naturally tyrannical is a truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of master for the more tender and endearing one of friend.
why then not put it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity.
men of sense in all ages abhor those customs which treat us only as the vassals of your sex.
regard us then as beings placed by providence under your protection and in immitation of the supreme being make use of that power only for our happiness.
john adams to abigail adams april 14 1776 as to declarations of independency be patient.
read our privateering laws and our commercial laws.
what signifies a word.
122 as to your extraordinary code of laws i cannot but laugh.
we have been told that our struggle has loosened the bands of government every where.
that children and apprentices were disobedient that schools and colleges were grown turbulent that indians slighted their guardians and negroes grew insolent to their masters.
but your letter was the first intimation that another tribe more numerous and powerful than all the rest were grown discontented.
this is rather too coarse a compliment but you are so saucy i wont blot it out.
depend upon it we know better than to repeal our masculine systems.
altho they are in full force you know they are little more than theory.
we dare not exert our power in its full latitude.
we are obliged to go fair and softly and in practice you know we are the subjects.
we have only the name of masters and rather than give up this which would completely subject us to the despotism of the peticoat i hope general washington and all our brave heroes would fight.
abigail adams to mercy otis warren braintree april 27 1776 he is very saucy to me in return for a list of female grievances which i transmitted to him i think i will get you to join me in a petition to congress.
i thought it was very probable our wise statesmen would erect a new government and form a new code of laws.
i ventured to speak a word on behalf of our sex who are rather hardly dealt with by the laws of england which gives such unlimited power to the husband to use his wife.
i requested that our legislators would consider our case and as all men of delicacy and sentiment are adverse to exercising the power they possess yet as there is a natural propensity in human nature to domination i thought the most generous plan was to put it out of the power of the arbitrary and tyranick to injure us with impunity by establishing some laws in favour upon just and liberal principals.
i believe i even threatened fomenting a rebellion in case we were not considered and assured him we would not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we had neither a voice nor representation.
in return he tells me he cannot but laugh at my extraordinary code of laws.
that he had heard their struggle had loosened the bands of government that children and apprentices were disobedient that schools and colleges had grown turbulent that indians slighted their guardians and negroes grew insolent to their masters.
but my letter was the first intimation that another tribe more numerous and powerful than all the rest were grown discontented.
this is rather too coarse a complement he adds but that i am so saucy he wont blot it out.
so i have helped the sex abundantly but i will tell him i have only been making trial of the disinterestedness of his virtue and when weighd in the balance have found it wanting.
it would be bad policy to grant us greater power say they since under all the disadvantages we labour we have the ascendency over their hearts.
and charm by accepting by submitting sway.
abigail adams to john adams may 7 1776 i can not say that i think you very generous to the ladies for whilst you are proclaiming peace and good will to men emancipating all nations you insist upon retaining an absolute power over wives.
but you must remember that arbitrary power is like most other things which are very hard very liable to be broken and notwithstanding all your wise laws and maxims we have it in our power not only to free our selves but to subdue our masters and without violence throw both your natural and legal authority at our feet.
charm by accepting by submitting sway yet have our humour most when we obey understand analyze evaluate 1.

the emphasis on liberty and the rights of man led some women to begin to question their own position in society.
abigail adams wrote to her husband john adams in 1776 in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors see consider the source the correspondence of abigail adams on womens rights adams was simply calling for new protections against abusive and tyrannical men.
a few women however went further.
judith sargent murray one of the leading essayists of the late eighteenth century wrote in 1779 that womens minds were as good as those of men and that girls as well as boys therefore deserved access to education.
but little changed as a result.
under english common law an unmarried woman had some legal rights but a married woman had virtually no rights at all.
everything she 123 124 chapter 5 owned and everything she earned belonged to her husband.
because she had no property rights she could not engage in any legal transactions on her own.
she could not vote.
few legal rights for women she had no legal authority over her children.
nor could she initiate a divorce that too was a right reserved almost exclusively for men.
after the revolution it did become easier for women to obtain divorces in a few states.
otherwise there were few advances and some setbacks including the loss of widows rights to regain their dowries from their husbands estates.
the revolution in other words did not really challenge but actually confirmed and strengthened the patriarchal legal system.
still the revolution did encourage people of both sexes to reevaluate the contribution of women to the family and society.
as the new republic searched for a cultural identity for itself it attributed a higher value to the role of women as mothers.
the new nation was many americans liked to believe producing a new kind of citizen steeped in the principles of liberty.
mothers had a particularly important task therefore in instructing their children in the virtues that the republican citizenry now was expected to possess.
the war economy the revolution also produced important changes in the structure of the american economy.
after more than a century of dependence on the british imperial system american commerce suddenly found itself on its own.
english ships no longer protected american vessels.
in fact they tried to drive them from the seas.
british imperial ports were closed to american trade.
but this disruption in traditional economic patterns strengthened the american economy in the long run.
enterprising merchants in new england and elsewhere began to develop new commercial networks in the caribbean and south america.
by the mid 1780s american merchants were also developing an important trade with asia.
when english imports to america were cut off states desperately tried to stimulate domestic manufacturing.
no great industrial expansion resulted but there was a modest increase in production.
trade also increased substantially among the american states.
the creation of state governments at the same time as americans were struggling to win their independence on the battlefield they were also struggling to create new institutions of government to replace the british system they had repudiated.
the assumptions of republicanism if americans agreed on nothing else they agreed that their new governments would be republican.
to them republicanism meant a political system in which all power came from the people rather than from some supreme authority such as a king.
the success of such a government depended on the character of its citizenry.
if the population consisted of sturdy independent property owners imbued with civic virtue then the republic could survive.
if it consisted of a few powerful aristocrats and a great mass of dependent workers then it would be in danger.
from the beginning therefore the ideal of the small freeholder the independent landowner was basic to american political ideology.
jefferson the great champion of the independent yeoman farmer once wrote dependence begets subservience and venality suffocates the germ of virtue and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition the american revolution 125 another crucial part of that ideology was the concept of equality.
the declaration of independence had given voice to the idea in its most ringing phrase all men are created equal the innate talents and energies of individuals not their positions rhetoric of equality at birth would determine their roles in society.
some people would inevitably be wealthier and more powerful than others.
but all people would have to earn their success.
there might be no equality of condition but there would be equality of opportunity.
in reality of course the united states was never a nation in which all citizens were independent property holders.
from the beginning there was a sizable dependent labor force white and black.
american women remained both politically and economically subordinate.
native americans were systematically exploited and displaced.
nor was there ever full equality of opportunity.
american society was more open and more fluid than that of most european nations but the condition of a persons birth was almost always a crucial determinant of success.
nevertheless in embracing the assumptions of republicanism americans were adopting a powerful even revolutionary ideology and their experiment in statecraft became a model for many other countries.
the first state constitutions two states connecticut and rhode island already had governments that were republican in all but name.
they simply deleted references to england and the king from their charters and adopted them as constitutions.
the other eleven states however produced new documents.
the first and perhaps most basic decision was that the constitutions were to be written down because americans believed the vagueness of englands unwritten constitution had produced corruption.
the second decision was that the power of the curbing executive power executive which americans believed had grown too great in england must be limited.
pennsylvania eliminated the executive altogether.
most other states inserted provisions limiting the power of governors over appointments reducing or eliminating their right to veto bills and preventing them from dismissing the legislature.
most important every state forbade the governor or any other executive officer from holding a seat in the legislature thus ensuring that unlike in england the executive and legislative branches of government would remain separate.
even so most new constitutions did not embrace direct popular rule.
in georgia and pennsylvania the legislature consisted of one popularly elected house.
but in every other state there were upper and lower chambers and in most cases the upper chamber was designed to represent the higher orders of society.
there were property requirements for voters some modest others substantial in all states.
revising state governments by the late 1770s americans were growing concerned about the apparent instability of their new state governments.
many believed the problem was one of too much democracy.
as a result most of the states began to revise their constitutions to limit popular power.
by waiting until 1780 to ratify its first constitution massachusetts became the first state to act on the new concerns.
two changes in particular differentiated the massachusetts and later constitutions from the earlier ones.
the first was a change in the process of c onstitution massachusettss constitution 126 chapter 5 writing itself.
most of the first documents had been written by state legislatures and thus could easily be amended or violated by them.
massachusetts created the constitutional convention a special assembly of the people that would meet only for the purpose of writing the constitution.
the second change was a significant strengthening of the executive.
the 1780 massachusetts constitution made the governor one of the strongest in any state.
he was to be elected directly by the people he was to have a fixed salary in other words he would not be dependent on the legislature each year for his wages he would have significant appointment powers and a veto over legislation.
other states followed.
those with weak or nonexistent upper houses strengthened or created them.
most increased the powers of the governor.
pennsylvania which had no executive at all at first now produced a strong one.
by the late 1780s almost every state had either revised its constitution or drawn up an entirely new one in an effort to produce greater stability in government.
toleration and slavery most americans continued to believe that religion should play some role in government but they did not wish to give special privileges to any particular denomination.
the privileges that churches had once enjoyed were now largely stripped away.
in 1786 virginia enacted the statute of religious liberty written by statute of religious liberty thomas jefferson which called for the complete separation of church and state.
more difficult to resolve was the question of slavery.
in areas where slavery was already weak new england and pennsylvania it was gradually abolished.
even in the south there were some pressures to amend or even eliminate the institution every state but south carolina and georgia prohibited further importation of slaves from abroad and south carolina banned the slave trade during the war.
virginia passed a law encouraging the voluntary freeing of slaves.
nevertheless slavery survived in all of the upper and lower states.
there were several reasons racist assumptions among whites about the inferiority of blacks the enormous economic investments many white southerners had in their slaves and the inability of even such men as washington and jefferson who had moral misgivings about slavery to reasons for slaverys persistence envision any alternative to it.
if slavery was abolished what would happen to the black people in america.
few whites believed that black men and women could be integrated into american society as equals.
the search for a national government americans were much quicker to agree on state institutions than they were on the structure of their national government.
at first most believed that the central government should remain relatively weak and that each state would be virtually a sovereign nation.
it was in response to such ideas that the articles of confederation emerged.
the confederation the articles of confederation which the continental congress had adopted in 1777 provided for a national government much like the one already in place before indepenlimited power of the national government dence.
congress remained the central indeed the only institution of national authority.
its powers expanded to give it authority to conduct the american revolution 127 wars and foreign relations and to appropriate borrow and issue money.
but it did not have power to regulate trade draft troops or levy taxes directly on the people.
for troops and taxes it had to make formal requests to the state legislatures which could and often did refuse them.
there was no separate executive the president of the united states was merely the presiding officer at the sessions of congress.
each state had a single vote in congress and at least nine of the states had to approve any important measure.
all thirteen state legislatures had to approve any amendment of the articles.
during the process of ratifying the articles of confederation which required approval by all thirteen states broad disagreements over the plan became evident.
the small states had insisted on equal state representation but the larger states wanted representation to be based on population.
the smaller states prevailed on that issue.
more important the states claiming western lands wished to keep them but the rest of the states demanded that all such territory be turned over to the national government.
new york and virginia had to give up their western claims before the articles were finally approved.
they went into effect in 1781.
the confederation which existed from 1781 until 1789 was not a complete failure but it was far from a success.
it lacked adequate powers to deal with interstate issues or to enforce its will on the states.
diplomatic failures in the peace treaty of 1783 the british had promised to evacuate american territory but british forces continued to occupy a string of frontier posts along the great lakes within the united states.
nor did the british honor their agreement to make restitution to slave owners whose slaves the british army had confiscated.
disputes also erupted over the northeastern boundary of the new nation and over the border between the united states and florida.
most american trade remained within the british empire and americans wanted full access to british markets england however placed sharp restrictions on that access.
in 1784 congress sent john adams as minister to london to resolve these differences but adams made no headway with the english who were john adams ambassador to england never sure whether he represented a single nation or thirteen different ones.
throughout the 1780s the british government refused even to send a diplomatic minister to the american capital.
confederation diplomats agreed to a treaty with spain in 1786.
the spanish accepted the american interpretation of the florida boundary.
in return the americans recognized the spanish possessions in north america and accepted limits on the right of united states vessels to navigate the mississippi for twenty years.
but southern states incensed at the idea of giving up their access to the mississippi blocked ratification.
the confederation and the northwest the confederations most important accomplishment was its resolution of controversies involving the western lands.
the confederation had to find a way to include these areas in the political structure of the new nation.
the ordinance of 1784 based on a proposal by thomas jefferson divided the western territory into ten self governing districts each of which could ordinances of 1784 and 1785 petition congress for statehood when its population equaled the number of free inhabitants of the smallest existing state.
then in the ordinance of 1785 congress created a system for surveying and selling the western lands.
the territory north of the ohio river was to 128 chapter 5 the seven ranges first area surveyed rie ee 1st range lak pa ng um r ki us em l t t li o o hi ohio 1803 indiana cincinnati c d e virginia kentucky 1792 four sections reserved for subsequent sales r ve ri a b pennsylvania virginia northwest territory section 16 reserved for school funds 29 23 11 one section 640 acres 1 mile square a half section 320 acres b quarter section 160 acres c half quarter section 80 acres d e quarter quarter section 40 acres 26 20 8 one township 6 miles square 6 miles 2nd range 3rd range 4th range 5th range 6th range 7th range geographers line base line 1 mile land survey ordinance of 1785 in the ordinance of 1785 the congress established a new system for surveying and selling western lands.
these maps illustrate the way in which the lands were divided in an area of ohio.
note the highly geometrical grid pattern that the ordinance imposed on these lands.
each of the squares in the map on the left was subdivided into 36 sections as illustrated in the map at the lower right.
why was this grid pattern so appealing to the planners of the western lands.
be surveyed and marked off into neat rectangular townships each divided into thirty six identical sections.
in every township four sections were to be reserved by the federal government for future use or sale a policy that helped establish the idea of public land.
the revenue from the sale of one of these federally reserved sections was to support creation of a public school.
the precise rectangular pattern imposed on the northwest territory the grid became a model for all subsequent land policies of the federal government and for many other planning decisions in states and localities.
the grid also became characteristic of the layout of many american cities.
it had many advantages.
it eliminated the uncertainty about property borders that earlier more informal land systems had produced.
it sped the development of western lands by making land ownership simple and understandable.
but it also encouraged a dispersed form of settlement with each farm family separated from its neighbors that made the formation of community more difficult.
whatever its consequences however the 1785 ordinance made a dramatic and indelible mark on the american landscape.
the american revolution 129 the original ordinances proved highly favorable to land speculators and less so to ordinary settlers many of whom could not afford the price of the land.
congress compounded the problem by selling much of the best land to the ohio and scioto companies before making it available to anyone else.
criticism of these policies led to the passage in 1787 of another law governing western settlement legislation that became known as the northwest ordinance the 1787 ordinance abandoned the ten the northwest ordinance districts established in 1784 and created a single northwest territory out of the lands north of the ohio the territory could be divided subsequently into three to five territories.
it also specified a population of 60 000 as a minimum for statehood guaranteed freedom of religion and the right to trial by jury to residents of the region and prohibited slavery throughout the territory.
the western lands south of the ohio river received less attention from congress.
the region that became kentucky and tennessee developed rapidly in the late 1770s as slave owning territories and in the 1780s began setting up governments and asking for statehood.
the confederation congress was never able to resolve the conflicting claims in that region successfully.
indians and the western lands on paper the western land policies of the confederation brought order and stability to the process of white settlement in the northwest.
but in reality order and stability came slowly and at great cost because much of the land was claimed by the indians.
congress tried to resolve that problem in 1784 1785 and 1786 by persuading iroquois choctaw chickasaw and cherokee leaders to sign treaties ceding lands to the united states.
but those agreements proved ineffective.
in 1786 the leadership of the iroquois confederacy repudiated the treaty it had signed two years earlier.
other tribes had never really accepted the treaties affecting them and continued to resist white movement into their lands.
violence between whites and indians on the northwest frontier reached a crescendo in the early 1790s.
in 1790 and again in 1791 the miami led by the famed warrior little turtle defeated united states forces in two major battles.
efforts to negotiate a settlement failed because of the miamis insistence that no treaty was possible unless it forbade white settlement west of the ohio river.
negotiations did not resume until after general anthony wayne led 4 000 soldiers into the ohio valley in 1794 and defeated battle of fallen timbers the indians in the battle of fallen timbers.
a year later the miami signed the treaty of greenville ceding substantial new lands to the united states in exchange for a formal acknowledgment of their claim to the territory they had managed to retain.
this was the first time the new federal government recognized the sovereignty of indian nations in doing so it affirmed that indian lands could be ceded only by the tribes themselves.
that hard won assurance however proved a frail protection against the pressure of white expansion.
debts taxes and daniel shays the postwar depression which lasted from 1784 to 1787 increased the perennial american problem of an inadequate money supply a burden that weighed particularly heavily on debtors.
the confederation itself had an enormous outstanding debt accumulated during the revolutionary war and few means with which to pay it down.
it had sold war bonds that were now due to be repaid it owed money to its soldiers it had substantial debts 130 chapter 5 abroad.
but with no power to tax it could request money only from the states and it received only about one sixth of the money it asked for.
the fragile new nation was faced with the grim prospect of defaulting on its obligations.
this alarming possibility brought to prominence a group of leaders who would play a crucial role in the shaping of the republic for several decades.
robert morris the head of the confederations treasury alexander hamilton his young protg james madison of virginia and others all called for a continental impost a 5 percent duty on imported goods to be levied by congress and used to fund the debt.
many americans however feared that the impost plan would concentrate too much financial power in the hands of morris and his allies in philadelphia.
congress failed to approve the impost in 1781 and again in 1783.
the states had war debts too and they generally relied on increased taxation to pay them.
but poor farmers already burdened by debt considered such policies unfair.
they demanded that the state governments issue paper currency to increase the money supply and make it easier for them to meet their obligations.
resentment was especially high among farmers in new england who felt that the states were squeezing them to enrich already wealthy bondholders in boston and other towns.
throughout the late 1780s therefore mobs of distressed farmers rioted periodically in various parts of new england.
dissidents in the connecticut valley and the berkshire hills of massachusetts rallied behind daniel shays a former captain in the continental army.
shays issued a set of demands that included paper money tax relief a moratorium on debts and the abolition of imprisonment for debt.
during the summer of 1786 the shaysites prevented the collection of debts private or public and used force to keep courts from convening and sheriffs from selling confiscated property.

the american revolution 131 as a military enterprise shayss rebellion was a failure although it did produce some concessions to the aggrieved farmers.
shays and his lieutenants at first sentenced to death were later pardoned and massachusetts offered the protesters some tax relief and a postponement of debt payments.
but the rebellion had important consequences for the future of the united states for it added urgency to the movement to produce a new national constitution.
conclusion between a small inconclusive battle on a village green in new england in 1775 and a momentous surrender at yorktown in 1781 the american people fought a great and terrible war against the mightiest military nation in the world.
few would have predicted in 1775 that the makeshift armies of the colonies could withstand the armies and navies of the british empire.
but a combination of luck brilliance determination costly errors by the british and timely aid from abroad allowed the patriots as they began to call themselves to make full use of the advantages of fighting on their home soil and to frustrate british designs.
the war was not just a historic military event.
it was also a great political one for it propelled the colonies to unite to organize and to declare their independence.
having done so they fought with even greater determination defending now not just a set of principles but an actual fledgling nation.
by the end of the war they had created new governments at both the state and national level and had begun experimenting with new political forms.
the war was also important for its effects on american society for the way it shook the existing social order for the way it caused women to question their place in society and for the way it spread notions of liberty and freedom throughout a society that in the past had mostly been rigidly hierarchical.
even african american slaves absorbed some of the ideas of the revolution although it would be many years before they would be in any position to make much use of them.
victory in the american revolution solved many of the problems of the new nation but it also produced others.
what should the united states do about its relations with the indians and with its neighbors to the north and south.
what should it do about the distribution of western lands.
what should it do about slavery.
how should it balance its commitment to liberty with its need for order.
these questions bedeviled the new national government in its first years of existence.

what were the most important questions debated at the constitutional convention of 1787 and how were they resolved.
what were the main tenets of the federalist and antifederalist arguments on ratification of the constitution.
what were the origins of americas first party system.
by the late 1780s many americans had grown dissatisfied with the confeder ation.
it was they believed ridden with factions unable to deal effectively with economic prob lems and frighteningly powerless in the face of shayss rebellion.
a decade earlier americans had deliberately avoided creating a strong national government.
now they reconsidered.
in 1787 the nation produced a new constitution and a much more powerful government with three independent branches.
but the adoption of the constitution did not complete the creation of the republic for although most americans came to agree that the constitution was a nearly perfect document they often disagreed on what that document meant.

in 1783 its members timidly withdrew from philadelphia to escape army veterans demanding their back pay.
they took refuge for a while in princeton new jersey then moved on to annapolis maryland and in 1785 settled in new york.
delegates were often scarce.
only with great difficulty could congress produce a quorum to ratify the treaty with great britain ending the revolutionary war.

by 1786 such demands had grown so intense that even defenders of the existing system reluctantly agreed that the government needed strengthening at its weakest point its lack of power to tax.
the most effective advocate of a stronger national government was alexander hamilton the illegitimate son of a scottish merchant in the west indies who had become a successful new york lawyer.
hamilton now called for a national convention to overhaul the articles of confederation.
he found an important ally in james madison of virginia who persuaded the virginia legislature to convene an interstate conference on commercial questions.
only five states sent delegates to the meeting which took place at annapolis in 1786 but the conference approved a proposal by hamilton for a convention of special delegates from all the states to meet in philadelphia the next year.
at first there seemed little reason to believe the philadelphia convention would attract any more delegates than had the annapolis meeting.
then early in 1787 the the constitution and the new republic 135 news of shayss rebellion spread throughout the nation alarming many previously apathetic leaders including george washington who promptly made plans to travel to philadelphia for the constitutional convention.
washingtons support gave the meeting wide credibility.
a divided convention fifty five men representing all the states except rhode island attended one or more sessions of the convention that sat in the philadelphia state house from may to september 1787.
these founding fathers as they became known much later the founding fathers were relatively young the average age was forty four and well educated by the standards of their time.
most were wealthy property owners and many feared what one of them called the turbulence and follies of democracy.
yet all retained the revolutionary suspicion of concentrated power.
the convention unanimously chose washington to preside over its sessions and then closed it to the public and the press.
it then ruled that each state delegation would have a single vote and that major decisions would require not unanimity as they did in congress but a simple majority.
almost all the delegates agreed that the united states needed a stronger central government.
but there agreement ended.
virginia the most populous state sent a well prepared delegation to philadelphia led by james madison thirty six years old who had devised in some detail a plan for a new national government.
the virginia plan shaped the agenda of the madisons virginia plan convention from the moment edmund randolph of virginia opened the debate by proposing that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary even that brief description outlined a government very different from the confederation.
but the delegates were so committed to fundamental reform that they approved the resolution after only brief debate.
there was less agreement about the details of madisons virginia plan.
it called for a national legislature of two houses.
in the lower house states would be represented in proportion to their population.
members of the upper house were to be elected by the lower house under no rigid system of representation thus some of the smaller states might at times have no members at all in the upper house.
the proposal aroused immediate opposition among delegates from the smaller states.
william paterson of new jersey offered an alternative the new patersons new jersey plan jersey plan that would retain the essence of the confederacy with its one house legislature in which all states had equal representation.
it would however give congress expanded powers to tax and to regulate commerce.
the convention rejected patersons proposal but supporters of the virginia plan now realized they would have to make concessions to the smaller states.
they agreed to permit members of the upper house what became the senate to be elected by the state legislatures.
many questions remained unresolved.
among the most important was the question of slavery.
there was no serious discussion of abolishing slavery during the convention.
but other issues were debated heatedly.
would slaves be counted as part of the population in determining representation in congress.
or would they be considered property not entitled to representation.
delegates from the states with large slave populations wanted to have it both ways.
they argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation but as property if the new government levied taxes on the states on the basis of population.
representatives from states where slavery had disappeared or was expected soon to disappear argued that slaves should be included in calculating taxation but not representation.
