246 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation arbitrary power had been the ideal guiding the american revolution while the freedom to pursue happiness became the ideal driving the new nation.
to ensure their new freedoms the revolutionaries wrestled with a fundamental question what is the proper role and scope of government.
in answering that question they eventually developed new ways to divide and balance power among the various branches of government so as to manage the tensions between ensuring liberty and maintaining order.
but even with victory in the war america was a nation in name only.
the quest for true nationhood after the revolution was the most significant political transformation in modern history for americans would insist that sovereignty ultimate power resided not with a king or an aristocracy but with the people the mass of ordinary citizens.
forging a new nation the unlikely american victory in the revolutionary war stunned the world but the patriots had little time to celebrate.
as alexander hamilton a brilliant young army officer turned congressman noted in 1783 we have now happily concluded the great work of independence but much remains to be done to reach the fruits of it the transition from war to peace was neither simple nor easy.
america was independent but it was not yet a s elf sustaining nation.
in fact the declaration of independence never mentioned the word nation.
its official title was the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america during the war james madison of virginia predicted that the confederation government would be only temporary.
the present union will but little survive the present war he wrote.
the states must recognize he continued the necessity of the union during the war and its probable dissolution after it forging a new nation out of a confederation of thirteen rebellious colonies turned free and independent states posed huge challenges not the least of which was managing what george washington called a deranged economy suffocating in w ar related debts.
the accumulated war debt was 160 million a huge amount at the time amounting to the total national budget over the twenty years from 1790 to 1810.
such financial stress made for trying times in the first years of the american republic.
the period from the drafting of the declaration of independence in 1776 through the creation of the new federal constitution in 1787 and ending with the election of thomas jefferson as president in 1800 was fraught with instability and tension.
from the start the new nation experienced growing political divisions economic distress and foreign troubles.
three fundamental questions shaped political debate during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.
where would sovereignty reside in the new the confederation government 247 nation.
what was the proper relationship of the states to each other and to the national government.
and what was required for the new republic to flourish as an independent nation.
the efforts to answer those questions created powerful tensions that continue to complicate american life.
the confederation government young john quincy adams a future president called the years between 1783 and 1787 the critical period when american leaders developed sharp differences about economic policies international relations and the proper relationship of the states to the national government.
debates over those key issues unexpectedly gave birth to the nations first political parties and to this day continue to influence the american experiment in federalism the sharing of power among national state and local governments.
after the war many patriots who had feared government power and criticized british officials for abusing it now directed their attacks against the new state and national governments.
in 1783 after congress ran out of money some army officers upset at not being paid had threatened to march on congress and take over the government.
alexander hamilton reported that the unpaid soldiers had become a mob rather than an army without clothing without pay without provisions food without morals without discipline only george washingtons intervention stopped the rebellious officers from confronting congress.
at the same time state legislatures desperate for funds to pay off their war debts sparked unrest and riots by raising taxes.
the often violent clashes between the working poor and the state governments were a great disappointment to washington john adams and other revolutionary leaders.
for them and others disillusioned by the surge of democratic rebelliousness the critical period was a time of hopes frustrated a story shaded by regret at the absence of national loyalty and international respect.
the weaknesses of the articles of confederation in dealing with the postwar turmoil led political leaders to design an entirely new national constitution and federal government.
a loose alliance of states the articles of confederation formally approved in 1781 had created a loose alliance confederation of thirteen independent and often squabbling and ungovernable states.
the states were united only in theory in practice each state government acted on its own.
the first major provision of the articles insisted that each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence the weak national government under the articles had only one component a one house legislature.
there was no national president no executive 248 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation branch no separate national judiciary court system.
state legislatures not voters appointed the members of the confederation congress in which each state regardless of size or population had one vote.
this meant that rhode island with 68 000 people had the same power in the confederation congress as virginia the largest and most prosperous state with more than 747 000 inhabitants.
george washington called the confederation a h alf starved limping government it could neither regulate trade nor create taxes to pay off the countrys large war debts.
it could approve treaties with other nations but had no power to enforce their terms.
it could call for raising an army but could not force men to fill the ranks.
the congress in short could not enforce its own laws and its budget relied on undependable voluntary contributions from the states.
in 1782 for example the confederation asked the states to provide 8 million for the national government they sent 420 000.
the lack of state support forced the confederation congress to print paper money called continentals whose value plummeted to two cents on the dollar as more and more were printed leading to the joking phrase not worth a continental virtually no gold and silver coins remained in circulation they had all gone abroad to purchase items for the war.
the confederation government ran up a budget deficit every year of its existence.
it was even hard to find people to serve in such a weak congress.
and people openly doubted the stability of the new american republic.
as john adams wrote to thomas jefferson the union is still to me an object of as much anxiety as ever independence was yet in spite of its limitations the confederation congress survived the war years while laying important foundations for the new national government.
the articles of confederation were crucially important in supporting the political concept of republicanism representative democracy which meant that america would be governed not by kings or queens or nobles but by the authority of the people whose elected representatives would make decisions on their behalf.
the confederation congress also created the national governments first executive departments and formulated the basic principles of land distribution and territorial government that would guide americas westward expansion.
land policy in ending the revolutionary war and transferring britains north american colonies to america the treaty of paris doubled the size of the united states extending the nations western boundary to the mississippi river.

what were the key terms of the land ordinance of 1785.
how did the ordinance arrange for future states to enter the union.
wwn64 figure m6 1 first proof 31p0 x 31p6 boundaries of the thirteen original states became public domain owned and administered by the national government.
between 1784 and 1787 the confederation congress created three major ordinances policies detailing how the government owned lands in the west would be surveyed sold and developed.
these ordinances rank among the 250 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation confederations greatest achievements and among the most important in american history.
thomas jefferson drafted the land ordinance act of 1784 which urged states to drop their competing claims to indian held territory west of the appalachian mountains so that the vast unmapped area could be divided into as many as fourteen self governing territories of equal size.
in the new territories all adult white males would be eligible to vote hold office and write constitutions for their territorial governments.
when a territorys population equaled that of the smallest existing state rhode island it would be eligible for statehood.
before jeffersons plan could take effect however the confederation congress revised it through the land ordinance of 1785 which outlined a plan of land surveys and sales for the northwest territory the area that would become the states of ohio michigan indiana illinois and wisconsin and later on the great plains.
wherever indian lands were p urchased or taken they were surveyed and divided into six mile square townships laid out along a grid of lines running east west and north south.
each township was in turn divided into t hirty six sections one mile square 640 acres with each section divided into four farms.
the 640 acre sections of public lands were to be sold at auctions the proceeds of which went into the national treasury.
the northwest ordinance the third major land policy created by the confederation congress was the northwest ordinance of 1787.
it set forth two key principles the new western territories would eventually become states and slavery was banned from the region north of the ohio river slaves already there would remain slaves however.
the northwest ordinance also included a promise which would be repeatedly broken that indian lands shall never be taken from them without their consent for a new territory to become a state the northwest ordinance specified a three stage process.
first congress would appoint a territorial governor and other officials to create a legal code and administer justice.
second when the population of adult males reached 5 000 they could elect a territorial legislature.
third when a territorys population reached 60 000 free inhabitants it could draft a constitution and apply to congress for statehood.
diplomacy after the revolutionary war relations with great britain and spain remained tense because both nations kept trading posts forts and soldiers on american soil and both nations encouraged indians to resist american efforts to settle on their tribal lands.

icans to pay their prewar debts to british merchants.
another major irritant in u s british relations was the seizure of loyalist property.
during and after the war americans had confiscated tory homes businesses farms and slaves.
with spain the chief issues were the southern boundary of the united states and the right for americans to send boats or barges down the mississippi river which spain then controlled.
after the seven years war in 1763 spain had acquired the vast louisiana territory which included the valuable port of new orleans the mississippi river and all of the area west to the rocky mountains.
after the revolution spain closed the mississippi river to a merican use 252 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation infuriating settlers in kentucky and tennessee.
spain also regained ownership of florida which then included southern alabama.
thereafter the spanish governor in florida provided firearms to creek indians who resisted american encroachment on their lands in south georgia.
trade and the economy more troublesome than the behavior of the british and the spanish was the fragile state of the american economy.
seven years of warfare had nearly bankrupted the new nation.
the escape of some 60 000 slaves during and after the revolution was a terrible blow to the southern economy.
at the same time many men who had served in the army had never been paid.
civilians who had loaned money supplies crops and livestock to the war effort had also not been repaid.
after the war the british treated the united states as an enemy nation insisting that all americans who had been born in england were still bound by allegiance to king george iii.
british warships began stopping american ships in the atlantic boarding them and kidnapping english born american sailors and impressing them into service in the royal navy.
the british also closed their profitable island colonies in the caribbean to american commerce.
new england shipowners and southern planters were especially hard hit as exports of tobacco rice rum and other commodities remained far below what they had been before the war.
after 1783 merchant ships were allowed to deliver american products to england and return to the united states with english goods.
but u s vessels could not carry british goods anywhere else in the world.
to punish britain for banning u s trade with the british west indies many state governments imposed special taxes called tonnage fees on british vessels arriving in american ports and levied tariffs taxes on british goods brought to the united states.
the british responded by sending their ships to ports in states whose tariff rates were lower.
domestic industry american by charging different tariffs on the craftsmen such as this cabinetmaker same products the states waged comfavored tariffs on foreign goods that mercial war with each other.
the result competed with their own products.
was economic chaos.
by 1787 it was the gathering crisis 253 evident that the national government needed to regulate interstate trade and foreign relations especially in regard to british and spanish control of enormous territories bordering the united states.
scarce money complex financial issues also hampered economic development during the critical period.
there was no stable national currency and the nation had only three banks in philadelphia new york city and boston all created since 1782.
farmers who had profited during the war now found themselves squeezed by lower crop prices and mounting debts and taxes.
the widespread shortage of hard money gold and silver coins which had gone to european merchants to buy imported goods led people to postpone paying their bills.
by 1785 indebted citizens urged states to print new paper currency.
in a drama that would be replayed many times over the next century debtors believed that printing paper money would ease their plight by increasing the money supply inflation.
in 1785 1786 seven states began issuing their own paper money to help indebted farmers and to pay the cash bonuses promised to military veterans.
the gathering crisis the economic difficulties weakening the confederation were compounded by growing fears among wealthy gentlemen leaders natural aristocrats that the democratic energies unleashed by the revolution all men are born equal were undermining the authority of the traditional social and economic elite.
class distinctions were disappearing as many among the working poor and middling classes stopped deferring to their betters the so called better sort of people were appalled at the leveling behavior of the antifederal peasants little folks and demagogues who were challenging their leadership.
a virginia aristocrat grumbled that the spirit of independency that inspired the revolution was being converted into equality after the war.
the political culture was also changing more men could now vote and hold office as property owning qualifications were reduced or eliminated in several states.
the nation said wealthy new yorker john jay was headed toward evils and calamities because the masses were gaining power and often taking the laws into their own hands.
no sooner was the war over than americans with large debts again began to protest taxes.
to begin paying down their war debts most state legislatures 254 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation had sharply increased taxes.
in fact during the 1780s most americans paid three times as much in taxes as they had under british tyranny earlier they had objected to taxation without representation now they objected to taxation with representation.
some patriots lost farms because of their inability to pay the new taxes other debtors were imprisoned.
in new hampshire in what was called the exeter riot hard pressed farmers surrounded the legislative building demanding that the representatives print paper money to ease their plight.
similar appeals occurred in other states.
the economic and political elites were horrified that the new men were endangering the security of property by encouraging the printing of more money.
shayss rebellion fears of a taxpayer revolt from below became all too real in western massachusetts when struggling farmers many of them former soldiers demanded that the state issue more paper money and give them more time to pay the unjust taxes owed on their land.
farmers also resented the new state constitution because it raised the property qualifications for voting and holding elected office thus stripping poorer men of political power.
when the merchant dominated massachusetts legislature refused to provide relief however three rural counties in the western part of the state erupted in a disorganized revolt in 1786.
one rebel farmer plough jogger expressed the fears of many when he charged that the great men are going to get all we have and i think it is time for us to rise and put a stop to it and have no more courts nor sheriffs nor tax collectors nor lawyers armed groups of angry farmers called regulators banded together to force judges and sheriffs to stop seizing the cattle and farms of those who could not pay their taxes.
close down the courts they shouted.
a prominent bostonian reported that massachusetts was in a state of anarchy and confusion bordering on civil war the situation worsened when a shayss rebellion shays and his followers demanded that states ragtag army of unruly farmers led issue paper currency to help ease by t hirty nine year old daniel shays the payment of debts and the right to a war veteran marched on the federal postpone paying taxes until the postwar arsenal at springfield in the winter of agricultural depression lifted.
the state government responded creating the constitution 255 by sending 4 400 militiamen who scattered shayss debtor army with a single cannon blast that left four farmers dead and many wounded.
shays fled to vermont.
several others were arrested and two were hanged.
the rebels nevertheless earned a victory of sorts as the state legislature agreed to eliminate some of the taxes and fees on farmers.
news of shayss rebellion sent shock waves across the nation.
in massachusetts abigail adams the wife of future president john adams dismissed shays and his followers as ignorant restless desperadoes without conscience or principles in virginia george washington was equally concerned.
america he exclaimed needed a government by which our lives liberty and properties will be secured unless an alternative could be found to the weak confederation government anarchy and confusion will inevitably ensue creating the constitution in the wake of shayss rebellion a collective shiver passed through what wealthy new yorker john jay called the better kind of people many among the rich and well born agreed with george washington that the nation was tottering the time had come to empower the national government to bring social order and economic stability.
the crisis is arrived during the 1780s newspapers warned that the nations situation had grown critical and dangerous and that its vices were threatening national ruin the states were behaving like thirteen ungovernable nations pursuing their own trade regulations and foreign policies nine of them claimed to have their own navies.
our present federal government said henry knox a boston bookseller who was a general during the revolutionary war is a name a shadow without power or effect such concerns led political leaders to revise their assessment of the american republic.
we have probably concluded washington in 1786 had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation fellow virginian james madison agreed declaring in 1787 that the crisis is arrived it was time to create a new federal constitution that would repair the vices of the political system and decide forever the fate of republican government new yorker alexander hamilton urged that a national gathering of delegates from each state be given full powers to revise the articles of confederation.
the constitutional convention in 1787 the confederation congress responded to hamilton and others by calling for a special 256 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation federal convention to gather in philadelphias old state house now known as independence hall for the purpose of revising the articles of confederation only rhode island refused to participate.
the delegates began work on may 25 1787 meeting five hours a day six days a week.
after four months of secret deliberations t hirty nine delegates signed the new federal constitution on september 17.
only three delegates refused to sign.
the durability of the constitution reflects the thoughtful men who created it.
the delegates were all white their average age was f orty two with the youngest being t wenty six.
most were members of the political and economic elite.
twenty six were college graduates two were college presidents and thirty four were lawyers.
others were planters merchants bankers and clergymen.
yet the founding fathers were also practical men of experience tested in the fires of the revolutionary war.
t wenty two had fought in the war five of whom were captured and imprisoned by the british.
seven had been state governors and eight had helped write their state constitutions.
most had been members of the continental or confederation congresses and eight had signed the declaration of independence.
nearly all were considered gentlemen and more than half of them owned slaves.
drafting the constitution george washington presides over a session of the constitutional convention in philadelphia.
creating the constitution 257 drafting the constitution the widely respected even r evered george washington served as presiding officer at the federal convention later renamed the constitutional convention.
he participated little in the debates however for fear that people would take his prestigious opinions too seriously.
the governor of pennsylvania eighty one year old benjamin franklin the oldest delegate was in such poor health that he had to be carried to the meetings in a special chair borne aloft by inmates from the philadelphia jail.
like washington franklin said little from the floor but provided a wealth of experience wit and common sense behind the scenes.
most active at the convention was james madison of virginia the ablest political theorist in the group.
a thirty six year old attorney who owned a huge tobacco plantation called montpelier not far from jeffersons monticello madison had arrived in philadelphia with trunks full of books about governments and a head full of ideas about how best to strengthen the loose confederation of independent and sovereign states madison was an unlikely giant at constitution making.
barely five feet tall and weighing only 120 pounds a colleague said he was no bigger than half a piece of soap he was too frail to serve in the revolutionary army and suffered from occasional epileptic seizures.
he speaks low his person body is little and ordinary and he was too timid in his politics remarked crusty fisher ames of massachusetts.
although painfully shy and s oft spoken madison had an agile mind a huge appetite for learning and a lifelong commitment to public service.
he was determined to create a constitution that would ensure the supremacy of national authority the logic of his arguments and his pragmatic willingness to compromise on particular points proved decisive in shaping the new constitution.
every person seems to acknowledge his greatness said a georgia delegate.
most delegates agreed with madison james madison this 1783 miniature that their young republic needed a stron shows madison at t hirty two years old ger national government weaker state just four years before he would assume a major role in drafting the constitution.
legislatures and the power to restrain the 258 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation excessive democratic impulses unleashed by the revolution.
the evils we experience said elbridge gerry of massachusetts flow from the excess of democracy two interrelated assumptions guided the constitutional convention that the national government must have direct authority over the citizenry rather than governing through the state governments and that the national government must derive its legitimacy from the people rather than from the state legislatures.
the insistence on the sovereignty of the people that the voters were the legitimate source of all authority as james wilson of pennsylvania stressed was the most important political innovation since the declaration of independence.
by declaring the constitution to be the voice of the people the founders authorized the federal government to limit the powers of the state governments.
the delegates realized too that an effective national government needed new authority to collect taxes borrow and issue money regulate commerce fund an army and navy and make laws binding upon individual citizens.
this meant that the states must be stripped of the power to print paper money make treaties wage war and levy tariffs on imported goods.
this concept of dividing authority between the national government and the states came to be called federalism.
the virginia and new jersey plans james madison drafted the framework for the initial discussions at the constitutional convention.
his proposals called the virginia plan started with a radical suggestion that the delegates scrap their original instructions to revise the articles of confederation and instead create an entirely new constitution.
the virginia plan called for a national government with a supreme legislative executive and judiciary it proposed a new congress divided into two houses bicameral a lower house of representatives chosen by the voters and an upper house of senators elected by the state legislatures.
the more populous states would have more representatives in congress than the smaller states.
madison also wanted to give congress the power to veto state laws.
the virginia plan sparked furious disagreements.
when asked why the small states were so suspicious of the plan gunning bedford of delaware replied i do not gentlemen trust you on june 15 bedford and other delegates submitted an alternative called the new jersey plan developed by william paterson of new jersey.
it sought to keep the existing equal representation of the states in a unicameral one house national legislature.
it also gave congress the power to collect taxes creating the constitution 259 and regulate commerce and the authority to name a chief executive as well as a supreme court but not the right to veto state laws.
the three branches of government the intense debate over congressional representation was finally resolved in mid july by the so called great compromise which used elements of both plans.
the more populous states won apportionment the allocation of delegates to each state by population in the proposed house of representatives while the delegates who sought to protect state power won equality of state representation in the senate where each state would have two members elected by the legislatures rather than directly by the people.
the legislature the great compromise embedded the innovative concept of separation of powers in the new congress.
it would have two separate houses each intended to counterbalance the other with the house of representatives representing the voters at large and the senate representing the state legislatures.
the lower house the house of representatives was designed to be as george mason said the grand repository of the democratic principle of the government its members would be elected by the voters every two years.
under the articles of confederation none of the members of congress had been chosen by popular vote all of them had been elected by state legislatures.
james madison argued that allowing individual citizens to elect one part of the new legislature was essential to every plan of free government the upper house or senate was intended to be a more elite group its members elected by state legislatures for six year terms.
the senate was intended to be a conservative balancing force.
it could use its power to overrule the house of representatives or the president.
madison explained that the senate would help protect the minority of the opulent against the majority the presidency the constitutional convention struggled mightily over issues related to the executive branch.
some delegates wanted a powerful president who could veto acts of congress.
others felt the opposite that the president should simply execute the laws as passed by congress.
still others like benjamin franklin wanted a plural executive rather than a single man governing the nation.
the eventual decision to have a single chief executive caused many delegates considerable pause according to james madison.
george mason of virginia feared that a single president might start behaving like a king.
260 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation in the end several compromises ensured that the president would be powerful enough to counterbalance the congress.
in some cases the chief executives powers actually exceeded those of the british king.
the new president to be elected for four year terms could veto acts of congress subject to being overridden by a two thirds vote in each house in britain the royal veto over parliamentary legislation had long since been abandoned.
the president was to be the nations chief diplomat and commander in chief of the armed forces and was responsible for implementing the laws made by congress.
yet the powers of the president were also limited in key areas.
the chief executive could neither declare war nor make peace those powers were reserved for congress.
unlike the british monarch moreover the president could be removed from office.
the house of representatives could impeach bring to trial the chief executive and other civil officers on charges of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors an impeached president could be removed from office if t wo thirds of the senate voted for conviction.
to preserve the separation of the three branches of the new national government the president would be elected not by congress but by a group of highly qualified electors chosen by the people in local elections.
the number of electors for each state would depend upon the combined number of signing the constitution september 17 1787 thomas pritchard rossiters painting shows george washington presiding over what thomas jefferson called an assembly of demi gods in philadelphia.
creating the constitution 261 congressional representatives and u s senators.
this electoral college was a compromise between those wanting the president elected by congress and those preferring a direct vote of qualified citizens.
the judiciary the third proposed branch of government the judiciary sparked little debate.
the constitution called for a supreme national court headed by a chief justice.
the supreme courts role was not to make laws a power reserved to congress or to execute and enforce the laws reserved to the presidency but to interpret the laws and to ensure that every citizen received equal justice under the law.
the u s supreme court was given final authority in interpreting the constitution and in settling constitutional disputes between states.
furthermore article vi of the constitution declared that the federal constitution federal laws and treaties are the supreme law of the land state laws or constitutions to the contrary notwithstanding the limits of the constitution the men who drafted the new constitution claimed to be representing all americans.
to highlight that point the constitution begins with the words we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union.
establish this constitution for the united states of america in fact however as senator stephen douglas of illinois noted seventy years later the constitution was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity descendants forever important groups of americans were left out of the constitutions protections.
native americans for example were not considered federal or state citizens unless they paid taxes which very few did.
the constitution declared that native american tribes were not part of the united states but instead were separate nations slavery of all the issues that emerged during the constitutional convention of 1787 none was more explosive than slavery.
when the patriots declared independence in 1776 slavery existed in every state.
by 1787 however massachusetts pennsylvania connecticut and rhode island had abolished the practice.
many of the framers viewed slavery as an embarrassing contradiction to the principles of liberty and equality embodied in the declaration of independence and the new constitution.
a new jersey delegate declared that slavery 262 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation was utterly inconsistent with the principles of christianity and humanity by contrast most delegates from the southern states stoutly defended slavery.
religion and humanity have nothing to do with this slavery question declared john rutledge of south carolina.
interest alone is the governing principle of nations most southern delegates would have walked out had there been an attempt to abolish slavery.
so the framers did not consider ending the cursed system nor did they view the enslaved as human beings whose rights should be protected.
slaves were simply viewed as a form of property with a cash value.
those with qualms about slavery salved their consciences by assuming that the practice would eventually die out naturally.
if the slaves were not to be freed or their rights to be acknowledged however how were they to be counted.
since the size of state delegations in the proposed house of representatives was to be based on population southern delegates argued that slaves should be counted to help determine how many representatives from each state would serve in the new congress.
northerners countered that it made no sense to count slaves for purposes of congressional representation when they were treated as property rather than people.
the delegates finally agreed to a compromise in which t hree fifths of all other persons that is the enslaved would be included in population counts as a basis for apportioning a states congressional representatives.
in a constitution intended to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity the three fifths clause was a glaring example of compromise being divorced from principle.
the corrupt bargain over slavery would bedevil the nation for the next seventy five years.
by design the original constitution never mentions the word slavery.
instead it speaks of free persons and all other persons and of persons charles calvert and his slave 1761 in military regalia the five year held to service of labor the word old descendant of lord baltimore slavery would not appear in the confounder of maryland towers over his stitution until the thirteenth amendslave who is dressed as a drummer boy.
ment 1865 abolished it.
creating the constitution 263 the three fifths clause gave the southern states disproportionate power in congress by increasing the number of southern votes in the house of representatives.
this in turn increased southern influence in the electoral college since the number of each states electors was to be the total of its senators and representatives.
it was thus no accident that in the nations first sixteen presidential elections between 1788 and 1848 a southern slaveholder would be elected twelve times.
the p ro slavery nature of the constitution prompted the fiery abolitionist william lloyd garrison to declare in the 1830s that the framers of the document had forged a covenant with death and an agreement with hell the absence of women the delegates at the constitutional convention dismissed any discussion of political rights for women.
yet not all women were willing to maintain their traditional subordinate role.
just as the experiences of the revolutionary war led many african americans to seize their freedom some brave women demanded political equality for themselves.
eliza yonge wilkinson born in 1757 to a wealthy plantation family living on an island south of charleston south carolina lost her husband early in the war.
in june 1780 after wilkinson was assaulted and robbed by inhuman british soldiers she became a fiery patriot who hated tyranny in every shape she assured a friend that we may be led but we never will be driven likewise wilkinson expected greater freedom for women after the war.
the men say we have no business with politics she wrote to a friend.
i wont have it thought that because we are the weaker sex as to bodily strength my dear we are capable of nothing more than minding the dairy visiting the poultry house and all such domestic concerns wilkinson demanded more.
they wont even allow us the liberty of thought and that is all i want judith sargent murray a massachusetts essayist playwright and poet argued that the rights and liberties fought for by patriots belonged not just to men but to women too.
in her essay on the equality of the sexes published in 1790 she challenged the prevailing view that men had greater intellectual capacities than women.
she insisted that any differences resulted from prejudice and discrimination that prevented women from having access to formal education and worldly experience.
the arguments for gender equality however fell mostly on deaf ears.
at the constitutional convention in philadelphia there was no formal discussion of womens rights nor does the constitution even include the word women.
writing from paris thomas jefferson expressed the hope that american ladies would be contented to soothe and calm the minds of their husbands returning ruffled from political debate 264 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation immigration although america was a nation of immigrants the constitution said little about immigration and naturalization the process of gaining citizenship and most of what it said was negative.
in article ii section 1 it prohibits any future immigrant from becoming president limiting the office to a born citizen on defining citizenship the constitution gives congress the authority to establish a uniform rule of naturalization but offers no further guidance.
as a result naturalization policy has changed repeatedly over the years in response to fluctuating social attitudes economic needs and political moods.
in 1790 the first congress under the new constitution would pass a naturalization law that allowed free white persons who had been in the united states for as few as two years to be made naturalized citizens.
this meant that persons of african descent were denied citizenship it was left to individual states to determine whether free blacks were citizens.
because indians were not free white persons they were also treated as aliens.
not until 1924 would native americans be granted c itizenship by an act of congress rather than a constitutional amendment.
on september 17 1787 the federal convention reported that it had completed the new constitution.
gentlemen announced benjamin franklin you have a republic if you can keep it the fight for ratification the final draft of the constitution was submitted to thirteen special state conventions for approval ratification on september 28 1787.
over the next ten months people from all walks of life in taverns and coffeehouses on street corners around dinner tables and in the nations n inety two newspapers debated the new constitutions merits.
as alexander hamilton noted the debate would reveal whether the people could establish good government by reflection and choice rather than by accident and force the outcome was by no means certain but hamilton said that during the f our month constitutional convention there has been an astonishing revolution for the better in the minds of the people about the new frame of government.
choosing sides advocates for the constitution assumed the name federalists opponents became anti federalists.
the two sides formed the seeds for americas first two party political system.
in the prolonged debate the federalists led by james madison and alexander hamilton had several advantages.
first they had a concrete proposal the proposed constitution itself their opponents had nothing to offer instead but criticism.
second the federalist leaders were on average ten to twelve the fight for ratification 265 years younger and more energetic than the anti federalists many of them had been members of the constitutional convention and were familiar with the disputed issues in the document.
third the federalists were more unified and better organized.
the anti federalist leaders virginians patrick henry george mason richard henry lee and future president james monroe george clinton of new york samuel adams elbridge gerry and mercy otis warren of massachusetts luther martin and samuel chase of m aryland were a diverse group.
some wanted to reject the constitution and retain the confederation.
others wanted to convene another convention and start over.
still others wanted to revise the proposed constitution.
most anti federalists worried that the new national government would eventually grow corrupt and tyrannical.
mercy otis warren of massachusetts the most prominent woman then writing regular political commentary compared the constitution to shackles on our own necks a philadelphia writer denounced those who drafted the constitution as representing the aristocratic party intent upon creating a monarchical national government.
the anti federalists especially criticized the absence of a bill of rights in the proposed constitution to protect individuals and states from the growing power of the national government.
other than the bill of rights however the anti federalists had no comprehensive alternative to the constitution except the admittedly flawed articles of confederation.
the federalist among the supreme legacies of the long debate over the constitution is what came to be called the federalist papers a collection of eighty five essays published in new york newspapers between 1787 and 1788.
written by james madison alexander hamilton and john jay the essays defended the concept of a strong national government and outlined the major principles and assumptions the federalist papers alexander hamilton james madison and john jay published this series of essays in 1788 defending the concept of stronger central government and urging ratification of the constitution.
266 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation embodied in the constitution.
thomas jefferson called the federalist papers the best commentary on the principles of government which ever was written in the most famous of the federalist essays number 10 madison turned the conventional wisdom about republics on its head.
from ancient times it had been assumed that self governing republics survived only if they were small and homogeneous.
patrick henry in fact argued that a single national government could not reign over so extensive a country as this is without absolute despotism madison however argued that small republics usually fell victim to warring f actions well organized interest groups pursuing their self interest at the expense of the whole.
in the united states he explained the size and diversity of the expanding nation would make it impossible for any single faction to form a dangerous majority that could dominate the federal government or society at large.
the contending factions would in essence cancel each other out.
in addition he argued that it was the responsibility of the congress to regulate these various and interfering interests madison and the other framers created a legal and political system designed to protect minorities from a tyranny of the majority.
given a new federal government in which power was checked and balanced among the three federal branches a large republic could work better than a small one to prevent factional tyranny.
extend the geographic sphere madison wrote and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens the states decide several of the smaller s tates delaware new jersey and georgia were among the first to ratify the constitution.
massachusetts still sharply divided in the aftermath of shayss rebellion was the first state in which the outcome was close approving the constitution by 187 to 168 on february 6 1788.
on june 21 1788 new hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the constitution thereby reaching the minimum number of states needed for approval.
the constitution however could hardly succeed without the approval of virginia the largest wealthiest and most populous state or new york which had the third highest population and occupied a key position geographically.
both states included strong opposition groups who were eventually won over by the same pledge as had been made in massachusetts the addition of a bill of rights.
upon notification that new hampshire had become the ninth state to ratify the constitution the confederation congress chose new york city as the initial national capital and called for the new national government to assume power in 1789.

we have become a nation other celebrants shared the hope that the new frame of government would last.
our constitution is in actual operation benjamin franklin wrote to a friend in 1789.
everything appears to promise that it will last but in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes george washington was even more uncertain about the future predicting that the constitution would not last for more than twenty years the constitution has lasted much longer of course and in the process its adaptability has provided a model of resilient republican government.
the constitution was by no means perfect after all it has been amended twenty seven times it was a bundle of messy compromises and concessions that left many issues the most important of which was slavery undecided or ignored.
few of the constitutions supporters liked it in its entirety but most believed that it was the best frame of government obtainable and that it would continue to evolve and improve over time.
the constitution confirmed that the united states would be the first democratic republic in history.
the founders believed that they were creating a unique political system based on a new science of politics combining the best aspects of democracies and republics.

by the end of 1788 five more states would approve and the new constitution would soon go into effect.

at the constitutional convention the delegates combined aspects of both approaches so that they balanced and regulated each other and ensured that personal freedoms and the public welfare were both protected in the process.
the federalist era the constitution was ratified because it promised to create a more powerful national government better capable of managing a rapidly growing republic.
yet it was one thing to ratify a new constitution and quite another to make the new government run smoothly.
with each passing year the united states witnessed growing debate over how to interpret and apply the provisions of the new constitution.
during the 1790s a decade called the age of passion the federal government would confront rebellions states threatening to secede international tensions and foreign wars as well as something left unmentioned in the constitution the formation of fiercely competing political parties federalists and democratic republicans more commonly known as jeffersonian republicans or simply as republicans.
the two political parties came to represent very different visions for america.
the democratic republicans were mostly southerners like virginians thomas jefferson and james madison who wanted the country to remain a 270 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation new beginnings an engraving from the title page of the universal asylum and columbian magazine published in philadelphia in 1790.
america is represented as a woman laying down her shield to engage in education art commerce and agriculture.
rural nation of small farmers dedicated to republican values.
the democratic republicans distrusted the national government defended states rights preferred a strict interpretation of the constitution and placed their trust in the masses.
the will of the majority the natural law of every society jefferson insisted is the only sure guardian of the rights of men the federalists led by alexander hamilton and john adams were clustered in new york and new england and embraced urban culture industrial development and commercial growth.
federalists distrusted the passions of the common people and advocated a strong national government and a flexible interpretation of the constitution.
as hamilton stressed the people are turbulent and changing they seldom judge or determine right the first president on march 4 1789 the new congress convened in new york city.
a few weeks later the presiding officer of the senate certified that george washington with 69 electoral college votes was the nations first president.
john adams of massachusetts with 34 votes the second highest number became vice president at this time no candidates ran specifically for the vice presidency the presidential candidate who came in second regardless of party affiliation became vice president.
the federalist era 271 george washington was a reluctant first president.
he would have preferred to stay at mount vernon his virginia plantation but agreed to serve because he had been summoned by my country some complained that washingtons personality was too cold and aloof.
others thought he was unsophisticated since he had little formal education and had never visited europe.
the acidic john adams groused that washington was too illiterate unlearned and unread to be president.
washington had virtues that adams lacked however.
as a french diplomat observed president washington had the soul look and figure of a hero in action he was a soldier who had married a wealthy young widow and become a prosperous tobacco planter and land speculator.
he brought to the presidency both a detached dignity and a remarkable capacity for leadership that helped keep the young republic from disintegrating.
although capable of angry outbursts washington was honest honorable and remarkably self disciplined he had extraordinary stamina and patience integrity and resolve courage and resilience.
and he exercised sound judgment.
he usually asked people for their views weighed his options and made a decision.
most of all he was fearless.
few doubted that he was the best person to lead the new nation.
in his inaugural address washington appealed for unity pleading with the new congress to abandon local prejudices and party animosities to create the national outlook necessary for the fledgling republic to thrive.
within a few months he would see his hopes dashed.
personal rivalries sectional tensions and political infighting would dominate life in the 1790s.
washingtons cabinet americas first president took charge of a tiny national government that faced massive challenges.
george washington had a larger staff at his mount vernon plantation than he did as president of the united states.
unlike today when the executive branch has hundreds of staff members president washington had two.
and when those two secretaries went on vacation he was forced to write all presidential letters himself.
in addition when the presidents office needed new furniture he paid for it.
during the summer of 1789 congress created executive departments corresponding to those formed under the confederation.
to head the department of state president washington named thomas jefferson recently back from his diplomatic duties in france.
to lead the department of the treasury washington appointed alexander hamilton who was widely read in matters of government finance.
washington selected john jay as the first chief justice of the supreme court.
after serving as president of the continental congress in 1778 1779 jay became the american minister ambassador to spain.
while in europe he helped john adams and benjamin franklin negotiate the treaty of paris 272 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation in 1783.
after the revolution jay served as secretary of foreign affairs.
he joined hamilton and james madison as co author of the federalist papers and became one of the most effective champions of the constitution.
president washington routinely called his chief staff members together to discuss matters of policy.
this was the origin of the presidents cabinet an advisory body for which the constitution made no formal provision.
the office of vice president also took on what would become its typical character.
the vice presidency john adams wrote his wife abigail is the most insignificant office.
contrived the bill of rights to address concerns raised by opponents of the new federal government james madison now a congressman from virginia presented to congress in may 1789 a set of constitutional amendments intended to protect individual rights from excessive government power.
as thomas jefferson explained such a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth general or particular and what no just government should refuse after considerable debate congress approved twelve amendments in september 1789.
by the end of 1791 the necessary three fourths of the states had approved ten of the twelve proposed amendments now known as the bill of rights.
the bill of rights provided safeguards for individual rights of speech assembly and the press the right to own firearms the right to refuse to house soldiers protection against unreasonable searches and seizures the right to refuse to testify against oneself the right to a speedy public trial with an attorney present before an impartial jury and protection against cruel and unusual punishments.
the tenth amendment addressed the widespread demand that powers not delegated to the national government are reserved to the states respectively or to the people the amendments were written in broad language that seemed to exclude no one.
in fact however they technically applied only to p roperty owning white males.
native americans were entirely outside the constitutional system an alien people in their own land.
and like the constitution itself the bill of rights gave no protections to enslaved americans.
instead they were governed by state slave codes they had no access to the legal system they could not go to court make contracts or own property.
similar restrictions applied to women who could not vote in most state and national elections.
equally important the bill of rights had a b uilt in flaw it did not protect citizens from states violating their civil rights.
religious freedom the debates over the constitution and the bill of rights generated a religious revolution as well as a political revolution.
hamiltons vision of a c apitalist america 273 unlike the new england puritans whose colonial governments enforced their particular religious beliefs the christian men who drafted and amended the constitution made no direct mention of god.
they were determined to protect religious life from government interference and coercion.
in contrast to the monarchies of europe the united states would keep the institutions of church and government separate and allow people to choose their own religions freedom of conscience.
to that end the first amendment declared that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof this statement has since become one of the most important and controversial principles of american government.
the united states was virtually alone among nations in not designating a single established national religion funded by the government.
france spain and italy were officially catholic nations great britain was anglican.
in addition when the bill of rights was ratified all but two s tates new york and v irginia still supported an official religion or maintained a religious requirement for holding political office.
dissenters the members of other churches or nonbelievers were tolerated but were prohibited from voting or holding political office.
the first amendment was intended to create a framework within which people of all religious persuasions could flourish.
it prohibited the federal government from endorsing or supporting any individual denomination or interfering with the religious choices that people make.
as thomas jefferson later explained the first amendment erected a wall of separation between church and state hamiltons vision of a c apitalist america in 1776 the same year that americans were declaring their independence adam smith a scottish philosopher published a revolutionary book titled an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations.
it provided the first full description of a modern capitalist economy and its social benefits.
like the american revolution the wealth of nations was a declaration of independence from great britains mercantilist system.
under mercantilism national governments had exercised tight controls over economic life.
smith argued that instead of controlling economic activity governments should allow individuals and businesses to compete freely for profits in the marketplace.
doing so would unleash the energies of the capitalist spirit.
alexander hamilton greatly admired the wealth of nations and he eagerly took charge of managing the nations complicated financial affairs.
more than 274 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation any other american he grasped both the complex issues of government finance and envisioned what america would become the worlds most prosperous capitalist nation.
hamilton was a self made and self educated aristocrat.
born out of wedlock in the west indies in 1755 he was deserted by his scottish father and left an orphan at thirteen by the death of his mother.
with the help of friends and relatives he found his way at age fifteen to new jersey in late 1772 before moving a year later to new york city.
there he entered kings college now columbia university.
when the war with britain erupted hamilton joined the continental army as a captain at the ripe age of nineteen.
after he distinguished himself in the battles of trenton and princeton hamilton became one of general washingtons favorite aides.
after the war hamilton established a thriving legal practice in new york city a fellow lawyer said he surpassed all of us in his abilities married into a prominent family and served as a member of the confederation congress.
during the revolutionary war hamilton had witnessed the near fatal weaknesses of the confederation congress.
its lack of authority and money almost lost the war.
now as treasury secretary he believed that the federal government should encourage the hustling bustling creative spirit that distinguished americans from other peoples.
hamilton became the foremost advocate for an energetic government promoting capitalist development.
in contrast to jefferson the southern planter hamilton the urban capitalist believed that the united states was too dependent on agriculture for its economic well being.
he championed trade banking finance investment alexander hamilton the powerful and manufacturing as well as bustling secretary of the treasury from 1789 to commercial cities as the most essential 1795 elements of americas future.
hamiltons vision of a c apitalist america 275 hamiltons economic reforms the united states was born in debt.
to fight the war for independence it had borrowed heavily from the dutch and the french.
now after the war it had to find a way to pay off the debts.
yet there was no national bank no national currency and very few mills and factories.
in essence the american republic was bankrupt.
it fell to alexander hamilton to determine how the debts should be repaid and how the new national government could balance its budget.
governments have four basic ways to pay their bills impose taxes or fees on individuals and businesses levy tariffs taxes on imported goods borrow money by selling interest paying government bonds to investors and last but not least print money.
under hamiltons leadership the united states did all of these things and more.
to raise funds the new congress with hamiltons support enacted tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on the value of a wide variety of imported items.
tariffs were hotly debated for two reasons 1 they were the source of most of the federal governments annual revenue and 2 tariffs also protected american manufacturers by taxing their foreign competitors especially those in britain.
by discriminating against imported goods tariffs enabled american manufacturers to charge higher prices for their products sold in the united states.
this penalized consumers particularly those in the southern states that were most dependent upon imported goods.
in essence tariffs benefited the nations young manufacturing sector most of which was in new england at the expense of the agricultural sector since farm produce was rarely imported.
tariff policy soon became an explosive political issue.
dealing with debts the levying of tariffs marked but one major element in alexander hamiltons ambitious plan to put the new republic on a sound financial footing.
in a series of brilliant reports submitted to congress between january 1790 and december 1791 hamilton outlined his visionary program for the economic development of the united states.
the first of two reports on public credit dealt with how the new federal government should refinance the massive debt that the states and the confederation government had accumulated during the war for independence.
hamilton insisted that the debts be repaid.
after all he explained a capitalist economy depends upon its integrity and reliability debts being paid contracts being enforced and private property being protected.
by selling government bonds to pay the interest due on the huge war related debts hamilton argued the u s government would also give investors 276 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation the monied interest a direct stake in the success of the new national government.
a well managed federal debt he claimed would become a national blessing by giving investors at home and abroad confidence in the national economy and the integrity of the government.
hamilton also insisted that the federal government pay assume the state debts from the revolutionary war because they were in fact a national responsibility all americans had benefited from the war for independence.
the debt of the united states he stressed was the price of liberty sectional differences hamiltons complicated financial proposals created a storm of controversy in part because many people then and since did not understand their complexities.
james madison who had been hamiltons close ally in the fight for the new constitution broke with him over the federal government assuming the states debts.
madison then the most powerful member of the new congress was troubled that northern states owed far more debt than southern states.
four states virginia north carolina georgia and maryland had already paid off most of their war debts.
the other states had not been as conscientious.
madisons opposition to hamiltons debt assumption plan ignited a vigorous debate in congress.
in april 1790 the house of representatives voted down hamiltons assumption plan 32 29.
hamilton did not give up however.
after failing to get a couple of members of congress to switch their votes he then hatched an ingenious scheme.
in june 1790 hamilton invited jefferson and madison to join him for dinner in new york city.
by the end of the evening the three leaders had reached a famous compromise.
first they agreed that the national capital should move from new york city to philadelphia for the next ten years.
then the capital would move to a new city to be built in a federal district on the potomac river between maryland and virginia.
hamilton agreed to find the votes in congress to approve the move in exchange for madison pledging to find the two votes needed to pass the d ebt assumption plan.
the votes in congress went as planned and the federal government moved in late 1790 to philadelphia.
ten years later the nations capital was moved again this time to the new planned city of washington in the federal district of columbia.
more immediately hamiltons debt funding scheme proved a success.
the new bonds issued by the federal government in 1790 were quickly snatched up by eager investors thereby providing money to begin paying off the war debts while covering its operating expenses.
in addition hamilton obtained new loans from european governments.
hamiltons vision of a c apitalist america 277 to raise additional government revenue hamilton convinced congress to create an array of excise taxes taxes on particular products such as carriages sugar and salt.
a 25 percent excise tax on liquor in 1791 would prove to be the most controversial of all but the excise taxes generated m uch needed revenue.
by 1794 the nation had a higher financial credit rating than all the nations of europe.
by making the new nation financially solvent hamilton set in motion the greatest economic success story in world history.
a national bank part of the opposition to hamiltons debt financing scheme grew out of opposition to hamilton himself.
the brash young treasury secretary viewed himself as president washingtons prime minister.
that his department of treasury had forty staff members while thomas jeffersons state department had five employees demonstrated the priority that president washington gave to the nations financial situation.
hamilton was on a mission to develop an urban centered economy anchored in finance and manufacturing.
after securing congressional approval of his d ebt funding scheme he called for a national bank modeled after the powerful bank of england.
such a bank hamilton believed would enable much greater commerce among individuals and provide a safe place for the federal governments cash.
by their nature hamilton explained banks were essential to a new nation that was short on gold and silver.
banks would increase the nations money supply by issuing currency in amounts greater than their actual reserve gold and silver coins and government bonds in their vaults.
by issuing loans and thereby increasing the amount of money circulating through the economy banks served as the engines of prosperity industry is increased commodities are multiplied agriculture and manufactures flourish and herein consist the true wealth and prosperity of a genuine nation hamiltons idea of a powerful national bank generated intense criticism.
once again madison and jefferson led the opposition arguing that since the constitution said nothing about creating a national bank the government could not start one.
jefferson also believed that hamiltons proposed bank would not help most americans.
instead a small inner circle of self serving financiers and investors would over time exercise corrupt control over congress.
hamilton however had the better of the argument in congress.
representatives from the northern states voted 33 1 in favor of the national bank southern congressmen opposed the bank 19 6.
the lopsided vote illustrated the growing political division between the north and south in the young nation.
278 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation the bank of the united states proposed by alexander hamilton the national bank opened in philadelphia in 1791.
before signing the bank bill president washington sought the advice of his cabinet where he found an equal division of opinion.
the result was the first great debate on constitutional interpretation.
were the powers of congress only those explicitly stated in the constitution or were other powers implied.
the argument turned chiefly on article i section 8 which authorized congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers such language left lots of room for disagreement about what was necessary and proper and led to a savage confrontation between jefferson and hamilton.
the treasury secretary had come to view jefferson as a man of profound ambition violent passions who was guided by an unsound dangerous agrarian economic philosophy.
secretary of state jefferson who despised banks almost as much as he hated the monarchist hamilton pointed to the tenth amendment of the constitution which reserves to the states and the people powers not explicitly delegated to congress.
jefferson argued that a bank might be a convenient aid to congress in collecting taxes and regulating the currency but it was not necessary as article i section 8 specified.
in a lengthy 16 000 word report to the president hamilton countered that the power to charter corporations was an implied power of any government.
hamiltons vision of a c apitalist america 279 as he pointed out the three banks already in existence had been chartered by states none of whose constitutions specifically mentioned the authority to incorporate banks.
hamilton convinced washington to sign the bank bill.
in doing so the president had in jeffersons words opened up a boundless field of power which in coming years would lead to a further broadening of the presidents implied powers with the approval of the supreme court.
the new bank of the united states b u s.
based in philadelphia had three primary responsibilities 1 to hold the governments funds and pay its bills 2 to provide loans to the federal government and to other banks to promote economic development and 3 to manage the nations money supply by regulating the power of state chartered banks to issue paper currency called banknotes.
could issue national banknotes as needed to address the chronic shortage of gold and silver coins.
by 1800 the b u s.
had branches in four cities and four more were soon to be added.
the american financial system was on the verge of becoming the most effective in the world.
encouraging manufacturing hamiltons bold economic vision for the new republic was not yet complete.
in the last of his celebrated recommendations to congress the report on manufactures distributed in december 1791 he set in place the capstone of his design for a modern capitalist economy the active governmental promotion of new manufacturing and industrial enterprises mills mines and factories.
industrialization hamilton believed would bring diversification to an american economy dominated by agriculture and dangerously dependent on imported british goods improve productivity through greater use of machinery provide work for those not ordinarily employed outside the home such as women and children and encourage immigration of skilled industrial workers from other nations.
to foster industrial development hamilton recommended that the federal government increase tariffs on imports three quarters of which came from britain while providing financial incentives called bounties to key industries making especially needed products such as wool cotton cloth and window glass.
such government support he claimed would enable new industries to compete on equal terms with longstanding european enterprises.
finally hamilton asked congress to fund major transportation improvements including the development of roads canals and harbors for commercial traffic.
few of hamiltons pro industry ideas were enacted because of strong opposition from jefferson madison and other southerners.
they did not believe the federal government should support particular industries.
hamiltons proposals however provided an arsenal of arguments for the advocates 280 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation certificate of the new york mechanick society an illustration of the growing diversification of labor by abraham godwin ca.
of manufacturing and federally funded transportation projects called internal improvements in years to come.
hamiltons visionary achievements the economic impact of hamiltons leadership was monumental.
during the 1790s as the treasury department began to pay off the revolutionary war debts foreign capitalists and banks invested heavily in the booming american economy and european nations as well as china began a growing trade with the united states.
economic growth so elusive in the 1780s blossomed at the end of the century as the number of new businesses soared.
a bostonian reported that the nation had never had a brighter sunshine of prosperity.
our agricultural interest smiles our commerce is blessed our manufactures flourish all was not well however.
by championing the values and institutions of a bustling new capitalist system and the big cities and industries that went along with it hamilton upset many people especially in the agricultural south and along the western frontier.
thomas jefferson and james madison had grown increasingly concerned that hamiltons urban industrial economic program and his political d eal making were threatening american liberties.
hamilton hamiltons vision of a c apitalist america 281 recognized that his successes had led jefferson and madison to form a party hostile to me and one intent on making jefferson the next president.
the political competition between jefferson and hamilton boiled over into a nasty personal feud.
both men were visionaries but their visions of americas future could not have been more different.
hamilton saw britain as the model for the kind of e conomy and society he wanted america to develop jefferson preferred france.
they also had markedly different hopes for the nations economic development.
jefferson told president washington that hamiltons efforts to create a thomas jefferson a 1791 portrait by capitalist economy would undermine charles willson peale.
and demolish the republic and c reate the most corrupt government on earth hamilton he added was really a colossus giant to the a nti republican party in turn hamilton called the agrarian jefferson an intriguing incendiary who had circulated unkind whispers about the treasury secretary in an effort to stab me in the dark he also accused jefferson of being an agrarian romantic who failed to see that manufacturing industry and banking would drive the economic future of the united states.
jeffersons spirited opposition to hamiltons politics and policies fractured washingtons cabinet.
jefferson wrote that he and hamilton daily pitted in the cabinet like two cocks roosters president washington who detested political squabbling begged them to stop smearing each other with wounding suspicions and irritating charges and urged them to rise above their dissensions but it was too late they had become mortal enemies as well as the leaders of the first loosely organized political parties the federalists and the d emocratic republicans.
federalists and democratic republicans the federalists were centered in new york and new england.
generally they feared the excesses of democracy distrusted the common people and wanted a strong central government led by the wisest and best leaders who would be 282 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation c ommitted to economic growth social stability and national defense.
what most worried the federalists as alexander hamilton said was the poison of democracy the people he stressed are turbulent and changing they seldom judge or determine right wisely by contrast the democratic republicans led by thomas jefferson and james madison were most concerned about threats to individual freedoms and states rights posed by a strong national government.
in july 1789 chaotic violence erupted in france when masses of the working poor enraged over soaring prices for bread their primary food and in part inspired by the american revolution revolted against the absolute monarchy of louis xvi sending shock waves throughout europe.
the french revolution captured the imagination of many sympathetic americans especially thomas jefferson and the republicans as royal tyranny was displaced by a democratic republic that gave voting rights to all adult men regardless of how much property they owned.
americans formed democratic republican societies that hosted rallies on behalf of the french revolution and in support of local republican candidates.
during the 1790s james madison assumed leadership of hamiltons republican opponents in congress.
foreign and domestic crises during the fragile infancy of the new nation george washington was the only man able to rise above party differences and hold things together.
in 1792 he was unanimously reelected to a second term.
and he quickly found himself embroiled in the cascading consequences of the french revolution which had started in 1789.
the turmoil in france threatened to draw the united states into a european war.
in 1791 the monarchies of prussia and austria had invaded france to stop the revolutionary movement from infecting their absolutist societies.
the foreign invaders however only inspired the french revolutionaries to greater efforts to use force to spread their ideal of democracy.
by early 1793 the most radical of the french revolutionaries called jacobins had executed the king and queen as well as hundreds of aristocrats and priests.
the jacobins not only promoted democracy religious toleration and human rights but they went well beyond the ideals of the american revolution in supporting social racial and sexual equality.
then on february 1 1793 the french revolutionary government declared war on great britain thus beginning a conflict that would last twenty two years.
as the french republic plunged into warfare the revolution entered its worst phase the s o called reign of terror.
in 1793 1794 t housands of foreign and domestic crises 283 counterrevolutionary political prisoners and priests were executed along with many revolutionary leaders.
barbarism ruled the streets of paris and other major cities.
secretary of state thomas jefferson who loved french culture and democratic ideals wholeheartedly endorsed the revolution as the most sacred cause that ever man engaged in by contrast alexander hamilton and vice president john adams saw the french revolution as vicious and godless.
such conflicting attitudes over events in europe transformed the first decade of american politics into one of the most fractious periods in the nations h istory an age of passion the european war against revolutionary france tested the ability of the united states to remain neutral in world affairs.
both france and britain purchased goods from america and each sought to stop the other from trading with the united states even if it meant attacking u s merchant ships.
federalists and jeffersonian republicans alike agreed that a naval war with either european power would devastate the american economy.
as president washington began his second term in 1793 he faced an awkward decision.
by the 1778 treaty of alliance the united states was a perpetual ally of france.
americans however wanted no part of the european war.
they were determined to maintain their profitable trade with both sides although almost 90 percent of u s imports came from britain.
hamilton and jefferson agreed that entering the european conflict would be foolish.
where they differed was in how best to stay out of the war.
hamilton had a simple answer declare the military alliance formed with the french during the american revolution invalid because it had been made with a monarchy that no longer existed.
jefferson preferred to delay and to use the alliance with france as a bargaining point with the british.
in the end president washington took a wise middle course.
on april 22 1793 he issued a neutrality proclamation that declared the united states friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers and warned u s citizens that they might be prosecuted for aiding or abetting hostilities or taking part in other un neutral acts.
instead of settling matters in his cabinet however washingtons neutrality proclamation brought to a boil the ugly feud between jefferson and hamilton.
jefferson dashed off an angry letter to james madison urging his friend to take up your pen and cut hamilton to pieces in the newspapers.
citizen gent at the same time that president washington issued the neutrality proclamation he accepted secretary of state jeffersons argument that the united states should officially recognize the new french revolutionary 284 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation government becoming the first nation to do so and welcome its ambassador to the united states the cocky twenty nine year old e dmond charles gent.
early in 1793 citizen gent as he became known landed at charleston south carolina to a heros welcome.
he then openly violated u s neutrality by recruiting four american privateers privately owned warships to capture english and spanish merchant vessels.
after five weeks in south carolina gent sailed to philadelphia where his reckless efforts to draw america into the war on frances side embarrassed his friends in the republican party.
when gent threatened to go around president washington and appeal directly to the american people even thomas jefferson disavowed the french monkey in august 1793 washington at hamiltons urging demanded that the french government replace gent.
the growing excesses of the radicals in france were fast cooling u s support for the revolution.
jefferson however was so disgusted by his feud with alexander hamilton and by washingtons refusal to support the french that he resigned as secretary of state at the end of 1793 and returned to his virginia home eager to be rid of the hated occupation of politics vice president adams greeted jeffersons departure by saying good riddance president washington felt the same way.
he never forgave jefferson and madison for organizing d emocratic republican societies to oppose his federalist policies.
after accepting jeffersons resignation washington never spoke to him again.
jays treaty jays treaty a firestorm of controversy greeted jays treaty in america.
opponents of the treaty rioted and burned jay in effigy.
during 1794 tensions between the united states and great britain threatened to renew warfare between the old enemies.
the treaty of paris 1783 that ended the revolutionary war had left the western and southern boundaries of the united states in dispute.
in addition in late 1793 british warships violated international law by seizing u s merchant ships that carried french goods foreign and domestic crises 285 or were sailing for a french port.
by early 1794 several hundred american ships had been confiscated and their crews were given the terrible choice of joining the british navy a process called impressment or being imprisoned.
at the same time british troops in the ohio valley gave weapons to indians who in turn attacked american settlers.
on april 16 1794 president washington sent chief justice john jay to london to settle the major issues between the two nations.
jay agreed to the british demand that america not sell products to france for the construction of warships.
britain also gained trading advantages with the united states while refusing to stop intercepting american merchant ships and impressing their sailors.
finally jay conceded that the british need not compensate u s citizens for the enslaved african americans who had escaped to the safety of british forces during the revolutionary war.
in return jay won three important promises from the british they would evacuate their six forts in northwest america by 1796 reimburse americans for the seizures of ships and cargo in 1793 1794 and grant u s merchants the right to trade again with the island economies of british west indies.
when the terms of jays treaty were disclosed however many americans especially republicans were outraged.
in massachusetts people shouted damn john jay.
damn everyone who wont damn john jay the ferocious debate over the treaty deepened the division between federalists and republicans.
jefferson dismissed jays treaty as an infamous act intended to undermine the constitution another prominent republican offered this toast to president washington may he be damned if he signs jays treaty the uproar created the most serious crisis of washingtons presidency.
some called for his impeachment.
yet the president while admitting that the proposed agreement was imperfect decided that it was the only way to avoid a war with britain that the united states was bound to lose the u s army then had only 672 men and there was no navy.
in the end with washingtons strong support jays treaty barely won the necessary two thirds majority in the senate.
some 80 percent of the votes for the treaty came from new england or the middle atlantic states 74 percent of those voting against the treaty were southerners most of them jeffersonian republicans.
frontier tensions meanwhile new conflicts erupted in the ohio valley between american settlers and native americans.
in the fall of 1793 revolutionary war hero general mad anthony wayne led a military expedition into the northwest territorys indian country they marched north from cincinnati built fort greenville in western ohio and soon went on the offensive in what became known as the northwest indian war a conflict that 286 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation treaty of greenville 1795 lake michigan e lak fallen timbers e eri er chicago detroit ve r h ri as b a w m e au m er iv pennsylvania e ty lin rea ville t green er fort greenville riv re little at k kanawha river a a r wh na ky ntuc ke riv e g ohio vincennes r virginia i r ve kentucky rland riv mbe er cu north carolina area of map 100 miles 100 kilometers indian cessions why did general anthony wayne build fort greenville.

first proof 23p0 x 22p0 arose after the british transferred the ohio country to the united states.
the native americans living in the region insisted that the british had no right to give away their ancestral lands.
as pioneers moved into the northwest territory the various indian nations formed the western confederacy to resist american settlement.
in august 1794 the western confederacy of some 2 000 shawnee ottawa chippewa delaware and potawatomi warriors supported by the british and reinforced by canadian militiamen engaged general waynes troops and indian allies in the battle of fallen timbers along the m ichigan ohio border.
the americans decisively defeated the indians destroyed their crops and villages and built a line of forts in northern ohio and indiana one of which became the city of fort wayne indiana.
the indians finally agreed to the treaty of greenville signed in foreign and domestic crises 287 august 1795 by which the united states bought most of the territory that would form the state of ohio and the cities of detroit and chicago.
the whiskey rebellion soon after the battle of fallen timbers the washington administration displayed another show of strength in the backcountry this time against the so called whiskey rebellion.
alexander hamiltons 1791 federal tax on distilled spirits had ignited resentment and resistance throughout the western frontier.
liquor made from grain or fruit was the rural regions most valuable product it even was used as a form of currency.
when protesters efforts to repeal the tax failed many turned to violence and intimidation.
beginning in september 1791 angry groups of farmers militiamen and laborers attacked federal tax collectors and marshals.
in the summer of 1794 the discontent exploded into open rebellion in western pennsylvania home to a fourth of the nations whiskey stills.
the rebels threatened to assault nearby pittsburgh loot the homes of the rich and set the town ablaze.
after negotiations failed a u s supreme court justice declared on august 4 1794 that western pennsylvania was in a state of rebellion it whiskey rebellion george washington as commander in chief reviews the troops mobilized to quell the whiskey rebellion in pennsylvania in 1794.
288 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation was the first great domestic challenge to the federal government since the constitution was ratified and george washington responded decisively.
at the urging of alexander hamilton washington ordered the whiskey rebels to disperse by september 1 or he would send in the militia.
when the rebels failed to respond some 12 500 militiamen from several states began marching to western pennsylvania to suppress the rebellion.
president washington donned his military uniform and rode on horseback to greet the soldiers.
it was the first and last time that a sitting president would lead troops in the field.

two dozen were charged with high treason two were sentenced to hang only to be pardoned by president washington.
the new federal government had made its point and showed its strength.
the show of force led the rebels and their sympathizers to change their tactics.
rather than openly defying federal laws they voted for republicans who won heavily in the next pennsylvania elections.
pinckneys treaty while the turbulent events were unfolding in pennsylvania the spanish began negotiations over control of the mississippi river as well as the disputed northern boundary of their florida colony which they had acquired from the british at the end of the revolutionary war.
u s negotiator thomas pinckney pulled off a diplomatic triumph in 1795 when he convinced the spanish to accept a southern american boundary at the 31st parallel in west florida along the northern coast of the gulf of mexico the current boundary between florida and georgia.
the spanish also agreed to allow americans to ship goods grains and livestock down the mississippi river to spanish controlled new orleans.
senate ratification of pinckneys treaty also called the treaty of san lorenzo came quickly for westerners were eager to transport their crops and livestock to new orleans.
western settlement the treaties signed by john jay and thomas pinckney spurred a new wave of settlers into the western territories.
their lust for land aroused a raging debate in congress over what the federal government should do with the vast areas it had acquired or taken from the british the spanish and from native americans.
land policy federalists and republicans differed sharply on federal land policy.
federalists wanted the government to charge high prices for western lands to keep the east from losing both political influence and a labor force important to the growth of manufactures.
they also preferred that government owned lands be sold in large parcels to speculators rather than in small plots to settlers.
thomas jefferson and james madison were reluctantly prepared to go along with such land policies for the sake of reducing the national debt but jefferson preferred that g overnment owned land be sold to farmers rather than speculators.
290 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation the prevalence of agriculture this american folk painting by edward hicks shows the residence of david twining a pennsylvania farmer as it appeared in 1787.
for the time being however the federalists prevailed.
with the land act of 1796 congress doubled the price of federal land public domain to 2 per acre.
half the townships would be sold in 640 acre sections making the minimum cost 1 280 a price well beyond the means of ordinary settlers.
by 1800 federal land offices had sold fewer than 50 000 acres.
criticism of the land policies led to the land act of 1800 which reduced the minimum parcel to 320 acres and spread payments over four years.
thus with a down payment of 160 one could buy a farm.
the wilderness road the lure of western lands led thousands of settlers to follow pathfinder daniel boone into the territory known as k entucky or kaintuck from the cherokee name k en ta ke great meadow.
in the western settlement 291 late eighteenth century the indian held lands in kentucky were a farmers dream and a hunters paradise.
the vast area boasted fertile soil bluegrass meadows abundant forests and countless buffalo deer and wild turkeys.
born on a small farm in 1734 in central pennsylvania boone was a deadeye marksman by the age of twelve who became an experienced farmer and an accomplished woodsman.
after hearing numerous reports about the fertile lands over the appalachian mountains boone set out in 1769 to find a trail into kentucky.
he discovered what daniel boone escorting settlers was called the warriors path a narrow through the cumberland gap foot trail that buffalo deer and native painting by george caleb bingham.
americans had worn along the steep ridges over the centuries.
in 1773 boone led a group of white settlers into kentucky.
two years later he and thirty woodsmen used axes to widen the 208 mile long warriors path into what became known as the wilderness road a rough passageway that more than 300 000 settlers would use over the next t wenty five years.
at a point where a branch of the wilderness road intersected with the kentucky river near what is now lexington boone built the settlement of boonesborough.
in 1780 kentucky was divided into three counties and integrated into the state of virginia.
in 1792 it became a separate state.
in the process of settling kentucky boone became one of americas first folk heroes a larger than life figure known as the columbus of the woods as he admitted however many heroic actions and chivalrous adventures are related of me which exist only in the regions of fancy.
with me the world has taken great liberties and yet i have been but a common man a steady stream of settlers mostly scots irish migrants from pennsylvania virginia and north carolina poured into kentucky during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.
the pioneers came on foot or horseback often leading a mule or a cow that carried their tools and other possessions.
near a creek or spring they would buy a parcel or stake out a claim and mark its boundaries by chopping notches into witness trees they would then build a l ean to for temporary shelter and clear the land for planting.
the larger t rees those that could not be felled with an a x were girdled a cut would be made around the 292 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation trunk and the tree would be left to die.
because clearing trees often took years a farmer had to hoe and plant a field filled with stumps.
the pioneers grew melons beans turnips and other vegetables but corn was the preferred crop because it kept well and had so many uses.
ears were roasted and eaten on the cob and kernels were ground into meal for making mush hominy grits and hoecakes or johnnycakes dry flour cakes suitable for travelers that were originally called journeycakes.
pigs provided pork and cows supplied milk butter and cheese.
many frontier families also built crude stills to manufacture a potent whiskey they called corn likker.
transfer of power in 1796 president washington decided that two terms in office were enough.
weary of the increasingly bitter criticism directed at him he was eager to retire to his plantation at mount vernon.
he would leave behind a formidable record of achievement the organization of a new national government a prosperous economy the recovery of territory from britain and spain a stable northwestern frontier and the admission of three new states vermont 1791 kentucky 1792 and tennessee 1796.
washingtons farewell on september 17 1796 washington delivered a farewell address in which he criticized the rising spirit of political partisanship and the emergence of political parties.
they endangered the republic he felt because they pursued the narrow interests of minorities rather than the good of the nation.
in foreign relations washington advised the united states should stay away from europes quarrels by avoiding permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world his warning against permanent foreign entanglements would serve as a fundamental principle in u s foreign policy until the early twentieth century.
the election of 1796 with washington out of the race the united states had its first contested election for president.
the federalist caucus a group of leading congressmen chose vice president john adams as their presidential candidate.
thomas pinckney of south carolina fresh from his diplomatic triumph in spain also ran as a federalist presidential candidate.
as expected the republicans chose thomas jefferson.
aaron burr a young new york attorney and senator who was distrusted by many and disliked by most also ran as a republican.
the campaign of 1796 was mean and nasty.
the federalists were attacked for unpopular taxes excessive spending and abuses of power.
republicans called the pudgy john adams his rotundity and labeled him a monarchist the adams administration 293 mount vernon george washington and the marquis de lafayette at mount vernon in 1784.
washington enlarged the estate which overlooks the potomac river to nearly 8 000 acres dividing it among five farms.
because he loved the symbols of power and despised the people adams wanted people to refer to the president as his highness federalists countered that jefferson was a french loving atheist eager for another war with great britain and charged that the philosophical virginian was not decisive enough to be president.
adams won the election with 71 electoral votes but in an odd twist jefferson who received 68 electoral votes became vice president.
the federalists won control of both houses of congress.
the adams administration vain and prickly opinionated and stubborn john adams had long lusted for the presidency but he was a much better political theorist than he was a political leader.
an independent thinker with a proud combative spirit and volcanic temper he fought as often with his fellow federalists especially alexander hamilton as he did with his republican opponents.
benjamin franklin said adams was always an honest man often a wise one but sometimes.
absolutely out of his senses adams had crafted a distinguished career as a massachusetts lawyer and as a leader in the revolutionary movement.
widely recognized as the hardest working member of the continental congress he had also authored the massa 294 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation john adams political philosopher and politician adams was the first president to take up residence in the new white house in the new national capital of washington d c in 1801 chusetts state constitution.
during the revolution adams had served as an exceptional diplomat in france holland and great britain and he had been george washingtons vice president.
in contrast to the tall lanky jefferson the short stocky adams feared democracy and despised equality both of which he believed must be kept within bounds by wise leaders.
he once referred to ordinary americans as making up the common herd of mankind adams also felt that he was never properly appreciated and he may have been right.
yet on the essential issue of his presidency war and peace he kept his head when others about him were losing theirs probably at the cost of his reelection.
the war with france as americas second president john adams inherited a quasi war with france a b y product of the angry french reaction to jays treaty between the united states and great britain.
the navies of both nations were capturing u s ships headed for the others ports.
by the time of adamss inauguration in 1797 the french had plundered some 300 american vessels and broken diplomatic relations with the united states.
adams sought to ease tensions by sending three prominent americans to paris to negotiate a settlement.
when the u s diplomats arrived however they were accosted by three french officials labeled x y and z by adams in his report to congress who announced that negotiations could begin only if the united states paid a bribe of 250 000 and loaned france 12 million.
such bribes were common i n the eighteenth century but the answer from the american side was no no not a sixpence when the so called xyz affair became public american hostility toward france soared.
many republicans with the exception of vice president thomas jefferson joined with federalists in calling for war.
federalists in congress voted to triple the size of the army and construct warships.
president adams asked george washington to put on his military uniform and become commander of the army again.
the adams administration 295 conflict with france a cartoon indicating the anti french sentiment generated by the xyz affair.
the three american negotiators at left reject the paris monsters demand for bribery money before discussions could begin.
he reluctantly agreed on the condition that hamilton be appointed a major general.
by the end of 1798 french and american ships were engaged in an undeclared naval war in the caribbean sea.
the war at home the naval conflict with france sparked an intense debate between federalists eager for a formal declaration of war and republicans sympathetic to france.
amid the superheated emotions vice president jefferson observed that a wall of separation had come to divide the nations political leaders.
he told a french official that president adams was a vain irritable stubborn man.
for his part adams had tried to take the high ground.
soon after his election he had invited jefferson to join him in creating a bipartisan administration.
jefferson refused saying that he would not be a part of the cabinet but instead would only preside over the senate as vice president as the constitution specified.
within a year he and adams were at each others throats.
adams regretted losing jefferson as a friend but felt obliged to look upon him as a man whose mind is warped by prejudice jefferson he claimed had 296 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation become a child and the dupe of the republican faction in congress led by james madison.
jefferson and other republicans were convinced that the real purpose of the french crisis was to provide federalists with an excuse to quiet their american critics.
the alien and sedition acts 1798 seemed to confirm the republicans suspicions.
these partisan acts passed amid a wave of patriotic war fervor gave the president extraordinary powers to violate civil liberties in an effort to stamp out criticism of the administration.
they limited freedom of speech and of the press as well as the liberty of aliens immigrants who had not yet gained citizenship.
adamss support of the alien and sedition acts war measures would prove to be the greatest mistake of his presidency.
timothy pickering his secretary of state claimed that adams agreed to the acts without consulting any member of the government and for a reason truly remarkable because he knew we should all be opposed to the measure three of the four alien and sedition acts reflected hostility to french and irish immigrants many of whom had become militant republicans in america.
the naturalization act lengthened from five to fourteen years the residency requirement for u s citizenship.
the alien act empowered the president to deport dangerous aliens and the alien enemies act authorized the president in wartime to expel or imprison enemy aliens at will.
finally the sedition act outlawed writing publishing or speaking anything of a false scandalous and malicious nature against the government or any of its officers.
of the ten people convicted under the sedition act all were republicans including newspaper editors.
to offset the reign of witches unleashed by the alien and sedition acts jefferson and madison drafted the kentucky and virginia resolutions passed by the legislatures of those two states in late 1798.
the resolutions denounced the alien and sedition acts as alarming infractions of constitutional rights and put forth the shocking idea that state legislatures should nullify reject and ignore acts of congress that violated the constitutional guarantee of free speech.
in attacking the alien and sedition acts jefferson was suggesting something more dangerous disunion.
george washington told patrick henry in virginia that jefferson was threatening to dissolve the union while adams and jefferson were waging their war of words the president was seeking peace with france.
in 1799 he dispatched another team of diplomats to negotiate with a new french government under first consul napolon bonaparte the general on horseback whose army had overthrown the republic.
in a treaty called the convention of 1800 the americans won the best terms they could from the french.
they dropped their demands to the adams administration 297 be repaid for the ships taken by the french and the french agreed to end the military alliance with the united states dating back to the revolutionary war.
the senate quickly ratified the agreement which became effective on december 21 1801 republican victory in 1800 the furor over the alien and sedition acts influenced the pivotal presidential election of 1800.
the federalists nominated adams even though many of them continued to snipe at him and his policies especially his refusal to declare war against france.
alexander hamilton publicly questioned adamss fitness to be president citing his disgusting egotism thomas jefferson and aaron burr the republican candidates once again represented the alliance of the two most powerful states virginia and new york.
the federalists claimed that jeffersons election would bring civil war and anarchy to america.
jeffersons supporters portrayed him as a passionate idealist and optimist who was a friend of farmers and a courageous champion of states rights a limited federal government and personal liberty.
in the important election of 1800 jefferson and burr the two republicans emerged with 73 electoral votes each.
federalist john adams received only 65.
when burr shockingly refused to withdraw his candidacy in favor of jefferson the tie vote in the electoral college sent the election into the house of representatives a constitutional defect corrected in 1804 by the twelfth amendment.
hamilton grudgingly preferred jefferson over burr who would later kill hamilton in a duel.
jefferson hamilton said is by far not so dangerous a man he has pretensions to character as to burr hamilton added there is nothing in his favor the tie vote in the electoral college between thomas jefferson and aaron burr created an explosive political crisis.
federalist fisher ames predicted that burr might impart vigor to the country while jefferson was absurd enough to believe his own nonsense the rumor filled three months between the house vote for president in december 1800 and thomas jeffersons inauguration in march 1801 were so tense that people talked openly of civil war.
the crisis is momentous warned the washington federalist.
there were even wild rumors of plots to assassinate jefferson.
in the end it took t hirty six ballots for the house of representatives to choose jefferson over burr as the new president.
before the federalists turned over power on march 4 1801 president adams and congress passed the judiciary act of 1801.
it was intended to ensure federalist control of the judicial system by creating sixteen federal circuit courts with a new judge for each.
it also reduced the number of supreme 298 chapter 6 strengthening the new nation court justices from six to five in an effort to deprive the next president of appointing a new member.
before he left office adams appointed federalists to all the new positions.
the federalists quipped jefferson had retired into the judiciary as a stronghold they never again would exercise significant political power.
a new era the election of 1800 did not resolve the fundamental political tensions that had emerged between ardent nationalists like adams and hamilton and those like jefferson and madison who clung to ideals of states rights and an agriculture based economy.
in fact the 1800 election further divided the young republic into warring political factions and marked a major turning point in the nations history.
it was the first time that one political party had relinquished presidential power to the opposition party and it was the only election that pitted a sitting president adams against his own vice president jefferson.

first proof 31p0 x 18p6 the adams administration 299 participation.
before and immediately after independence people took a keen interest in public affairs but socially prominent families the rich the able and the wellborn still dominated political life.
however the raging political battles of the late 1790s culminating in 1800 with jeffersons election established the right of common men to play a more active role in governing the young republic.
with the gradual elimination of the requirement that citizens must own property to vote the electorate expanded enormously in the early nineteenth century.
jefferson called his election the revolution of 1800 for it marked the triumph of the republican party and the slaveholding south at the expense of the new england federalists.
three virginia republican slaveholders jefferson james madison and james m onroe would hold the presidency for the next t wenty four years.
a bitter john adams was so upset by his defeat as well as by the death of his alcoholic son charles that he refused to participate in jeffersons inauguration in the new federal capital in washington d c.
instead unnoticed and unappreciated adams boarded a stagecoach at 4 a m for the 500 mile trip to his home in massachusetts.
he and jefferson would not communicate for the next twelve years.
as adams returned to work on his massachusetts farm with his wife abigail he told his eldest son john quincy who would become the nations sixth president that anyone governing the united states has a hard laborious and unhappy life the victorious jefferson would soon feel the same way.
chapter review summary confederation government despite its many weaknesses the national government created by the articles of confederation managed to construct impor tant alliances during the revolutionary war help win the war of independence and negotiate the treaty of paris 1783.
it created executive departments and established through the northwest ordinance the process by which new western territories would be organized and governments formed before they applied for statehood.
yet the articles of confederation did not allow the national government to raise taxes to fund its debts.
shayss rebellion made many americans fear that such uprisings would eventually destroy the new republic unless the united states formed a stronger national government.
constitutional convention delegates gathered at the convention in philadelphia in 1787 to revise the existing government but almost immediately they decided to scrap the articles of confederation and start over.
an entirely new document emerged which created a system called federalism in which a strong national government with clear separation of powers among executive legislative and judicial branches functioned alongside state governments with clearly designated responsibilities.
arguments about how best to ensure that the rights of individual states were protected and also that the people were represented in the new congress were resolved by establishing a senate with equal representation for each state and a house of representatives the number of whose delegates was determined by population counts.
ratification of the constitution ratification of the constitution was hotly contested.
anti federalists such as virginias patrick henry opposed the new structure of government because the absence of a bill of rights would lead to a loss of individual and states rights.
to sway new york state toward ratification alexander hamilton james madison and john jay wrote the federalist papers.
ratification became possible only when federalists promised to add a bill of rights.
federalists versus republicans alexander hamilton and the federalists wanted to create a diverse economy in which agriculture was balanced by trade finance and manufacturing.
hamilton crafted a federal budget that funded the national debt through tariff and tax revenues and he created a national bank the first bank of the united states.
thomas jefferson and others known as jeffersonian republicans worried that hamiltons plans violated the constitution and made the federal government too powerful.
they envisioned a nation dominated by farmers and planters where the rights of states would be protected against federal power.
trouble abroad during the french revolution george washingtons policy of neutrality violated the terms of the 1778 treaty with france.
at the same time americans sharply criticized jays treaty with the british for giving too much away.
french warships began seizing british and american ships and an undeclared war was under way.
federalists supported washingtons approach while republicans were more supportive of france.
during the presidency of john adams the united states fought an undeclared naval war with the french which led to the controversial alien and sedition acts of 1798.

nine of ten americans lived or worked on land with most of them growing enough food and raising enough livestock to feed their families but rarely producing enough to sell outside the community much less overseas.
that changed during the nineteenth century.
with each passing year more and more farmers began to produce surplus crops and livestock to sell in regional and world markets.
such commercial agriculture was especially evident in the south where skyrocketing european demand for cotton caused prices to soar.
the growing market economy produced the boom and bust cycles that have always been a regular element of capitalist economies but overall the years from 1790 to 1830 were prosperous with enterprising americans experiencing unprecedented opportunities for land ownership economic gain geographic mobility and political participation.
the desire displayed by americans for profits was according to congressman henry clay a passion as unconquerable as any with which nature has endowed us.
you may attempt to regulate it but you cannot destroy it everywhere in the early republic it seemed people were on the move and on the make leading one newspaper to claim that what made the united states different from other nations was the almost universal ambition to get forward americans excelled at westward expansion economic development rapid population growth and intense political activity.

148 chapter 4 from colonies to states competing neighbors the french established colonies in north america at the same time as the english.
the bitter rivalry between great britain and france fed frances desire to challenge the english presence in the americas by establishing catholic settlements in the caribbean canada and the region west of the appalachian mountains.
yet the french never invested the people or resources in north america that the english did.
during the 1660s the population of new france was less than that of the tiny english colony of rhode island.
by the m id eighteenth century the residents of new france numbered less than 5 percent of british americans.
new france the actual settlement of new france began in 1605 when soldier explorer samuel de champlain the father of new france founded p ort royal in acadia along the eastern canadian coast.
three years later champlain established quebec to the west along the st lawrence river quebec is an algonquian word meaning where the river narrows.
champlain was the first european to explore and map the great lakes.
champlain in new france samuel de champlain firing at a group of iroquois killing two chieftains 1609.
competing neighbors 149 until his death in 1635 champlain governed new france on behalf of trading companies exploiting the fur trade with the indians.
the trading companies sponsored champlains voyages in hopes of creating a prosperous commercial colony.
in 1627 however the french government ordered that only catholics could live in new france.
this restriction stunted its growth as did the harsh winter climate.
as a consequence the number of french who colonized canada was much smaller than the number of british dutch and spanish colonists in other north american colonies.
champlain knew that the outnumbered french could survive only by befriending the native peoples.
to that end he dispatched young trappers and traders to live with the indigenous peoples learn their languages and customs marry native women and serve as ambassadors of new france.
many of these hardy woodsmen were coureurs des bois runners of the woods who pushed into the forested regions around the great lakes and developed a thriving fur trade.
in 1663 french king louis xiv changed struggling new france into a royal colony led by a governor general who modeled his rule after that of the absolute monarchy.
new france was fully subject to the french king.
the french colonists had no political rights or elected legislature and public meetings could not be held without official permission.
to solidify new france the king dispatched soldiers and settlers during the 1660s including shiploads of young women known as the kings daughters to be wives for the mostly male colonists.
louis xiv also awarded large grants of land called seigneuries to lure aristocratic settlers.
the poorest farmers usually rented land from the seigneur.
yet none of these efforts transformed new france from being essentially a fur trading outpost.
only about 40 000 french immigrants came to the western hemisphere during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries even though the population of france was three times that of spain.
by 1750 when the british colonists in north america numbered about 1 5 million the total french population was 70 000.
from their canadian outposts along the great lakes french explorers in the early 1670s moved southward down the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico.
louis jolliet a fur trader born in quebec teamed with father jacques marquette a jesuit priest fluent in indian languages to explore the wisconsin river south to the mississippi river.
traveling in canoes they paddled south to within 400 miles of the gulf of mexico where they turned back for fear of encountering spanish soldiers.
other french explorers followed.
in 1682 ren robert cavelier sieur de la salle organized an expedition that started in montreal crossed the great lakes and made it all the way down the mississippi river to the gulf 150 chapter 4 from colonies to states the french in north america hudson bay newfoundland james bay n e w montreal france superior green bay e ke la french a c a d i a english port royal boston albany plymouth new york philadelphia r mo i o atlantic ocean jamestown ap missi ppi river ssi ansas rive r pa la french english ch ia n oh louisbourg u n ta no i l li vincennes a i a n st louis kaskaskia io tar rie r cahokia on ins lake michigan n uro is ke la eh so mi s i s l o uuri r a rk l ak wisconsin r fort michilimackinac fox river quebec t connecticu n r dso rive hu er riv l st.

la salle who learned seven different indian languages hoped to create a string of fur trading posts along the entire length of the river.
near what is today venice mississippi he buried an engraved plate and erected a cross claiming for france the vast ohio and mississippi valleys all the way to the rocky mountains.
he named the entire region louisiana after king louis xiv.
settlement of the louisiana territory finally began in 1699 when the french established a colony near biloxi mississippi.
the main settlement then moved to mobile bay and in 1710 to the present site of mobile alabama.
for nearly fifty years the driving force in louisiana was j ean baptiste le moyne sieur de bienville.
sometimes called the father of louisiana he served periodically as governor and in 1718 he founded new orleans which shortly thereafter became the capi jesuits in new france founded in 1539 tal of the sprawling louisiana colony the jesuits sought to convert indians to encompassing much of the interior of catholicism in part to make them more reliable trading partners and military the entire north american continent.
new france had one important advantage over its british rival access to the great inland rivers that led to the heartland of the continent and the pelts of fur bearing animals beaver otter and mink.
in the illinois region french settlers began farming the fertile soil while jesuits established missions to convert the indians at places such as terre haute high land in what is now indiana and des moines of the monks in p resent day i owa the name probably shortened from rivire des moines or river of the monks.
the british colonial system the diverse british colonies in north america were quite different from those of new france.
the colonial governments typically were headed by a royal 152 chapter 4 from colonies to states governor or proprietor who could appoint and remove officials command the militia and grant pardons to people convicted of crimes.
the british colonies unlike the spanish french or dutch colonies had elected legislatures the lower houses were chosen by popular vote.
like parliament the assemblies controlled the budget and could pass laws and regulations.
most colonial assemblies exercised influence over the royal governors by paying their salaries.
unlike in new france self government in british america was expected and cherished.
mercantilism the english civil war during the 1640s sharply reduced the flow of money and people to america and created great confusion regarding colonial policies.
it also forced english americans to take sides in the conflict between royalists and puritans.
the 1651 victory of oliver cromwells puritan army over the monarchy had direct effects in the colonies.
as englands new ruler cromwell embraced mercantilism a political and economic policy adopted by most european monarchs during the seventeenth century.
in a mercantile system the government controlled all economic activities in an effort to strengthen national power.
key industries were regulated taxed or subsidized supported by payments from the government.
people with specialized skills or knowledge of new industrial technologies such as textile machinery were not allowed to leave the country.
mercantilism also supported the creation of global empires.
colonies it was assumed enriched the mother country in several ways 1 by providing silver and gold as well as the raw materials furs fish grains timber sugar tobacco indigo tar etc.
needed to supply food build ships and produce goods 2 by creating a captive market of colonial consumers who would be forced to buy goods created in the home country 3 by relieving social tensions and political unrest in the home country because colonies could absorb the growing numbers of poor unemployed and imprisoned and 4 by not producing goods that would compete with those produced in the home country.
navigation acts such mercantilist assumptions prompted oliver cromwell to adopt the first in a series of navigation acts intended to increase control over its colonial economies.
the navigation act of 1651 required that all goods going to and from the colonies be carried only in british owned ships built in britain.
the law was intended to hurt the dutch who had developed a flourishing business shipping goods between america and europe.
dutch shippers charged much less to transport goods than did the english and they actively encouraged smuggling in the american colonies as a means of defying competing neighbors 153 the navigation acts.
by 1652 england and the netherlands were at war the first of three naval conflicts that erupted between 1652 and 1674 involving the two protestant rivals.
after the monarchy was restored to power in 1660 the new royalist parliament passed the navigation act of 1660 which specified that certain colonial products such as tobacco were to be shipped only to england or other colonies.
the navigation act of 1663 called the staples act required that all shipments of goods from europe to america must first stop in britain to be offloaded and taxed before being sent on to the colonies.
by 1700 the english had surpassed the dutch as the worlds leading maritime power and most products sent to and from america via europe and africa were carried in british ships.
what the english government did not predict or fully understand was that the mercantile system would arouse resentment in the colonies.
colonial resentment colonial merchants and shippers loudly complained about the navigation acts but the english government refused to lift its restrictions.
new england which shipped 90 percent of all american exports was particularly hard hit.
in 1678 a defiant massachusetts legislature declared that the navigation acts had no legal standing.
in 1684 boston from the southeast this view of e ighteenth century boston shows the importance of shipping and its regulation in the colonies.
154 chapter 4 from colonies to states king charles ii tried to teach the rebellious colonists a lesson by revoking the royal charter for massachusetts.
the following year king charles ii died and was succeeded by his brother king james ii the first catholic monarch in more than 100 years.
to demonstrate his power over americans the new king reorganized the new england colonies into a single royal supercolony called the dominion of new england.
in 1686 the newly appointed royal governor the authoritarian sir edmund andros arrived in boston to take control of the dominion.
andros stripped new englanders of their civil rights imposed new taxes as well as the anglican religion ignored town governments strictly enforced the navigation acts and punished smugglers who tried to avoid regulation altogether.
the glorious revolution in 1688 the dominion of new england added the former dutch provinces of new york east jersey and west jersey to its control just a few months before the glorious revolution erupted in england in december.
the revolution was called glorious because it took place with little bloodshed.
james ii was forced to flee to france and was replaced by the kings protestant daughter mary and her protestant husband william iii the ruling dutch prince.
william iii and mary ii would rule as constitutional monarchs their powers limited by the parliament.
the new king and queen soon issued a religious toleration act and a bill of rights to ensure that there never again would be an absolute monarchy in england.
in 1689 americans in boston staged their own revolution upon learning of the transfer of power in london.
a group of merchants ministers and militiamen citizen soldiers arrested governor andros and his aides and removed massachusetts bay colony from the new dominion of new england.
within a few weeks the other colonies that had been absorbed into the dominion also restored their independence.
william and mary allowed all the colonies to regain their former status except massachusetts bay and plymouth which after some delay were united under a new charter in 1691 as the royal colony of massachusetts bay.
william and mary however were determined to crack down on american smuggling and rebelliousness.
they appointed new royal governors in massachusetts new york and maryland.
in massachusetts the governor was given authority to veto acts of the colonial assembly and he removed the requirement that only church members could vote in elections.
john locke on revolution the glorious revolution in england had significant long term effects on american history in that the an emerging colonial system 155 removal of king james ii revealed that a hated monarch could be deposed according to constitutional principles.
the long standing geographical designation great britain for the united kingdoms of england scotland and wales would soon be revived as the nations official name.
a powerful justification for revolution appeared in 1690 when the english philosopher john locke published his two treatises on government which had an enormous impact on political thought in the colonies.
locke rejected the divine right of monarchs to govern with absolute power.
he also insisted that people are endowed with natural rights to life liberty and property.
locke noted that it was the need to protect those natural rights that led people to establish governments in the first place.
when rulers failed to protect the property and lives of their subjects locke argued the people had the r ight in extreme cases to overthrow the monarch and change the government.
an emerging colonial system in early 1689 new yorkers sent a message to king william thanking him for delivering england from tyranny popery and slavery many colonists were disappointed however when the king cracked down on american smugglers.
the act to prevent frauds and abuses of 1696 required colonial royal governors to enforce the navigation acts allowed customs officials in america to use writs of assistance general search warrants that did not have to specify the place to be searched and ordered that accused smugglers be tried in royal admiralty courts because juries in colonial courts rarely convicted their peers.
admiralty cases were decided by judges appointed by the royal governors.
soon however british efforts to enforce the navigation acts waned.
king george i r 1714 1727 and george ii r 1727 1760 german princes who were descendants of james i showed much less interest in enforcing colonial trade laws.
robert walpole the l ong serving prime minister 1721 1742 and lord of the treasury decided that the american colonies should be left alone to export needed raw materials timber tobacco rice indigo and to buy various manufactured goods from the mother country.
under walpoles leadership britain followed a policy of a wise and salutary neglect of the navigation acts and gave the colonies greater freedom to pursue their economic interests.
what walpole did not realize was that such salutary neglect would create among many colonists an independent attitude that would eventually blossom into revolution.
156 chapter 4 from colonies to states the habit of self government government within the american colonies evolved without plan during the eighteenth century as the colonial assemblies acquired powers particularly with respect to government appointments that parliament had yet to exercise itself.
the english colonies in america unlike new france and new spain benefited from elected legislative assemblies.
whether called the house of burgesses virginia delegates maryland representatives massachusetts or simply the assembly the lower houses were chosen by popular vote.
only male property owners could vote based upon the notion that only men who held a tangible stake in society could vote responsibly.
because property holding was much more widespread in america than in europe a greater proportion of the men could vote and hold office in the colonies.
members of the colonial assemblies tended to be wealthy prominent figures but there were exceptions.
one unsympathetic colonist observed in 1744 that the new jersey assembly was chiefly composed of mechanicks and ignorant wretches obstinate to the last degree the most profound political trend during the early eighteenth century was the growing power exercised by the colonial assemblies.
like parliament the assemblies controlled the budget through their vote on taxes and expenditures and they held the power to initiate legislation.
most of the colonial assemblies also exerted leverage on the royal governors by controlling their salaries.
throughout the eighteenth century the assemblies expanded their power and influence sometimes in conflict with the governors sometimes in harmony with them.
self government in america became first a habit then a right by the mid eighteenth century the american colonies had become largely s elf governing.
warfare in the colonies the glorious revolution of 1688 transformed relations among the great powers of europe.
protestants william and mary for example were passionate foes of catholic frances louis xiv.
king william organized an alliance of european nations against the french in a transatlantic war known in the american colonies as king williams war 1689 1697.
it was the first of four major wars fought in europe and the colonies over the next s eventy four years.
in each case britain and its european allies fought against catholic france or spain and their allies.
by the end of the eighteenth century the struggle between the british and the french would shift the balance of power in europe.
warfare in the colonies 157 in all four of the wars except the last the seven years war battles in the north american colonies were but a sideshow accompanying massive warfare in europe.
although the wars involved many nations including indians who fought on both sides the conflicts centered on the intense struggle for supremacy between the british and the french a struggle that ended up profoundly shifting the international balance of power among the great powers of europe.
the prolonged warfare during the eighteenth century had a devastating effect on new england especially massachusetts for it was closest to the battlefields of french canada.
the wars also reshaped britains relationship with america.
great britain emerged from the wars in 1763 as the most powerful nation in the world.
thereafter international commerce became increasingly essential to the expanding british empire thus making the american colonies even more strategically significant.
the french and indian war the most important conflict between britain and france in north america was the french and indian war 1754 1763 globally known as the seven years war.
unlike the earlier wars the french and indian war started in america and ended with a decisive victory.
it was sparked by french and british competition for the ancestral indian lands in the vast ohio valley and the stakes were high.
whoever controlled the ohio country would control the entire continent because of the ohio and mississippi rivers.
to defend their interests in the ohio country the french pushed south from canada and built forts in the region.
when virginias british governor learned of the forts he sent an ambitious t wenty two year old militia officer major george washington to warn the french to leave.
washington made his way on foot and by horseback canoe and raft more than 450 miles to fort le boeuf just south of lake erie in northwest pennsylvania in late 1753 only to be rudely rebuffed by the french.
a few months later in the spring of 1754 washington now a lieutenant colonel went back to the ohio country with 150 volunteer soldiers and indian allies.
they planned to build a fort where the allegheny monongahela and ohio rivers converged where the city of pittsburgh later developed.
the so called forks of the ohio was the key strategic gateway to the vast western territory west of the appalachian mountains and both sides were determined to control it.
after two months of difficult travel through densely forested hilly terrain washington learned that french soldiers had beaten him to the site and built fort duquesne in western pennsylvania.
washington decided to camp about 158 chapter 4 from colonies to states forty miles from the fort.
the next day the virginians ambushed a french scouting party killing ten soldiers including the c ommander the first fatalities in what would become the french and indian war.
washington and his troops reinforced by more virginians and british soldiers dispatched from south carolina hastily constructed a tiny circular stockade at great meadows in western pennsylvania.
they called it fort necessity.
washington remarked that the valley provided a charming field for an encounter but there was nothing charming about the battle that erupted when a large french force attacked in a rainstorm on july 3 1754.
after the d ay long lopsided battle of great meadows washington surrendered having seen a third of his 300 men killed or wounded.
the french and their indian allies lost only three men.
the french commander then forced washington to surrender his french prisoners and admit that he had assassi major campaigns of the french and indian war wo lfe c a n a d 1 cape breton island a quebec fort louisbourg ri r ve nova scotia montreal hu r on fort niagara fort ticonderoga t a r i o fort george l ak e on mo ha new york river wk fort le boeuf r iv er fort duquesne sus pennsylvania qu e oh fort necessity md braddock 1755 washington 1754 amherst 1759 nh ma boston ct new york nj de potomac river virginia port royal maine mass.

most of them he noted are almost naked and scarcely a man has either shoes stockings or hat france was now in undisputed control of the ohio country.
washingtons bungled expedition not only had failed to oust the french it had triggered a massive world war.
as a british politician exclaimed the volley fired by a young virginian in the backwoods of america set the world on fire the albany plan british officials worried about war with the french and their indian allies urgently called a meeting of the northern colonies as far south as maryland.
twenty one representatives from seven colonies gathered in albany new york.
it was the first time that a large group of colonial delegates had met to take joint action.
at the urging of pennsylvanias benjamin franklin the albany congress june 19 july 11 1754 approved the albany plan of union.
it called for eleven colonies to band together headed by a president appointed by the king.
each colonial assembly would send two to seven delegates to a grand council the first american political cartoon benjamin franklins plea to the colonies to unite against the french in 1754 would become popular again twenty years later when the colonies faced a different threat.
160 chapter 4 from colonies to states which would have legislative powers.
the union would have jurisdiction over indian affairs.
the albany plan of union was too radical for the time however.
british officials and the colonial legislatures eager to maintain their powers wanted simply a military alliance against indian attacks so they rejected the albany plan.
benjamin franklin later maintained that the plan of union had it been adopted may have postponed or eliminated the eventual need for a f ull scale colonial revolution.
franklins proposal however did have a lasting significance in that it would be the model for the form of governance articles of confederation created by the new american nation in 1777 war in north america with the failure of the albany plan the british government decided to force a showdown with the presumptuous french in north america.
in june 1755 a british fleet captured the french forts protecting acadia a colony of new france along the atlantic coast of canada.
the british then expelled 11 500 acadians the catholic french residents.
hundreds of them eventually found their way to french louisiana where they became known as cajuns the name derived from acadians.
in 1755 the british government sent 1 000 soldiers to dislodge the french from the ohio country.
the arrival of unprecedented numbers of redcoat soldiers on american soil would change the dynamics of british north america.
although the colonists endorsed the use of force against the french they later would oppose the use of british soldiers to enforce colonial regulations.
braddock s defeat the british commander in chief in america general edward braddock was a stubborn overconfident officer who refused to recruit large numbers of indian allies.
braddock viewed indians with open contempt telling those willing to fight with him that he would not reward them with land for doing so no savage should inherit the land his dismissal of the indians and his ignorance of unconventional warfare in american forests would prove fatal.
neither he nor his irish troops had any experience fighting in the wilderness.
with the addition of some american militiamen including george washington as a volunteer officer braddocks force left northern virginia to confront the french hacking a 125 mile long road west through the rugged allegheny mountains toward fort duquesne.
on july 9 1755 as the british neared the fort they were ambushed by french soldiers canadian militiamen and indians.
the british troops dressed in impractical b right red wool uniforms in the summer heat suf warfare in the colonies 161 fered s hocking losses.
braddock was mortally wounded and would die three days later.
washington his coat riddled by four bullets helped lead a hasty retreat.
what came to be called the battle of monongahela was one of the worst british defeats in history.
the french and indians killed 63 of 86 british officers 914 out of 1 373 soldiers and captured the british cannons and supplies.
twelve of the wounded british soldiers left behind on the battlefield were stripped and burned alive by indians.
a devastated washington wrote his brother that the british army had been scandalously beaten by a trifling body of men the vaunted redcoats broke run as sheep pursued by hounds but the virginians he noted behaved like men and died like soldiers a world war while braddocks stunning defeat sent shock waves through the colonies indians allied with the french began attacking from la roques encyclopedie des american farms throughout western voyages an iroquois warrior in an eighteenth century french engraving.

desperate to respond the pennsylvania provincial government offered 130 spanish dollars for each male indian scalp and 50 dollars for female scalps.
indians and colonists killed each other mercilessly throughout 1755 and 1756 during the french and indian war.
it was not until may 1756 however that protestant britain and catholic france formally declared war in europe.
the first truly world war the seven years war in europe and the french and indian war in north america would eventually be fought on four continents and three oceans around the globe.
in the end it would redraw the political map of the world.
162 chapter 4 from colonies to states the onset of war brought into office a new british government with william pitt as prime minister.
his exceptional ability and self assurance matched his towering ego.
i know that i can save england and no one else can he announced.
pitt assembled a huge force of 45 000 british troops and american militiamen and in august 1759 they captured the french forts near the canadian border at ticonderoga crown point and niagara.
the battle of quebec in 1759 the french and indian war reached its climax with a series of british triumphs on land and at sea.
the most decisive victory was at quebec the hilltop fortress city and the capital of french canada.
during the dark of night some 4 500 british troops scaled the cliffs above the st lawrence river and at dawn surprised the unprepared french defenders in a battle that lasted only ten minutes.
the french retreated only to surrender four days later.
the battle of quebec was the turning point in the war.
thereafter the conflict in north america diminished although the fighting dragged on until 1763.
in the south fighting flared up between the carolina settlers and the cherokee nation.
a force of british regulars and colonial militia broke cherokee resistance in 1761 a new british king meanwhile the seven years war played out around the globe.
in europe huge armies ravaged each other.
hundreds of towns and cities were plundered and more than a million people killed.
on october 25 1760 british king george ii arose at 6 a m drank his morning chocolate milk and suddenly died on his toilet as the result of a ruptured artery.
his death shocked the nation and brought an untested new king to the throne.
george iis inexperienced successor was his t wenty two year old grandson george iii who was despised by his grandfather.

the treaty of paris which ended the war made great britain the ruler of an enormous world empire.
the american colonists celebrated the great british victories with as much excitement and pride as did londoners.
the treaty of paris 1763 in the treaty of paris signed in february 1763 britain took control of many important french colonies around the world including several incredibly profitable sugar island c olonies in the west indies most of the french colonies in india and all of frances north american possessions east of the mississippi river all of canada and what was then called spanish florida including much of present day alabama and mississippi.
as compensation the treaty gave spain control over the vast louisiana territory including new orleans and all french land west of the mississippi river.
the loss of louisiana left france with no territory on the north american continent.
british americans were delighted with the outcome of the war.
as a new england minister declared great britain had reached the summit of earthly grandeur and glory britains spectacular military success created massive challenges however.
the national debt doubled during the war and the new cost of maintaining the sprawling north american empire including the permanent stationing of british soldiers in the colonies was staggering.
in winning a huge global empire british leaders developed what one historian has called an arrogant triumphalism which led them to t ighten and ultimately l ose their control over the indians and colonists in north america.
managing a new empire no sooner was the treaty of paris signed than king george iii and his cabinet working through parliament began strictly enforcing economic regulations on the american colonies to help reduce the crushing national debt caused by the war.
during and after the war the british government increased taxes in britain to fund the military expenses.
in 1763 the average british citizen paid t wenty six times as much in taxes each year as the average american colonist paid.
with that in mind british leaders thought it only fair that the americans should pay more of the expenses for administering and defending the colonies.
many americans disagreed however arguing that the various navigation acts restricting their economic activity were already a form of tax on them.
the tension between the british need for greater revenue from the colonies and the americans defense of their rights and liberties set in motion a chain of events that would lead to revolution and independence.

every day for some time past reported a marylander has offered the melancholy scene of poor distressed families.
who have deserted their plantations for fear of falling into the cruel hands of our savage enemies the refugees told of terrible massacres in which settlers were most cruelly butchered the woman was roasted.
and several of the men had awls thrust in their eyes and spears arrows pitchforks etc sticking in their bodies the widespread indian attacks in the spring and summer of 1763 came to be called pontiacs rebellion because of the prominent role played by the inspiring ottawa chieftain who sought to unify several tribes in the effort to stop american expansion.
pontiac told a british official that the french never conquered us neither did they purchase a foot of our country nor have they a right to give it to you in december 1763 a group of frontier ruffians in pennsylvania took the law into their own hands.
outraged at the unwillingness of pacifist quakers in the pennsylvania assembly to protect white settlers on the frontier from marauding indians a group called the paxton boys s cots irish farmers from paxton near harrisburg armed with tomahawks and rifles took revenge by massacring and scalping peaceful conestogas men women and children.
then they threatened to kill the so called moravian indians a group of christian converts living near bethlehem.
when the indians took refuge in philadelphia some 1 500 paxton boys marched on the capital where benjamin franklin helped persuade the ungovernable frontiersmen to return home.
the proclamation line to help keep peace with the indians and to abide by the terms of an earlier agreement with the delawares and shawnees called the treaty of easton 1758 king george iii issued the royal proclamation of 1763 which drew an imaginary line along the crest of the appalachian mountains from canada south to georgia.
white settlers our loving subjects were forbidden to go west of the line in order to ensure that the indians would not be molested or disturbed on their ancestral lands.
for the first time american territorial expansion was to be controlled by royal officials.
in practice the proclamation line ended the activities of speculators buying huge tracts of indian lands but did not keep l and hungry settlers from pushing across the steep appalachian ridges into indian country.
by 1767 an indian chief was complaining that whites were making more encroachments on their country than ever they had before regulating the colonies 167 regulating the colonies as britain tightened its hold over the colonies after 1763 americans reminded parliament that their original charters guaranteed that they should be treated as if they were english citizens with all the rights and liberties protected by the nations constitutional traditions.
such arguments however fell on deaf ears in parliament.
as one member explained the british were determined to make north america pay for its own army grenvilles colonial policy just as the proclamation of 1763 was being drafted a new british government led by george grenville began to grapple with the huge debts the government had accumulated during the war along with the added expenses of maintaining troops in america.
grenville insisted that the americans whom he called the least taxed people in the world must pay for the soldiers defending them.
he also resented the large number of american merchants who engaged in smuggling to avoid paying british taxes on imported goods.
grenville ordered colonial officials to tighten enforcement of the navigation acts and sent warships to capture smugglers who if caught would be tried in new military courts rather than civilian jury trials.
the sugar act grenvilles effort to enforce the various navigation acts posed a serious threat to new englands prosperity.
distilling rum out of molasses a sweet syrup made from sugarcane had become quite profitable especially if the molasses could be smuggled in from caribbean islands still controlled by the french.
to generate more money from the colonies grenville put through the american revenue act of 1764 commonly known as the sugar act which cut the tax on molasses in half.
doing so he believed would reduce the temptation to smuggle french molasses or to bribe royal customs officers.
but the sugar act also added new duties taxes on other goods sugar wines coffee spices imported into america.
the new revenues generated by the sugar act grenville estimated would help pay for the necessary expenses of defending protecting and securing the said colonies with the sugar act parliament for the first time adopted a policy designed to raise revenues from the colonies and not merely to regulate trade with other nations.
colonists claimed that the sugar act taxed them without their consent since they had no elected representatives in parliament.
british officials argued however that parliaments power was absolute and indivisible.
if the americans accepted parliamentary authority in any area they had to accept 168 chapter 4 from colonies to states its authority in every area.
in the end however the controversial new sugar tax did not produce more revenue for great britain the cost of enforcing it was four times greater than the revenue it generated.
the currency act americans equally hated another of grenvilles new regulatory measures the currency act of 1764 which prohibited the colonies from coining or printing money while requiring that all payments for british goods imported into the colonies must be in gold or silver coins or in a commodity like tobacco.
the colonies had long faced a chronic shortage of hard money gold and silver coins called specie which kept flowing overseas to pay debts in england.
to address the lack of specie many colonies issued their own paper money which could not be used in other colonies.
british creditors feared payment in a currency of such fluctuating value.
to alleviate their fears grenville implemented the currency act.
by banning paper money it caused the value of existing paper money to plummet.
as a philadelphia newspaper complained ollar less the times are dreadful dismal doleful dolorous and d the stamp act prime minister grenville excelled at doing the wrong thing repeatedly.
in 1765 for example he persuaded parliament to pass the quartering act which required americans to feed and house british troops.
most americans saw no need for so many british soldiers in colonial cities.
if the british were there to defend against indians why werent they positioned closer to the indians.
some colonists decided that the quartering act was actually an effort to use british soldiers to bully the americans.
william knox a british colonial official admitted as much in 1763 when he said that the main purpose of keeping an army in america was to secure the dependence of the colonies on great britain yet grenville aggravated colonial concerns by pushing through an even more controversial measure.
on february 13 1765 parliament passed the stamp act which required colonists to purchase stamped paper for virtually every possible use newspapers pamphlets bonds leases deeds licenses insurance policies college diplomas even playing cards.
the requirement was to go into effect november 1.
the stamp act was the first effort by parliament to place a tax directly on american goods and services rather than levying an external tax on imports and exports.
not a single colony supported the new measure.
the whig point of view grenvilles colonial policies outraged many americans especially those living in the large port cities bos regulating the colonies 169 ton new york philadelphia and charleston.
unwittingly the prime minister had stirred up a storm of protest and set in motion a violent debate about the proper relationship between great britain and her colonies.
in the late eighteenth century the americans who opposed british policies began to call themselves patriots or whigs a name earlier applied to british critics of royal power.
in turn whigs labeled the king and his corrupt government ministers and parliamentary supporters as tories a term of abuse meaning friends of the king.
in 1764 and 1765 whigs felt that grenville was violating their rights in several ways.
a professional army was usually a weapon used by tyrants and now with the french defeated and canada solidly under british control thousands of british soldiers remained in america.
were the troops there to protect the colonists or to scare them into obedience.
whigs also argued that british citizens had the right to be taxed only by their elected representatives in parliament but americans had no such representatives.
british leaders countered that the colonists enjoyed virtual representation in parliament.
william pitt a staunch supporter of american rights in parliament dismissed grenvilles concept of virtual representation as the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of a man many others in both britain and america agreed.
sir francis bernard the royal governor of massachusetts correctly predicted that the new stamp tax would cause a great alarm meet much opposition in the colonies.
protests in the colonies the stamp act aroused fierce resentment and resistance.
a new yorker wrote that this single stroke has lost great britain the affection of all her colonies in a flood of pamphlets speeches resolutions and street protests critics repeated a slogan familiar to americans no taxation without representation in parliament protesters calling themselves sons of liberty emerged in every colony often meeting beneath liberty trees in boston a great elm in charleston south carolina a live oak.
in new york city the sons of liberty erected liberty poles as symbols of their resistance.
in virginia patrick henry convinced the assembly to pass the stamp act resolutions which asserted yet again that the colonists could not be taxed without being first consulted by the british government or represented in parliament by their own elected members.
the nonimportation movement americans opposed to the stamp act knew that the most powerful form of leverage they had against 170 chapter 4 from colonies to states opposition to the stamp act in protest of the stamp act which was to take effect the next day the pennsylvania journal printed a skull and crossbones on its masthead.
the british was economic.
to put pressure on the british government and show that the colonists themselves had not become dependent on britains empire of goods patriots by the thousands between 1767 and 1770 signed what were called nonimportation agreements pledging not to buy or consume any british goods.
the nonimportation movement of the 1760s and 1770s united whigs from different communities and different colonies.
it also enabled women to play a significant role resisting britains colonial policies.
calling themselves daughters of liberty many colonial women stopped buying imported british clothes.
they also quit drinking british tea in order to save this abused country from ruin and slavery using herbs and flowers they made liberty tea instead.
the daughters of liberty also participated in public spinning bees whereby they would gather in the town square to weave and spin yarn and wool into fabric known as homespun in 1769 the boston evening post reported that the industry and frugality of american ladies were enabling the political salvation of a whole continent regulating the colonies 171 patriots saw the effort to boycott british products as a way to restore their own virtue.
a rhode islander declared that a primary cause of americas problems was the luxury and extravagance brought on by their freewheeling purchases of british goods.
the nonimportation movement would help americans restore our frugality industry and simplicity of manners a boston minister claimed that those who could not do without british luxury goods and be satisfied with plainness and simplicity did not deserve to be american citizens.
colonial unity the boycotts worked imports of british goods fell by 40 percent.
at the same time the virginia house of burgesses struck the first official blow against the stamp act with the virginia resolves a series of resolutions inspired by the fiery patrick henry.
virginians henry declared were entitled to all the rights of englishmen and englishmen could be taxed only by their own elected representatives.
because virginians had no elected representatives in parliament they could only be taxed by the virginia the repeal or the funeral procession of miss a meric stamp this 1766 cartoon shows grenville carrying the dead stamp act in its coffin.
in the background trade with america starts up again.
172 chapter 4 from colonies to states legislature.
newspapers spread the virginia resolves throughout the colonies and other colonial assemblies hastened to follow virginias example.
no taxation without representation became the echoing rally cry for american whigs.
in 1765 the massachusetts house of representatives invited the other colonial assemblies to send delegates to new york city to discuss their opposition to the stamp act.
nine responded and from october 7 25 1765 the stamp act congress formulated a declaration of the rights and grievances of the colonies.
the delegates insisted that they would accept no taxes being imposed on them without their own consent given personally or by their representatives grenville responded by denouncing his colonial critics as ungrateful for all of the benefits provided them by the british government.
repeal of the stamp act the storm over the stamp act had scarcely erupted before grenville was out of office.
he had lost the confidence of the king who replaced him with lord rockingham in july 1765.
then in mid august 1765 nearly three months before the stamp act was to take effect a boston mob plundered the homes of the royal lieutenant governor thomas hutchinson and the official in charge of enforcing the stamp tax.
thoroughly shaken the boston stamp agent resigned and other stamp agents throughout the colonies were hounded out of office.
the growing violence in america and the success of the nonimportation movement convinced rockingham that the stamp act was a mistake.
in february 1766 a humiliated parliament repealed it.
to save face parliament passed the declaratory act which asserted its power to govern the colonies in all cases whatsoever the repeal of the stamp act set off excited demonstrations throughout the colonies.
sally franklin wrote to her father benjamin in europe that philadelphias church bells were rung and bonfires were built.
i never heard so much noise in my life she noted.
the townshend acts in july 1766 king george iii replaced lord rockingham with william pitt the former prime minister who had exercised heroic leadership during the seven years war.
for a time the guiding force in the pitt ministry was the witty but reckless charles townshend the treasury chief whose abilities were superior to those of all men said a colleague and his judgment common sense below that of any man in 1767 townshend pushed through parliament his i ll fated plan to generate more colonial revenue.
a few months later he died at age f orty two leaving regulating the colonies 173 behind a bitter legacy the townshend acts.
the revenue act of 1767 which taxed colonial imports of glass lead paint paper and tea was the most hated.
it posed an even more severe threat than grenvilles taxes had for townshend planned to use the new tax revenues to pay the salaries of the royal governors in the colonies.
until that point the colonial assemblies paid the salaries thus giving them some leverage over them.
john adams observed that townshends plan would make the royal governor independent of the people and disrupt that balance of power which is essential to all free governments writing in the boston gazette adams insisted that such an independent ruler is a monster in a free state discontent on the frontier some colonists had little interest in the disputes over british regulatory policy raging along the seaboard.
parts of the backcountry stirred with quarrels that had nothing to do with the stamp and townshend acts.
rival claims to lands east of lake champlain pitted new york against new hampshire.
eventually the residents of the disputed area would form their own state of vermont created in 1777 although not recognized as a member of the union until 1791.
in the south frontiersmen in south carolina issued a rising chorus of complaints about the lack of colonial protection from horse thieves cattle rustlers and indians.
backcountry residents organized societies called regulators to administer vigilante justice in the region and refused to pay taxes until they gained effective government.
in 1769 the assembly finally set up six circuit courts in the region but without responding to the backcountrys demand for representation in the legislative assemblies.
in north carolina the protest was less over the lack of government than over the abuses and extortion by appointees from the eastern part of the colony.
western farmers felt especially oppressed by the governments refusal either to issue paper money or to accept produce in payment of taxes and in 1766 they organized to resist.
efforts of these regulators to stop seizures of property and other court proceedings led to more disorders and the enactment of a bill that made the rioters guilty of treason.
that the regulators tended to be baptists methodists and presbyterians who preached plain living while the coastal elite tended to be anglicans who paraded their wealth injected a religious and social element into the squabbles.
in the spring of 1771 north carolinas royal governor william tryon led 1 200 militiamen into battle against regulators.
there his forces defeated some 174 chapter 4 from colonies to states 2 000 i ll organized regulators in the battle of alamance in which eight were killed on each side.
tryons men then ranged through the backcountry forcing some 6 500 piedmont settlers to sign an oath of allegiance to the king.
these disputes and revolts within the colonies illustrate the diversity of opinion and outlook among americans on the eve of the revolution.
colonists were of many minds about many things including british rule but also differed with one another over how best to protest against particular grievances.
the crisis grows the townshend acts surprised and angered many colonists.
as american rage bubbled over samuel adams of boston one of the most radical rebels decided that a small group of determined whigs could generate a mass movement.
it does not take a majority to prevail adams insisted but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men early in 1768 adams and boston attorney james otis jr convinced the massachusetts assembly to circulate a letter they had written to the other colonies.
it restated the illegality of taxation without representation in parliament and invited the support of other colonies.
british officials ordered the massachusetts assembly to withdraw the letter.
they refused and the king ordered the assembly dissolved.
in response to an appeal by the royal governor of massachusetts 3 000 british troops were sent to boston in october 1768 to maintain order.
loyalists as the americans who supported the king and parliament were often called welcomed the soldiers patriots those rebelling against british authority viewed the british troops as an occupation force.
meanwhile in london the king appointed samuel adams adams was the fiery still another new chief minister fredorganizer of the sons of liberty.
erick lord north in january 1770.
the crisis grows 175 the first bloodshed in 1765 benjamin franklin had predicted that although british soldiers sent to america would not find a rebellion they may indeed make one the growing tensions between rebellious americans and british troops triggered several violent incidents.
the first called the battle at golden hill occurred in new york city where liberty boys kept erecting liberty poles only to see british soldiers knock them down.
the soldiers called lobsterbacks or redcoats because of their bright red uniforms also began posting signs declaring that the sons of liberty were the real enemies of society on january 18 1770 a group of patriots captured two british soldiers.
soon an angry crowd formed around the twenty british soldiers sent to rescue their comrades.
the outnumbered soldiers retreated.
when they reached golden hill more soldiers arrived.
at that point the redcoats turned on the crowd pursuing them.
an officer yelled draw your bayonets and cut your way through them they attacked the crowd and in the confusion several on both sides were seriously hurt.
the next day more brawls erupted.
once the british soldiers left the scene the sons of liberty erected another liberty pole which bore the inscription liberty and property the first blood had been shed in the growing conflict over american liberties and it was soon followed by more violence.
the boston massacre massachusetts had long been the center of resistance to british authority.
in boston the presence of thousands of british soldiers had become a constant source of irritation.
crowds frequently heckled the soldiers many of whom earned the abuse by harassing and intimidating americans.
on the evening of march 5 1770 two dozen boston rowdies teens irishmen blacks and sailors began taunting and throwing icicles at hugh white a british soldier guarding the custom house.
someone rang the town fire bell drawing a larger crowd to the scene as the taunting continued kill him kill him knock him down.
fire damn you fire you dare not fire a squad of soldiers arrived to help white but the surly crowd surrounded them.
when someone knocked a soldier down he arose and fired his musket.
others joined in.
when the smoke cleared five people lay dead or dying and eight more were wounded.
the first one killed or so the story goes was crispus attucks a former slave who worked at the docks.
the so called boston massacre sent shock waves throughout the colonies and all the way to london.
virtually the entire city of boston attended the funerals for the deceased.
only the decision to postpone the trial of the british 176 chapter 4 from colonies to states the bloody massacre paul reveres engraving of the boston massacre 1770.
soldiers for six months allowed the tensions to subside.
at the same time the impact of the colonial boycott of british products persuaded lord north to modify the townshend acts.
late in april 1770 parliament repealed all the townshend duties except for the tea tax which the king wanted to keep as a symbol of parliaments authority.
colonial discontent subsided for two years thereafter.
the redcoats left boston but remained in canada and the british navy still patrolled the new england coast.
the gaspe incident in june 1772 a naval incident further eroded the colonies fragile relationship with the mother country.
near warwick rhode island the hms gaspe a british warship ran aground while chasing suspected american smugglers.
its hungry crew seized local sheep hogs and chickens from local farms.
an enraged crowd some of them dressed the crisis grows 177 as mohawk indians then boarded the gaspe shot the captain removed the crew looted the ship and then burned it.
the gaspe incident symbolized the intensity of anti british feelings among growing numbers of americans.
when the british tried to take the suspects to london for trial patriots organized in protest.
thomas jefferson said that it was the threat of transporting americans for trials in britain that reignited a nti british activities in virginia.
in response to the gaspe incident samuel adams organized the committee of correspondence which issued a statement of american rights and grievances and invited other towns to do the same.
similar committees sprang up across massachusetts and in other colonies forming a unified network of resistance.
the flame is kindled and like lightning it catches from soul to soul reported abigail adams the high spirited wife of future president john adams.
by 1772 thomas hutchinson now the royal governor of massachusetts could tell the colonial assembly that the choice facing americans was stark they must choose between obeying the supreme authority of parliament and total independence the boston tea party the new british prime minister lord north soon provided the spark to transform resentment into rebellion.
in 1773 he tried to bail out the struggling east india company which had in its british warehouses some 17 million pounds of tea that it desperately needed to sell before it rotted.
parliament passed the tea act of 1773 to allow the company to send its tea directly to america without paying any taxes.
british tea merchants could thereby undercut the prices charged by their american competitors most of whom were smugglers who bought tea from the dutch.
at the same time king george iii told lord north to compel obedience in the colonies.
in massachusetts the committees of correspondence backed by boston merchants alerted colonists that the british government was trying to purchase colonial submission with cheap tea.
the reduction in the price of tea was a clever trick to make colonists accept taxation without consent.
in boston furious americans decided that their passion for liberty outweighed their love for tea.
on december 16 1773 scores of patriots disguised as indians boarded three british ships in boston harbor and dumped overboard 342 chests filled with 46 tons of east india company tea.
the boston tea party pushed british officials to the breaking point.
the destruction of so much valuable tea convinced the king and his advisers that a forceful response was required.
the colonists must either submit or triumph george iii wrote to lord north who decided to make an example of boston 178 chapter 4 from colonies to states to the rest of the colonies.
we are now to establish our authority over the colonies north said or give it up entirely the coercive acts in 1774 lord north convinced parliament to punish rebellious boston by enacting a cluster of harsh laws called the coercive acts americans renamed them the intolerable acts.
the boston port act closed the boston harbor until the city paid for the lost tea.
a new quartering act ordered colonists to provide lodging for british soldiers.
the impartial administration of justice act said that any royal official accused of a major crime would be tried back in great britain rather than in the colony.
finally the massachusetts government act gave the royal governor the authority to appoint the colonys legislative council which until then had been elected by the people as well as judges and sheriffs.
it also ordered that no town meeting could be held without the royal governors consent.
in may lieutenant general thomas gage commander in chief of british forces in north america was named governor of massachusetts and assumed command of the british soldiers who had returned to boston.
the intolerable acts shocked colonists.
no one had expected such a severe reaction to the boston tea party.
many towns held meetings in violation of the able doctor or america swallowing the bitter draught this 1774 engraving shows lord north the boston port act in his pocket pouring tea down americas throat and america spitting it back.
the crisis grows 179 the new laws and voters elected their own unauthorized provincial legislative assembly which ordered town governments to quit paying taxes to the royal governor.
by august 1774 patriots across massachusetts had essentially taken control of local governments.
they also began stockpiling weapons and gunpowder in anticipation of an eventual clash with british troops.
elsewhere colonists rallied to help boston raising money sending supplies and boycotting as well as burning or dumping british tea.
in williamsburg when the virginia assembly met in may a member of the committee of correspondence thomas jefferson suggested that june 1 the effective date of the boston port act become an official day of fasting and prayer in virginia.
the royal governor responded by dissolving the assembly whose members then retired to the raleigh tavern where they decided to form a continental congress to represent all the colonies more effectively in the confrontation with britain.
as samuel savage a connecticut colonist wrote may 1774 the conflict had come down to a single question whether we shall or shall not be governed by a british parliament the first continental congress on september 5 1774 the fifty five delegates making up the first continental congress assembled in philadelphia.
it was the first time that all of the colonies had met to coordinate policies.
over seven weeks the congress endorsed the suffolk resolves which urged massachusetts to resist british tyranny with force.
the congress then adopted a declaration of american rights which proclaimed once again the rights of americans as british citizens and denied parliaments authority to regulate internal colonial affairs.
we demand no new rights said the congress.
we ask only for peace liberty and security finally the congress adopted the continental association of 1774 which recommended that every colony organize committees to enforce a new and complete boycott of all imported british goods a dramatic step that would be followed by a refusal to send american goods exports to britain.
if the ideal of republican virtue meant anything it meant the sacrificing of self interest for the public good.
the association was designed to show that americans could deny themselves the baubles of britain in order to demonstrate their commitment to colonial liberties and constitutional rights.
the county and city committees forming the continental association became the organizational network for the resistance movement.
seven thousand men across the colonies served on the local committees and many more women helped put the boycotts into practice.
the committees required 180 chapter 4 from colonies to states colonists to sign an oath refusing to purchase british goods.
in east haddam connecticut a loyalist doctor was tarred feathered and rubbed with pig dung.
such violent incidents led loyalists to claim that it was better to be a slave to the king than to a patriot mob.
thousands of ordinary men and women participated in the boycott of british goods and their sacrifices on behalf of colonial liberties provided the momentum leading to revolution.
it was common people who enforced the boycott volunteered in patriot militia units attended town meetings and ousted royal officials.
as the people of pittsfield massachusetts declared in a petition we have always believed that the people are the fountain of power the growing rebellion against british tyranny now extended well beyond simple grievances over taxation.
patriots decided that there was a conspiracy against their liberties at work in london.
in boston an increasingly nervous general gage requested that more british troops be sent to suppress the growing rebellion.
mercy otis warren wrote that most americans still balked at the idea of drawing the sword against the nation from whence she america derived her origin she feared however that britain was poised to plunge her dagger into the bosom of her affectionate offspring last minute compromise in london king george fumed.
he wrote lord north that blows must decide whether the americans are to be subject to this country or independent in early 1775 parliament declared that massachusetts was officially in rebellion and prohibited the new england colonies from trading with any nation outside the british empire.
on february 27 1775 lord north issued the conciliatory propositions which offered to resolve the festering dispute by eliminating all taxes on any colony that voluntarily paid both its share for military defense and the salaries of the royal governors.
in other words north was asking the colonies to tax themselves.
by the time the conciliatory propositions arrived in america shooting had already started.
bold talk of war while most of the patriots believed that britain would back down patrick henry of virginia dramatically declared that war was unavoidable.
the twenty nine year old henry a farmer and storekeeper turned lawyer claimed that the colonies have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on but their efforts had been met only by violence and insult freedom the defiant henry shouted could be bought only with blood.
if forced to choose he supposedly shouted give me liberty then paused dramatically clenched his fist as if it held a dagger and plunged it into his c hest or give me death loyalists shouted treason amid the applause.
the crisis grows 181 as henry predicted events quickly moved toward armed conflict.
by mid 1775 the king and parliament had effectively lost control they could neither persuade nor force the patriots to accept new regulations and revenue measures.
in boston general gage warned that armed conflict would unleash the horrors of civil war but lord sandwich head of the british navy dismissed the rebels as raw undisciplined cowardly men without an army or navy.
major john pitcairn a british army officer agreed writing from boston that one active campaign a smart action and burning two or three of their towns will set everything to rights lexington and concord patrick henry of virginia henry famously declared give me liberty or give me death major pitcairn soon had his chance to quash the rebel resistance.
on april 14 1775 the british army in boston received secret orders to stop the open rebellion in massachusetts.
general gage had decided to arrest rebel leaders such as samuel adams and seize the militias gunpowder stored at concord sixteen miles northwest of boston.
after dark on april 18 some 800 british soldiers secretly boarded boats and crossed the charles river to cambridge then set out westward on foot to lexington a town about eleven miles away.
when patriots got wind of the plan paul revere and william dawes mounted their horses for their famous midnight ride to warn the rebel leaders that the british were coming.
in the gray dawn light of april 19 an advance unit of 238 redcoats found american captain john parker and about seventy minutemen patriot militia who could assemble at a minutes notice lined up on the lexington town square while dozens of villagers watched.
parker and his men intended only a silent protest but major pitcairn rode onto the lexington green swinging his sword and yelling disperse you damned rebels.
you dogs run the outnumbered militiamen were backing away when someone fired.
the british soldiers shot at the minutemen then charged them with bayonets leaving eight dead and ten wounded.
jonathan 182 chapter 4 from colonies to states harrington a militiaman who was shot in the back managed to crawl across the green only to die on his doorstep.
the british officers quickly brought their men under control and led them to concord where they destroyed hidden military supplies.
while marching out of the town they encountered american riflemen at the north bridge.
shots were fired and a dozen or so british soldiers were killed or wounded.
more important the short skirmish and ringing church bells alerted rebel farmers ministers craftsmen and merchants from nearby communities to grab their muskets.
they were as one of them said determined to be free or die by noon the british began a ragged retreat back to lexington.
less than a mile out of concord they suffered the first of many ambushes.
the narrow road turned into a gauntlet of death as rebel marksmen fired on the british troops from behind stone walls trees barns and houses.
it was a day full of horror one of the soldiers recalled.
the patriots seemed maddened during the fighting along the road leading to lexington a british soldier was searching a house for rebel snipers when he ran into t wenty five year old patriot james hayward a school teacher.

and answered so are you they fired simultaneously.
the british soldier died instantly and hayward succumbed to a head wound eight hours later.
by nightfall the redcoat survivors were safely back in boston having suffered three times as many dead and wounded as the americans.
a british general reported that the colonists had earned his respect whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob will find himself much mistaken until the battles of lexington and concord both sides had mistakenly assumed that the other would back down when confronted with deadly force.
instead the clash of arms turned a resistance movement into a war of rebellion.
masses of ordinary people were determined to fight for their freedoms against a british parliament and king bent on denying them their civil and legal rights.
in virginia thomas jefferson reported that the news from concord and lexington had unleashed a frenzy of revenge against the british among all ranks of people the spreading conflict on june 15 1775 the second continental congress unanimously selected forty three year old george washington to lead a new national army.
his service in the french and indian war had made him one of the few experienced 184 chapter 4 from colonies to states american officers and he was admired for his success as a planter surveyor and land speculator as well as for his service in the virginia legislature and the continental congress.
perhaps more important he looked like a leader.
tall and strong washington was a superb horseman and fearless fighter.
washington humbly accepted the responsibility of leading the american war effort but refused to be paid.
a few weeks later mercy otis warren wrote a friend in london that washington was a man whose military abilities public private virtue place him in the first class of the good the brave the battle of bunker hill on saturday june 17 the very day that george washington was named commander in chief patriot militiamen engaged british forces in their first major clash the battle of bunker hill adjoining breeds hill was the battles actual location.
in an effort to strengthen their control over the area around boston some 2 400 british troops based in the city boarded boats and crossed over the charles river to the charlestown peninsula where they formed lines and advanced up breeds hill in tight formation through waist high grass and across pasture fences as the american defenders watched from behind their earthworks.
view of the attack on bunker hill the battle of bunker hill and the burning of charlestown peninsula.
the spreading conflict 185 the militiamen mostly farmers waited until the redcoats had come within thirty paces then loosed a volley that shattered the front ranks.
the british attacked again but the patriot riflemen forced them to retreat a second time.
during the third british assault the colonists ran out of gunpowder and retreated in panic and confusion.
i jumped over the walls peter brown remembered and ran for about half a mile while musket balls flew like hailstones and cannons roared like thunder the british took the high ground but were too tired to pursue the rebels.
they had suffered 1 054 casualties over twice the american losses.
a dearly bought victory reported british general henry clinton another such would have ruined us there followed a nine month stalemate around boston with each side hoping for a negotiated settlement.
abigail adams reported that the patriots still living in boston where the british army governed by martial law were being treated like abject slaves under the most cruel and despotic of tyrants open and avowed enemies three weeks after the battle of bunker hill in july 1775 the continental congress sent the king the olive branch petition urging him to negotiate with his rebellious colonies.
when the petition reached london however king george refused to look at it.
on august 22 he denounced the americans as open and avowed enemies his arrogant dismissal of the olive branch petition convinced abigail adams that war was now certain the die is cast.
the sword is now our only yet dreadful alternative outright rebellion resistance had grown into outright rebellion but few patriots were ready to call for american independence.
they still considered themselves british subjects.
when the second continental congress convened at philadelphia on may 10 1775 most of the delegates still wanted parliament to restore their rights so that they could resume being loyal british colonists.
meanwhile the british army in boston was under siege by militia units and small groups of musket toting men who had arrived from across new england to join the rebellion.
they were still farmers not trained soldiers and the uprising was not yet an army it lacked an organized command structure and effective support system.
the patriots also lacked training discipline cannons muskets bullets gunpowder and blankets.
what they did have was a growing sense of confidence and resolve.
as a massachusetts patriot said our 186 chapter 4 from colonies to states all is at stake.
death and devastation are the instant consequences of delay.
every moment is infinitely precious with each passing day war fever infected more and more colonists.
oh that i were a soldier john adams wrote home to abigail from philadelphia.
i am reading military books.
everybody must and will and shall be a soldier on the very day that congress met the british fort ticonderoga on lake champlain in upstate new york near the canadian border fell to a patriot force of green mountain boys led by ethan allen of vermont and massachusetts volunteers under benedict arnold.
two days later the patriots captured a smaller british fort at crown point north of ticonderoga.
independence the revolutionary war was well underway in january 1776 when thomas paine a recently arrived t hirty nine year old english emigrant who had found work as a radical journalist in philadelphia provided the patriot cause with a stirring pamphlet titled common sense.
until it appeared colonial grievances had been mainly directed at parliament.
paine however directly attacked the british monarchy by openly appealing to the passions and feelings of mankind the common sense of the matter paine stressed was that king george iii had caused the rebellion and had ordered the savage and cruel denial of american rights.
even brutes do not devour their young he wrote nor savages make war upon their families yet britain the mother of america was doing just that.
americans paine urged should abandon the british monarchy the blood of the slain the weeping voice of nature cries tis time to part it was paine who helped convince americans that independence was not unrealistic it was inevitable.
only by declaring independence he predicted could the colonists gain the crucial support of france and spain the cause of america is in great measure the cause of all mankind the rest of the world would welcome and embrace an independent america it would be the glory of the earth paine concluded that the sun had never shined on a cause of greater worth he insisted that we have it in our power to begin the world over again within three months more than 150 000 copies of paines stirring pamphlet were circulating throughout the colonies and around the world an enormous number for the time.
common sense is working a powerful change in the minds of men george washington reported.
independence 187 breaking the bonds of empire common sense inspired the colonial population from massachusetts to georgia and helped convince british subjects still loyal to the king to embrace the radical notion of independence.
without the pen of paine remembered john adams the sword of washington would have been wielded in vain during the spring and summer of 1776 some ninety local governments towns and colonial legislatures issued declarations of independence from great britain.
momentum for independence was building in the continental congress too but success was by no means assured.
in congress john dickinson of pennsylvania urged delay.
on june 1 he warned that independence was a dangerous step since america had no national government or european allies.
but his was a lone voice of caution.
in june 1776 one by one the colonies authorized their delegates in the continental congress to take the final step.
on june 7 richard henry lee of virginia moved that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states lees resolution passed on july 2 a date that john adams predicted would be the most memorable in the history of america.
the coming revolution the continental congress votes for independence july 2 1776.
188 chapter 4 from colonies to states the more memorable date however became july 4 1776 when the congress formally adopted the declaration of independence.
a few delegates refused to sign the momentous document others said john adams signed with regret.
and with many doubts most however signed wholeheartedly knowing full well that by doing so they were likely to be hanged if captured by british troops.
benjamin franklin acknowledged how high the stakes were well gentlemen he told the congress we must now hang together or we shall most assuredly hang separately the declaration of independence the declaration in its most frequently reproduced form an 1823 engraving by william j.
independence 189 jeffersons declaration in philadelphia in june 1776 t hirty t hree year old thomas jefferson a brilliant virginia attorney and planter serving in the continental congress drafted a statement of independence that john adams and benjamin franklin then edited followed by the members of congress themselves.
the declaration of independence was crucially important not simply because it marked the creation of a new nation but because of the ideals it expressed and the grievances it listed.
it insisted that certain truths were self evident that all men are created equal and independent and have the right to create governments of their own choosing.
governments in thomas jeffersons words derive their just powers from the consent of the people who are entitled to alter or abolish those governments when rulers deny citizens their unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness because king george iii was trying to impose an absolute tyranny over these states the representatives of the united states of america declared the thirteen united colonies to be free and independent states the contradictions of freedom once the continental congress chose independence the members set about revising thomas jeffersons draft declaration before sending it to london.
southern representatives insisted on deleting the slave owning jeffersons section criticizing george iii for perpetuating the african slave trade.
in doing so they revealed the major contradiction at work in the movement for independence the rhetoric of freedom that animated the revolution did not apply to americas original sin the widespread system of slavery that fueled the southern economy.
slavery was the absence of liberty yet few americans confronted the inconsistency of their protests in defense of freedom for whites.
in 1764 a group of slaves in charleston watching a demonstration against british tyranny by white sons of liberty got caught up in the energies of the moment and began chanting freedom freedom freedom but that was not at all what southern planters wanted for african americans.
in 1774 when a group of slaves killed four whites in a desperate attempt to gain their own freedom from tyranny georgia planters responded by capturing the rebels and burning them alive.
the harvard educated lawyer james otis was one of the few whigs who demanded freedom for blacks and women.
in 1764 he had argued in a widely circulated pamphlet that the colonists black and white born here are free british subjects and entitled to all the essential civil rights of such he even went so far as to suggest that slavery itself should be ended since all men.
white or black were by the law of nature freeborn 190 chapter 4 from colonies to states otis also asked are not women born as free as men.
would it not be infamous to assert that the ladies are all slaves by nature his sister mercy otis warren became a tireless advocate of american resistance to british tyranny through her poems pamphlets and plays.
in a letter to a friend she noted that british officials needed to realize that americas daughters are politicians and patriots and will aid the good work of resistance with their female efforts in 1765 john adams had snarled that he and other colonists angered by british actions would not be their slaves actual slaves insisted on independence too.
in 1773 a group of enslaved african americans in boston appealed to the royal governor of massachusetts to free them just as white americans were defending their freedoms against british tyranny.
in many respects the slaves argued they had a more compelling case for liberty we have no property we have no wives.
no children.
no country a few months later a group of four boston slaves addressed a public letter to the town government in which they referred to the hypocrisy of slaveholders who protested against british regulations and taxes.
we expect great things from men who have made such a noble stand against the designs of their fellow men to enslave them they noted.
but freedom in 1776 was a celebration to which slaves were not invited.
in 1775 the prominent south carolinian william henry drayton expressed his horror that impertinent slaves were claiming that the present contest with great britain was for obliging us to give them liberty george washington himself acknowledged the contradictory aspects of the revolutionary movement when he warned that the alternative to declaring independence was to become tame and abject slaves as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway absolute power washphillis wheatley an autographed ington and other slaveholders at the portrait of americas first african head of the revolutionary movement american poet.
such as thomas jefferson were in part independence 191 so resistant to british tyranny because they witnessed every day what actual slavery was like for the blacks under their control.
a morally perplexed jefferson admitted the hypocrisy of slave owning revolutionaries.
southerners he wrote to a french friend are jealous of their own liberties but trampling on those of others such inconsistency was not lost on others.
phillis wheatley the first african american writer to see her poetry published in america highlighted the absurdity of white colonists claiming their freedom while continuing to exercise oppressive power over enslaved africans.
we always had governed ourselves historians still debate the causes of the american revolution.
americans in 1775 1776 were not desperately poor overall they probably enjoyed a higher standard of living than most other societies and lived under the freest institutions in the world.
their diet was better than that of europeans as was their average life span.
in addition the percentage of free property owners in the thirteen american colonies was higher than in britain or europe.
as the wealthy charlestonian charles pinckney remarked a few years later americans by which he meant white americans were more equal in their circumstances than the people of any other country at the same time the new taxes forced on americans after 1763 were not as great as those imposed on the british people.
it is also important to remember that many american colonists perhaps as many as half were indifferent hesitant or actively opposed to rebellion.
so why did the americans revolt at all.
historians have highlighted many factors the clumsy british efforts to tighten their regulation of colonial trade the restrictions on colonists eager to acquire western lands the growing tax burden the mounting debts to british merchants the lack of american representation in parliament and the role of radicals such as samuel adams and patrick henry in stirring up anti british feelings.
yet colonists sought liberty from british tyranny for reasons that were not so selfless or noble.
many of the new englanders and new yorkers most critical of tighter british regulations were smugglers.
boston merchant john hancock for example embraced the patriot cause in part because he was a wealthy smuggler.
paying more british taxes would have cost him a fortune.
likewise south carolinas henry laurens and virginias landon carter both prosperous planters worried that the british might abolish slavery.
overall however what americans most feared and resented were the british efforts to constrict their civil liberties thereby denying their rights as british citizens.
as hugh williamson a pennsylvania physician explained the 192 chapter 4 from colonies to states revolution resulted not from trifling or imaginary injustices but from gross and palpable violations of american rights that had thrown the miserable colonists into the pit of despotism yet how did the american colonies the most diverse society in the world divided by nationality and class develop such a unified resistance.
although most were of english heritage there were many other peoples represented scots irish scots irish welsh germans dutch swedes finns swiss french and jews as well as growing numbers of africans and diminishing numbers of native americans.
in 1774 thomas hutchinson the royal governor of massachusetts assured british officials that a union of the colonies was utterly impracticable because the colonists were greatly divided among themselves in every colony he predicted that rebellious americans would ultimately submit and that they must and moreover would soon hutchinson was wrong of course.
what most a mericans regardless of their backgrounds had come to share by 1775 was a defiant attachment to the civil rights and legal processes guaranteed by the english constitutional tradition.
this new outlook rooted in the defense of sacred constitutional principles made the revolution conceivable armed resistance made it possible and independence ultimately made it achievable.
the outlook of the revolutionaries was founded on the shared political principle that all citizens were equal and independent and that all governmental authority had to be based on the consent of those governed and longstanding constitutional principles.
this republican ideal was the crucial force transforming a prolonged effort to preserve old rights and liberties enjoyed by british citizens into a movement to create an independent nation.
as john adams explained americans by 1776 had lost their affection for england because british officials were conspiring to strip them of their cherished liberties.
with their declaration of independence the r evolutionaries men and women farmers artisans mechanics sailors merchants tavern owners and shopkeepers had at last become determined to develop their own society.
most patriots still spoke the same language and worshipped the same god as the british but they no longer thought the same way.
americans wanted to trade freely with the world and to expand what jefferson called their empire of liberty westward across the appalachian mountains.
perhaps the last word on the complex causes of the revolution should belong to levi preston a minuteman from danvers massachusetts.
asked late in life about the british efforts to impose new taxes and regulations on the colonists preston responded by asking his young interviewer what were they.
oppressions.
i didnt feel them he was then asked what were you independence 193 not oppressed by the stamp act preston replied that he never saw one of those stamps.
i am certain i never paid a penny for one of them what about the tax on tea.
i never drank a drop of the stuff the boys threw it all overboard his interviewer finally asked why he decided to fight for independence.
young man preston explained what we meant in going for those redcoats was this we always had governed ourselves and we always meant to.
they didnt mean we should chapter review summary british and french colonies new france followed the spanish model of absolute power in governing its far flung trading outposts.
on the other hand great britains policy of salutary neglect allowed the colonies a large degree of self government until the british governments decision to rigidly enforce its policy of mercantilism as seen in such measures as the navigation acts became a means to enrich its global empire.
the glorious revolution in great britain inspired new political philosophies that challenged the divine right of kings with the natural rights of free men.
the french and indian war four european wars affected america between 1689 and 1763 as the british and french joined by their allies fought throughout the world.
early in the french and indian war worried colonies created the albany plan of union which formed an early blueprint for an independent american government.
the seven years war known as the french and indian war 1754 1763 in the colonies eventually was won by the british.
in the treaty of paris in 1763 france lost all its north american possessions britain gained canada and florida and spain acquired the vast louisiana territory.
the indians fought to regain control of their ancestral lands in pontiacs rebellion and great britain weary of war negotiated peace in the royal proclamation of 1763.
british colonial policy after the french and indian war the british government was saddled with an enormous debt.
to reduce that burden prime minister george grenville implemented various taxes to compel colonists to pay for their own defense.
colonists resisted claiming that they could not be taxed by parliament because they were not represented in parliament.
british officials countered that the colonists had virtual representation in parliament since each member was supposed to represent his district as well as the empire as a whole.
colonial reaction to the stamp act of 1765 was the first intimation of real trouble for british authorities.
conflicts between whigs and tories intensified when the townshend acts imposed additional taxes.
the sons of liberty and the daughters of liberty mobilized resistance particularly through boycotts of british goods.

spontaneous resistance led to the boston massacre organized protesters later staged the boston tea party.
the british response to the events in boston called the coercive acts sparked further violence between patriots and loyalists.

pa r t t wo building a nation the signing of the declaration of independence in july 1776 thrilled the rebellious colonists and forced other americans to make a hard choice to remain loyal subjects of king george iii and thus traitors to the new united states of america or to embrace the rebellion and become traitors to great britain.
it was one thing for patriot leaders to declare independence and quite another to win it on the battlefield.
the odds greatly favored the british fewer than half of the colonists were patriots who actively supported the revolution and many others the loyalists fought against it.
the thirteen independent states had new untested governments and general george washington found himself in charge of an inexperienced and poorly equipped army of amateurs facing the worlds greatest military power.
yet the revolutionaries would persevere and prevail.
as a military leader washington proved to be more dogged than brilliant a general famous for his courage and c omposure even in the face of adversity.
he had extensive knowledge of the nations geography and used it to his advantage against the british.
even more important to the revolutionary cause was the decision by the french and later the spanish and dutch to join the war against britain.
the f ranco american military alliance negotiated in 1778 was the decisive turning point in the war.
in 1783 after eight years of sporadic fighting and heavy human and financial losses the british gave up the fight and their american colonies.
while fighting the british the patriots also had to create new governments for themselves.
quite different colonies suddenly became coequal states.
the deeply ingrained resentment of british imperial rule led the americans to give more power to the individual states than to the weak new national government called the confederation.
as thomas jefferson declared virginia is my country such powerful local ties help explain why the articles of confederation the original constitution organizing the thirteen states into a loose confederation provided only minimal national authority when it was finally ratified by the states in 1781.
final power to make and execute laws remained with the states.
after the revolutionary war the flimsy political bonds authorized by the articles of confederation could not meet the needs of the new nation.
this realization led to the calling of the constitutional convention in 1787.
the process of drafting and approving the new constitution generated a heated debate about the respective powers granted to the states and the national government a debate that became the central theme of american political thought.
199 the revolution also helped reshape american society.
what would be the role of women african americans and native americans in the new nation.
how would the different economies of the various regions of the new united states be developed.
who would control access to the vast native american ancestral lands to the west of the original thirteen states.
how would the united states of america relate to the other nations of the world.
these questions gave birth to the first national political parties in the united states.
during the 1790s the federalist party led by george washington john adams and alexander hamilton and the democratic republican party led by thomas jefferson and james madison furiously debated the political and economic future of the new nation.
with jeffersons election as president in 1800 the republicans gained the upper hand in national politics and would remain dominant for the next quarter century.
in the process they presided over a maturing republic that aggressively expanded westward at the expense of the native americans embraced industrial development engaged in a second war with great britain and witnessed growing tensions between north and south over slavery.
the american revolution 1776 1783 the death of general mercer at the battle of princeton ca.
1789 1831 after the american victory at trenton new jersey george washington center on horseback launched a surprise attack on the british at the battle of princeton.
the americans won the battle but one of the casualties was washingtons close friend general hugh mercer bottom whose death created a rallying symbol for the revolution.
f ew europeans thought the upstart american revolutionaries could win a war against the worlds richest and most powerful empire and indeed the americans did lose most of the major battles in the revolutionary war.
but they outlasted the british eventually forcing them to end the war and grant independence to the united states of america.
this stunning result reflected the tenacity of the patriots as well as the difficulties the british faced in fighting a transatlantic war 3 000 miles from home.
it took five to ten weeks for orders from the government in london to reach british commanders in america and often they were out of date by the time they arrived.
the british also had to adjust to the often unorthodox american ways of warfare.
they discovered that patriots were willing to fight at night in the cold in the woods and in the rain and snow.
what began as a war for independence became both a civil war between americans patriots whigs versus loyalists tories joined by their indian allies and a world war involving numerous allied european nations.
the crucial development was the ability of the united states to forge military alliances with france spain and the netherlands all of which were eager to humble great britain and seize its colonies around the world.
those nations provided the revolutionaries with desperately needed money supplies soldiers and warships.
the french and spanish also sent a combined fleet of warships to the english c hannel forcing much of the royal navy to remain at home thus weakening the british effort to blockade american ports.

202 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 l evels local state and national.
after all as the declaration of independence asserted governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed the common people readily took advantage of their new opportunities.
in virginia voters in 1776 elected a new state legislature that as an observer noted was composed of men not quite so well dressed nor so politely educated nor so highly born as had been the case in the past.
mobilizing for war the british empire sent some 35 000 soldiers and half of its huge navy across the atlantic to put down the american rebellion.
the british also hired foreign soldiers mercenaries as some 30 000 germans served in the british armies in america.
most were from the german state of hesse cassel thus they became known to americans as hessians.
the british also recruited american loyalists native americans and african americans to fight on their behalf but there were never as many willing to join them as they had hoped.
further the british faced a formidable challenge in supplying their large army and navy in america.
they initially assumed that there would be enough food for their troops and plenty of forage for their horses in america.
as the war ground on however most of the supplies had to come from britain.
the war in america became terribly expensive and eventually demoralizing to the british people as it dragged on year after year costing more and more in lives and money.
the british government under lord north also never had a consistent war strategy.
initially the british focused on blockading new englands seaports to strangle american commerce.
when that failed british military leaders sought to destroy george washingtons continental army in new york.
despite their initial success in driving the americans out of the city the british commanders failed to pursue and eliminate the retreating continental army.
they next tried to drive a wedge between new england and new york splitting the colonies in two.
that too would fail leading to the final british strategy moving their main army into the southern colonies in hopes of rallying loyalists in the region.
the continental army while the patriots had the advantage of fighting on their home ground they also had to create an army and navy from scratch and with little money to do so.
recruiting supplying equipping training and paying soldiers and sailors were monumental challenges.
before the war citizen soldiers militiamen were primarily civilians summoned from their farms and shops to defend their communities.
once the danger passed the militiamen quickly dispersed and returned to their homes mobilizing for war 203 or farms.
many militiamen were unreliable and ungovernable.
they come in you cannot tell how general washington said in exasperation go you cannot tell when and act you cannot tell where consume your provisions exhaust your stores supplies and leave you at last at a critical moment once the war started washington knew that militiamen alone could not win against veteran british and german soldiers.
he needed a professional army with full time soldiers.
while recruiting fighters general washington was pleased to see that the men from different colonies were developing a national or continental viewpoint in which they thought of themselves as fighting for a new nation not just protecting their particular communities like militiamen.
washington thus decided to call it the continental army.
about half of the 200 000 americans who served in the war were in the continental army.
they were mostly young single relatively poor farmers laborers or indentured servants.
what the continental army needed most at the start of the war were capable officers intensive training modern weapons and multiyear enlistment contracts.
the revolutionary soldiers also needed strict discipline for they had no room for error against the british.
as washington began whipping his new army into shape those who violated the rules were jailed flogged or sent packing.
some deserters were hanged.
many patriots who had not fought in the french and indian war found army life unbearable and combat horrifying.
as general nathanael greene a rhode island quaker who abandoned the pacifism of his religion for the war effort and became washingtons ablest commander pointed out few patriots had ever engaged in mortal combat and they were hard pressed to stand the shocking scenes of war to march over dead men to hear without concern the groans of the wounded desertions grew as the war dragged on.
at times washington could put only a few thousand men in the field.
eventually to recruit more soldiers congress was forced to provide more generous enticements such as land grants and cash bonuses in exchange for recruits agreeing to serve in the continental army for the duration of the war.
problems of finance and supply financing the revolution was much harder for the new american nation than it was for great britain.
lacking the power to impose taxes the confederation congress could only ask the states to provide funds for the national government.
yet the states rarely provided their expected share of the wars expenses and the continental congress reluctantly had to allow the patriot armies to take supplies directly from farmers in return for written promises of future payment.
204 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 in a predominantly agricultural society like america turning farmers into soldiers hurt the national economy.
william hooper a north carolinian who signed the declaration of independence grumbled that a soldier made is a farmer lost in april 1776 the continental congress had ended britains trade regulations by opening american ports to the ships of all nations.
soon however british warships set up blockades around americas major coastal cities.
many states found a ready source of revenue in the sale of abandoned loyalist homes farms and plantations.
nevertheless congress and the states still fell short of funding the wars cost and were forced to print more and more paper money which eroded its value.
at the start of the fighting there george washington at princeton commissioned for independence were no uniforms for the soldiers and hall in philadelphia this 1779 painting sailors and weapons were as variby charles willson peale portrays ous as their costumes most weapons washington as the hero of the battle of and ammunition were acquired either princeton.
by capturing british supplies or by importing them from france a government all too glad to help the patriots fight its arch enemy.
native americans and the revolution both the british and americans recruited indians to fight with them but the british were far more successful largely because they had longstanding relationships with chieftains and they promised to protect indian lands.
the peoples making up the iroquois league split their allegiances with most mohawks onondagas cayugas and senecas led by mohawk joseph brant and seneca old smoke joining the british and most oneidas and tuscaroras supporting the patriots.
the cherokees also joined the british in hopes of driving out american settlers who had taken their lands.
most indians in new england tried to remain neutral or sided with the patriots.
the stockbridge indians in massachusetts mostly mahicans formed mobilizing for war 205 a company of minutemen who fought alongside patriot units.
they pledged that wherever your armies go there we will go you shall always find us by your side and if providence calls us to sacrifice our lives in the field of battle we will fall where you fall and lay our bones by yours yet however much the british or americans claimed native americans as allies most indians engaged in the war as a means of protecting themselves and their own interests.
disaster in canada in july 1775 the continental congress authorized an ill planned military expedition in canada against quebec in the vain hope of rallying support among the french canadians.
one patriot detachment under general richard montgomery a former british army officer headed toward quebec by way of lake champlain along the new york canadian border another under general benedict arnold struggled westward toward quebec through the dense maine woods.
the americans arrived outside quebec in september tired exhausted and hungry.
a silent killer then ambushed them smallpox.
as the deadly virus raced through the american camp general montgomery faced a brutal dilemma.
most of his soldiers had signed up for short tours of duty and many were scheduled for discharge at the end of the year.
because of the impending departure of his men montgomery could not afford to wait until spring for the smallpox to subside.
seeing little choice but to fight he ordered an attack on the british forces defending quebec during a blizzard on december 31 1775.
the american assault was a disaster.
montgomery was killed early in the battle and benedict arnold was seriously wounded.
more than 400 americans were taken prisoner.
the rest of the patriot force retreated to its camp outside the walled city and appealed to the continental congress for reinforcements.
smallpox spread throughout the american army and arnold warned george washington in february 1776 that the runaway disease would soon bring the entire ruin of the army the british sensing weakness attacked the american camp and sent the ragtag patriots on a frantic retreat up the st lawrence river to the american held city of montreal and eventually back to new york and new england.
by the summer of 1776 the american revolutionaries had come to realize that their quest for independence would be neither short nor easy for the king and parliament were determined to smash the revolt and restore their empire.
george washington confessed to his brother that his efforts to form an effective american army out of the great mixture of troops were filled with difficulties and distresses most of the new england soldiers farmers sailors fishermen and a few former s laves were he said an exceeding ly 206 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 dirty and nasty people units from pennsylvania washington added did not know more of a rifle than my horse washingtons narrow escape on july 2 1776 the day the continental congress voted for independence a huge army of british redcoats came ashore on undefended staten island across new york citys harbor from manhattan.
by late august two thirds of the entire british army veterans of many campaigns around the world were camped on staten island.
they were the first wave in an effort to end the war quickly with a decisive victory.
for the next several weeks while more ships supplies and troops landed and prepared for action general william howe and his older brother admiral richard howe both of whom sympathized with american grievances but felt strongly that the rebellion must be put down met with patriot leaders in an effort to negotiate a settlement of the revolution.
their orders from london told them to make peace if possible and then wage war if peace was out of the question after the negotiations failed on august 22 1776 a massive british fleet of 427 ships carrying 32 000 troops including 8 000 hired german soldiers began landing on long island near new york city.
it was the largest seaborne military expedition in history to that point.
i could not believe my eyes recalled a pennsylvania militiaman.
i declare that i thought all london was afloat meanwhile george washington after ousting the british from boston had moved his forces to defensive positions around new york city in february 1776.
he still struggled to raise an army powerful enough to match the british.
during the winter and spring he could gather only about 19 000 poorly trained militiamen and recruits.
nor did he have any warships to defend a city surrounded by rivers and bays.
it was too small a force to defend new york from the expected british invasion but the continental congress insisted that the strategic city be defended.
as john adams explained new york was the key to the whole continent although a veteran of frontier fighting washington had never commanded a large force or supervised artillery cannon units.
as he confessed to the continental congress he had no experience to move armies on a large scale and had only limited.
in military matters washington was still learning the art of generalship and the british invasion of new york taught him some costly and painful lessons.
the new american army suffered a humiliating defeat at the battle of long island as the british invaders perfectly executed their assault.
an american mobilizing for war 207 officer noted that the fighting on long island was nothing but fright disgrace and confusion as general washington watched the british advance he sighed good god.
what brave fellows i must this day lose in the face of steadily advancing ranks of british soldiers with bayonet tipped muskets many of the untested american defenders and their officers panicked.
the smoke and chaos of battle disoriented the patriots.
over the next week of intense fighting the confused disorganized undisciplined and indecisive americans steadily gave ground.
only a timely rainstorm and heroic efforts by experienced boatmen enabled the retreating americans to cross the harbor from brooklyn to manhattan during the night of august 29.
had howes british army moved more quickly in pursuing the retreating patriots it could have trapped washingtons entire force and ended the revolution.
but the british rested as the main american army joined by patriot civilians made a miraculous escape from manhattan over the next several weeks.
they crossed the hudson river and retreated with furious urgency into new jersey and then over the delaware river into eastern pennsylvania.
a new jersey resident reported that the retreating americans marched two abreast looked ragged some without a shoe to their feet and most of them wrapped in blankets thousands had been captured during the new york campaign and hundreds more deserted eager to go home ahead of their british pursuers.
general washington was wearied almost to death by one of the greatest chases in military history as the ragged remnants of his army outraced their british pursuers over 170 miles in two months.
in one thing only did the british fail reported an observer they could not run as fast as their foe a british general predicted a quick victory in the war.
the americans he claimed would never again stand before us in the field.
everything seems to be over with them the situation was bleak in the fall of 1776.
new york city became the headquarters of both the royal navy and the british army.
local loyalists tories in new york city and new jersey excitedly welcomed the british occupation.
hundreds in this colony are against us a new york city patriot wrote to john adams.
tories openly express their sentiments in favor of the enemy by december 1776 the american revolution was near collapse.
a british officer reported that many rebels were without shoes or stockings and several were observed to have only linen drawers.
without any proper shirt.
they must suffer extremely in the winter weather.
indeed the continental army was shrinking before washingtons eyes.
he had only 3 000 men left by christmas.
unless a new army could be raised quickly he warned i think the game is pretty near up 208 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 then almost miraculously help emerged from an unexpected source the english born war correspondent thomas paine.
having opened the eventful year of 1776 with his inspiring pamphlet common sense paine now composed the american crisis in which he wrote these stirring lines these are the times that try mens souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
tyranny like hell is not easily conquered.
yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph.
paines rousing pamphlet boosted patriot morale.
out of the disastrous defeat came major changes in the way the continental congress managed the war.
on december 27 1776 it gave general washington large powers to strengthen the war effort including the ability to offer army recruits cash land clothing and blankets.
in december 1776 general william howe commander in chief of the british forces decided that the war with america was all but won.
he then casually settled down with his flashing blonde loyalist mistress twenty five year old elizabeth loring the wife of a new england tory to wait out the winter in new york city.
eighteenth century armies rarely fought during the thomas paines common sense thomas paines inspiring pamphlet was originally published anonymously because the british viewed it as treasonous.
mobilizing for war 209 winter months.
one american general concluded that howe shut his eyes fought his battles drank his bottle and had his little whore a desperate gamble george washington however was not ready to hibernate for the winter.
the morale of his men and the hopes of the nation he decided required some brilliant stroke of good news after the devastating defeats around new york city.
so the normally cautious washington grew bold out of necessity launching a desperate gamble to achieve a much needed victory before more of his soldiers decided to leave the army and return home.
on christmas night 1776 washington led some 2 400 men packed into forty foot long boats from pennsylvania across the icy delaware into new jersey.
a blizzard of sleet and snow helped cloak their movements on the frigid night.
near dawn at trenton the americans surprised 1 500 sleeping hessians attacking them from three sides.
an american sergeant said his blood chilld to see such horror and distress blood mingling together the dying groans.
the sight was too much to bear the battle of trenton was a total rout from which only 500 hessians escaped.
just two of washingtons men were killed.
the american commander had been in the thick of the battle urging his men forward press on.
press on boys a week later general washington and the americans again crossed the delaware and won another battle in new jersey at princeton before taking shelter at morristown in the hills of northern new jersey.
a british officer muttered that the americans had become a formidable enemy the surprising victories at princeton and trenton saved the cause of independence and shifted the wars momentum as a fresh wave of inspired americans signed up to serve in washingtons army.
a british officer recognized that the victories at trenton and princeton would revive the dropping spirits of the rebels and increase their force the military successes in new jersey also revived patriot confidence in george washingtons leadership.
british war correspondents claimed that he was more talented than any of their own commanders.
yet although the dark days of the autumn of 1776 were over unexpected challenges quickly chilled the patriots excitement.
winter in morristown during the record cold winter in early 1777 george washingtons ragged army again nearly disintegrated as s ix month enlistment contracts expired and deserters fled the hardships caused by the brutal weather inadequate food and widespread disease.

31p0xrebellion 40p0 american society at war 211 smallpox and other diseases continued to cause more casualties among the american armies than combat.
by 1777 washington had come to view smallpox with greater dread than the sword of the enemy on any given day a fourth of the american troops were deemed unfit for duty usually because of smallpox.
the threat was so great that in early 1777 washington ordered a mass inoculation which he managed to keep secret from the british.
inoculating an entire army was a risky undertaking in the eighteenth century but it paid off.
the successful inoculation of the american army marks one of washingtons greatest strategic accomplishments of the war.
only about 1 000 patriots stayed with washington through the brutal morristown winter.
with the spring thaw however recruits began arriving to claim the bounty of 20 and 100 acres of land offered by congress to those who would enlist for three years or for the duration of the conflict if less.
having cobbled together some 9 000 regular troops washington began skirmishing with the british forces in northern new jersey.
a strategy of evasion general howe had been making his own plans however and so had other british officers.
howe hoped to maneuver the american army into fighting a single decisive action that the superior british forces would surely win and thereby end the war in one glorious engagement.
george washington however refused to take the bait.
the fighting around new york city had shown him that his outmanned army almost certainly could not defeat the british in a large open battle.
the only way to beat them he decided was to evade the main british army carefully select when and where to attack and in the end wear down the enemy forces and their will to fight on.
washington was willing to concede control of major cities like new york to the british for it was his army not defenseless towns that they have to subdue so the americans in the revolution did not have to win large battles they simply had to avoid losing the war.
britain on the other hand could win only by destroying the american will to resist.
with each passing year it became more difficult and expensive for the british to supply their large army and navy in america.
over time the british government and people would tire of the human and financial toll of conducting a prolonged war across the atlantic.
american society at war the revolution was as much a ruthless civil war among americans including the native american peoples allied with both sides as it was a prolonged struggle against great britain.
the necessity of choosing sides divided families and friends towns and cities.
212 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 benjamin franklins illegitimate son william for example was the royal governor of new jersey.
an ardent loyalist he sided with great britain in the war.
his patriot father later removed him from his will.
similarly eighteen year old bostonian lucy flucker defied her loyalist fathers wishes and married bookseller henry knox in 1774.
knox would become an american general.
lucys estranged family fled with the british army when it left boston in 1776 and she never saw them again.
i have lost my father mother brother and sister entirely lost them she wrote.
the colonists were generally divided into three groups patriots who formed the continental army and fought in state militias loyalists or tories as the patriots mockingly called them and a less committed middle group that sought to remain neutral but were eventually swayed by the better organized and more energetic patriots.
loyalists may have represented 20 percent of the american population but patriots were the largest of the three groups.
some americans like benedict arnold switched sides during the war.
both the patriots and the british once they took control of a city or community would often require the residents to swear an oath of loyalty to their cause.
in pennsylvania patriots tied a rope around the neck of john stevens a loyalist and dragged him behind a canoe in the susquehanna river because he refused to sign a loyalty oath.
where the patriots rejected the monarchy the loyalists whom george washington called abominable pests of society viewed the revolution as an act of treason.
the british empire they felt was much more likely than an independent america to protect them from foreign foes and enable them to prosper.
loyalists were most numerous in the seaport cities especially new york city and philadelphia as well as the carolinas but they came from all walks of life.
governors judges and other royal officials were almost all loyalists most anglican ministers also preferred the mother country as did many anglican worshippers.
in the backcountry of new york and across the carolinas many small farmers who had largely been unaffected by the controversies over british efforts to tighten colonial regulations rallied to the british side.
more new york men joined loyalist regiments than the continental army.
many loyalists calculated that the revolution would fail or feared that it would result in mob rule.
in few places however were there enough loyalists to assume control without the support of british troops.
the loyalists did not want to dissolve the political bands with britain as the declaration of independence demanded.
instead as some 700 of them in new york city said in a petition to british officials they steadily and uniformly opposed this most unnatural unprovoked rebellion jacob bailey american society at war 213 four soldiers ca.

of massachusetts dismissed the patriots as a set of surly savage beings who have power in their hands and murder in their hearts in few places however were there enough loyalists to assume control of areas or communities without the presence of british troops.
the british were repeatedly frustrated by both the failure of loyalists to materialize in strength and the collapse of loyalist militia units once british troops departed.
because patriot militias quickly returned whenever the british left an area any loyalists in the region faced a difficult choice either accompany the british and leave behind their property or stay and face the wrath of the patriots.
even more disheartening was what one british officer called the licentiousness of the loyalist troops who committed every species of rapine and plunder and thereby converted potential friends to enemies.
the patriots both moderates and radicals supported the war because they realized that the only way to protect their liberty was to separate themselves from british control.
patriots also wanted to establish an american republic a unique form of government that would convert them from being subjects of a king to being citizens in a republic with the power to elect their own government and pursue their own economic interests.
we have it in our power wrote thomas paine to begin the world over again.
the birthday of a new world is at hand 214 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 setbacks for the british 1777 in 1777 a carefully conceived but poorly executed british plan to defeat the american rebellion involved a three pronged assault on the state of new york.
by gaining control of that important state the british planned to split america in two cutting off new england from the rest of the colonies.
the complicated plan called for a british army based in canada and led by general john burgoyne to advance southward from quebec via lake champlain to the hudson river.
at the same time another british force would move eastward from oswego in western new york.
general william howe meanwhile would lead a third british army up the hudson river from new york city.
all three advancing armies would eventually converge in central new york and wipe out any remaining patriot resistance.
the three british armies however failed in their e xecution and in their communications with one another.
at the last minute howe changed his mind and decided to move his army south from new york city to attack the patriot capital philadelphia.
general washington withdrew most of his men from new jersey to meet the british threat in pennsylvania while other american units banded together in upstate new york to deal with the british threat there.
on september 11 1777 at brandywine creek southwest of philadelphia the british overpowered washingtons army and occupied philadelphia then the largest and wealthiest american city.
the members of the continental congress were forced to flee the city.
battered but still intact washington and his army withdrew to winter quarters twenty miles away at valley forge while howe and his men remained in the relative comfort of philadelphia.
general john burgoyne commander of britains northern forces.
burgoyne and most of his troops surrendered to the americans at saratoga on october 17 1777 the campaign of 1777 meanwhile in northern new york a second british army had stumbled into an american trap.
in june an overconfident general burgoyne nicknamed setbacks for the british 1777 215 general swagger had led his mistress and 7 000 soldiers southward from canada toward new yorks lake champlain.
the american commander in northern new york was general horatio gates.
thirty two years earlier in 1745 he and burgoyne had served as officers in the same british regiment.
now they were commanding opposing armies.
as burgoynes army pushed deeper into new york it became harder to get food and supplies from canada.
short of wagons and carts the advance slowed to a snails pace in the dense forests and swamps thereby allowing the americans to spring a trap.
the outnumbered but more mobile patriots had the benefit of fighting in familiar territory.
they inflicted two serious defeats on the british forces in august 1777.
at oriskany on august 6 patriot militiamen mostly local german american farmers and their indian allies withstood an ambush by loyalists and indians and gained time for patriot reinforcements to arrive at nearby fort stanwix which had been besieged by british soldiers.
when the british demanded the forts surrender general gates rejected the offer with disdain saying that the fort would be defended to the last extremity as the days passed the iroquois deserted the british army leading the british commander to order a withdrawal.
as a result the strategic mohawk valley running across central new york was secured by the patriot forces.
to the east at bennington vermont on august 16 new england militiamen led by colonel john stark decimated a detachment of hessians and loyalists.
stark had pledged that morning well beat them before night or molly stark will be a widow as patriot militiamen converged from across central new york burgoyne pulled his dispirited forces back to the village of saratoga near the hudson river.
in the ensuing t hree week long battles of saratoga gatess army surrounded the british forces cutting off their supply lines.
desperate for food and ammunition the british failed twice to break through the encircling americans.
thus ended all our hopes of victory noted a british officer.
the trapped burgoyne surrendered on october 17 1777 turning over 5 800 troops 7 000 muskets and forty two brass cannons to gates.
in london king george fell into agonies on hearing the account of burgoynes defeat.
william pitt the former british prime minister made a shocking prediction to parliament after the defeat you cannot conquer america alliance with france the surprising american victory at saratoga was a strategic turning point because it convinced the french who had lost four wars to the british in the previous eighty years to sign two crucial treaties that created an american alliance with france.
216 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 under the treaty of amity and commerce france officially recognized the new united states and offered important trading privileges to american ships.
under the treaty of alliance both parties agreed first that if france entered the war both countries would fight until american independence was won second that neither would conclude a truce or peace without the formal consent of the other and third that each would guarantee the others possessions in america from the present time and forever against all other powers france further agreed not to seek canada or other british possessions on the mainland of north america.
in the end the intervention of the french army and navy determined the outcome of the war.
the americans would also form important alliances with the spanish 1779 and the dutch 1781 but neither provided as much support as the french.
after the british defeat at saratoga and the news of the french alliance with the united states parliament tried to end the war by granting all the demands that the americans had made before they declared independence.
but the continental congress would not negotiate until britain officially recognized american independence and withdrew its military forces.
king george refused.
1778 both sides regroup valley forge and stalemate for george washingtons army at valley forge near philadelphia the winter of 1777 1778 was a time of intense suffering and unrelenting cold hunger and disease.
some soldiers lacked shoes and blankets and their makeshift l og and mud huts offered little protection from the chilling winds.
by february 7 000 troops were too ill for duty.
more than 2 500 soldiers died at valley forge another 1 000 deserted.
fifty officers resigned on one december day and several hundred more left before winters end.
desperate for relief washington sent troops across new jersey delaware and the eastern shore of maryland to confiscate horses cattle and hogs in exchange for receipts promising future payment.
by march 1778 the troops at valley forge saw their strength restored.
their improved health enabled washington to begin a rigorous training program.
because few of the american officers had any formal military training their troops lacked leadership discipline and skills.
to remedy this defect washington turned to an energetic prussian soldier of fortune friedrich wilhelm baron von steuben who used an interpreter and frequent profanity to instruct the troops in the fundamentals of close order drill.
1778 both sides regroup 217 valley forge during the harsh winter of 1777 1778 washingtons army battled starvation disease and freezing temperatures.
steuben was one of several foreign volunteers who joined the american army at valley forge.
another was a n ineteen year old red haired french orphan named gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette.
a wealthy idealist excited by the american cause i was crazy with desire to wear a uniform he said lafayette offered to serve in the continental army for no pay in exchange for being named a general.
washington was initially skeptical of the young french aristocrat but lafayette soon became the commander in chief s most trusted aide.
washington noted that lafayette possessed a large share of bravery and military ardor the young french general also proved to be an able diplomat in helping to forge the military alliance with france there are forty cities seven counties and a private college named for lafayette across the united states.
the continental armys morale rose when the continental congress promised extra pay and bonuses after the war and it rose again with the news of the military alliance with france.

in addition to the main conflict between armies in the east a frontier guerrilla war of terror and vengeance pitted indians and loyalists against isolated patriot settlers along the northern and western frontiers.
in the ohio valley as well as western new york and pennsylvania the british urged frontier loyalists and their indian allies to raid farm settlements and offered to pay bounties for american scalps.

clarks rugged frontiersmen called rangers captured five indians carrying american scalps.
clark ordered his men to kill the indians in sight of the fort.
after watching the terrible executions the british surrendered.
while clarks rangers were in the indiana territory a much larger u s military force moved against iroquois strongholds in western new york where loyalists tories and their indian allies had been terrorizing frontier settlements.
these iroquois attacks led by mohawk chief joseph brant had killed hundreds of patriot militiamen.
in response george washington sent 4 000 men under general john sullivan to crush the hostile tribes and the most mischievous of the tories at newton new york on august 29 1779 sullivans soldiers destroyed about 220 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 forty seneca and cayuga villages which broke the power of the iroquois confederacy for all time.

his daughter was captured and another brother was wounded four times.
in early 1776 a delegation of northern i ndians shawnees delawares and mohawks had talked the cherokees into attacking frontier settlements in virginia and the carolinas.
swift retaliation had followed as carolina militiamen led by andrew pickens burned dozens of cherokee villages.
by weakening the major indian tribes along the frontier the american revolution cleared the way for white settlers to seize indian lands after the war.
the war moves south in late 1778 the british launched their southern strategy built on the assumption that large numbers of loyalists in the carolinas virginia and georgia would join the british cause.
once the british gained control of the southern colonies they would have the shrinking united states pinched between canada and a british controlled south.
in december 1778 general sir henry clinton the new commander in chief of british forces in america sent 3 000 redcoats hessians and loyalists to take the port city of savannah on the southeast georgia coast and roll northeast from there.
the plan was to enlist support from local loyalists and the cherokees led by chief dragging canoe who promised to leave the ground dark and bloody british momentum initially clintons southern strategy worked.
within twenty months the british and their allies had defeated three american armies seized the strategic port cities of savannah and charleston south carolina occupied georgia and much of south carolina and killed wounded or captured some 7 000 american soldiers.
the success of the southern campaign led lord george germain the british official in london overseeing the war to predict a speedy and happy termination of the american war germains optimistic prediction however fell victim to three developments first the loyalist strength in the south was weaker than estimated second the british effort to unleash indian attacks convinced many undecided backcountry settlers to join the patriot side and third some british and loyalist soldiers behaved so harshly that they drove loyalists to switch sides.
war in the carolinas the carolina campaign took a major turn when british forces led brilliantly by generals clinton and charles 222 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 ornwallis bottled up an entire american army on the charleston peninsula.
c benjamin lincoln the u s commander begged local planters to arm their slaves and let them join the defense of the city but the slaveholders refused.
prominent south carolina leaders then used their control of local militia units to prevent lincoln and his continental army from escaping the british invasion.
on may 12 1780 general lincoln surrendered charleston and its 5 500 defenders.
it was the single greatest patriot loss of the war.
soon thereafter general cornwallis in charge of the british troops in the south defeated a much larger american force led by general horatio gates at camden south carolina.
cornwallis had georgia and most of south carolina under british control by 1780.
then he made a tactical blunder by sending lieutenants into the carolina countryside to organize loyalist fighters to root out patriots.
in doing so they mercilessly burned homes and hacked to death surrendering rebels.
their behavior alienated many poor rural folk who had been neutral.
francis kinlock a loyalist warned a british official that the lower sort of people who were in many parts.
originally attached to the british government have suffered so severely and been so frequently deceived that great britain now has a hundred enemies where it had one before in mid 1780 small bands of patriots based in the swamps and forests of south carolina launched a successful series of h it and run raids.
led by colorful fighters such as francis marion the swamp fox and thomas sumter the carolina gamecock the patriot guerrillas gradually wore down british confidence and morale.
by august 1780 the british commanders were forced to admit that south carolina was in an absolute state of rebellion against them.
warfare in the carolinas was especially brutal.
patriots fought loyalists who were neighbors of each other.
both sides looted farms and plantations and tortured scalped and executed prisoners.
families were fractured by divided loyalties.
fathers fought sons and brothers killed brothers.
edward lacey a young south carolina patriot who commanded a militia unit had to tie his tory father to a bedstead to prevent him from informing the british of his whereabouts.
chilling violence occurred on both sides.
in virginia the planter charles lynch set up vigilante courts to punish loyalists by lynching them which in this case meant whipping them.
others were tarred and feathered.
in the carolinas and georgia british army commanders encouraged their poorly disciplined loyalist allies to wage a s corched earth war of terror arson and intimidation.
in a civil war the british general charles 1778 both sides regroup 223 ornwallis declared there is no admitting of neutral characteristics he c urged his commanders to use the most vigorous measures to extinguish the rebellion tory militiamen took civilian hostages assaulted women and children burned houses and churches stole property bayoneted wounded patriots and tortured and executed unarmed prisoners.
vengeful patriots responded in kind.
when georgia loyalist thomas burnfoot brown refused to join the revolutionary side a mob of patriots bludgeoned him took his scalp tarred his legs and then held his feet over a fire costing him several toes.
brown thereafter conducted a personal war of vengeance.
after a battle near augusta georgia brown ordered loyalists to hang thirteen patriot prisoners from a staircase banister.
the battle of kings mountain cornwalliss two most c old blooded cavalry officers sir banastre tarleton and major patrick ferguson who were in charge of training loyalist militiamen eventually overreached themselves.
the british officers often let their men burn patriot farms liberate slaves and destroy livestock.
major ferguson sealed his doom when he threatened to march over the blue ridge mountains hang the mostly s cots irish presbyterian patriot leaders backwater barbarians and destroy their frontier farms.
instead the feisty overmountain men from southwestern virginia and western north and south carolina including tennesseans all of them experienced hunters and riflemen who had often fought cherokees went hunting for ferguson and his army of carolina loyalists in late september 1780.
on october 7 the two sides clashed near kings mountain a heavily wooded ridge along the border between north carolina and south carolina.
in a ferocious h our long battle patriot sharpshooters told by an officer to shout like hell and fight like devils devastated the loyalist troops.
major ferguson had boasted beforehand that all the rebels in hell could not push him off kings mountain.
by the end of the battle his lifeless body was riddled with seven bullet holes.
seven hundred loyalists were captured twenty five of whom were later hanged.
the division among the people is much greater than i imagined an american officer wrote to one of general washingtons aides.
the patriots and loyalists he said persecute each other with.
savage fury as with so many confrontations during the war in the south the battle of kings mountain resembled an extended family feud.
seventy four sets of brothers fought on opposite sides and twenty nine sets of fathers and sons.
224 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 after the battle patriot captain james withrow refused to help his loyalist brother in law who had been badly wounded and left him to die on the battlefield.
when withrows wife learned how her husband had treated her brother she asked for a separation.
five brothers in the goforth family from rutherford county north carolina fought at kings mountain three were loyalists two were patriots.
only one of them survived.
two of the brothers preston and john preston fighting on opposite sides recognized each other during the battle took deadly aim as if in a duel and fired simultaneously killing each other.
the american victory in the battle of kings mountain was crucial because it undermined the british strategy in the south.
thomas jefferson later said that the battle was the turn of the tide of success after kings mountain the british forces under cornwallis were forced to retreat to south carolina and found it virtually impossible to recruit more loyalists.

greene arrived in charlotte north carolina to find himself in charge of a shadow army the 2 200 troops lacked everything necessary either for the comfort or convenience of soldiers greene wrote general washington that the situation was dismal and truly distressing yet he also knew that if he could not create a victorious army the whole south would be re annexed to britain.
like washington greene adopted a h it and run strategy.
from charlotte he moved his army eastward while sending general daniel morgan one of the heroes of the battles of saratoga a h eavy drinking fist fighting wagonmaster with about 700 riflemen on a sweep to the west of cornwalliss headquarters at winnsboro south carolina.
on january 17 1781 morgans force took up positions near cowpens an area of cattle pastures in northern south carolina about t wenty five miles from kings mountain.
there he lured sir banastre tarletons army into an elaborate trap.
tarleton known for his bravery but hated for his brutality rushed his men forward running at us as if they intended to eat us up only to be ambushed by morgans cavalry.
tarleton escaped but 110 british soldiers were killed and more than 700 were taken prisoner.
cowpens was the most complete victory for the american side in the revolution and was one of the few times that patriots won a battle in which a war of endurance 225 the two sides were evenly matched.
when general cornwallis learned of the american victory he was so furiously disappointed that he snapped his ceremonial sword in two saying that the news broke my heart after the victory at cowpens morgans army moved into north carolina and linked up with greenes troops.
greene lured cornwalliss starving british army north then attacked the redcoats at guilford courthouse near what became greensboro north carolina on march 15 1781.
the americans lost the battle of guilford courthouse but inflicted such heavy losses that cornwallis left behind his wounded and marched his weary men toward wilmington on the north carolina coast to lick their wounds and take on supplies from british ships.
the british commander reported that the americans had fought like demons greene then resolved to go back into south carolina hoping to lure cornwallis after him or force the british to give up the state.
greene connected with local guerrilla bands led by francis marion andrew pickens and thomas sumter.
by targeting outlying british units and picking them off one by one the guerrillas eventually forced the british back into charleston and savannah.
george washington praised greene for having done great things with little means a war of endurance during 1780 the revolutionary war became a contest of endurance and the americans held the advantage in time men and supplies.
they knew they could outlast the british as long as they avoided a catastrophic defeat.
we fight get beat rise and fight again general greene said.
the virginia campaign by september 1781 the americans had narrowed british control in the south to charleston and savannah although local patriots and loyalists would continue to battle each other for more than a year in the backcountry where there was nothing but murder and devastation in every quarter greene said.
meanwhile cornwallis had pushed his army northward from wilmington.
before the carolinas could be subdued he had decided that virginia must be eliminated as a source of american reinforcements and supplies.
in may 1781 the british marched into virginia.
there benedict arnold the former american general whom the british had bribed to switch sides in the war was eager to strike at the americans.
arnold had earlier plotted to sell out his former american command of west point a critically important 226 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 major campaigns in the south 1778 1781 american forces petersburg british forces battle site n 100 kilometers so hillsborough 100 miles guilford courthouse er gu f ga n g north carolina ne ree r mo charlotte sav an c na h ri ve r south carolina or nw lincoln georgia is camden a ll i wilmington s n winnsboro l al e ta r l to 1 s te ga kings mountain w rn co cowpens cornwallis 1781 virginia s c li n ton d an li al nw r co charleston savannah r ve altama ha ri atlantic ocean east florida british why did the british suddenly shift their military campaign to the south in 1778.

as long as the british navy maintained suprem15p5 x15p5 acy along the coast the americans could not hope to win the war.
in may 1781 however the elements for a combined f rench american action suddenly fell into place.
as cornwalliss army moved into virginia washington persuaded the commander of the french army in rhode island to join in an attack on the british in new york city.
before they could strike however word came from the caribbean that admiral f ranois joseph paul de grasse was headed for the chesapeake bay with his large fleet of french warships and some 3 000 soldiers.
the u nexpected news led general washington to change his strategy.
he immediately began moving his army briskly south toward yorktown.
at the same time french ships slipped out of the british blockade at newport and also headed south.
somehow in an age when communications were difficult the french and americans coordinated a complex plan to join naval and army forces and destroy the main british army.
success depended on the french fleet getting to the chesapeake bay off the coast of virginia before the british navy did.
on august 30 admiral de grasses t wenty four warships won the race to yorktown and french troops landed to join the americans.
on september 6 the day after a british fleet appeared de grasse attacked and forced the british navy to abandon cornwalliss surrounded army leaving him with no way to get fresh food and supplies.
de grasse then sent ships up the chesapeake to ferry down the soldiers who were marching south from new york 228 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 surrender of lord cornwallis the artist john trumball completed his painting of the pivotal british surrender at yorktown in 1781.

the battle of yorktown began on september 28.
the american and french troops soon closed off cornwalliss last escape route and began bombarding the british with cannons.
they held out for three grim weeks before running out of food and suffering from widespread disease.
on october 17 1781 a glum cornwallis surrendered.
two days later the british forces marched out and laid down their weapons.
cornwallis himself claimed to be too ill to participate.
his report to the british commander in chief in new york was painfully brief i have the mortification to inform your excellency that i have been forced to surrender the troops under my command among cornwalliss surrendered army were five of thomas jeffersons former slaves and two owned by george washington.
the treaty of paris 1783 the war was not yet over.
the british still controlled new york city charleston and savannah and british ships still blockaded other american ports but any lingering british hopes of a military victory vanished at yorktown.
in a war of endurance 229 london lord north reacted to the news as if he had taken a ball bullet in the breast the shaken prime minister exclaimed oh god it is all over in december 1781 king george decided against sending more troops to america.
on february 27 1782 parliament voted to begin negotiations to end the war and on march 20 lord north resigned.

31p0 x 31p0 230 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 a negotiated peace upon learning of the british decision to negotiate the continental congress named a group of prominent americans to go to paris to discuss terms with the british.
they included john adams who was then representing the united states in the netherlands john jay minister ambassador to spain and benjamin franklin already in france.
the cranky john adams was an odd choice since as thomas jefferson said he hates benjamin franklin he hates john jay he hates the french he american commissioners of the preliminary hates the english in the end franklin peace negotiations with great britain an and jay did most of the work leading to unfinished painting from 1782 by benjamin west.

franklin henry laurens and franklins the negotiations dragged on for grandson william temple franklin.
months until on september 3 1783 the treaty of paris was finally signed.
its provisions were surprisingly favorable to the united states.
great britain recognized the independence of the thirteen former colonies a nd surprisingly agreed that the mississippi river was americas western boundary thereby more than doubling the territory of the new nation.
the boundaries of the united states created by the treaty covered some 900 000 square miles most of which were west of the proclamation line of 1763 a vast region long inhabited by indians and often referred to as trans appalachia.
native americans were given no role in the negotiations and they were by far the biggest losers in the final treaty.
the treatys unclear references to americas northern and southern borders would be a source of dispute for years.
florida as it turned out passed back to spain from britain.
as for the prewar debts owed by americans to british merchants the u s negotiators promised that british merchants should meet with no legal impediment in seeking to collect money owed them.
war as an engine of change like all major wars the american war for independence had unexpected effects on political economic and social life.
the long war upset traditional social relationships and affected the lives of people who had long been dis war as an engine of change 231 criminated a gainst african americans women and indians.
in important ways then the revolution was an engine for political experimentation and social change.
it ignited a prolonged debate about what new forms of government would best serve the new american republic.
republican ideology american revolutionaries embraced a republican ideology instead of the aristocratic or monarchical outlook that had long dominated europe.
the new american republic was not a democracy in the purest sense of the word.
in ancient greece the athenians had practiced direct democracy which meant that citizens voted on all major decisions affecting them.
the new united states however was technically roperty holding white men governed a representative democracy in which p themselves through the concept of republicanism whereby they elected representatives or legislators to make key decisions on their behalf.
as thomas paine observed representative democracy had many advantages over monarchies one of which was greater transparency whatever are its excellencies and defects they are visible to all to preserve the delicate balance between liberty and power in the new republic revolutionary leaders believed that they must protect the rights of individuals and states from being violated by the national government.
the war for independence thus sparked a wave of new state constitutions that remains unique in history.
not only was a new nation coming into being as a result of the revolutionary war but new s tate level governments were also being created all of which were designed to reflect the principles of the republican ideology limiting the powers of government so as to protect the rights of the people.
state governments most of the political experimentation between 1776 and 1787 occurred at the state level in the form of written constitutions in which the people granted limited authority to their governments.
the first state constitutions created state governments during the war of independence much like the colonial governments but with elected governors and senates instead of royally appointed governors and councils.
most of the constitutions also included a bill of rights that protected freedom of speech trial by jury freedom from self incrimination and the like.
most also limited the powers of governors and strengthened the powers of the legislatures.
the articles of confederation once the colonies had declared their independence in 1776 the patriots needed to form a national government as well.
before march 1781 the continental congress had exercised emergency powers without any legal or official authority.
232 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 plans for a permanent form of government emerged quickly.
as early as july 1776 a committee appointed by the continental congress had produced a draft constitution called the articles of confederation and perpetual union.
when the articles of confederation finally were ratified in march 1781 they essentially legalized the way things had been operating since independence had been declared.
the confederation government reflected the long standing fears of monarchy by not allowing for a president or chief executive.
in the confederation government congress was given full power over foreign affairs and disputes between the states.
but it had no national courts and no power to enforce its resolutions and ordinances.
it could not levy taxes and its budgetary needs depended on requisitions from the states which state legislatures often ignored.
the states were in no mood to create a strong central government.
the confederation congress in fact had less power than the colonists had once accepted in the british parliament because it could not regulate interstate and foreign commerce.
for certain important acts moreover a special majority in the confederation congress was required.
nine states had to approve measures dealing with war treaties coinage finances and the army and navy.
unanimous approval from the states was needed both to impose tariffs often called duties or taxes on imports and to amend the articles.
for all its weaknesses however the confederation government represented the most practical structure for the new nation.
after all the revolution on the battlefields had yet to be won and an america besieged by british armies and warships could not risk divisive debates over the distribution of power.
the new state governments were not willing in 1776 to create a strong national government that might threaten their liberties.
expansion of political participation the new political opportunities afforded by the creation of state governments led more ordinary citizens to participate than ever before.
property qualifications for voting which already allowed an overwhelming majority of white men to vote were lowered after 1776 as a result of the revolutionary fervor.
as a group of farmers explained no man can be free and independent unless he possesses a voice.
in the most important officers in the legislature in pennsylvania delaware north carolina and georgia any male taxpayer could vote regardless of how much if any property they owned.
farmers tradesmen and shopkeepers were soon elected to state legislatures.
in general a higher percentage of american males could vote in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century than could their counterparts in great britain.
the social revolution 233 the social revolution what did the revolution mean to those workers servants farmers and freed slaves who participated.
many hoped that the revolution would remove not reinforce the elites traditional political and social advantages.
wealthy patriots on the other hand would have been content to replace royal officials with the rich the wellborn and the able and let it go at that.
in the end the new republics social fabric and political culture were visibly different after the war.
the energy created by the concepts of liberty equality and democracy changed the dynamics of american social and political life in ways that people could not have imagined in 1776 the exodus of loyalists the loyalists were hurt the most by the brutal civil war embedded within the revolutionary war.
they suffered greatly for their stubborn loyalty to king george iii and for their refusal to pledge allegiance to the new united states.
during and after the revolution their property was confiscated and many loyalists were assaulted brutalized and executed by patriots and vice versa.
after the american victory at yorktown tens of thousands of panicked loyalists made their way to seaports to board british ships and flee the united states.
thousands of african americans mostly runaway slaves also flocked to new york city charleston and savannah with many of their angry owners in hot pursuit.
boston king a runaway said he saw white slave owners grabbing their escaped slaves in the streets of new york or even dragging them out of their beds general guy carleton the commander in chief of british forces in north america organized the mass evacuation after the war.
he intentionally violated the provisions of the treaty of paris by refusing to return slaves to their owners defiantly telling a furious george washington that his slaves from mount vernon had already escaped and boarded british ships bound for canada.
some 80 000 desperate refugees white loyalists free blacks freed slaves and native americans who had allied with the b ritish dispersed throughout the british empire changing it in the process.
among the refugees who resettled in canada were 3 500 former slaves who had been given their freedom in exchange for joining the british army.
some 2 000 freed blacks opted to go to sierra leone where british abolitionists helped them create an experimental colony called freetown.
about 12 000 georgia and south carolina loyalists including thousands of their slaves the british granted freedom only to the slaves of patriots 234 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 the fate of the loyalists 1783 after the revolution many loyalists fled to british colonies in the caribbean and canada.
this british cartoon shows patriots depicted as savages let ting loose mercilessly hanging and scalping loyalists.
went to british controlled east florida only to see their new home handed over to spain in 1783.
spanish authorities gave them a hard choice swear allegiance to the spanish king and convert to catholicism or leave.
most of them left.
some of the doubly displaced loyalists sneaked back into the united states but most went to british islands in the caribbean.
we are all cast off complained one embittered loyalist.
i shall ever tho remember with satisfaction that it was not i deserted my king george iii but my king that deserted me the largest number of loyalist exiles landed in canada where royal officials wanted them to displace the earlier french presence.
the departure of so many loyalists from america was one of the most important social consequences of the revolution.
their confiscated homes lands and vacated jobs created new social economic and political opportunities for patriots.
in paris however the americans negotiating the peace treaty agreed that the continental congress would earnestly recommend to the states that the confiscated property be restored although it rarely was.
freedom of religion the revolution also tested traditional religious loyalties and set in motion important changes in the relationship the social revolution 235 religious development the congregational church developed a national presence in the early nineteenth century.
lemuel haynes depicted here was its first african american minister.
between church and government.
before the revolution americans tolerated religious dissent after the revolution americans insisted on complete freedom of r eligion as embodied in the principle of separation of church and state.
the anglican church established as the official religion in five colonies and parts of two others was especially vulnerable to changes prompted by the war.
anglicans tended to be pro british and non anglicans notably baptists and methodists outnumbered anglicans in all states except virginia.
all but virginia eliminated tax support for the church before the fighting was over and virginia did so soon afterward.
although anglicanism survived in the form of the new episcopal church it never regained its p re revolutionary stature.
in 1776 the virginia declaration of rights guaranteed the free exercise of religion and in 1786 the virginia statute of religious freedom written by thomas jefferson declared that no man shall be compelled to frequent 236 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 or support any religious worship place or ministry whatsoever and that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion these statutes and the revolutionary ideology that justified them helped shape the course that religious life would take in the new united states diverse and voluntary rather than monolithic and enforced by the government.
slaves and the revolution the sharpest irony of the american revolution is that great britain offered enslaved blacks more opportunities for freedom than did the united states.
in november 1775 the british royal governor of virginia john murray lord dunmore himself a slave owner announced that all slaves and indentured servants would gain their freedom if they joined the loyalist cause.
within a month the british had attracted more than 300 former servants and slaves to what came to be called the ethiopian regiment the number soon grew to almost 1 000 males and twice as many women and children.
one former slave renamed himself british freedom another runaway who joined the a ll black ethiopian regiment was harry washington one of george washingtons slaves.
in his new role as soldier he wore a uniform embroidered with the motto liberty to slaves washingtons farm manager wrote the general that all his slaves would leave us if they believed they could make their escape for liberty is sweet the british recruitment of slaves outraged george washington thomas jefferson and other white plantation owners in virginia where 40 percent of the population was black.
washington predicted that if dunmores efforts were not crushed soon the number of slaves joining the british army would increase as a snow ball by rolling jefferson expressed the same concerns after t wenty three slaves escaped from his plantation outside charlottesville.
jefferson eventually reclaimed six of them only to sell them for their disloyalty another virginia planter captured a fifteen year old girl who tried to join the british army lashed her eighty times with his whip and then poured hot coals on her wounds.
southern backlash in the end the british policy of recruiting slaves backfired.
the terrifying prospect of british troops arming slaves persuaded many f ence straddling southerners to join the patriot cause.
edward rutledge of south carolina said that the british decision to arm slaves and the revolution 237 slaves did more to create an eternal separation between great britain and the colonies than any other expedient for rutledge and many other southern whites the revolution became primarily a war to defend slavery.
in 1775 thomas jeremiah a free black was convicted and executed in charleston south carolina for telling slaves that british troops were coming to help the poor negroes in response to the british recruitment of enslaved african americans at the end of 1775 a desperate general washington authorized the enlistment of free blacks but not slaves into the american army.
in february 1776 however southern representatives convinced the continental congress to instruct general washington to enlist no more african americans free or enslaved.
two states south carolina and georgia refused to allow any blacks to serve in the patriot forces.
as the american war effort struggled however some states ignored southern wishes.
massachusetts organized two all black army units and rhode island organized one which also included native americans.
about 5 000 african americans fought on the patriot side and most of them were free blacks from northern states.
the white belknap family of framingham massachusetts freed their african american slave peter salem so that he might enlist in the massachusetts militia.
salem was with the minutemen at concord in 1775 and also fought alongside other blacks at the battles of bunker hill and saratoga.
another former slave who fought at bunker hill salem poor was commended after the battle for being a brave gallant soldier who behaved like an experienced officer as well as an excellent soldier overall the british army which liberated 20 000 enslaved blacks during the war was a far greater instrument of emancipation than the american forces.
most of the newly freed blacks found their way to canada or to british colonies on caribbean islands.
while thousands of free blacks and runaway slaves fought in the war the vast majority of african americans did not choose sides so much as they chose freedom.
several hundred thousand enslaved blacks mostly in the southern states took advantage of the disruptions caused by the war to seize their freedom.
in the north which had far fewer slaves than the south the ideals of liberty and freedom led most states to end slavery either during the war or shortly afterward.
but those same ideals had little to no impact in the southern states.
these contrasting attitudes toward slavery would continue to shape the political disputes of the young nation.
238 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 the status of women the ideal of liberty spawned by the revolution applied to the status of women as much as to that of african americans.
the legal status of women was governed by british common law which essentially treated them like children limiting their roles to child rearing and maintaining the household.
women could not vote or hold office.
few had access to formal education.
boys were taught to read and write girls were taught to read and sew.
most new england women in the eighteenth century could not write their own names.
until married women were subject to the dictates of their fathers.
once a woman married she essentially became the property of her husband and her property became his.
a married woman had no right to buy sell or manage property.
technically any wages a wife earned belonged to the husband.
women could not sign contracts file lawsuits or testify in court.
a husband could beat and even rape his wife without fearing legal action.
divorces were extremely difficult to obtain.
yet the revolution offered women new opportunities for independence and public service.
women in many communities made clothing for soldiers and organized fund raising efforts.
others became camp followers traveling and camping with the soldiers often with their children in tow.
the women in the army camps cooked meals washed clothes nursed wounds and on occasion took part in battle.
in 1777 some 400 armed women mobilized to defend pittsfield vermont.
the men of the town had gone off to fight when a band of loyalists and indians approached the village.
in a day long battle the women held off the attackers until help arrived.
a few women disguised their gender and fought as ordinary soldiers.
an exceptional case was deborah sampson who joined a massachusetts regiment as robert shurtleff and served from 1781 to 1783 by the artful concealment of her gender.
she was wounded twice leading congress to declare after the war that she was the highest example of female heroism fidelity and courage perhaps the feistiest of the fighting women was georgian nancy hart a tall red haired cousin of american general daniel morgan and a skilled hunter local native americans called her war woman.
when a group of loyalists accused her of helping a patriot escape she didnt deny the charge.
instead she shot two of them then held the others at gunpoint until her husband arrived.
her husband so the story goes wanted to shoot the remaining tories but she insisted on hanging them instead.
women and liberty americas war against great britain led some women to demand their own independence.
early in the revolution slaves and the revolution 239 ary struggle abigail adams one of the most learned spirited and independent women of the time wrote to her husband john in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies.
do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands since men were naturally tyrannical she wrote why then not put it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity otherwise if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have abigail adams abigail adams wife of no voice or representation john adams in a 1766 portrait.
though john adams could not help but an ardent patriot adams and other laugh at his wifes radical proposals women like her saw disappointingly few for female equality.
while surprised changes in womens rights emerging in the new united states.
that women might be dissatisfied he insisted on retaining the traditional privileges enjoyed by males depend upon it we know better than to repeal our masculine systems if women were to be granted equality he warned then children and apprentices and indians and negroes would also demand equal rights and freedoms.
thomas jefferson shared adamss stance.
in his view there was no place in the new american republic for female political participation.
women should not wrinkle their foreheads with politics but instead soothe and calm the minds of their husbands improvements in the status of women would have to wait.
new yorker margaret livingston admitted as much in 1776 when she wrote that our sex are doomed to be obedient to men at every stage of life so that we shant be great gainers by this contest the revolutionary war native americans and the revolution most native americans sought to remain neutral in the war but both british and american agents urged the chiefs to fight on their side.
the result was chaos.
indians on both sides attacked villages burned crops and killed civilians.
213003 05 197 243 r3 th indd 239 24 10 15 1 06 pm 240 chapter 5 the american revolution 1776 1783 during and after the war the new american government assured its indian allies that it would respect their lands and their rights.
but many white americans used the disruptions of war to destroy and displace native americans.
once the war ended and independence was secured there was no peace for the indians.
by the end of the eighteenth century land hungry americans were again pushing into indian territories on the western frontier.
the emergence of an american culture on july 2 1776 when the second continental congress had resolved that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states john adams had written abigail that future generations would remember that date as their day of deliverance people he predicted would celebrate the occasion with pomp and parade with shows games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations fireworks from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more adams got everything right but the date.
as luck would have it july 4 the date the declaration of independence was approved became independence day rather than july 2 when independence was formally declared.
the celebration of independence day quickly became the most important public ritual in the united states.
people from all walks of life suspended their normal routine in order to devote a day to parades patriotic speeches and fireworks displays.
in the process the infant republic began to create its own myth of national identity.
what a day exclaimed the editor of the southern patriot in 1815.
what happiness what emotion what virtuous triumph must fill the bosoms of americans american nationalism embodied a stirring idea.
this new nation was not rooted in antiquity.
its people except for the native americans had not inhabited it over many centuries nor was there any notion of a common ethnic descent.
the american national consciousness one observer wrote is not a voice crying out of the depth of the dark past but is proudly a product of the enlightened present setting its face resolutely toward the future many people at least since the time of the pilgrims had thought of the new world as singled out for a special identity a special mission assigned by god.
john adams proclaimed the opening of america a grand scheme and design in providence for the illumination and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth this sense of providential mission provided much of the energy for americas development as a new national republic.
from the democratic rhetoric of the emergence of an american culture 241 thomas jefferson to the pragmatism of george washington to heady toasts bellowed in south carolina taverns patriots everywhere claimed a special role for american leadership in history.
the first mission was to gain independence.
now people believed god was guiding the united states to lead the world toward greater liberty and equality.
benjamin rush a philadelphia doctor and scientist issued a prophetic statement in 1787 the american war is over but this is far from being the case with the american revolution.
on the contrary but the first act of the great drama is closed chapter review summary military challenges in 1776 the british had the mightiest army and navy in the world and they supplemented their military might by hiring professional german soldiers called hessians to help put down the american revolution.
the americans had to create an army the continental a rmy from scratch.
george washington realized that the americans had to turn unreliable citizen soldiers into a disciplined fighting force and try to wage a long costly war staking that the british army was fighting thousands of miles from its home base and would eventually cut its losses and give up.
turning points after forcing the british to evacuate boston the american army suffered a string of defeats before george washington surprised the hessians at the battle of trenton at the end of 1776.
the victory bolstered american morale and prompted more enlistments in the continental army.
the french were likely allies for the colonies from the beginning of the conflict because they resented their losses to britain in the seven years war.
after the british defeat at the battles of saratoga the colonies brokered an alliance with france.
washingtons ability to hold his ragged forces together despite daily desertions and two especially difficult winters in morristown and valley forge was another major turning point.
the british lost support on the frontier and in the southern colonies when terrorist tactics backfired.
the battle of kings mountain drove the british into retreat and french supplies and the french fleet helped tip the balance and ensure the american victory at the battle of yorktown.
civil war the american revolution was also a civil war dividing families and communities.
there were at least 100 000 loyalists in the colonies.
they included royal officials anglican ministers wealthy southern planters and the elite in large seaport cities they also included many humble people especially recent immigrants.
after the hostilities ended many loyalists including slaves who had fled plantations to support the british cause left for canada the west indies or england.
a political and social revolution the american revolution disrupted and transformed traditional class and social relationships.
american revolutionaries embraced a republican ideology and more white men gained the right to vote as property requirements were removed.
but fears of a monarchy being reestablished led colonists to vest power in the states rather than in a national government under the articles of confederation.
new state constitutions instituted more elected positions and most included bills of rights that protected individual liberties.
