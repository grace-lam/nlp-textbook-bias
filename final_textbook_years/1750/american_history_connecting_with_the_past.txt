a broadside against nobility this 1783 pamphlet was one of many expressions of the broad democratic sentiment that the revolution unleashed in american society.
the society of the cincinnati was an organization created shortly after the revolution by men who had served as high ranking officers in the patriot army.
to many americans however the society membership in which was to be hereditary looked suspiciously like the inherited aristocracies of england.
this pamphlet printed in philadelphia but intended for south carolinians warns of the dangers the society supposedly posed to the freedom and happiness of the republic fotosearch getty images fifty five men representing all the states except rhode island attended one or more sessions of the convention that sat in the philadelphia state house from may to september 1787.
these founding fathers as they would later become known were relatively young their average age was forty four and only one delegate benjamin franklin then eighty one was of advanced age.
they were well educated by the standards of their time.
most represented the great propertied interests of the country and many feared what one of them called the turbulence and follies of democracy.
yet all were also products of the american revolution and retained the the founding fathers uovninrinmrv qiicnirinn nf concentrated the convention unanimously chose washington to preside over its sessions and then closed its business to the public and the press.
the members then ruled that each state delegation would have a single vote.
major decisions would not require unanimity as they did in congress but only a simple majority.
virginia the most populous state sent the best prepared delegation to philadelphia.
james madison thirty six years old was its intellectual leader.
he had devised a detailed plan for a new national government and the virginians used it to control the agenda from the moment the convention began.
edmund randolph of virginia began the discussion by proposing that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary despite its vagueness it was a drastic proposal.
it called for the creation of a government very different from the existing the virginia confederation which among other things plan had no executive branch.
but so committed were the delegates to fundamental reform that they approved this resolution after only perfunctory debate.
then randolph introduced the details of madisons plan.
the virginia plan as it came to be known called for a new national legislature consisting of two houses.
in the lower house the states would be represented in proportion to their population thus the largest state virginia would have about ten times as many representatives as the smallest delaware.
members of the upper house were to be elected by the lower house under no rigid system of representation thus some of the smaller states might at times have no members in the upper house.
the proposal aroused immediate opposition among delegates from delaware new jersey and other small states.
some responded by arguing that congress had called the convention for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and had no authority to do more than that.
eventually however william paterson of new jersey submitted a substantive alternative to the virginia plan a proposal for a federal as opposed to a national government.
the new jersey plan would preserve the existing one house legislature in which each state had equal representation but it gave congress expanded powers to tax and to regulate commerce.
the delegates voted to table paterson s proposal but not without taking note of the substantial support for it among small state representatives.
the constitution and the new republic 163 the virginia plan remained the basis for discussion.
but its supporters realized they would have to make concessions to the small states if the convention was ever to reach a general agreement.
they soon conceded an important point by agreeing to permit the members of the upper house to be elected by the state legislatures rather than by the lower house of the national legislature.
thus each state would always have at least one member in the upper house.
but many questions remained.
would the states be equally represented in the upper house or would the large states have small states more members than the small ones.
would versus large slaves who could not vote be counted as states part of the population in determining the size of a states representation in congress or were they to be considered simple property.
delegates from states with large and apparently permanent slave populations especially those from south carolina wanted to have it both ways.
they argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation.
but they wanted slaves to be considered property if the new government were to levy taxes on each state on the basis of population.
representatives from states where slavery had disappeared or was expected soon to disappear argued that slaves should be included in calculating taxation but not representation.
no one argued seriously for giving slaves citizenship or the right to vote.
compromise the delegates bickered for weeks.
by the end of june as both temperature and tempers rose to uncomfortable heights the convention seemed in danger of collapsing.
benjamin franklin the great who remaineb a calm voice of conciliation compromise through the summer warned that if they failed the delegates would become a reproach and by word down to future ages.
and what is worse mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance war and conquest partly because of franklins soothing presence the delegates refused to give up.
finally on july 2 the convention agreed to create a grand committee with a single delegate from each state and with franklin as chairman to resolve the disagreements.

hall of representatives washington d c the bn geman r i rary debating the past the meaning of the constitution p f c cons u on has inspired debate from the moment it was drafted.
some people argue jl h u that the constitution is a flexible document intended to evolve in response to society s evolution others argue that it has a fixed meaning rooted in the original intent of the framers and that to move beyond that is to deny its value.
historians too disagree about why the constitution was written and what it meant to some scholars the creation of the federal system was an effort to preserve the ideals of the revolution and to create a strong national government capable of exercising real authority to others the constitution was an effort to protect the economic interests of existing elites even at the cost of betraying the principles of the revolution.
to still others the constitution was designed to protect individual freedom and to limit the power of the federal government.
the first influential exponent of the heroic view of the constitution as the culmination of the revolution was john fiske.
in the critical period of american history 1888 fiske described the many problems that beset the nation under the articles of confederation economic difficulties the weakness and ineptitude of the new national government threats from abroad interstate jealousies and widespread lawlessness.
only the timely adoption of the constitution fiske claimed saved the young republic from disaster.
in an economic interpretation of the constitution of the united states 1913 charles a.
beard challenged fiske s view.
according to beard the 1780s had been a critical period primarily for conservative businessmen who feared that the decentralized political structure of the republic imperiled their financial position.
such men he claimed wanted a government able to promote industry and trade protect private property and make good the public debt much of which was owed to them.
the constitution was beard claimed an economic document drawn with superb skill by men whose property interests were immediately at stake and who won its ratification over the opposition of a majority of the people.
a series of powerful challenges to beards thesis emerged in the 1950s as many scholars began to argue that the constitution was not an effort to preserve property but rather an enlightened effort to ensure stability and order.
examining the debate between the federalists and the antifederalists forrest mcdonald in we the people 1958 concluded that there was no consistent relationship between wealth and property and support for the constitution.
instead opinion on the new system was far more likely to reflect local and regional interests.
the cumulative effect of these challenges greatly weakened beard s argument few historians any longer accepted his thesis without reservation.
committee produced a proposal that became the basis of the great compromise its most important achievement was resolving the difficult problem of representation.
the proposal called for a legislature in which the states would be represented in the lower house on the basis of population.
each slave would count as three fifths of a free person in determining the basis for both representation and direct taxation.
the three fifths formula was based on the false assumption that a slave was three fifths as productive as a free worker and thus contributed only three fifths as much wealth to the state.
the committee proposed that in the upper house the states should be represented equally with two members apiece.
the proposal broke the deadlock.
on july 16 1787 the convention voted to accept the compromise.
over the next few weeks the convention agreed to another important compromise on the explosive issue of slavery.
the representatives of the southern states feared that the power to regulate trade might interfere with their agrarian economy which relied heavily on sales abroad and with slavery.
in response the convention agreed that the new legislature would not be permitted to tax exports congress would also be forbidden to impose a duty of more than 10 a head on imported slaves and it would have no authority to stop the slave trade for twenty years.
to those delegates who viewed the continued 164 existence of slavery as an affront to the principles of the new nation this was a large and difficult concession.
they agreed to it because they feared that without it the constitution would fail.
the convention chose to ignore differences of opinion it was unable to resolve leaving important questions alive that would surface again in later years.
the constitution provided no definition of citizenship.
most important was the absence of a list of individual rights which would restrain the powers of the national government in the way that bills of rights restrained the state governments.
madison opposed the idea arguing that specifying rights that were reserved to the people would in effect limit those rights.
other delegates however feared that without such protections the national government might abuse its new authority.
the constitution of 1787 many people contributed to the creation of the american constitution but the single most important of them was james james madison the most creative political madison thinker of his generation.
perhaps madisons most important achievement was in helping resolve two important philosophical questions that had served as obstacles to the creation of an effective national national archives and records administration j and property and to defend the nation against the dangers of too much liberty.
but if madison and hamilton feared too much liberty they also feared too little.
and that made them receptive to the vigorous demands of the antifederalists for protections of individual rights which culminated in the bill of rights.
the constitution is not rakove argues infinitely malleable.
but neither does it have a fixed meaning that can be a reliable guide to how we interpret it today e om0erstawix amalyze amd evaluate in the 1960s a new group of scholars began to revive an economic interpretation of the constitution one that differed from beard s in important ways but that nevertheless emphasized social and economic factors as motives for supporting the federal system.
jackson turner main argued in the anti federalists 1961 that supporters of the constitution were cosmopolitan commercialists eager to advance the economic development of the nation the antifederalists by contrast were agrarian localists fearful of centralization.
gordon wood in the creation of the american republic 1969 suggested that the debate over the state constitutions in the 1770s and 1780s reflected profound social divisions and that those same divisions helped shape the argument over the federal constitution.
the federalists wood suggested were largely traditional aristocrats deeply concerned over the instability of life un der the articles of confederation and particularly alarmed by the decline in popular deference toward social elites.
the creation of the constitution wood argued was part of a larger search to create a legitimate political leadership based on the existing social hierarchy.
historians have continued to examine the question of intent did the framers intend a strong centralized political system or did they intend to create a decentralized system with a heavy emphasis on individual rights.
the answer according to jack rakove in original meanings 1996 and revolutionaries 2010 is both and many other things as well.
the constitution rakove argues was the result of a long and vigorous debate through which the views of many different groups found their way into the document.
james madison a strong nationalist believed that only a powerful central government could preserve stability in a large nation.
alexander hamilton also saw the constitution as a way to protect order 1.
is the constitution a conservative liberal or radical document.
did the framers consider the constitution something finished with the exception of constitutional amendments or did they consider it a document that would evolve in response to changes in society over time.
which parts of the constitution suggest that the framers intent was to create a strong centralized political system.
which parts suggest that the framers intent was to create a decentralized system with heavy emphasis on individual rights.
although many amendments have been proposed only twenty seven have been added to the constitution.
why do you think so few have been added.
government the question of sovereignty and the question of limiting power.
the question of sovereignty had been one of the chief sources of friction between the colonies and great britain and it continued to trouble americans as they attempted to create their own government.
how could both the national government and the state governments exercise sovereignty the question at same time where did ultimate sov of sovereignty ereignty lie.
the answer madison and his contemporaries decided was that all power at all levels of government flowed ultimately from the people.
thus neither the federal government nor the state governments were truly sovereign.
all of them derived their authority from below.
the opening phrase of the constitution devised by gouverneur morris was we the people of the united statesman expression of the belief that the new government derived its power not from the states but from its citizens.
resolving the problem of sovereignty made possible one of the distinctive features of the constitution its distribution of powers between the national and state governments.
it was madison wrote at the time in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution but a composition of both the constitution and the government it created were to be the supreme law of the land no state would have the authority to defy it.
the federal government was to have broad powers including the power to tax to regulate commerce to control the currency and to pass such laws as would be necessary and proper for carrying out its other responsibilities.
gone was the stipulation of the articles that each state shall retain every power jurisdiction and right not expressly delegated to the united states in congress assembled on the other hand the constitution accepted the existence of separate states and left important powers in their hands.
in addition to solving the question of sovereignty the constitution produced a solution to a problem troubling to americans the problem of concentrated authority.
nothing so frightened the leaders of the new nation as the prospect of creating a tyrannical government.
that fear had been one of the chief obstacles to the creation of a national government.
drawing from the ideas of the french philosopher baron de montesquieu most americans had long believed that the best way to avoid tyranny was to keep government close to the people.
a republic they thought must remain confined to a small area.
a large nation would breed corruption and despotism because the rulers would be so distant from most of the people that there would be no way to control them.
165 166 chapter 6 in the first years of the new american nation these assumptions had led to the belief that the individual states must remain sovereign and that a strong national government would be dangerous.
madison however helped break the grip of these assumptions by arguing that a large republic would be less not more likely to produce tyranny because it would contain so many different factions that no single group would ever be able to dominate it.
in this he drew from among other sources the separation scottish philosopher david hume.
this of powers idea of many centers of power checking each other and preventing any single despotic authority made possible the idea of a large republic and also helped shape the internal structure of the federal government.
the constitutions most distinctive feature was its separation of powers within the government its creation of checks and balances among the legislative executive and judicial branches.
the array of forces within the government would constantly compete with and often frustrate one another.
congress would have two chambers the senate and the house of representatives each with members elected in a different way and for different terms and each checking the other since both would have to agree before any law could be passed.
the president would have the power to veto acts of congress.
the federal courts would have protection from both the executive and the legislature because judges and justices once appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate would serve for life.
the federal structure of the government which divided power between the states and the nation and the system of checks and bal vi ances which divided power among various elements within the national government were designed to protect the united states from the kind of despotism americans believed had emerged in england.
but they were also designed to protect the nation from another kind of despotism perhaps equally menacing the tyranny of the people.
fear of the mob of an excess of democracy was at least as important to the framers of the constitution as fear of a single tyrant.
shayss rebellion had been only one example they believed of what could happen if a nation did not defend itself against the unchecked exercise of popular will.
thus in the new government only the members of the house of representatives would be elected directly by the people.
senators the president and federal judges would be insulated in varying degrees from the public.
on september 17 1787 thirty nine delegates signed the constitution doubtless sharing the feelings that benjamin franklin expressed at the end thus i consent sir to this constitution because i expect no better and because i am not sure it is not the best k sb.
the limits of the constitution the constitution of 1789 was a document that established a democratic republic for white people mostly white men.
indians and african americans the two largest population groups sharing the lands of the united states with anglo americans enjoyed virtually none of the rights and privileges provided to the white population.
native americans had at least the semblance of a legal status within the nation through treaties that assured them lands that would be theirs forever.
but most of these treaties did not survive for long and the indians found themselves driven farther and farther west with little of the protection that the government had promised them.
among the white leaders of the united states there were eminent figures who believed indians could join the republic as citizens.
jefferson was among them believing that indians could be taught the ways of civilization jefferson and other americans with good intentions sought to teach the indians to live as white americans did.
efforts to teach them anglo farming methods were based on sedentary farms that relied on men doing the farming and women caring for the home.
indians had no interest in such ways and preferred to retain their traditional cultures.
their repudiation of white civilization contributed to the erosion of support among white americans.
indians were not granted citizenship of the united states until the 1920s.

the granger collection new york in a book distributed to the people of new york began as the constitution and the new republic 167 far more removed from the guarantees of the constitution were african american slaves who were given virtually none of the rights and protections that the new government provided to white people.
they were one southern official noted not constituent members of our society the french canadian writer hector st john de crevecoeur who after the revolution settled in the united states wrote a famous book letters from an american farmer in 1782.
in it he posed what became a famous question what then is the american this new man crevecoeur answered his own question by noting that individuals of all nations would become melted into a common citizenry.
but he too saw no room for african americans in the community of the new man indeed among the first laws passed by the new united states under the constitution was the naturalization act of 1790 which helped legalize the stream of immigrants coming into the country and allowed them to become citizens.
but it defined citizenry as a status available only to white people.
even free black people were barred from citizenship.
jefferson who had briefly tried without result to give indians a legal status within the new nation had no such aspirations for african americans.
he was an uneasy defender of slavery worrying about excluding a whole race of men from the natural rights that jefferson himself had done so much to promote.
but he could never accept the idea that black men and black women could attain the level of knowledge and intelligence of white people.
jeffersons long romantic relationship with a black woman sally hemmings did nothing to change his mind.
hemmings was a light skinned woman who was a slave on jeffersons plantation in virginia.
jefferson lived with her after the death of his wife and fathered several of her children.
but his intimate relationship with the hemmings family did not ultimately change his postion on slavery.
unlike george washington who stipulated that his slaves be freed after his death jefferson deeply in debt required his heirs to sell his slaves after he died after liberating the hemmings family.
not until the end of the civil war were black men and black women eligible to live as citizens in the united states and even then with only partial rights until a century later.
federalists and antifederalists the delegates at philadelphia had greatly exceeded their instructions from congress and the states.
instead of making simple revisions to the articles of confederation they had produced a plan for a completely different form of government.
they feared therefore that the constitution might never be ratified under the rules of the articles of confederation which required unanimous approval by the state legislatures.
so the convention changed the rules.
the constitution specified that the new government would come into existence among the ratifying states when any nine of the thirteen had ratified it.
the delegates recommended to congress that special state conventions not state legislatures consider the document.
they were required to vote yes or no on the document.
they could make no changes until after the constitution was ratified by the required number of states at which point the constitutions amendment process could be used as it was for the bill of rights.
the old confederation congress now overshadowed by the events in philadelphia passively accepted the constitutional conventions work and submitted it to the states for approval.
all the state legislatures except rhode islands elected delegates to ratifying conventions most of which began meeting by early 1788.
even before the ratifying conventions convened however a great national debate on the new constitution had begun in the state legislatures in mass meetings in the columns of newspapers and in ordinary conversations.
occasionally passions rose to the point that opposing factions came to blows.
in at least one place albany new york such clashes resulted in injuries and death.
supporters of the constitution had a number of advantages.
they were better organized than their opponents and they had the support of the two most eminent men in america franklin and washington.
and they seized an ap.
pealing label for themselves federalists federalist the term that opponents of centralization papers had once used to describe themselves thus implying that they were less committed to a nationalist government than in fact they were.
the federalists also had the support of the ablest political philosophers of their time alexander hamilton james madison and john jay.
those three men under the joint pseudonym publius wrote a series of essays widely published in newspapers throughout the nation explaining the meaning and virtues of the constitution.
they did so in an effort to counter the powerful arguments that those opposed to the constitution those who became known as the antifederalists were making.
without a powerful defense of the new constitution they feared the antifederalists might succeed in several crucial states most notably in new york.
the essays were later issued as a book and they are known today as the federalist papers.
they are among the most important american contributions to political theory.
the federalists called their critics antifederalists implying that their rivals had nothing to offer except opposi yhe tion and chaos.
but the antifederalists antifederalists had serious and intelligent arguments of their own.
they presented themselves as the defenders of the true principles of the revolution.
the constitution they believed would betray those principles by establishing a strong potentially tyrannical center of power in the new national government.
the federal government they claimed would increase taxes obliterate the states wield dictatorial powers favor the well born over the common people and put an end to individual liberty.
but their biggest complaint was that the constitution lacked a bill of rights a concern that revealed one of the most important sources of their opposition a basic mistrust of 168 chapter 6 debating the constitution human nature and of the capacity of human beings to wield power.
the antifederalists argued that any government that centralized authority would inevitably produce despotism.
their demand for a bill of rights was a product of this belief no government could be trusted to protect the liberties of its citizens only by enumerating the natural rights of the people could there be any assurance that those rights would be preserved.
at its heart then the debate between the federalists and the antifederalists was a battle between two fears.
the federalists were afraid above all of disorder anarchy chaos they feared the unchecked power of the masses and they sought in the constitution to create a government that would function at some distance from popular passions.
the antifederalists were not anarchists they too recognized the need for an effective government.
but they were much more concerned about the dangers of concentrated power than about the dangers of popular will.
they opposed the constitution for some of the same reasons the federalists supported it because it placed obstacles between the people and the exercise of power.
despite the antifederalist efforts ratification proceeded quickly although not without occasional difficulty during the winter of 1787 1788.
the delaware convention was the first to act when it ratified the constitution unanimously.
the new jersey and georgia conventions did the same.
in the larger states of pennsylvania and massachusetts the antifederalists put up a determined struggle but lost in the final vote.
new hampshire ratified the document in june 1788 the ninth state to do so.
it was now theoretically possible for the constitution to go into effect.
a new government could not hope to flourish however without the participation of virginia and new york the two most populous states whose conventions remained closely divided.
by the end of june first virginia and then new york had consented to the constitution by narrow margins.
the new york convention yielded to expediency even some of the most staunchly antifederalist delegates feared that the states commercial interests would suffer if once the other states gathered under the new roof new york were to remain outside.
massachusetts virginia and new york all ratified on the assumption that a bill of rights would be added to the constitution.
the north carolina convention adjourned without taking action waiting to see what happened to the amendments.
rhode island whose leaders had opposed the constitution almost from the start did not even call a convention to consider ratification.
completing the structure the first elections under the constitution took place in the early months of 1789.
almost all the newly elected congressmen and senators had favored ratification and many had served as delegates to the philadelphia convention.
there was the bill of rights never any real doubt about who would be the first president.
george washington had presided at the constitutional convention and many delegates who had favored ratification did so only because they expected him to preside over the new government as well.
washington received the votes of all the presidential electors.
john adams a leading federalist became vice president.
after a journey from mount vernon marked by elaborate celebrations along the way washington was inaugurated in new york the national capital for the time being on april 30 1789.
the first congress served in many ways almost as a continuation of the constitutional convention because its principal responsibility was filling in the various gaps in the constitution.
its most important task was drafting a bill of rights.
by early 1789 even madison had come to agree that some sort of bill of rights was essential to legitimize the new government in the eyes of its opponents.
congress approved twelve amendments on september 25 1789 ten of them were ratified by the states by the end of 1791.
what we know as the bill of rights is these first ten amendments to the constitution.
nine of them placed limitations on congress by forbidding it to infringe on certain basic rights freedom of religion speech and the press immunity from arbitrary arrest trial by jury and others.
the tenth amendment reserved to the states all powers except those specifically withheld from them or delegated to the federal government.
on the subject of the federal courts the constitution said only the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish it was left to congress to determine the number of supreme court judges to be appointed and the kinds of lower courts to be organized.
in the judiciary act of 1789 congress provided for a supreme court of six members with a chief justice and five associate justices thirteen district courts with one judge apiece and three circuit courts of appeal each to consist of one of the district judges sitting with two of the supreme court justices.
in the same act congress gave the supreme court the power to make the final decision in cases involving the constitutionality of state laws.
the constitution referred indirectly to executive departments but did not specify what or how many there should be.
the first congress created three such departments state trea the cabinet sury anc war and also established the offices of the attorney general and the postmaster general.
to the office of secretary of the treasury washington appointed alexander hamilton of new york who at age thirty two was an acknowledged expert in public finance.
for secretary of war he chose a massachusetts federalist general henry knox.
as attorney general he named edmund randolph of virginia sponsor of the plan on which the constitution had been based.
as secretary of state he chose another virginian thomas jefferson who had recently served as minister to france.
the constitution and the new republic 169 federalists and republicans the resolution of these initial issues however did not resolve the deep disagreements about the nature of the new government.
on the contrary for the first twelve years under the constitution american politics was characterized by a level of acrimony seldom matched in any period since.
the framers of the constitution had dealt with many disagreements not by solving them but by papering them over with a series of vague compromises as a result the conflicts survived to plague the new government.
at the heart of the controversies of the 1790s was the same basic difference in philosophy that had been at the heart of the debate over the constitution.
on one side stood a powerful group that believed america required a strong national gov competing ernment.
that the country s mission was visions to become a genuine nation state with centralized authority a complex commercial economy and a proud standing in world affairs.
on the other side stood another group a minority at first but one that gained strength during the decade that envisioned a far weaker central government.
american society should not this group believed aspire to be highly commercial or urban.
it should remain predominantly rural and agrarian and it should have a central government of modest size and powers that would leave most power in the hands of the states and the people.
the centralizers became known as the federalists and gravitated to the leadership of alexander hamilton.
their opponents took the name republicans and gathered under the leadership of james madison and thomas jefferson.
hamilton and the federalists for twelve years control of the new government remained firmly in the hands of the federalists.
that was in part because george washington had always envisioned a strong national government and as president had quietly supported those who were attempting to create one.
his enormous prestige throughout the nation was one of the federalists greatest assets.
but washington also believed that the presidency should remain above political controversies and so he avoided any personal involvement in the deliberations of congress.
as a result the dominant figure in his administration became his talented secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton who exerted more influence on domestic and foreign policy than anyone else both during his term of office and to an almost equal extent after his resignation in 1794.
of all the national leaders of his time hamilton was one of the most aristocratic in personal tastes and political philosophy ironically perhaps since his own origins as an illegitimate child in the caribbean had been so humble.
far from embracing the republican ideals of the virtue of the people he believed that a stable and effective government alexander hamilton as president george washingtons secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton exerted enormous influence in both domestic and foreign affairs.
hamilton favored the establishment of an enlightened ruling class to govern the new nation.
his plans for the new federal government to assume existing public debt and to establish a national bank were part of his vision of a powerful nation with a vigorous and independent commercial economy a robust industrial sector and a dynamic role in world economic affairs.
de agostini picture library the bridgeman art library required an enlightened ruling class.
thus the new government needed the support of the wealthy and powerful and to get that support it needed to give those elites a stake in its.
hamilton proposed therefore debt t t ie new gvernment take responsi bility for the existing public debt.
many of the miscellaneous uncertain depreciated certificates of indebtedness that the old congress had issued during and after the revolution were now in the hands of wealthy speculators the government should call them in and exchange them for uniform interest bearing bonds payable at definite dates.
this policy was known as funding the debt.
he also recommended that the federal government assume or take over the debts the states had accumulated during the revolution this assumption policy would encourage state as well as federal bondholders to look to the central government for 170 chapter 6 eventual payment.
hamilton did not in other words envision paying off and thus eliminating the debt.
he wanted instead to create a large and permanent national debt with new bonds being issued as old ones were paid off.
the result he believed would be that creditors the wealthy classes most likely to lend money to the government would have a permanent stake in seeing the government survive.
hamilton also wanted to create a national bank.
at the time there were only a few banks in the country located principally in boston philadelphia and new york city.
a new national bank would help fill the void that the absence of a well developed banking system had created.
it would provide loans and currency to businesses.
it would give the government a safe place to deposit federal funds.
it would help collect taxes and disburse the governments expenditures.
the bank would be chartered by the federal government would have a monopoly of the governments own banking business and would be controlled by directors of whom one fifth would be appointed by the government.
it would provide a stable center to the nations small and feeble banking system.
the funding and assumption of debts would require new sources of revenue since the government would now have to pay interest on the loans it was accepting.
up to now most government revenues had come from the sale of public lands in hamiltons west hamilton proposed two new report on kinds of taxes.
one was an excise to be manufacturing paid by distillers of alcoholic liquors a tax that would fall most heavily on the whiskey distillers of the backcountry especially in pennsylvania virginia and north carolina small farmers who converted part of their corn and rye crop into whiskey.
the other was a tariff on imports which not only would raise revenue but also would protect american manufacturing from foreign competition.
in his famous report on manufactures of 1791 hamilton laid out a grand scheme for stimulating the growth of industry in the united states and wrote glowingly of the advantages to the nation of a healthy manufacturing base.
the federalists in short offered more than a vision of how to stabilize the new government.
they offered a vision of the sort of nation america should become a nation with a wealthy enlightened ruling class a vigorous independent commercial economy and a thriving industrial sector a nation able to play a prominent role in world economic affairs.
enacting the federalist program few members of congress objected to hamiltons plan for funding the national debt but many did oppose his proposal to accept the debt at par that is at face value.
the old certificates had been issued to merchants and farmers in payment for debating war supplies during the revolution or to hamiltons officers and soldiers of the revolutionary program army in payment for their services.
but many of these original holders had sold their bonds during the hard times of the 1780s to speculators who had bought them at a fraction of their face value.
many members of congress believed that if the federal government was to assume responsibility for these bonds some of them should be returned to the original purchasers.
james madison now a representative from virginia proposed dividing the federally funded bonds between the original purchasers and the speculators.
but hamiltons allies insisted that such a plan was impractical and that the honor of the government required that it pay the bondholders themselves not the original lenders who had sold their bonds of their own accord.
congress finally passed the funding bill hamilton wanted.
hamiltons proposal that the federal government assume the state debts encountered greater difficulty.
his opponents argued that if the federal government took over the state debts the people of states with few debts would have to pay taxes to service the larger debts of other states.
hamilton and his supporters struck a bargain with the virginians to win passage of the bill.
the deal involved the location of the national capital.
the capital had moved from new york city back to philadelphia in location of 1790.
but the virginians wanted a new the capital capital near them in the south.
hamiton met with thomas jefferson and agreed over dinner to provide northern support for placing the capital in the south in exchange for virginias votes for the assumption bill.
the bargain called for the construction of a new capital city on the banks of the potomac river which divided virginia and maryland on land to be selected by washington himself.
the government would move there by the beginning of the new century.
hamilton argued that creation of a national bank was compatible with the intent of the constitution even though the bank of the document did not explicitly authorize it.
united states but madison jefferson randolph and others argued that congress should exercise no powers that the constitution had not clearly assigned it.
nevertheless both the house and the senate finally agreed to hamiltons bill.
washington displayed some uncertainty about its legality at first but he finally signed it.
the bank of the united states began operations in 1791 under a charter that granted it the right to continue for twenty years.
once enacted hamiltons program had many of the effects he had intended and won the support of influential segments of the population.
it quickly restored public credit the bonds of the united states were soon selling at home and abroad at prices even above their face value.
speculators among them many members of congress reaped large profits as a result.
manufacturers profited from the tariffs and merchants in the seaports benefited from the new banking system.
small farmers who formed the vast majority of the population complained that they had to bear a disproportionate tax burden.
not only did they have to pay property taxes to their state governments but they bore the brunt of the excise tax on distilleries that hamilton had initiated.
they also opposed a 1792 tariff also promoted by hamilton.
many americans came to believe that the federalist the constitution and the new republic 171 program served the interests not of the people but of small wealthy elites.
partly as a result an organized political opposition arose.
the republican opposition the constitution had made no reference to political parties and the omission was not an oversight.
most of the framers george washington in particular believed that organized parties were dangerous and should be avoided.
disagreement on particular issues was inevitable but most of the founders believed that such disagreements need not and should not lead to the formation of permanent factions.
the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties madison wrote in the federalist papers number 10 perhaps the most influential of all the essays and.
measures are too often decided not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority yet within just a few years after ratification of the constitution madison and others became convinced that hamilton and his followers had become just such an interested and overbearing majority the hamiltonians madison and others agreed had worked to establish a national network of influence that embodied all the worst features of a party.
the federalists had used their control over appointments and the awarding of government franchises to reward their supporters and win additional allies.
they had encouraged the formation of local associations largely establishment of the federalist party formation of the republican party aristocratic in nature to strengthen their standing in local communities.
they were doing many of the same things their opponents believed that the corrupt british governments of the early eighteenth century had done.
because the federalists appeared to be creating a menacing and tyrannical structure of power their opponents believed that there was no alternative but to organize a vigorous opposition.
the result was the emergence of an alternative political organization which called itself the republican party.
this first republican party is not an ancestor of the modern republican party which was born in the 1850s.
by the late 1790s the republicans were going to even greater lengths than the federalists to create an apparatus of partisan influence.
in every state they formed committees societies and caucuses.
republican groups corresponded with one another across state lines.
they banded together to influence state and local elections.
and they justified their actions by claiming that they and they alone represented the true interests of the nation that they were fighting to defend the people against a corrupt conspiracy by the federalists.
just as hamilton believed that the network of supporters he was creating represented the only legitimate interest group in the nation so the republicans believed that their party organization represented the best interests of the people.
neither side was willing to admit that it was acting as a party neither would concede the right of the other to exist.
this institutionalized factionalism is known to scholars as the first party system rpntgrv were drawn to tranquil rural scenes symbolic of the jeffersonian vision of a nation of small independent farmers.
the jeffersonian idyll american artists in t e eary nine een farm the simple agrarian republic it depicts was already being transformed by rapid economic growth.
by 1822 when francis alexander painted this pastoral landscape o a p courtesy national gallery of art washington 172 chapter 6 from the beginning the preeminent figures among the republicans were thomas jefferson and james madison.
indeed the two men were such intimate collaborators with such similar political philosophies that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the contributions of one from those of the other.
but jefferson the more charismatic personality of the two gradually emerged as the most prominent spokesman for the republicans.
jefferson considered himself a farmer.
he was in fact a substantial planter but he had spent little time in recent years at his estate in virginia.
he believed in an agrarian republic most of whose citizens would be sturdy independent farmer citizens tilling their own soil.
jefferson did not scorn commercial activity he assumed farmers would market their crops in the national and even international markets.
nor did he oppose industry he believed the united states should develop some manufacturing capacity.
but he was suspicious of large cities feared urban mobs as sores upon the body politic and opposed the development of an advanced industrial economy because it would he feared increase the number of propertyless workers packed in cities.
in short jefferson envisioned a decentralized society dominated by small property owners engaged largely in agrarian activities.
the difference between the federalist and republican social philosophies was visible in among other things reactions to the french revolution.
as that revolution dlfffrfncfs over the grew increasingly radical in the 1790s french with ts attacks on organized religion the revolution overthrow of the monarchy and eventually the execution of the king and queen the federalists expressed horror.
but the republicans generally applauded the democratic antiaristocratic spirit they believed the french revolution embodied.
some even imitated the french radicals the jacobins by cutting their hair short wearing pantaloons and addressing one another as citizen and citizeness although both parties had supporters in all parts of the country and among all classes there were regional and economic differences.
the federalists were most numerous in the commercial centers of the northeast and in such southern seaports as charleston the republicans were most numerous in the rural areas of the south and the west.
as the 1792 presidential election the nation s second approached both jefferson and hamilton urged washington to run for another term.
the president reluctantly agreed.
but while most americans considered washington above the partisan battle he was actually much more in sympathy with the federalists than with the republicans.
and during his presidency hamilton remained the dominant figure in government.
establishing national sovereignty the federalists consolidated their position and for a time attracted wide public support for the new national govern ment by dealing effectively with two problems the old confederation had been unable fully to resolve.
they helped stabilize the nations western lands and they strengthened america s international position.
securing the frontier despite the northwest ordinance the confederation congress had largely failed to tie the outlying western areas of the country firmly to the government.
farmers in western massachusetts had risen in revolt settlers in vermont kentucky and tennessee had toyed with the idea of separating from the union.
the new government under the constitution inherited these problems.
in 1794 farmers in western pennsylvania raised a major challenge to federal authority when they refused to pay a whiskey excise tax and began terrorizing the tax collectors much as colonists had done at the time of the stamp act.
but the federal government did not leave settlement of the so called whiskey rebellion to pennsylvania as the confederation whiskey congress had left shayss rebellion to rebellion massachusetts.
at hamiltons urging washington called out the militias of three states raised an army of nearly 15 000 a larger force than he had commanded against the british during most of the revolution and personally led the troops into pennsylvania.
as the militiamen approached pittsburgh the center of the resistance the rebellion quickly collapsed.
the federal government won the allegiance of the whiskey rebels by intimidating them.
it won the loyalties of other frontier people by accepting their territories as new states in the union.
the last of the original thirteen colonies joined the union once the bill of rights had been appended to the constitution north carolina in 1789 and rhode island in 1790.
then vermont which had had its own state government since the revolution became the fourteenth state in 1791 after new york and new hampshire finally agreed to give up their claims to it.
next came kentucky in 1792 when virginia gave up its claim to that region.
after north carolina finally ceded its western lands to the union tennessee became first a territory and in 1796 a state.
native americans and the new nation the new government faced a greater challenge also inherited from the confederation in the more distant areas of the northwest and the southwest where indians occasionally in alliance with the british and spanish fought to retain tribal lands that the u s government claimed for itself.
the ordinances of 1784 1787 had produced a series of border conflicts with indian tribes resisting white settlement in what they considered their lands.
although the united states eventually defeated virtually every indian challenge if often at great cost it was clear that the larger question of who was to control the lands of the west the united states or the indian nations remained unanswered.
these clashes revealed another issue the constitution had done little to resolve the place of the indian nations within the constitution and the new republic 173 the new federal structure.
the constitution barely mentioned native americans.
article i excluded indians not taxed from indians being counted in the population totals and the that determined the number of seats constitution states would receive in the house of representatives and it gave congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes article vi bound the new government to respect treaties negotiated by the confederation most of which had been with the tribes.
but none of this did much to clarify the precise legal standing of indians or indian nations within the united states.
on the one hand the constitution seemed to recognize the existence of the tribes as legal entities.
on the other hand it made clear that they were not foreign nations in the same sense that european countries were nor were their members citizens of the united states.
the tribes received no direct representation in the new government.
above all the constitution did not address the major issue that would govern relations between whites and indians land.
indian nations lived within the boundaries of the united states yet they claimed and the white government at times agreed that they had some measure of sovereignty within their own lands.
but neither the constitution nor common law offered any clear guide to the rights of a nation within a nation or to the precise nature of tribal sovereignty which ultimately depended on control of land.
thus the relationship between the tribes and the united states remained to be determined by a series of treaties agreements and judicial decisions in a process that has continued for more than 200 years.
maintaining neutrality not until 1791 eight years after the end of the revolution did great britain send a minister to the united states and then only because madison and the republicans were threatening to place special trade restrictions on british ships.
that was one of many symbols of the difficulty the new government had in establishing its legitimacy in the eyes of the british.
another crisis in anglo american relations emerged in 1793 when the new french government created by the revolution of 1789 went to war with great britain and its allies.
both the president and congress took steps to establish american neutrality in that conflict.
but the neutrality quickly encountered severe tests.
the first challenge to american neutrality came from revolutionary france and its first diplomatic representative to america the brash and youthful edmond genet.
instead of landing at philadelphia and presenting himself immediately to the president genet disembarked at charleston.
there he made plans to use american ports to outfit french warships citizen genet encouraged american shipowners to serve as french privateers and commissioned the aging george rogers clark to lead a military expedition against spanish lands to the south.
spain was at the time an ally of great britain and an enemy of france.
in all of this genet was brazenly ignoring washingtons policies and flagrantly violating the neutrality act.
his conduct infuriated washington who provided citizen genet as he was known with an icy reception in philadelphia and the federalists it also embarrassed all but the most ardent admirers of the french revolution among the republicans.
washington eventually demanded that the french government recall him but by then genets party was out of power in france.
the president granted him political asylum in the united states and he settled with his american wife on a long island farm.
the neutrality policy had survived its first serious test.
a second and even greater challenge came from great britain.
early in 1794 the royal navy began seizing hundreds of american ships engaged in trade in the french west indies a comment on the whiskey rebellion although thomas jefferson and other republicans claimed to welcome occasional popular uprisings the federalists were horrified by such insurgencies as shays s rebellion in massachusetts and later the whiskey rebellion in pennsylvania.
this federalist cartoon portrays the rebels as demons who pursue and eventually hang an unfortunate exciseman tax collector who has confiscated two kegs of rum.

anti british feeling rose still higher at the report that the governor general of canada had delivered a warlike speech to the indians on the northwestern frontier encouraging them to challenge u s dominance there.
hamilton was deeply concerned.
war would mean an end to imports from england and most of the revenue for maintaining his financial system came from duties on those imports.
jay s treaty and pinckneys treaty this was hamilton believed no time for ordinary diplomacy.
he did not trust the state department to reach a settlement with britain.
jefferson had resigned as secretary of state in 1793 to devote more time to his political activities but his successor edmund randolph was even more ardently pro french than jefferson had been.
so hamilton persuaded washington to name a special commissioner to england john jay chief justice of the united states supreme court and a staunch new york federalist.
jay was instructed to secure compensation for the recent british assaults on american shipping to demand withdrawal of british forces from the frontier posts and to negotiate a new commercial treaty.
the long and complex treaty jay negotiated in 1794 failed to achieve these goals.
but it was not without merit.
it settled the conflict with britain and helped prevent what had seemed likely to become a war between the two nations.
it established jay s treaty undisputed american sovereignty over the entire northwest.
and it produced a reasonably satisfactory commercial relationship with britain whose trade was important to the united states.
nevertheless when the terms became public in america there were bitter public denunciations of it for having failed to extract enough promises from the british.
jay was burned in effigy in various parts of the country.
opponents of the treaty nearly all the republicans and even some federalists encouraged by agents of france went to extraordinary lengths to defeat it in the senate.
the american minister to france james monroe and even the secretary of state edmund randolph joined the desperate attempt to prevent ratification.
but in the end the senate ratified what was by then known as jays treaty.
among other things the treaty made possible a settlement of americas conflict with the spanish because it raised fears in spain that the british and the americans might now join pinckneys together to challenge spanish possessions treaty in north america.
when thomas pinckney arrived in spain as a special negotiator he had no difficulty in gaining nearly everything the united states had sought from the spaniards for more than a decade.
under pinckney s treaty signed in 1795 spain recognized the right of americans to navigate the mississippi to its mouth and to deposit goods at new orleans for reloading on oceangoing ships agreed to fix the northern boundary of florida where americans always had insisted it should be along the 31st parallel and required spanish authorities to prevent the indians in florida from launching raids across the border.
the downfall of the federalists the federalists impressive triumphs did not ensure their continued dominance in the national government.
on the contrary success seemed to produce problems of its own problems that led to their downfall.
since almost all americans in the 1790s agreed that there was no place in a stable republic for an organized opposition the emergence of the republicans as powerful contenders for popular favor seemed to the federalists a grave threat to national stability.
beginning in the late 1790s when international perils confronted the government as well the federalists could not resist the temptation to move forcefully against the opposition.
facing what they believed was a stark choice between respecting individual liberties and preserving stability the federalists chose stability.
the result was political disaster.
after 1796 the federalists never won another election.
the popular respect for the institutions of the federal government which they had worked so hard to 3 wasnington lavished enormous attention on t thev hold ly.

paul rocteeau er strve b9 refinement and 9en ililv10 lheir the constitution and the new republic 175 produce among the people survived.
but the federalists themselves gradually vanished as an effective political force.
the election of 1796 despite strong pressure from his many admirers to run for a third term as president george washington insisted on retiring from office in 1797.
in his farewell address to the american people actually a long letter composed in part by hamilton and published in a philadelphia newsletter he reacted sharply to the washingtons republicans his reference to the insidi farewell ous w es f foreign influence was not just address an abstract warning against international entanglements it was also a specific denunciation of those republicans who had been conspiring with the french to frustrate the federalist diplomatic program.
with washington out of the running no obstacle remained to an open expression of the partisan rivalries that had been building over the previous eight years.
jefferson was the uncontested candidate of the republicans in 1796.
the federalists faced a more difficult choice.
hamilton the personification of federalism had created too many enemies to be a credible john adams john adams s illustrious career as revolutionary leader diplomat and president marked the beginning of four generations of public distinction among members of his family.
his son john quincy adams served as secretary of state and president.
his grandson charles francis adams was one of the great diplomats of the civil war era.
his great grandson henry adams was one of americas most distinguished historians and writers.
courtesy national gallery of art washington d c candidate.
so vice president john adams who had been directly associated with none of the unpopular federalist measures became his partys nominee for president.
the federalists were still clearly the dominant party and there was little doubt of their ability to win a majority of the presidential electors.
but without washington to mediate they fell victim to fierce factional rivalries that almost led to their undoing.
hamilton and many other federalists especially in the south were not reconciled to adamss candidacy and favored his running mate thomas pinckney instead.
and when as expected the federalists elected a majority of the presidential electors some of these pinckney supporters declined to vote for adams he managed to defeat jefferson by only three electoral votes.
because a still larger number of adamss supporters declined to vote for pinckney jefferson finished second in the balloting and became vice president.
until the twelfth amendment was adopted in 1804 the constitution provided for the candidate receiving the second highest number of electoral votes to become vice president hence the awkward result of men from different parties serving in the nations two highest elected offices.
adams thus assumed the presidency under unhappy circumstances.
he presided over a divided party which faced a divided strong and resourceful republican opposi federalists tion committed to its extinction.
adams was not even the dominant figure in his own party hamilton remained the most influential federalist and adams was never able to challenge him effectively.
the new president was one of the countrys most accomplished and talented diplomats but he had few skills as a politician.
austere rigid aloof he had little talent at conciliating differences soliciting support or inspiring enthusiasm.
he was a man of enormous indeed intimidating rectitude and he seemed to assume that his own virtue and the correctness of his positions would be enough to sustain him.
the quasi war with france american relations with great britain and spain improved as a result of jays and pinckneys treaties.
but the nations relations with revolutionary france quickly deteriorated.
french vessels captured american ships on the high seas and at times imprisoned the crews.
when the south carolina federalist charles cotesworth pinckney brother of thomas pinckney arrived in france the government refused to receive him as the official representative of the united states.
some of president adamss advisers favored war most notably secretary of state thomas pickering a stern new englander who detested france.
but hamilton recommended conciliation and adams agreed.
in an effort to stabilize relations adams appointed a bipartisan commission consisting of charles cotesworth pinckney the recently rejected minister john marshall a virginia federalist later chief justice of the supreme court and elbridge gerry a massachusetts republican but a friend of the president to negotiate with france.
when the americans arrived in paris in 1797 three 176 chapter 6 agents of the french foreign minister prince talleyrand demanded a loan for france and a bribe for french officials before any negotiations could begin.
pinckney responded no.
not a sixpence when adams heard of the incident he sent a message to congress denouncing the french insults and urging preparations for war.
he then turned the report of the american commissioners over to congress after deleting the names of the the xyz three french agents and designating them affair only as messrs x y and z when the re port was published it created widespread popular outrage at france s actions and strong support for the federalists response.
for nearly two years after the xyz affair as it became known the united states found itself en gaged in an undeclared war with france.
adams persuaded congress to cut off all trade with france and to authorize american vessels to capture french armed the quasi ships on the high seas.
in 1798 congress war created a department of the navy and ap propriated money for the construction of new warships.
the navy soon won a number of duels with french vessels and captured eighty five ships including armed merchantmen.
the united states also began cooperating closely with the british and became an ally of britain in the war with france.
in the end france chose to conciliate the united states before the conflict grew.
adams sent another commission to paris in 1800 and the new french government headed now by first consul napoleon bonaparte agreed to a treaty with the united states that canceled the old agreement of 1778 and established new commercial arrangements.
as a result the quasi war came to a reasonably peaceful end.
repression and protest the conflict with france helped the federalists increase their majorities in congress in 1798.
armed with this new strength alien and they be8an to consider ways to silence the sedition acts republican opposition.
the result was some of the most controversial legislation in american history the alien and sedition acts.
the alien act placed new obstacles in the way of foreigners who wished to become american citizens and it strengthened the presidents hand in dealing with aliens.
the sedition act allowed the government to prosecute those who engaged in sedition against the government.
in theory only libelous or treasonous activities were subject to prosecution but since such activities were open to widely varying definitions the law made it possible for the federal government to stifle almost any opposition.
the republicans interpreted the new laws as part of a federalist campaign to destroy them and fought back.
president adams signed the new laws but was cautious in implementing them.

the constitution and the new republic 177 prevented the government from launching a major crusade against the republicans.
but the legislation had a significant repressive effect nevertheless.
the alien act helped discourage immigration and encouraged some foreigners already in the country to leave.
and the administration made use of the sedition act to arrest and convict ten men most of them republican newspaper editors whose only crime had been to criticize the federalists in government.
republican leaders pinned their hopes for a reversal of the alien and sedition acts on the state legislatures.
the supreme virginia and court had not yet established its sole right kentucky to nullify congressional legislation and resolutions there were many republican leaders who believed that the states had that power too.
the republicans laid out a theory for state action in two sets of resolutions in 1798 1799 one written anonymously by jefferson and adopted by the kentucky legislature and the other drafted by madison and approved by the virginia legislature.
the virginia and kentucky resolutions as they were known used the ideas of john locke to argue that the federal government had been formed by a compact or contract among the states and possessed only certain delegated powers.
whenever the federal government exercised any undelegated powers its acts were unauthoritative void and of no force if the parties to the contract the states decided that the central government had exceeded those powers the kentucky resolution claimed they had the right to nullify the appropriate laws.
such claims emerged again in the south in the decades before the civil war.
the republicans did not win wide support for nullification only virginia and kentucky declared the congressional statutes void.
the republicans did however succeed in elevating their dispute with the federalists to the level of a national crisis.
by the late 1790s the entire nation was deeply and bitterly divided politically.
state legislatures at times resembled battlegrounds.
even the united states congress was plagued with violent disagreements.
in one celebrated incident in the chamber of the house of representatives matthew lyon a republican from vermont responded to an insult from roger griswold a federalist from connecticut by spitting in griswolds face.
griswold attacked lyon with his cane.
lyon fought back with a pair of fire tongs and the two men ended up wrestling on the floor.
the revolution of 1800 these bitter controversies shaped the 1800 presidential election.
adams and jefferson were again the opposing candidates.
but the the election campaign of 1800 was very different from of 1800 the one preceding it.
indeed it may have been the ugliest in american history.
adams and jefferson themselves displayed reasonable dignity but their supporters showed no such restraint.
the federalists accused jefferson of being a dangerous radical and his followers of being wild men who if they came to power would bring on a reign of terror comparable to that of the french revolution.
the republicans portrayed adams as a tyrant conspiring to become king and they accused the federalists of plotting to subvert human liberty and impose slavery on the people.
there was considerable personal invective as well.
for example it was during this campaign that the story of jeffersons romantic involvement with a slave woman on his plantation was first widely aired.
recent dna evidence has proven that the story was true.
the election was close and the crucial contest was in new york.
there aaron burr had mobilized an organization of congressional brawlers this cartoon lampoons a celebrated fight on the floor of the house of representatives in 1798 between matthew lyon a republican from vermont and roger griswold a federalist from connecticut.
the conflict began when griswold insulted lyon by attacking his military record in the revolutionary war.
lyon replied by spitting in griswolds face.
two weeks later griswold attacked lyon with his cane and lyon seized a pair of fire tongs and fought back.
that later scene is depicted and ridiculed here.
other members of congress are portrayed as enjoying the spectacle.

and through tammanys efforts the republicans carried the city by a large majority and with it the state.
jefferson was apparently elected.
but an unexpected complication soon jeopardized the republican victory.
the constitution called for each elector to vote by ballot for two persons the normal practice was for an elector to cast one vote for his partys presidential candidate and another for the vice presidential candidate.
to avoid a tie between jefferson and aaron burr the republican vice presidential candidate the republicans had intended for one elector to refrain from voting for burr.
but the plan went awry.
when the votes were counted jefferson and burr each had 73.
no candidate had a majority.
according to the constitution the house of representatives had to choose between the two leading candidates when no one had a majority in this case that meant deciding between jefferson and burr.
each state delegation would cast a single vote.
the new congress elected in 1800 with a republican majority was not to convene until after the inauguration of the president so it was the federalist congress that had to decide the question.
some federalists hoped to use the situation to salvage the election for their party others wanted to strike a bargain with burr and elect him.
but after a long deadlock several leading federalists most prominent among them alexander looking back the writing of the constitution of 1787 was the single most important political event in the history of the united states and a notable event in the political history of the modern world.
in creating a federal system of dispersed and divided authority authority divided among national and state governments authority divided among an executive a legislature and a judiciary the young nation sought to balance its need for an effective central government against its fear of concentrated and despotic power.
the ability of the delegates to the constitutional convention to compromise to produce the ultimate structure gave evidence of the deep yearning among them for a stable political system.
the same willingness to compromise allowed the greatest challenge to the ideals of the new democracy slavery to survive intact.
hamilton concluded that burr whom many suspected of having engineered the deadlock in the first place was too unreliable to trust with the presidency.
on the thirty sixth ballot jefferson was elected.
after the election of 1800 the only branch of the federal government left in federalist hands was the judiciary.
the adams administration spent its last months in office taking steps to make the partys hold on the courts secure.
by the judiciary act of the judiciary 180 x passed bythe lame duck con8ress the act of 1801 federalists reduced the number of supreme court justiceships by one but greatly increased the number of federal judgeships as a whole.
adams quickly appointed federalists to the newly created positions.
indeed there were charges that he stayed up until midnight on his last day in office to finish signing the new judges commissions.
these officeholders became known as the midnight appointments even so the republicans viewed their victory incorrectly as almost complete.
the nation they believed had been saved from tyranny.
a new era could now begin one in which the true principles on which america had been founded would once again govern the land.
the exuberance with which the victors viewed the future and the importance they attributed to the federalists defeat was evident in the phrase jefferson later used to describe his election the revolution of 1800 it remained to be seen how revolutionary it would really be.
the writing and ratifying of the constitution settled some questions about the shape of the new nation.
the first twelve years under the government created by the constitution solved others.
and yet by the year 1800 a basic disagreement about the future of the nation a disagreement personified by the differences between committed nationalist alexander hamilton and the self proclaimed champion of democracy thomas jefferson remained unresolved and was creating bitter divisions and conflicts within the political world.
the election of thomas jefferson to the presidency that year opened a new chapter in the nations public history.
it also brought to a close at least temporarily savage political conflicts that had seemed to threaten the nations future.

how did the napoleonic wars affect the united states.
what events and issues led to the war of 1812.
the jeffersonian vision setting the stage.
upiri thomas jefferson and his followers assumed control of the national government in 1801 as the champions of a distinctive vision of america a vision sharply different from that of andrew hamilton and other federalists.
they envisioned a society of sturdy independent farmers happily free from the workshops industrial towns and city mobs of europe.
they promoted a cultural outlook that emphasized localism and republican simplicity.
and they proposed a federal government of sharply limited power with most authority remaining at the state level.
almost nothing worked out as they planned.
for during their years in power the young republic was developing in ways that made much of their vision obsolete.
the american economy became steadily more diversified and complex.
growing cities surging commerce and expanding industrialism made the ideal of a simple agrarian society impossible to maintain.
american cultural life far from reflecting localism and simplicity reflected a vigorous and ambitious nationalism.
the republicans did manage to translate some of their political ideals into reality.
jefferson dismantled much of the bureaucratic power structure the federalists had erected in the 1790s and he helped ensure for a time that in many respects the federal government would remain a relatively unimportant force in american life.
yet he also frequently encountered situations that required him to exercise strong national authority as for example when he arranged the greatest single increase in the size of the united states in its history.
the republicans did not always like these nationalizing and modernizing trends but for the most part they adjusted to them and in doing so became agents of the transformation of american life they had once resisted.
the rise of cultural nationalism in many respects american cultural life in the early nineteenth century seemed to reflect the republican vision of the nation s future.
opportunities for education increased the nation s literary and artistic life began to free itself from european influences and american religion began to confront and adjust to the spread of enlightenment rationalism.
in other respects however the new culture was posing a serious challenge to republican ideals.
patterns of education central to the republican vision of america was the concept of a virtuous and enlightened citizenry.
jefferson himself called emphatically for a national crusade against ignorance republicans believed therefore in the establishment of a nationwide system of public importance of sch00js to create the educated electorate they believed a republic required.
acitizenrys a11 white male citizens the nation s prospective voters should they argued receive free education.
some states endorsed the principle of public education for all in the early years of the republic but none actually created a working system of free schools.
a massachusetts law of 1789 reaffirmed the colonial laws by which each town was obligated to support a school but there was little enforcement.
in virginia the state legislature ignored jeffersons call for universal elementary education and for advanced education for the gifted.
as late as 1815 not a single state had a comprehensive public school system.
instead schooling became primarily the responsibility of private institutions most of which were open only to those who could afford to pay for them.
in the south and in the mid atlantic states religious groups ran most of the schools.
in new england and elsewhere private private academies were usually secular many of them modeled on schools schooling founcjecj by the phillips family at andover massachusetts in 1778 and at exeter new hampshire three years later.
by 1815 there were thirty such private secondary schools in massachusetts thirty seven in new york and several dozen more scattered throughout 181.
chapter 4 further there was considerable overlapping and confusion of authority among the departments.
few of the london officials moreover had ever visited america few knew very much about conditions there.
what information they did gather came in large part from agents sent to england by the colonial assemblies to lobby for american interests.
these agents naturally did nothing to encourage interference with colonial affairs.
the best known of them benjamin franklin represented not only his own colony pennsylvania but also georgia new jersey and massachusetts.
it was not only the weakness of administrative authority in london and the policy of neglect that weakened englands hold on the colonies.
it was also the character of the royal officials in america among them the governors the collectors of customs and naval officers.
some of these officeholders were able and intelligent most were not.
appointments generally came as the result of bribery or favoritism not as a reward for merit.
many appointees remained in england and with part of their salaries hired substitutes to take their places in america.
such deputies received paltry wages and thus faced great temptations to augment their incomes with bribes.
few resisted the temptation.
customs collectors for example routinely waived duties on goods when merchants paid them to do so.
even honest and well paid officials usually found it expedient if they wanted to get along with their neighbors to yield to the colonists resistance to trade restrictions.
resistance to imperial authority centered in the colonial legislatures.
by the 1750s the american assemblies had claimed the right to levy taxes make appropriations approve appointments and pass laws for their respective colonies.
powerful their legislation was subject to veto by colonial the gvernor or the privy council.
but the legislatures assemblies had leverage over the governor through their control of the colonial budget and they could circumvent the privy council by repassing disallowed laws in slightly altered form.
the assemblies came to look upon themselves as little parliaments each practically as sovereign within its colony as parliament itself was in england.
the colonies divided despite their frequent resistance to the authority of london the colonists continued to think of themselves as loyal english subjects.
in many respects in fact they felt stronger ties to england than they did to one another.
tire and water an english traveler wrote are not more heterogeneous than the different colonies in north america new englanders and virginians viewed each other as something close to foreigners.
a connecticut man denounced the merchants of new york for their frauds and unfair practices while a new yorker condemned connecticut because of the low craft and cunning so incident to the people of that country only an accident of geography it seemed connected these disparate societies to one another.
an appeal for colonial unity this sketch one of the first american editorial cartoons appeared in benjamin franklins philadelphia newspaper the pennsylvania gazette on may 9 1754.
it was meant to illustrate the need for intercolonial unity and in particular for the adoption of franklin s albany plan.
the library of congress lc uszc4 5315 yet for all their differences the colonies could scarcely avoid forging connections with one another.
the growth of the colonial population produced an almost continuous line of settlement along the seacoast and led to the gradual construction of roads and the rise of intercolonial trade.
the colonial postal service helped increase communication.
in 1691 it had operated only from massachusetts to new york and pennsylvania.
in 1711 it extended to new hampshire in the north in 1732 to virginia in the south and ultimately all the way to georgia.
still the colonists were loath to cooperate even when in 1754 they faced a common threat from their old rivals the albany plan french and frances indian allies.
a conference of colonial leaders with delegates from pennsylvania maryland new york and new england was meeting in albany in that year to negotiate a treaty with the iroquois as the british government had advised the colonists to do.
the delegates stayed on to talk about forming a colonial federation for defense against the indians.
benjamin franklin proposed and the delegates tentatively approved a plan by which parliament would set up in america one general government for all the colonies except georgia and nova scotia.
each colony would retain its present constitution but would grant to the new general government such powers as the authority to govern all relations with the indians.
the central government would have a president general appointed and paid by the king just as colonial governors were and a legislature a grand council elected by the colonial assemblies.
war with the french and indians was already beginning when this albany plan was presented to the colonial assemblies.
none approved it.
everyone cries a union is necessary franklin wrote to the massachusetts governor but when they come to the manner and form of the union their weak noodles are perfectly distracted the empire in transition 101 the struggle for the continent in the late 1750s and early 1760s a great war raged through north america changing forever the balance of power both on the continent and throughout much of the world.
the war in america was part of a titanic struggle between england and france for dominance in world trade and naval power.
the british victory in that struggle known in europe as the seven years war rearranged global power and cemented englands role as the worlds great commercial and imperial nation.
it also cemented its control of most of the settled regions of north america.
in america however the conflict was the final stage in a long battle among the three principal powers in northeastern an uneasy north america the english the french balance of and the iroquois.
for more than a century power prior to the conflict known in america as the french and indian war these three groups had maintained an uneasy balance of power.
the events of the 1750s upset that balance produced a prolonged and open conflict and established a precarious dominance for the english societies throughout the region.
the french and indian war was important to the english colonists in america for another reason as well.
by bringing the americans into closer contact with british authority than ever before it raised to the surface some of the underlying tensions in the colonial relationship.
new france and the iroquois nation the french and the english had coexisted peacefully in north america for nearly a century.
but by the 1750s religious and commercial tensions began to produce new conflicts.
the crisis began in part because of the expansion of the french presence in america in the late seventeenth century a result of new sources louis xivs search for national unity and of conflict increased world power.
the lucrative fur trade drew immigrant french peasants deeper into the wilderness while missionary zeal drew large numbers of french jesuits into the interior in search of potential converts.
the bottomlands of the mississippi river valley attracted french farmers discouraged by the short growing season in canada.
by the mid seventeenth century the french empire in america comprised a vast territory.
louis joliet and father jacques marquette french explorers of the 1670s journeyed together by canoe from green bay on lake michigan as far south as the junction of the arkansas and mississippi rivers.
a year later rene robert cavelier sieur de la salle began the explorations that in 1682 took him to the delta of the mississippi where he claimed the surrounding country for france and named it louisiana in the kings honor.
subsequent traders and missionaries wandered to the southwest as far as the rio grande and the explorer pierre gaultier de varennes sieur de la verendrye pushed westward in 1743 from lake superior to a point within sight of the rocky mountains.
the french had by then revealed the outlines of and laid claim to almost the whole continental interior.
to secure their hold on these enormous claims they founded a string of widely separated communities fortresses france s missions and trading posts.
fort louis north bourg on cape breton island guarded the american approach to the gulf of st lawrence.
empire would be feudal lords established large estates seigneuries along the banks of the st lawrence river and on a high bluff above the river stood the fortified city of quebec the center of the french empire in america.
to the south was montreal and to the west sault sainte marie and detroit.
on the lower mississippi emerged plantations much like those in the southern colonies of english america worked by black slaves and owned by creoles white immigrants of french descent.
new orleans founded in 1718 to service the french plantation economy soon was as big as some of the larger cities of the atlantic seaboard biloxi and mobile to the east completed the string of french settlement.
but the french were not of course alone in the continental interior.
they shared their territories with a large and powerful indian population in regions now often labeled the middle grounds see p 60 and their relations with the natives were crucial to the shaping of their empire.
they also shared the interior with a growing number of english traders and settlers who had been moving beyond the confines of the colonial boundaries in the east.
both the french and the english were aware that the battle for control of north america would be determined in part by which group could best win the allegiance of native tribes as trading partners and at times as military allies.
the indians for their part were principally concerned with protecting their independence.
whatever alignments they formed with the european societies growing up around them were generally marriages of convenience determined by which group offered the most attractive terms.
the english with their more advanced commercial economy could usually offer the indians better and more plentiful goods.
but the french offered something that was often more important tolerance.
unlike the english settlers most of whom tried to impose their own social norms on the native americans they encountered the french settlers in the interior generally adjusted their own behavior to indian patterns.
french fur traders frequently married indian women and adopted tribal ways.
jesuit missionaries interacted comfortably with the natives and converted them to catholicism by the thousands without challenging most of their social customs.
by the mid eighteenth century therefore the french had better and closer relations with most of the tribes of the interior than did the english.
the most powerful native group however had a different relationship with the french.
the iroquois confederacy the five indian nations mohawk seneca cayuga onondaga and oneida that had formed a defensive alliance in the fifteenth 102.
chapter 4 century had been the most powerful tribal presence in the northeast since the 1640s when they had fought and won a the iroquois bitter war against the hurons.
once their confederacy major competitors were largely gone from the region the iroquois forged an important commercial relationship with the english and dutch along the eastern seaboard although they continued to trade with the french as well.
indeed the key to the success of the iroquois in maintaining their independence was that they avoided too close a relationship with either group and astutely played the french and the english against each other.
as a result they managed to maintain an uneasy balance of power in the great lakes region and beyond.
the principal area of conflict among these many groups was the ohio valley.
the french claimed it.
several competing indian tribes many of them refugees from lands farther east driven into the valley by the english expansion lived there.
english settlement was expanding into it.
and the iroquois were trying to establish a presence there as traders.
with so many competing groups jostling for influence the ohio valley quickly became a potential battleground.
european seeds of conflict anglo french conflicts as long as england and france remained at peace in europe and as long as the precarious balance in the north american interior survived the tensions among the english french and iroquois remained mild.
but after the glorious revolution in england the english throne passed to one of louis xivs principal enemies william iii who was also the stadholder chief magistrate of the netherlands and who had long opposed french expansionism.
williams successor queen anne the daughter of james ii ascended the throne in 1702 and carried on the struggle against france and its new ally spain.
the result was a series of anglo french wars that continued intermittently in europe for nearly eighty years.
the wars had important repercussions in america.
king williams war 1689 1697 produced a few indecisive clashes between the english and french in northern new england.
queen annes war which began in 1701 and continued for nearly twelve years generated substantial conflicts border fighting with the spaniards in the south as well as with the 7 7 kj the siege of louisbourg 1758 the fortress of louisbourg on cape breton island in nova scotia was one of the principal french outposts in eastern canada during the french and indian war.
it took a british fleet of 157 ships nearly two months to force the french garrison to surrender.

the new brunswick museum saint john nb french and their indian allies in the north.
the treaty of utrecht which brought the conflict to a close in 1713 transferred substantial areas of french territory in north america to the english including acadia nova scotia and newfoundland.
two decades later european rivalries led to still more conflicts in america.
disputes over british trading rights in the spanish colonies produced a war between england and spain and led to clashes between the british in georgia and the spaniards in florida.
it was in the context of this conflict that the last english colony in america georgia was founded in 1733 see pp.
the anglo spanish conflict soon merged with a much larger european war in which england and france lined up on opposite sides of a territorial dispute between frederick the great of prussia and maria theresa of austria.
the english colonists in america were soon drawn into the struggle which they called king georges war and between 1744 and 1748 they engaged in a series of conflicts with the french.
new englanders captured the french bastion at louisbourg on cape breton island but the peace treaty that finally ended the conflict forced them in bitter disappointment to abandon it.
in the aftermath of king georges war relations among the english french and iroquois in north america quickly deteriorated.
the iroquois in what in retrospect appears a major blunder began to grant trading concessions in the interior to english merchants.
in the context of the already tense anglo french relationship in america the decision to side with the british set in motion a chain of events disastrous for the iroquois confederacy.
the french feared that the english were using the concessions as a first step toward expansion into french lands which to some extent they were.
they began in 1749 to construct new fortresses in the ohio valley.
the english interpreted the french activity as a threat to their western settlements.
they protested and began making military preparations and building fortresses of their own.
the balance of power that the iroquois had striven to maintain for so long rapidly disintegrated and the five indian nations allied themselves with the british and assumed an essentially passive role in the conflict that followed.
for the next five years tensions between the english and the french increased.
in the summer of 1754 the governor of virginia sent a militia force under the command of an fort inexperienced young colonel george necessity washington into the ohio valley to challenge french expansion.
washington built a crude stockade fort necessity not far from the larger french outpost fort duquesne on the site of what is now pittsburgh.
after the virginians staged an unsuccessful attack on a french detachment the french countered with an assault on fort necessity trapping washington and his soldiers inside.
after a third of them died in the fighting washington surrendered.
that clash marked the beginning of what became the french and indian war the american part of the much larger seven years war that spread through europe at the same time.
it was the climactic event in the long anglo french struggle for empire.
the empire in transition 103 the great war for the empire the french and indian war lasted nearly nine years and it proceeded in three distinct phases.
the first phase lasted from the fort necessity debacle in 1754 until the expansion of the war to europe in 1756.
it was primarily a north american conflict which the english colonists managed largely on their own.
the british provided modest assistance during this period but they provided it so ineptly that it had little impact on the braddock struggle.
the british fleet failed to prevent defeated the landing of large french reinforcements in canada and the newly appointed commander in chief of the british army in america general edward braddock failed miserably in a major effort in the summer of 1755 to retake the crucial site at the forks of the ohio river where washington had lost the battle at fort necessity.
a french and indian ambush a few miles from the fort left braddock dead and his remaining forces in disarray.
the local colonial forces meanwhile were preoccupied with defending themselves against raids on their western settlements by the indians of the ohio valley.
virtually all of the tribes except the iroquois were now allied with the french having interpreted the defeat of the virginians at fort duquesne as evidence of british weakness.
even the iroquois who were nominally allied with the british remained fearful of antagonizing the french.
they engaged in few hostilities and launched no offensive into canada even though they had under heavy english pressure declared war on the french.
by late 1755 many english settlers along the frontier had withdrawn to the east of the allegheny mountains to escape the hostilities.
the second phase of the struggle began in 1756 when the governments of france and england formally opened hostilities and a truly international conflict the seven years war began.
in europe the war was marked by a realignment within the complex system of alliances.
france allied with its former enemy austria england joined frances former ally prussia.
the fighting now spread to the west indies india and europe.
but the principal struggle remained the one in north america where so far england had suffered nothing but frustration and defeat.
beginning in 1757 william pitt the english secretary of state and future prime minister began to transform the war william pitt effort in america by bringing it for the first takes charge time fully under british control.
pitt himself began planning military strategy for the north american conflict appointing military commanders and issuing orders to the colonists.
military recruitment had slowed dramatically in america after the defeat of braddock.
to replenish the army british commanders began forcibly enlisting colonists a practice known as impressment.
officers also began to seize supplies and equipment from local farmers and tradesmen and compelled colonists to offer shelter to british troops all generally without compensation.
the americans had long ago become accustomed to running their own affairs and had been fighting for over two years without the first global war m tj tj french and indian war in north america was only a small part of a much larger con 1 ll uflict.
known in europe as the seven years war it was one of the longest most widespread and most important wars in modern history.
ministers in this country where every part of the world affects us in some way or another should consider the whole globe the duke of newcastle wrote in britain in 1758 reflecting the international achievements and war aims of the british in the mid eighteenth century.
two centuries later winston churchill the former british prime minister wrote of the seven years war as the first world war.
in north america the war was a result of tensions along the frontiers of the british empire but a larger war resulted from conflicts among the great powers in europe.
it began in the 1750s with what historians have called a diplomatic revolution.
well established alliances between britain and the austro hungarian empire and between france and prussia collapsed replaced by new alliances that set britain and prussia against france and austria.
the instability that these changing alliances produced helped speed the european nations toward war.
the one thing that did not change was the continuing rivalry between britain and france.
the austrian british alliance collapsed because austria suffered a series of significant defeats at the hands of the prussians.
to the british government these failures suggested that the austro hungarian empire was now too weak to help britain balance french power.
as a result britain sought new partnerships with the rising powers of northern germany austria s enemies.
seeking protection from the power of their former british allies the austrians allied with france.
russia concerned about the austro hungarian empire s possible dominance in central europe allied with britain and prussia.
the tensions that these complicated realignments created eventually led to war just as the complicated alliances in europe in the early twentieth century helped produce world war i.
the european part of the war was a result of the continuing conflict between prussia and austria and the effect of those wars on the allies of both.
the seven years war soon spread across much of the world engaging not only most of the great powers in europe from england to russia but also the emerging 104 the empire in transition 105 colonial world india west africa the caribbean and the philippines as the powerful british navy worked to strip france and eventually spain of their valuable colonial holdings.
like most modern conflicts the seven years war was a struggle for economic power.
colonial possessions many european nations believed were critical to their future wealth well worth fighting for.
the war s outcome affected not only the future of america but also the distribution of power through much of the world.
it destroyed the french navy and much of the french empire and it elevated great britain to undisputed preeminence among colonial powers especially when at the conclusion of the war india and all of eastern north america fell firmly under english control.
the war also reorganized the balance of power in europe with britain now preeminent among the great powers and prussia later to become the core of modern germany rapidly rising in wealth and military power.
the seven years war was not only one of the first great colonial wars it was also one of the last great wars of religion.
it extended the dominance of protestantism in europe.
in what is now canada the war replaced french with british rule and thus catholic with protestant rule.
the vatican no longer a military power itself had relied on the great catholic empires spain france and austria hungary as bulwarks of the vatican s power and influence.
the shift of power toward protestant governments in europe and north america weakened the catholic church and reduced its geopolitical influence.
the conclusion of the seven years war strengthened britain and germany and weakened france.
but it did not provide any lasting solution to the rivalries among the great colonial powers.
in north america a dozen years after the end of the war the american revolution the origins of which were in many ways a direct result of the seven years war stripped the british empire of one of its most important and valuable colonial appendages.
by the time the american revolution came to an end the french revolution had sparked another lengthy period of war culminating in the napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century which once again redrew the map of europe and for a while the world.
much assistance or direction from the british.
they resented these new impositions and firmly resisted them at times as in a 1757 riot in new york city violently.
by early 1758 the friction between the british authorities and the colonists was threatening to bring the war effort to a halt.
beginning in 1758 therefore pitt initiated the third and final phase of the war by relaxing many of the policies that americans found oppressive.
he agreed to reimburse the colonists for all supplies requisitioned by the army.
he returned control over military recruitment to the colonial assemblies which resulted in an immediate and dramatic increase in enlistments.
and he dispatched large numbers of additional troops to america.
finally the tide of battle began to turn in england s favor.
the french had always been outnumbered by the british colonists after 1756 the french colonies suffered as well from a series of poor harvests.
as a result they were unable to sustain their early military successes.
by mid 1758 the british regulars who did the bulk of the fighting and the colonial militias were siege of seizing one french stronghold after another.

not all aspects of the struggle were as romantic as wolfes dramatic assault on quebec.
the british resorted at times to such brutal military expedients as population dispersal.
in nova scotia for example they uprooted several thousand french inhabitants whom they suspected of disloyalty and scattered them throughout the english colonies.
some of these acadians eventually made their way to louisiana where they became the ancestors of the present day cajuns.
elsewhere english and colonial troops inflicted even worse atrocities on the indian allies of the french for example offering scalp bounties to those who could bring back evidence of having killed a native.
the french and their indian allies retaliated and hundreds of families along the english frontier perished in brutal raids on their settlements.
peace finally came after the accession of george iii to the british throne and the resignation of pitt who unlike the new king wanted to continue hostilities.
the british achieved most of pitts aims nevertheless in the peace of peace of paris paris signed in 1763.
under its terms the french ceded to great britain some of their west indian islands and most of their colonies in india.
they also transferred canada and all other french territory east of the mississippi except new orleans to great britain.
they ceded new orleans and their claims west of the mississippi to spain thus surrendering all title to the main land of north america.
the french and indian war had profound effects on the british empire and the american colonies.
it greatly expanded englands territorial claims in the new world.

the empire in transition 107 leaders many of whom were contemptuous of the colonists for what they considered american military ineptitude during the war.
they were angry as well that the colonists had made so few financial contributions to a struggle waged largely for american benefit they were particularly bitter that some colonial merchants had been selling food and other goods to the french in the west indies throughout the conflict.
all these factors combined to persuade many english leaders that a major reorganization of the empire giving london increased authority over the colonies would be necessary in the aftermath of the war.
the war had an equally profound but very different effect on the american colonists.
it forced them for the first time to act in concert against a common foe.
the friction of 1756 1757 over british requisition and impressment policies and consequences of the seven years war the 1758 return of authority to the colonial assemblies established an important precedent in the minds of the colonists it seemed to confirm the illegitimacy of english interference in local affairs.
for thousands of americans the men who served in the colonial armed forces the war was an important socializing experience.
the colonial troops unlike the british regiments generally viewed themselves as part of a peoples army the relationship of soldiers to their units was the soldiers believed in some measure voluntary their army was a communal not a coercive or hierarchical organization.
the contrast with the british regulars whom the colonists widely resented for their arrogance and arbitrary use of power was striking and in later years the memory of that contrast helped to shape the american response to british imperial policies.
for the indians of the ohio valley the third major party in the french and indian war the british victory was disastrous.
those tribes that had allied themselves with the french had earned the enmity of the victorious english.
the iroquois confederacy which had allied with britain fared only slightly better.
english officials saw the passivity of the iroquois during the war a result of their effort to hedge their bets and avoid antagonizing the french as evidence of duplicity.
in the aftermath of the peace settlement the iroquois alliance with the british quickly unraveled and the iroquois confederacy itself began to crumble from within.
the iroquois nations would continue to contest the english for control of the ohio valley for another fifty years but increasingly divided and increasingly outnumbered they would seldom again be in a position to deal with their white rivals on terms of military or political equality.
the new imperialism with the treaty of 1763 england found itself at peace for the first time in more than fifty years.
but saddled with enormous debts and responsible for vast new lands in the new world the imperial government could not long avoid expanding its involvement in its colonies.
burdens of empire versus territorial imperialists the experience of the french and indian war suggested that such increased involvement would not be easy to achieve.
not only had the colonists proved so resistant to british control that pitt had been forced to relax his policies in 1758 but the colonial assemblies had continued after that to respond to british needs slowly and grudgingly.
unwilling to be taxed by parliament to support the war effort the colonists were generally reluctant to tax themselves as well.
defiance of imperial trade regulations and other british demands continued and even increased through the last years of the war.
the problems of managing the empire became more difficult after 1763 because of a basic shift in britains imperial design.
in the past the english had viewed their colonial em commercial pire primar y terms of trade they had opposed acquisition of territory for its own sake.
but by the mid eighteenth century a growing number of english and american leaders including william pitt and benjamin franklin were beginning to argue that land itself was of value to the empire because of the population it could support the taxes it could produce and the imperial splendor it would confer.
the debate between the old commercial imperialists and the new territorial ones came to a head at the conclusion of the french and indian war.
the mercantilists wanted england to return canada to france in exchange for guadeloupe the most commercially valuable of the french sugar islands in the west indies.
the territorialists however prevailed.
the acquisition of the french territories in north america was a victory for among others benjamin franklin who had long argued that the american people would need these vast spaces to accommodate their rapid and he believed limitless growth.
with the territorial annexations of 1763 the area of the british empire was suddenly twice as great as it had been and the problems of governing it were thus considerably more complex.
some british officials argued that the empire should restrain rapid settlement in the western territories.
to allow europeans to move into the new lands too quickly they warned would run the risk of stirring up costly conflicts with the indians.
restricting settlement would also keep the land available for hunting and trapping.
many colonists wanted to see the new territories opened for immediate development but they disagreed among themselves about who should control the western lands.
colonial governments made fervent and often conflicting claims of jurisdiction.
other colonists argued that control should remain in england and that the territories should be considered entirely new colonies unlinked to the existing settlements.
there were in short a host of problems and pressures that the british could not ignore.
at the same time the government in london was running out of options in its effort to find a way to deal with its staggering war debt.
landlords and merchants in england itself were objecting strenuously to increases in what they already considered 108 chapter 4 hudsons bay company carolina.

note also the string of forts established beyond the proclamation line.
how do the forts help to explain the efforts of the british to restrict settlement.
and how does the extent of actual settlement help explain why it was so difficult for the british to enforce their restrictions.
excessively high taxes.
the necessity of stationing significant numbers of british troops on the indian border after 1763 was britains adding even more to the cost of defending staggering the american settlements.
and the half war debt hearted response of the colonial assemblies to the war effort had suggested that in its search for revenue england could not rely on any cooperation from the colonial governments.
only a system of taxation administered by london the leaders of the empire believed could effectively meet englands needs.
at this crucial moment in anglo american relations with the imperial system in desperate need of redefinition george iii became king in 1760 on the death of his grandfather.
he brought two particularly unfortunate qualities to the office.
the empire in transition 109 first he was determined unlike his two predecessors to be an active and responsible monarch.
in part because of pressure from his ambitious mother he removed from power the long standing and stable coalition of whigs who had under pitt and others governed the empire for much of the century and whom the new king mistrusted.
in their place he created a new coalition of his own through patronage and bribes and gained an uneasy control of parliament.
the new ministries that emerged as a result of these changes were unstable each lasting in office only about two years.
second the king had serious intellectual and psychological limitations that compounded his political difficulties.
he suffered apparently from a rare disease that produced intermittent bouts of insanity.
indeed in the last years of his long reign he was according to most accounts deranged george iifs confined to the palace and unable to per shortcomings form any official functions.
yet even when george iii was lucid and rational which in the 1760s and 1770s was most of the time he was painfully immature he was only twenty two when he ascended the throne and insecure striving constantly to prove his fitness for his position but time and again finding himself ill equipped to handle the challenges he seized for george hi george iii was twenty two years old when he ascended the throne in 1760 and for many years almost all portraits of him were highly formal with the king dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes.
this less formal painting dates from much later in his reign after he had begun to suffer from the mental disorders that eventually consumed him.
after 1810 he was blind and permanently deranged barred from all official business by the regency act of 1811.
his son later king george iv served as regent in those years until he became king after his fathers death in 1820.
the granger collection new york himself.
the king s personality therefore contributed to both the instability and the intransigence of the british government during these critical years.
more immediately responsible for the problems that soon emerged with the colonies however was george grenville whom the king made prime minister in 1763.
grenville did not share his brother in law william pitts sympathy with the american point of view.
he agreed instead with the prevailing opinion within britain that the colonists had been too long indulged and that they should be compelled to obey the laws and to pay a part of the cost of defending and administering the empire.
he promptly began trying to impose a new system of control upon what had been a loose collection of colonial possessions in america.
the british and the tribes the western problem was the most urgent.
with the departure of the french settlers and traders from the english colonies moved immediately into the upper ohio valley.
the indians of the region objected to this intrusion and an alliance of tribes under the ottawa chieftain pontiac struck back.
to prevent an escalation of the fighting that might threaten western trade the british government issued a ruling the proclamation of 1763 forbidding settlers to advance beyond a line drawn along the appalachian mountains.
proclamation the proclamation of 1763 was appealing of 1763 to the british for several reasons.
it would allow london rather than the provincial governments and their land hungry constituents to control the westward movement of the white population.
hence westward expansion would proceed in an orderly manner and conflicts with the tribes which were both militarily costly and dangerous to trade might be limited.
slower western settlement would also slow the population exodus from the coastal colonies where englands most important markets and investments were.
and it would reserve opportunities for land speculation and fur trading for english rather than colonial entrepreneurs.
although the tribes were not enthusiastic about the proclamation which required them to cede still more land to the white settlers many tribal groups supported the agreement as the best bargain available to them.
the cherokee in particular worked actively to hasten the drawing of the boundary hoping to end white encroachments.
relations between the western tribes and the british improved in some areas after the proclamation partly as a result of the work of the indian superintendents the british appointed.
john stuart was in charge of indian affairs in the southern colonies and sir william johnson in the northern ones.
both were sympathetic to native american needs and lived among the tribes johnson married a mohawk woman mary brant who was later to play an important role in the american revolution.
in the end however the proclamation of 1763 failed to meet even the modest expectations of the native americans.
it had some effect in limiting colonial land speculation in the west and 110 chapter 4 in controlling the fur trade but on the crucial point of the line of settlement it was ineffective.
white settlers continued to white swarm across the boundary and to claim encroachment lands farther and farther into the ohio valley.
the british authorities tried repeatedly to establish limits to the expansion but continually failed to prevent the white colonists from pushing the line of settlement still farther west.
the colonial response the grenville ministry soon moved to increase its authority in the colonies in more direct ways.
regular british troops london announced would now be stationed permanently in america and under the mutiny act of 1765 the colonists were required to assist in provisioning and maintaining the army.
ships of the british navy were assigned to patrol american waters and search for smugglers.
the customs service was reorganized and enlarged.
royal officials were ordered to take up their colonial posts in person instead of sending substitutes.
colonial manufacturing was to be restricted so that it would not compete with the rapidly expanding industry of great britain.
the sugar act of 1764 designed in part to eliminate the illegal sugar trade between the continental colonies and the french and spanish west indies strengthened enforce sugar rnent of the duty on sugar while low currency ering the duty on molasses further and stamp damaging the market for sugar grown acts in the colonies.
it also established new vice admiralty courts in america to try accused smugglers thus depriving them of the benefit of sympathetic local juries.
the currency act of 1764 required the colonial assemblies to stop issuing paper money a widespread practice during the war and to retire on schedule all the paper money already in circulation.
most momentous of all the stamp act of 1765 imposed a tax on most printed documents in the colonies newspapers almanacs pamphlets deeds wills licenses.
the new imperial program was an effort to reapply to the colonies the old principles of mercantilism.
and in some ways it proved highly effective.
british officials were soon collecting more than ten times as much annual revenue from america as before 1763.
but the new policies created many more problems than they solved.
the colonists may have resented the new imperial regulations but at first they found it difficult to resist them effectively.
americans continued to harbor as many grievances against one another as against the authorities in london.
often the conflicts centered around tensions between the paxton boys established societies of the atlantic coast and the backcountry farther west whose residents often felt isolated from and underrepresented in the colonial governments.
these western settlers sometimes felt resentful because they lived closer to the worlds of the indian tribes than the societies of the east.
in regulator movement 1763 for example a band of people from western pennsylvania known as the paxton boys descended on philadelphia with demands for relief from colonial not british taxes and for money to help them defend themselves against indians the colonial government averted bloodshed only by making con cessions to them.
in 1771 a small scale civil war broke out as a result of the so called regulator movement in north carolina.
the regulators were farmers of the carolina upcountry who organized in opposition to the high taxes that local sheriffs appointed by the colonial governor collected.
the western counties were badly underrepresented in the colonial assembly and the regulators failed to win redress of their grievances there.
finally they armed themselves and began resisting tax collections by force.
to suppress the revolt governor william tryon raised an army of militiamen mostly from the eastern counties who defeated a band of 2 000 regulators in the battle of alamance.
nine on each side were killed and many others were wounded.
afterward six regulators were hanged for treason.
the bloodshed was exceptional but bitter conflicts within the colonies were not.
after 1763 however the new policies of the british government began to create common grievances among virtually all colonists that to some degree counterbalanced these internal divisions.
indeed there was something in the grenville program to antagonize everyone.
northern merchants believed they would suffer from restraints on commerce closing opportunities for manufacturing and increased taxes.
settlers in the northern backcountry resented the closing of the west to land speculation and fur trading.
southern planters in debt to english merchants feared having to pay additional taxes and losing their ability to ease their debts by speculating in western land.
professionals ministers lawyers professors and oth ers depended on merchants and planters for their livelihood and thus shared their concerns about the effects of english law.
small farmers the largest group in the colonies believed they would suffer from increased taxes and from the abolition of paper money which had enabled them to pay their loans.
workers in towns opposed the restraints on manufacturing.
the new restrictions came moreover at the beginning of an economic depression.
the british government by pouring postwar money into the colonies to finance the depression fighting had stimulated a wartime boom.
when the flow of funds stopped after the peace in 1763 an economic bust followed.
the imperial policies would many colonists feared doom them to permanent economic stagnation and a declining standard of living.
in reality most americans soon found ways to live with or circumvent the new british policies.
the american economy was not in fact being destroyed.
but economic anxieties were rising in the colonies nevertheless and they created a growing sense of unease.

britain gained a vast new territory formerly controlled by france canada and a large area west of the mississippi river thus more than doubling the size of the british empire in america rench possessions in the new world dwindled to a few islands in the caribbean.
spain continued to control a substantial empire in the north american interior.
the red line along the western borders f the english colonies represents the line of settlement established by britain in 1763.
white settlers were not permitted to move beyond that line.
why did the british wish to restrict settlement of the western lands.
eyes of the colonists far worse.
perhaps nowhere else in the late eighteenth century world did so large a proportion of the people take an active interest in public affairs.
that was partly because anglo americans were deeply attached to broad powers of self government and the colonists were determined to protect those powers.
the keys to self government they believed were the provincial assemblies and the key to the power of the provincial assemblies was their long established political consequences of the grenville program right to give or withhold appropriations for the colonial governments a right the british were now challenging.
home rule therefore was not something new and different that the colonists were striving to attain but something old and familiar that they desired to keep.
the movement to resist the new imperial policies a movement for which many would ultimately 112 chapter 4 preparing to meet the paxton boys the paxton boys were residents of western pennsylvania who were declared outlaws by the assembly in philadelphia after they launched an unauthorized attack on neighboring conestoga indians.

fotosearch getty images fight and die was at the same time democratic and conservative.
it was a movement to conserve liberties americans believed they already possessed.
stirrings of revolt by the mid 1760s a hardening of positions had begun in both england and america that would bring the colonies into increasing conflict with the mother country.
the victorious war for empire had given the colonists a heightened sense of their own importance and a renewed commitment to protecting their political autonomy.
but it had also given the british a strengthened belief in the need to tighten administration of the empire and use the colonies as a source of revenue.
the result was a series of events that more rapidly than anyone had imagined shattered the british empire in america.
the stamp act crisis even if he had tried prime minister grenville could not have devised a better method for antagonizing and unifying the effects of the colonies than the stamp act of 1765.
stamp act the sugar act of a year earlier had affected few people other than the new england merchants.
but the new tax fell on all americans and it evoked particular opposition from some of the most powerful members of the population.
merchants and lawyers were obliged to buy stamps for ships papers and legal documents.
tavern owners often the political leaders of their neighborhoods were required to buy stamps for their licenses.
printers the most influential group in distributing information and ideas in colonial society had to buy stamps for their newspapers and other publications.
the actual economic burdens of the stamp act were relatively light the stamps were not expensive.
what made the law offensive to the colonists was the precedent it seemed to set.
in the past americans had rationalized the taxes and duties on colonial trade as measures to regulate commerce not raise money.
some americans had even managed to persuade themselves that the sugar act which was in fact designed primarily to raise money was not fundamentally different from the traditional imperial duties.
the stamp act however they could interpret in only one way it was a direct attempt by england to raise revenue in the colonies without the consent of the colonial assemblies.
if this new tax passed without resistance the door would be open for more burdensome taxation in the future.
few colonists believed that they could do anything more than grumble and buy the stamps until the virginia house of the empire in transition 113 the alternatives of william burg in the aftermath of the boston tea party and in response to the coercive acts great britain enacted to punish the colonists the first continental congress called on americans to boycott british goods until the acts were repealed.
in this drawing a prosperous virginia merchant is seen signing a pledge to honor the nonimportation agreement not surprising given the alternative visible in the background of the picture tar and feathers hanging from a post labeled a cure for the refractory the colonial williamsburg foundation burgesses sounded what one colonist called a trumpet of sedition that aroused americans to action almost everywhere.
the trumpet was the collective voice of a group of young virginia aristocrats.
they hoped among other things to challenge the power of tidewater planters who in alliance with the royal governor dominated virginia politics.
foremost among the malcontents was patrick henry who had already achieved fame for his fiery oratory and his occasional defiance of british authority.
henry made a dramatic speech to the house of burgesses in may 1765 concluding with a vague prediction that if present policies were not revised george iii like earlier tyrants might lose his head.
there were shocked cries of treason and according to one witness an immediate apology from henry although many years later he was quoted as having made the defiant reply if this be treason make the most of it.
henry introduced a set of resolutions declaring that americans possessed the same rights as the english especially virginia the ri ht to be caxed by resolves representatives that virginians should pay no taxes except those voted by the virginia assembly and that anyone advocating the right of parliament to tax virginians should be deemed an enemy of the colony.
the house of burgesses defeated the most extreme of henrys resolutions.
all of them however were printed and circulated as the virginia resolves creating an impression in other colonies that the people of virginia were more militant than they actually were.
in massachusetts at about the same time james otis persuaded his fellow members of the colonial assembly to call an intercolonial congress for action against the new tax.
in october 1765 the stamp act congress met in new york with delegates from nine colonies and decided to petition the king and the two houses of parliament.
their petition conceded that americans owed to parliament all due subordination but it denied that the colonies could rightfully be taxed except through their own provincial assemblies.
meanwhile in several colonial cities crowds began taking the law into their own hands.
during the summer of 1765 sons of serious riots broke out up and down liberty the coast the largest of them in boston.
men belonging to the newly organized sons of liberty terrorized stamp agents and burned the stamps.
the agents themselves americans hastily resigned and the sale of stamps in the continental colonies ceased.
in boston a crowd also attacked such pro british aristocrats as the lieutenant governor thomas hutchinson who had privately opposed passage of the stamp act but who as an officer of the crown felt obliged to support it once it became law.
the protesters pillaged hutchinsons elegant house and virtually destroyed it.
the stamp act crisis was a dangerous moment in the relationship between the colonies and the british government.
but the crisis subsided largely because england backed down.
the authorities in london changed their attitude not because of the colonists defiance but because of economic pressure.
even before the stamp act many new englanders had stopped buying english goods to protest the sugar act of 1764.
now the colonial boycott spread and the sons of liberty intimidated colonists who were reluctant to participate in it.
the merchants of england feeling the loss of much of their colonial market begged parliament to repeal the stamp act and stories of unemployment poverty and discontent arose from english seaports and manufacturing towns.
the marquis of rockingham who succeeded grenville as prime minister in july 1765 tried to appease both the english merchants and the american colonists and he finally con parliament vinced the king to kill the stamp act.
retreats on march 18 1766 parliament re pealed it.
rockinghams opponents were strong and vociferous and they insisted that unless england compelled the colonists to obey the stamp act they would soon cease to obey any laws of parliament.
so on the same day to satisfy such critics parliament passed the declaratory act asserting parliaments authority over the colonies in all cases whatsoever in their rejoicing over the repeal of the stamp act most americans paid little attention to this sweeping declaration of power.
114 chapter 4 internal rebellions the conflicts with britain were not the only uprisings emerging in the turbulent years of the 1760s.
in addition to the stamp act crisis and other challenges to london there were internal rebellions that had their roots in the class system in new york and new england.
in the hudson valley in new york great estates had grown up whose owners had rented their land to small farmers.
the revolutionary fervor of the time led many of these tenants to demand ownership of the land they worked.
to emphasize their determination they stopped paying rents.
the challenge to landownership soon failed.
but other challenges to landownership continued in other colonies.
in vermont which still was governed by new york insurgent farmers challenged landowners many of them the same owners whom tenants had challenged on the hudson by taking up arms and demanding ownership of the land they torys day of judgment a mob of american patriots hoists a loyalist neighbor up a flagpole in this woodcut which is obviously sympathetic to the victim.
the crowd is shown as fat rowdy and drunken.
public humiliations of tories were not infrequent during the war.
more common however was seizure of their property.
library of congress worked.
ethan allen later a hero of the revolutionary war and himself a land speculator took up the cause of the green mountain farmers and accused the landowners of trying to enslave a free people allen eventually succeeded in making vermont into a separate state which broke up some of the large estates.
the townshend program the reaction in england to the rockingham governments policy of appeasement was less enthusiastic than it was in america.
english landlords a powerful political force angrily protested that the government had sacrificed the landed gentlemen to the interests of traders and colonists they feared that backing down from taxing the colonies would lead the government to increase taxes on them.
the king finally bowed to their pressure and dismissed the rockingham ministry.
to replace it he called upon the aging but still powerful william pitt to form a government.
pitt had been a strong critic of the stamp act and had a reputation in america as a friend of the colonists.
once in office however pitt now lord chatham was so hobbled by gout and at times so incapacitated by mental illness that the actual leadership of his administration fell to the chancellor of the exchequer charles townshend a brilliant flamboyant and at times reckless politician known to his contemporaries variously as the weathercock and champagne charlie among townshends first challenges was dealing with the continuing american grievances against parliament now mutiny act most notably the mutiny or quartering act of 1765 which required the colonists to provide quarters and supplies for the british troops in america.
the british considered this a reasonable requirement.
the troops were stationed in north america to protect the colonists from indian or french attack and to defend the frontiers lodging the troops in coastal cities was simply a way to reduce the costs to england of supplying them.
to the colonists however the law was another assault on their liberties.
they did not so much object to quartering the troops or providing them with supplies they had been doing that voluntarily ever since the last years of the french and indian war.
they resented that these contributions were now mandatory and they considered it another form of taxation without consent.
the massachusetts assembly refused to vote the mandated supplies to the troops.
the new york assembly soon did likewise posing an even greater challenge to imperial authority since the army headquarters were in new york city.
to enforce the law and to try again to raise revenues in the colonies townshend steered two inflammatory measures through parliament in 1767.
the first disbanded the internal and new yor assembly until the colo external nists agreed to obey the mutiny act.
taxes by singling out new york townshend thought he would avoid grenvilles the empire in transition 115 mistake of arousing all the colonies at once.
the second levied new taxes known as the townshend duties on various goods imported to the colonies from england lead paint paper and tea.
the colonists could not logically object to taxation of this kind townshend reasoned because it met standards they themselves had accepted.
benjamin franklin as a colonial agent in london trying to prevent the passage of the stamp act had long ago argued for the distinction between internal and external taxes and had denounced the stamp duties as internal taxation.
townshend himself had considered the distinction laughable but he was nevertheless imposing duties on what he believed were clearly external transactions.
yet townshends efforts to satisfy colonial grievances were to no avail.
he might call them external taxes but they were no more acceptable to colonial merchants than the stamp act.
their purpose americans believed was the same as that of the stamp act to raise revenue from the colonists without their consent.
and the suspension of the new york assembly far from isolating new york aroused the resentment of all the colonies.
they considered this assault on the rights of one provincial government a precedent for the annihilation of the rights of all of them.
the massachusetts assembly took the lead in opposing the new measures by circulating a letter to all the colonial governments urging them to stand up against every tax external or internal imposed by parliament.
at first the circular evoked little response in some of the legislatures and ran into strong opposition in pennsylvanias.
then lord hillsborough secretary of state for the colonies issued a circular letter of his own from london in which he warned that assemblies endorsing the massachusetts letter would be dissolved.
massachusetts defiantly reaffirmed its support for the circular.
the vote in the assembly was 92 to 17 and for a time ninety two became a patriotic rallying cry throughout british america.
the other colonies including pennsylvania promptly rallied to the support of massachusetts.
in addition to his other unpopular measures townshend tried to strengthen enforcement of commercial regulations in the colonies by among other things establishing a new board of customs commissioners in america.
townshend hoped the new board would stop the rampant corruption in the colonial customs houses and to some extent his hopes were fulfilled.
the new commissioners ended smuggling in boston their headquarters although smugglers continued to carry on a busy trade in other colonial seaports.
the boston merchants accustomed to loose enforcement of the navigation acts and doubly aggrieved now that the new commission was diverting the lucrative smuggling trade were colonial indignant and took the lead in organiz boycotts ing another boycott.
in 1768 the mer chants of philadelphia and new york joined them in a nonimportation agreement and later some southern merchants and planters also agreed to cooperate.
colonists boycotted british goods subject to the townshend duties and throughout the colonies american homespun and other domestic products became fashionable overnight while english luxuries fell from favor.
late in 1767 charles townshend suddenly died before the consequences of his ill conceived program had become fully apparent.
the question of dealing with colonial resistance to the townshend duties fell therefore to the new prime minister lord north.
hoping to break the nonimportation agreement and divide the colonists lord north secured the repeal of all the townshend duties except the tax on tea in march 1770.
the boston massacre competition for scarce employment the withdrawal of the townshend duties never had a chance to pacify colonial opinion.
before news of the repeal reached america an event in massachusetts raised colonial resentment to a new level of intensity.
the colonists harassment of the new customs commissioners in boston had grown so intense that the british government had placed four regiments of regular troops inside the city.
the presence of the redcoats was a constant affront to the colonists sense of their independence and a constant reminder of what they considered british oppression.
in addition british soldiers poorly paid and poorly treated by the army wanted jobs in their off duty hours and they competed with local workers in an already tight market.
clashes between them were frequent.
on the night of march 5 1770 a few days after a particularly intense skirmish between workers at a ship rigging factory and british soldiers who were trying to find work there a crowd of dockworkers liberty boys and others began pelting the sentries at the customs house with rocks and snowballs.
hastily captain thomas preston of the british regiment lined up several of his men in front of the building to protect it.
there was some scuffling one of the soldiers was knocked down and in the midst of it all apparently several british soldiers fired into the crowd killing five people among them a mulatto sailor crispus attucks.
this murky incident almost certainly the result of panic and confusion was quickly transformed by local resistance leaders into the boston massacre a graphic symbol of british oppression and brutality.
the victims became popular martyrs the event became the subject of many lurid and inaccurate accounts.
a famous engraving by paul revere widely reproduced and circulated falsely portrayed the massacre as a carefully organized calculated assault on a peaceful crowd.
a jury of massachusetts colonists found two british soldiers guilty of manslaughter and acquitted six others.
colonial pamphlets and newspapers however convinced many americans that all of the soldiers were guilty of official murder.
year after year resistance leaders marked the anniversary of the massacre with demonstrations and speeches.
the leading figure in fomenting public outrage over the boston massacre was samuel adams the most effective radical in the colonies.
adams a distant cousin of john adams 116 chapter 4 the boston massacre 1770 by paul revere this is one of many sensationalized engravings by revere and others of the conflict between british troops and boston laborers that became important propaganda documents for the patriot cause in the 1770s.
among the victims of the massacre listed by revere was crispus attucks probably the first black man to die in the struggle for american independence.
library of congress second president of the united states was born in 1722 and samuel adams was thus somewhat older than other leaders of colonial protest.
as a member of an earlier generation with strong ties to new englands puritan past he was particularly inclined to view public events in stern moral terms.
a failure in business he became an unflagging voice expressing outrage at british oppression.
england he argued had become a morass of sin and corruption only in america did public virtue survive.
he spoke frequently at boston town meetings and as one unpopular english policy followed another the townshend duties the placement of customs commissioners in boston the stationing of british troops in the city with its violent results his message attracted increasing support.
in 1772 he proposed the creation of a committee of correspondence in boston to publicize the grievances against england throughout the colony.
he became its first head.
other colonies followed massachusettss lead and a loose network of political organizations grew up that kept the spirit of dissent alive through the 1770s.
the empire in transition 117 the philosophy of revolt a superficial calm settled on the colonies for approximately three years after the boston massacre.
but the crises of the 1760s had helped arouse enduring ideological challenges to england and had produced powerful instruments for publicizing colonial grievances.
gradually a political outlook gained a following in america that would ultimately serve to justify revolt.
the ideas that would support the revolution emerged from many sources.
some were drawn from religious particularly puritan sources or from the political experiences of the colonies.
others came from abroad.
most important perhaps were the radical ideas of those in great britain who stood in opposition to their government.
some were scots who considered the english state tyrannical.
others were embittered country whigs who felt excluded from power and considered the existing political system corrupt and oppressive.
drawing from some of the great philosophical minds of earlier generations most notably john locke these english dissidents framed a powerful argument against their government.
central to this emerging ideology was a new concept of what government should be.
because humans were inherently corrupt and selfish government was necessary to protect individuals from the evil in one another.
but because any government was run by corruptible people the people needed safeguards against its possible abuses of power.
most people in both england and america had long considered the english constitution the best system ever devised to meet these necessities.
by distributing power among the three elements of society the monarchy the aristocracy and the common people the english political system ensured that no individual or group could exercise authority unchecked by another.
yet by the mid seventeenth century dissidents in both england and america had become convinced that the constitution was in danger.
a single center of power the king and his ministers was becoming so powerful that it could not be effectively checked.
the system the dissidents believed was becoming a corrupt and dangerous tyranny.
such arguments found little sympathy in most of england.
the english constitution was not a written document or a fixed set of unchangeable rules.
it was a general sense of the way things are done and most people in england were willing to accept changes in it.
americans by contrast drew from their experience with colonial charters in which the shape and powers of government were permanently inscribed on paper.
they resisted the idea of a flexible changing set of basic principles.
one basic principle americans believed was the right of people to be taxed only with their own consent a belief that gradually took shape in the widely repeated slogan no taxation without representation this clamor about representation made little sense to the english.
according to englands balanced constitution cruel fate of the loyalists this british cartoon published near the end of the american revolution shows three indians representing american revolutionaries murdering six loyalists four by hanging one by scalping and one appealing to fate about to be killed by an axe wielding native.
by using indians to represent anglo american soldiers the british were trying to equate the presumed savagery of native americans with the behavior of the revolutionaries.
the library of congress lc usz62 1540 english constitutional theory members of parliament did not represent individuals or particular geographic areas.
instead each member represented the interests of the whole nation and indeed the whole empire no matter where the member came from.
the many boroughs of england that had no representative in parliament the whole of ireland and the colonies thousands of miles away all were thus represented in the parliament at london even though they elected no representatives of their own.
this was the theory of virtual representation.
but americans drawing from their experiences with their town meetings and their colonial assemblies believed in actual representation every community was entitled to its own representative elected by the people of that community and directly responsible to them.
since the colonists had none of their own representatives in parliament it followed that they were not represented there.
instead americans believed that the colonial assemblies played the same role within the colonies that parliament did within england.
the british empire the americans began to argue was a sort of federation of commonwealths each with its own legislative body all tied together by common loyalty to the king.
such ideas illustrated a fundamental difference of opinion between england and america over the nature of sovereignty virtual versus over the question of where ultimate power lay.
by arguing that parliament had the right to legislate for england and for the empire as a whole but that only the provincial assemblies could legislate for the individual colonies americans were in effect arguing for a division of sovereignty.
parliament would be sovereign in some matters the assemblies would be sovereign in others.
to the british such an argument was absurd.
in any system of government actual representation 118 chapter 4 there must be a single ultimate authority.
and since the empire was in their view a single undivided unit there could be only one authority within it the english government of king and parliament.
the tea excitement the relatively calm first years of the 1770s disguised a growing sense of resentment at the increasingly heavy handed british enforcement of the navigation acts.
the customs commissioners who remained in the colonies despite the repeal of the townshend duties were mostly clumsy intrusive and arrogant officials.
they harassed colonial merchants and seamen constantly with petty restrictions and they also enriched themselves through graft and illegal seizures of merchandise.
colonists also kept revolutionary sentiment alive through writing and talking.
dissenting leaflets pamphlets and books circulated widely through the colonies.
in towns and cities revolutionary men gathered in churches schools discourse town squares and above all in taverns see patterns of popular culture pp.
122 123 to discuss politics and express their growing disenchantment with english policy.
the rise of revolutionary ideology was not simply a result of the ideas of intellectuals.
it was also a product of a social process by which ordinary people heard discussed and absorbed new ideas.
the popular anger lying just beneath the surface was also visible in occasional acts of rebellion.
at one point colonists seized a british revenue ship on the lower delaware river.
and in 1772 angry residents of rhode island boarded the british schooner gaspee set it afire and sank it in narragansett bay.
the british response to the gaspee affair further inflamed american opinion.
instead of putting the accused attackers on trial in colonial courts the british sent a special commission to america with power to send the defendants back to england for trial.
what finally revived the revolutionary fervor of the 1760s however was a new act of parliament one that the english government had expected to be relatively uncontroversial.
it involved the business of selling tea.
in 1773 britain s east india company which had an official monopoly on trade with the far east was on the verge of bankruptcy and sitting on large stocks of tea that it could not sell in england.
in an effort to save the company the government passed the tea act of 1773 which gave the company the right to export its merchandise directly to the colonies without paying any of the navigation taxes that were imposed on the colonial merchants who had traditionally served as the middlemen in such transactions.
with these privileges the east india company could undersell american merchants and monopolize the colonial tea trade.
the tea act angered many colonists for several reasons.
first it enraged influential colonial merchants who feared being replaced and bankrupted by a powerful monopoly.
the east india company s decision to grant franchises to certain american merchants for the sale of its tea created further re the tea act sentments among those excluded from this lucrative trade.
more important however the tea act revived american passions about the issue of taxation without representation.
the law provided no new tax on tea.
but it exempted the east india company from having to pay the normal customs duties.

british prime minister lord north assumed that most colonists would welcome the new law because it would reduce the price of tea to consumers by removing the middlemen.
but resistance leaders in america argued that it was another insidious example of the results of an unconstitutional tax.
many colonists responded by boycotting tea.
the boycott was an important event in the history of colonial resistance.
unlike earlier protests most of which had involved small numbers of people the boycott mobilized large segments of the population.
it also helped link the colonies in a common experience of mass popular protest.
particularly important to the movement were the activities of colonial women who were among the principal consumers of tea and now became leaders of the effort to boycott it.
women had played a significant role in resistance activities from the beginning.
several women most prominently mercy otis warren had been important in writing the dissident literature in warrens case satirical plays that did much to fan colonial resentments in the 1760s.
women had participated actively in anti british riots and crowd activities in the 1760s they had formed an informal organization the daughters of liberty that occasionally mocked their male counterparts as insufficiently militant.
now as the sentiment for a boycott grew some women mobilized as never before determined as the daughters of liberty had written that rather than freedom well part with our tea in the last weeks of 1773 with strong popular support leaders in various colonies made plans to prevent the east india company from landing its cargoes in colonial ports.
in philadelphia and new york city determined colonists kept the tea from leaving the companys ships.
in charles town they stored it in a public warehouse.
in boston after failing to turn back the three ships in the harbor local patriots staged a spectacular drama.
on the evening of december 16 1773 three companies of fifty men each masquerading as mohawks passed through a tremendous crowd of spectators which served to protect them from official interference went aboard the three ships broke open the tea chests and heaved them into the harbor.
as the electrifying news of the boston yea party spread other seaports followed the example and staged similar acts of resistance.
when the bostonians refused to pay for the property they had destroyed george iii and lord north decided on a policy of coercion to be applied only against massachusetts the chief center of resistance.
in four acts of 1774 parliament closed the port of boston drastically reduced colonial self government permitted royal officers to be tried in other colonies or in england when accused of crimes and provided for the quarter boston tea party ing of troops in the colonists barns and empty houses.
parliament followed these coercive acts or as they were more widely known in america intolerable acts with the cofrcvf actc quebec act which was separate from coercive acts quite different in purpose.
its object was to provide a civil government for the paying the exciseman this eighteenth century satirical drawing by a british artist depicts bostonians forcing tea down the throat of a customs official whom they have tarred and feathered.

gl archive alamy french speaking roman catholic inhabitants of canada and the illinois country.
the law extended the boundaries of quebec to include the french communities between the ohio and mississippi rivers.
it also granted political rights to roman catholics and recognized the legality of the roman catholic church within the enlarged province.
in many ways it was a tolerant and long overdue piece of legislation.
but in the inflamed atmosphere of the time many people in the thirteen english speaking colonies considered it a threat.
they were already alarmed by rumors that the church of england was scheming to appoint a bishop for america who would impose anglican authority on all the various sects.
since the line between the church of england and the church of rome had always seemed to many americans dangerously thin the passage of the quebec act convinced some of them that a plot was afoot in london to subject americans to the tyranny of the pope.
those interested in western lands moreover believed that the act would hinder westward expansion.
the coercive acts far from isolating massachusetts made it a martyr to residents of other colonies and sparked new resistance up and down the coast.
colonial consequences legislatures passed a series of resolves i w consider the source 4 tea parties the boston tea party of 1773 was a revolt against taxation without representation.
the poem tea destroyed by indians celebrates the action of the boston tea party expresses the colonists resentments and complaints against the distant london government and calls upon boston patriots to continue to resist british actions.
the twenty first century tea party movement became prominent in 2009.

taverns in revolutionary massachusetts colonial massachusetts as in many other american colonies in the 1760s and 1770s taverns or public houses or pubs as they came to be known were crucial to the development of popular resistance to british rule.
the puritan culture of new england created some resistance to taverns and there were continuing efforts by reformers to regulate or close them to reduce the problems caused by public drunkenness lewd behavior and anarchy.
but as the commercial life of the colonies expanded and as increasing numbers of people began living in towns and cities tav erns became a central institution in american social life and eventually in its political life as well.
taverns were appealing of course because they provided alcoholic drinks in a culture where the craving for alcohol and the extent of drunkenness was very high.
but taverns had other attractions as well.
there were few other places where people could meet and talk openly in public and to many colonists the life of the tavern came to seem the most democratic experience available to them.
gradually many began to see the attacks on the public houses as efforts to increase the power of existing elites and suppress the freedoms of ordinary people.
the tavern was a mostly male institution just as politics was considered a mostly male concern.
and so the fusion of male camaraderie and political discourse emerged naturally out of the tavern culture.
as the revolutionary crisis deepened taverns and pubs became the central meeting places for discussions of the ideas that fueled resistance to british polices.
educated and uneducated men alike joined in animated discussions of events.
those who could not read and there were many could learn about the contents of revolutionary pamphlets from listening to tavern discussions.
they could join in the discussion of the new republican ideas emerging in the americas by participating in tavern celebrations of for example the anniversaries of resistance to the stamp act.
those anniversaries inspired elaborate toasts in public houses throughout the colonies.
such toasts were the equivalents of political speeches and illiterate men could learn much from them about the political concepts that were circulating through the colonies.

womens groups throughout the colonies mobilized to extend the boycotts of british goods and to create substitutes for the tea textiles and other commodities they were shunning.
cooperation and war revolutions do not simply happen.
they need organizers and leaders.
beginning in 1765 colonial leaders developed a variety of organizations for converting popular discontent into direct action organizations that in time formed the basis for an independent government.
new sources of authority the passage of authority from the royal government to the colonists themselves began on the local level where the tradition of autonomy was already strong.
in colony after colony local institutions responded to the resistance movement by simply seizing authority on their own.
at times entirely new extralegal bodies emerged semispontaneously and began to perform some of the functions of government.
in massachusetts in 1768 for example samuel adams called a convention of delegates from the towns of the colony to sit in place of the general court which the governor had dissolved.
the sons of liberty which adams had helped organize in massachusetts and which sprang up elsewhere as well became another source of power.
its members at times formed disciplined bands of vigilantes who made certain that all colonists respected the boycotts and other forms of popular resistance.
and in most colonies committees of prominent citizens began meeting to perform additional political functions.
the most effective of these new groups were the committees of correspondence which adams had inaugurated in first massachusetts in 1772.
virginia later continental established the first intercolonial com congress mittees of correspondence which made possible continuous cooperation among the colonies.
virginia also took the greatest step of all toward united action in 1774 when after the royal governor dissolved the assembly a special session met in the raleigh tavern at williamsburg declared that the intolerable acts menaced the liberties of every colony and issued a call for a continental congress.
variously elected by the assemblies and by extralegal meetings delegates from all the thirteen colonies except georgia were present when in september 1774 the first 122 tfl taverns were important sources of information in an age before any wide distribution of newspapers.
tavernkeepers were often trusted informants and confidants to the sons of liberty and other activists and they were fountains of information about the political and social turmoil of the time.
taverns were also the settings for political events.
in 1770 for example a report circulated through the taverns of danvers massachusetts about a local man who was continuing to sell tea despite the colonial boycott.
the sons of liberty brought the seller to the bell tavern and persuaded him to sign a confession and apology before a crowd of defiant men almost all politicians found it necessary to visit taverns in colonial massachusetts if they wanted any real contact with the public.

library of congress continental congress convened in carpenters hall in philadelphia.
they made five major decisions.
first in a very close vote they rejected a plan proposed by joseph galloway of pennsylvania for a colonial union under british authority much like the earlier albany plan.
second they endorsed a statement of grievances whose tortured language reflected the conflicts among the delegates between moderates and extremists.
the statement seemed to concede parliaments right to regulate colonial trade and addressed the king as most gracious sovereign but it also included a more extreme demand for the repeal of all the oppressive legislation passed since 1763.
third they approved a series of resolutions recommending among other things that the colonists make military preparations for defense against possible attack by the british troops in boston.
fourth they agreed to nonimportation nonexportation and nonconsumption as means of stopping all trade with great britain and they formed a continental association to enforce the agreements.

revere was captured just west of lexington but dawes escaped and returned to boston.
the next morning british forces moved out of boston toward lexington where they met armed american minutemen on the lexington common and exchanged fire.
the british dispersed the americans in lexington.

but their efforts the conciliatory propositions were in vain.
lord north finally won approval early in 1775 for a series of measures known as the conciliatory propositions but they were far less conciliatory than the approaches burke or chatham had urged.

one british soldier described the nightmarish withdrawal we were fired on from houses and behind trees the country was full of hills woods stone walls which the rebels did not fail to take advantage of.
anne s k brown military collection brown university library in boston general thomas gage commanding the british garrison knew of the military preparations in the countryside general thomas but considered his army too small to do gage anything until reinforcements arrived.
he resisted the advice of less cautious officers who assured him that the americans would never dare actually to fight that they would back down quickly before any show of british force.
major john pitcairn for example insisted that a single small action such as the burning of a few towns would set everything to rights general gage still hesitated when he received orders from england to arrest the rebel leaders sam adams and john hancock known to be in the vicinity of lexington.
but when gage heard that the minutemen had stored a large supply of gunpowder in concord eighteen miles from boston he finally decided to act.
on the night of april 18 1775 he sent a detachment of about 1 000 soldiers out from boston on the road to lexington and concord.
he intended to surprise the colonials and seize the illegal supplies without bloodshed.
but patriots in boston were watching the british movements closely and during the night two horsemen william dawes and paul revere rode out to warn the villages and farms.
when the british troops arrived in lexington the next day several dozen minutemen awaited them on the town common.
shots were fired and minutemen fell eight of them were killed and ten more wounded.
advancing to concord the british discovered that the americans had hastily removed most of the powder supply but the british burned what was left of it.
all along the road from concord back to boston farmers hiding behind trees rocks and stone fences harassed the british with continual gunfire.
by the end of the day the british had lost almost three times as many men as the americans.
the first shots the shots heard round the world as americans later called them had been fired.
but who had fired them.
according to one of the minutemen at lexington major pitcairn had shouted to the colonists on his arrival disperse ye rebels when the americans ignored the command he had given the order to fire.
british officers and soldiers told a different story.
they claimed that the minutemen had fired first that only after seeing the flash of american guns had the british begun to shoot.
whatever the truth the rebels succeeded in circulating their account well ahead of the british version adorning it with lurid tales of british atrocities.
the effect was to rally to the rebel cause thousands of colonists north and south who previously had had little enthusiasm for 126 chapter 4 war.
jeremy lister a minuteman in lexington wrote later we got all over the bay and landed on the opposite shore betwixt twelve and one oclock and was on our march by one which was at first through some swamps and slips of the sea till we got into the road leading to lexington soon after which the country people begun to fire their alarm guns light their beacons to raise the country.

many saw them as simply another example of the tensions that thf revolution had been afflictin anglo american re begins lations for years.
but whether they rec ognized it at the time or not the british and the americans had taken a decisive step.
the war for independence had begun.
looking back when the french and indian war ended in 1763 it might have seemed reasonable to expect that relations between the english colonists in america and great britain itself would have been cemented more firmly than ever.
america and britain had fought together in a great war against the french and their indian allies.
they had won impressive victories.
they had vastly expanded the size of the british empire.
but the end of the french and indian war altered the imperial relationship forever in ways that ultimately drove americans to rebel against english rule and begin another war for independence.
to the british the lesson of the war was that the colonies in america needed firmer control from london.
the empire was now much bigger and it needed better administration.
the war had produced great debts and the americans among the principal beneficiaries of the war should help pay them.
and so for more than a decade after the end of the fighting the british tried one strategy after another to tighten control over and extract money from the colonies all of them in the end failures.
to the colonists this effort to tighten imperial rule was both a betrayal of the sacrifices they had made in the war and a challenge to their long developing assumptions about the rights of english people to rule themselves.
gradually white americans came to see in the british policies evidence of a conspiracy to establish tyranny in the new world.
and so throughout the 1760s and 1770s the colonists developed ever more overt and effective forms of resistance.
by the time the first shots were fired in the american revolution in 1775 britain and america once bonded so closely to one another that most white americans considered themselves just as english as any resident of london had come to view each other as two very different societies.
their differences which came to seem irreconcilable propelled them into a war that would change the course of history.

one was the military conflict with great britain.
the second was a political battle within america.
the military conflict was by the standards of later wars relatively modest.
by the standards of its own day however it was unusually savage pitting not only army against army but also the civilian population against an external force.
the shift of the war from a traditional conventional struggle to a new kind of conflict a revolutionary war for liberation made it possible for the american army finally to defeat the vastly more powerful british.
at the same time americans were wrestling with the great political questions the conflict necessarily produced first whether to demand independence from britain second how to structure the new nation they had proclaimed and third how to deal with questions the revolution had raised about slavery the rights of indians the role of women and limits of religious tolerance in the new american society.
only the first question had been resolved when the british surrendered at yorktown in 1781.
but by then the united states had already established itself as a new kind of nation one dedicated to enlightened ideals.
neither at the time nor later did the united states always follow those ideals.
at the same time that revolutionaries were celebrating the rights of man they were consolidating the enslavement of african americans depriving loyalists american colonists who supported the british during the revolution of rights and property barring women from participation in public life and denying indian tribes the limited rights the british had accorded them.
yet despite these contradictions they believed that the nation should try to live up to the ideals proclaimed in the revolution as a continuing influence on the future history of the united states.
the states united although many americans had been anticipating a military conflict with britain for months even years the actual beginning of hostilities in 1775 found the colonies generally unprepared for the enormous challenges awaiting them.
america was an unformed nation with a population less than a third as large as the 9 million of great britain and with vastly inferior economic and military resources.
it faced the task of mobilizing for war against the worlds greatest armed power at the same time americans were deeply divided about what they were fighting for.
defining american war aims three weeks after the battles of lexington and concord the second continental congress met in the state house in philadelphia with delegates from every colony except georgia which sent no representative until the following autumn.
the members agreed to support the war but they disagreed at times profoundly about its purpose.
at one pole was a group led by the adams cousins john and samuel richard henry lee of virginia and others who favored complete independence from great britain.
at the other pole was a group led by such moderates as john dickinson of pennsylvania who hoped for modest reforms in the imperial relationship that would permit an early reconciliation with great britain.
most of the delegates tried to find some middle ground between these positions.
they demonstrated their uncertainty in two very different declarations which they adopted in quick succession.
they approved one last conciliatory appeal to the king the olive branch ch petition which the british government rejected.
then on july 6 1775 they adopted an antagonistic declaration of the causes and necessity of taking up arms it proclaimed that the british government had left the american people with only two alternatives unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers or resistance by force 129.
130 chapter 5 the attitude of much of the public mirrored that of the congress.
at first most americans believed they were fighting not for independence but for a redress of grievances within the british empire.
during the first year of fighting however many of them began to change their minds for several reasons.
first the costs of the war human and financial were so high that the original war aims began to seem too modest to justify them.
second what lingering affection american patriots retained for england greatly diminished when the british began trying to recruit indians african slaves and foreign mercenaries the hated hessians against them.
third and most important colonists came to believe that the british government was forcing them toward independence by rejecting the olive branch petition and instead enacting a prohibitory act it closed the colonies to all overseas trade and made no concessions to american demands except an offer to pardon repentant rebels.
the british enforced the prohibitory act with a naval blockade of colonial ports.
but the growing support for independence remained to a large degree unspoken until january 1776 when an impassioned pamphlet appeared that galvanized many americans.
it was called simply common sense.
its author unmentioned on the title page was thirty eight year old thomas paine who thomas paine paine emigrated to america in 1774 and quickly became involved in the revolutionary circles in philadelphia.
early in 1776 he published an anonymous pamphlet titled common sense which called for an end to british rule in america.
he served in the american army during the revolution in new jersey while also writing additional tracts promoting independence.
in later years he joined the french revolution and published the rights of man in 1791 1792.
corbis had emigrated from england to america fifteen months before.
r he barely survived the transatlantic voyage common sense y to america.
for much of his life he lived in poverty and he was ostracized because he openly ridiculed christianity.
but his pamphlets influenced the developing ideals of the united states.
a failure in various trades paine now proved a brilliant success as a revolutionary propagandist.
his common sense helped change the american outlook toward the war.
paine wanted to turn the anger of americans away from the specific parliamentary measures they were resisting and toward what he considered the root of the problem the english constitution itself.
it was not enough he argued for americans to continue blaming their problems on particular ministers or even on parliament.
it was the king and the system that permitted him to rule that was to blame.
it was he argued simple common sense for americans to break completely with a government that could produce so corrupt a monarch as george iii a government that could inflict such brutality on its own people a government that could drag americans into wars in which america had no interest.
the island kingdom of england was no more fit to rule the american continent paine claimed than a satellite was fit to rule the sun.
the decision for independence common sense sold more than 100 000 copies in its first few months.
to many of its readers it was a revelation.
although sentiment for independence remained far from unanimous support for the idea grew rapidly in the first months of 1776.
at the same time the continental congress was moving slowly and tentatively toward a final break with england.
it declared american ports open to the ships of all nations except great britains.
it entered into communication with for eign powers it recommended to the various colonies that they establish new governments independent of the british empire as most already were doing.
congress also appointed a commit tee to draft a formal declaration of independence.
on july 2 1776 it adopted a resolution that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states thai jhe they are absolved from all allegiance tc declaration of r e british crown and that all politica independence connexion between them and the state o great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.
two days later on july 4 congress approved the declaration of independence which provided the formal justi fications for the actions the delegates had in fact taken twc days earlier.
thomas jefferson a thirty three year old delegate from virginia wrote most of the declaration with help from benjamin franklin and john adams.
as adams later observed jefferson said little in the document that was new.
its power lay in the eloquence with which it expressed beliefs already widespread in america.
in particular it repeated ideas that had been voiced throughout the colonies in the preceding months in the form of at least ninety local declarations of independence declarations drafted up and down the coast by town meetings artisan and militia organizations county officials grand juries sons of liberty and colonial assemblies.
jefferson borrowed heavily from these texts both for the ideas he expressed and to some extent for the precise language he used.
the document was in two parts.
in the first the declaration restated the familiar contract theory of john locke that governments were formed to protect the rights of life liberty and property jefferson gave the theory a more idealistic tone by replacing property with the pursuit of happiness in the second part the declaration listed the alleged crimes of the king who with the backing of parliament had violated his contract with the colonists and thus had forfeited all claim to their loyalty.
the declarations ringing endorsement of the idea that all men are created equal a phrase borrowed from an earlier document by jeffersons fellow virginian george mason later helped inspire movements of liberation and reform of many kinds in the united states and abroad among them the french revolutions own declaration of the rights of man.
more immediately the declaration and its bold claim that the american colonies were now a sovereign nation the united states of america led to increased foreign aid for the struggling rebels and prepared the way for frances intervention on their side.
the declaration also encouraged american patriots as those opposing the british called themselves to fight on and to reject the idea of a peace that stopped short of winning independence.
at the same time it created deep divisions within american society.
responses to independence at the news of the declaration of independence crowds in philadelphia boston and other places gathered to cheer fire guns and cannons and ring church bells.
but there were many in america who did not rejoice.
some had disapproved of the war from the beginning.
others had been willing to support it only so long as its aims did not conflict with their basic loyalty to the king.
such people were a minority but a substantial one.
they called themselves loyalists supporters of independence called them tories.
in the aftermath of the declaration of independence the colonies began to call themselves states a reflection of their belief that each province was now in some respects a separate and sovereign entity.
even before the declaration colonies were beginning to operate independently of royal authority.
divided the parliament ln london had suspended americans representative government in america.
that suspension did not end colonial self government.
it increased it since the colonial assemblies continued to meet now independent of imperial law.
after the declaration of 1776 the former colonies marked their independence by writing formal constitutions for themselves.
by 1781 most of the new states had produced such constitutions which established republican governments.
some of these constitutions survived for many decades without signif icant change.
the american revolution 131 at the national level however the process of forming a government was more halting and less successful.
for a time americans were uncertain whether they even wanted a real national government the continental congress had not been much more than a coordinating mechanism and virtually everyone considered the individual colonies now states the real centers of authority.
yet fighting a war required a certain amount of central direction.
americans began almost immediately to do something they would continue to do for more than two centuries balance the commitment to state and local autonomy against the need for some centralized authority.
in november 1777 congress adopted the articles of confederation which were not finally ratified until 1781.
they did little more than confirm the weak decentralized system already in operation.
the continental congress articles of would survive as the chief coordinating confederation agency of the war effort.
its powers over the individual states would be very limited.
indeed the articles did not make it entirely clear that the congress was to be a real government.
as a result the new nation had to fight a war for its own survival with a weak and uncertain central government never sure of its own legitimacy.
mobilizing for war the new governments of the states and the nation faced a series of overwhelming challenges raising and organizing armies providing them with supplies and equipment and finding a way to pay for it all.
without access to the british markets on which the colonies had come to depend finding necessary supplies was exceptionally difficult.
america had many gunsmiths but they could not come close to meeting the wartime demand for guns and ammunition let alone the demand for heavy arms.
although congress created a government arsenal at springfield massachusetts in 1777 the americans managed to manufacture only a small fraction of the equipment they needed.
instead they relied heavily on weapons and materiel they were able to capture from the british.
but they got most of their war supplies from european nations mainly from france.
financing the war proved in many ways the most nettle some problem.
congress had no authority to levy taxes directly on the people it had to requisition funds from the state governments.
but hard money was scarce in america and the states were little better equipped to raise it than congress was.
none of them contributed more than a small part of their expected share.
congress tried to raise money by selling longterm bonds but few americans could afford them and those who could generally preferred to invest in more profitable ventures such as privateering.
in the end the government had no choice but to issue paper money.
continental currency came from the printing presses in large and repeated batches.
the states printed sizable amounts of paper currency of their own.
debating the past the american revolution hp t t t.
long standing debate over the origins of the american revolution has tended to reflect 1 jli u two broad schools of interpretation.
one sees the revolution largely as a political and intellectual event and argues that the revolt against britain was part of a defense of ideals and principles.
the other views the revolution as a social and economic phenomenon and contends that material interests were at its heart the revolutionary generation itself portrayed the conflict as a struggle over ideals and their interpretation prevailed through most of the nineteenth century.
but in the early twentieth century historians influenced by the reform currents of the progressive era 1873 1920 began to identify social and economic forces that they believed had contributed to the rebellion.
in a 1909 study of new york carl becker wrote that two questions had shaped the revolution the first was the question of home rule the second was the question of who should rule at home.
not only were the colonists fighting the british they were also engaged in a kind of civil war a contest for power between radicals and conservatives that led to the democratization of american politics and society.
other progressive historians elaborated on becker s thesis.
in the american revolution considered as a social movement 1926 j franklin jameson argued that many economic desires many social aspirations were set free by the political struggle many aspects of society profoundly altered by the forces thus let loose.
in a 1917 book arthur m schlesinger maintained that colonial merchants motivated by their own interest in escaping the restrictive policies of british mercantilism aroused american resistance in the 1760s and 1770s.
beginning in the 1950s a new generation of scholars began to re emphasize the role of ideology and to de em phasize the role of economic interests.
robert e brown in 1955 and edmund s morgan in 1956 both argued that most eighteenth century white americans shared basic political principles and that the social and economic conflicts the progressives had identified were not severe.
the rhetoric of the revolution they suggested was not propaganda but rather a real reflection of the colonists ideas.
bernard bailyn in the ideological origins of the american revolution 1967 demonstrated the complex roots of the ideas behind the revolution and argued that this carefully constructed political stance was not a disguise for economic interests but a genuine ideology rooted in deeply held convictions about rights and power by the late 1960s however a group of younger historians were challenging the ideological interpretation again by illuminating social and economic tensions within colonial society that they claimed helped shape the revolutionary struggle.
jesse lemisch and dirk hoerder the result predictably was inflation.
prices rose to fantastic heights and the value of paper money plummeted.
many financing the american farmers and merchants began to war prefer doing business with the british who could pay for goods in gold or silver coin.
that was one reason why george washingtons troops suffered from severe food shortages at valley forge in the winter of 1777 1778 many philadelphia merchants would not sell to them.
congress tried and failed repeatedly to stem the inflationary spiral.
in the end the new american government was able to finance the war effort only by borrowing heavily from other nations.
after the first great surge of patriotism faded in 1775 few americans volunteered for military service.
as a result the states had to resort to persuasion and force to paying bounties to attract new recruits and to drafting them.
even when it was possible to recruit substantial numbers of militiamen they re general mained under the control of their respec george rive states.
congress quickly recognized washington the disadvantages of this decentralized system and tried with some success to correct it.
in the spring of 1775 it created a continental army with a single commander in chief.
george washington the forty three year old virginia planter aristocrat who had commanded colonial forces during the french and indian war and despite his defeat at the battle at fort necessity in 1754 possessed more experience than any other american born officer available.
he had also been an early advocate of independence.
above all he was admired respected and trusted by nearly all patriots.
he was the unanimous choice of the delegates and he took command in june 1775.
congress had chosen well.
throughout the war washington never flagged despite difficulties and discouragements that would have daunted a lesser man.
there were serious problems of morale among soldiers who consistently received short rations and low pay.
open mutinies broke out in 1781 among the pennsylvania and new jersey troops.
the continental congress always seemed too little interested in supplying him with manpower and equipment and too much interested in interfering with his conduct of military operations.
washington had some shortcomings as a military commander.
but he was in the end a great war leader.
with the foreign f foreign military experts such as the assistance marquis de lafayette from france and baron von steuben from prussia he succeeded in building and holding together an army of fewer than 10 000 men that along with state militias ultimately pointed to the actions of mobs in colonial cities as evidence of popular resentment of both american and british elites.
joseph ernst reemphasized the significance of economic pressures on colonial merchants and tradesmen.

d the granger collection new york in the urban crucible 1979 emphasized the role of growing economic distress in colonial cities in creating a climate in which revolutionary sentiment could flourish.
some newer social interpretations of the revolution attempt to break free of the old debate pitting ideas against interests.
the two things are not in competition with but rather reinforce each other more recent scholars argue.
everyone has economic interests gary nash has written and everyone has an ideology.
only by exploring the relationships between the two can historians hope fully to understand either.
also as linda kerber has written newer interpretations have reinvigorated the progressive focus on social conflict between classes and extended it to include the experience not only of rich and poor but of a wide variety of interest groups marginal communities and social outsiders.
that extension of focus to previously little studied groups includes work by mary beth norton on women silvia frey on slaves and colin calloway on native americans.
gordon wood in the radicalism of the american revolution 1992 and empire of liberty 2009 helped revive a once popular interpretation of the revolution that had fallen out of fashion that it was a genuinely radical event which led to the breakdown of such long standing patterns of society as deference patriarchy and traditional gender relations.

prevailed against the greatest military power in the world.
even more important in a new nation still unsure of either its purposes or its structure with a central government both weak and divided washington provided the army and the people with a symbol of stability around which they could rally.
he may not have been the most brilliant of the countrys early leaders but in the crucial years of the war at least he was the most successful in holding the new nation together.
the war for independence on the surface at least all the advantages in the military struggle between america and great britain appeared to lie with the british.
they possessed the greatest navy and the best equipped army in the world.
they had access to the resources of an empire.
they had a coherent structure of command.
the americans by contrast were struggling to create a new army and a new government at the same time that they were trying to fight a war.
yet the united states had advantages that were not at first apparent.
americans were fighting on their own ground while the english were far from home and from their own resources.
american the american patriots were on the advantages whole deeply committed to the conflict the british people only halfheartedly supported the war.
as thomas paine said at the time they cannot defeat an idea with an army beginning in 1777 moreover the americans had the benefit of substantial aid from abroad when the american war became part of a larger world contest in which great britain faced the strongest powers of europe most notably france in a struggle for imperial supremacy.
the american victory was not however simply the result of these advantages nor even of the remarkable spirit and resourcefulness of the people and the army.
it was a result too of a series of egregious blunders and miscalculations by the british in the early stages of the fighting when england could and probably should have won.
and it was finally a result of the transformation of the war which proceeded in three different phases into a new kind of conflict that the british military for all its strength could not win.
the first phase new england for the first year of the fighting the british remained uncertain about whether or not they were actually engaged in a 133 134 chapter 5 voting for independence the continental congress actually voted in favor of independence from great britain on july 2 1776.
july 4 the date americans now celebrate as independence day is when the congress formally ratified the declaration of independence.

many english authorities continued to believe that british forces were simply attempting to quell pockets of rebellion in the contentious area around boston.
gradually however colonial forces took the offensive and made almost the entire territory of the american colonies a battleground.
after the british withdrawal from concord and lexington in april 1775 american forces besieged the army of general bunker hill thomas gage in boston.
the patriots suffered severe casualties in the battle of bunker hill actually fought on breeds hill on june 17 1775 and were ultimately driven from their position there.
but they inflicted much greater losses on the enemy than the enemy inflicted on them.
indeed the british suffered their heaviest casualties of the entire war at bunker hill.
after the battle the patriots continued to tighten the siege.
by the first months of 1776 the british had concluded that boston was not the best place from which to wage war.
not only was it in the center of the most fervently anti british region of the colonies it was also tactically indefensible a narrow neck of land easily isolated and besieged.
by late winter in fact patriot forces had surrounded the city and occupied strategic positions on the heights.
on march 17 1776 a date still celebrated in boston as evacuation day the british departed boston for halifax in nova scotia with hundreds of loyalist refugees.
less than a year after the firing of the first shots the massachusetts colonists had driven the british temporarily from american soil.
elsewhere the war proceeded fitfully and inconclusively.
to the south at moores creek bridge in north carolina a band of patriots crushed an uprising of loyalists on february 27 1776 and in the process discouraged a british plan to invade the southern states.
the british had expected substantial aid from local tories in the south they realized now that such aid might not be as effective as they had hoped.
to the north americans launched an invasion of canada hoping to remove the british threat and win the canadians to their cause.
benedict arnold the revolutionary soldiers jean baptiste de verger a nineteen year old french officer serving in america during the revolution kept a journal of his experiences illustrated with watercolors.
here he portrays four american soldiers carrying different kinds of arms a black infantryman with a light rifle a musketman a rifleman and an artilleryman.
anne s k brown military collection brown university library invasion of commander of a small american force canada threatened quebec in late 1775 and early 1776 after a winter march of incredible hardship.
richard montgomery coming to his assistance combined his forces with arnold s and took command of both.
montgomery died in the assault on the city and although a wounded arnold kept up the siege for a time the quebec campaign ended in frustration.
congress sent a civilian commission to canada headed by the seventy year old benjamin franklin.
but franklin also failed to win the allegiance of the northern colonists.
canada did not become part of the new nation.
the british evacuation of boston in 1776 was not therefore so much a victory for the americans as a reflection of changing english assumptions about the war.
by the spring of 1776 it had become clear to the british that england must be prepared to fight a much larger and longer conflict.
the departure of the british therefore signaled the beginning of a new phase in the war.
the second phase the mid atlantic region the next phase of the war which lasted from 1776 until early 1778 was when the british were in the best position to win.
indeed had it not been for a series of blunders and misfortunes they probably would have crushed the rebellion then.
during this period the struggle became for the most part a traditional conventional war.
and in that the americans were woefully overmatched.
the british regrouped quickly after their retreat from boston.
during the summer of 1776 in the weeks immediately following the declaration of independence the waters around new york city grew crowded with the most formidable military force great britain had ever sent abroad.
hundreds of man of war vessels and troopships and 32 000 disciplined soldiers arrived under the command of the affable william howe.
howe felt no particular hostility toward the americans.
he hoped to awe them into submission rather than fight them and he believed that most of them if given a chance would show their loyalty to the king.
in a meeting with commissioners from congress he offered them a choice between submission with royal pardon and a battle against overwhelming odds.
to oppose howes impressive array washington could muster only about 19 000 poorly armed and lightly trained soldiers even after combining the continental army with state militias he had no navy at all.
even so the americans quickly 136 chapter 5 the battle of germantown the battle of germantown a campaign intended by washington to liberate philadelphia from british occupation took place on october 4 1777.
in this painting by alonzo chappel 1828 1887 battle of germantown attack on judge chews house 1860 washington s much larger force cannot defeat the 120 british infantrymen who barricaded themselves in the summer home of loyalist benjamin chew.
twelve thousand american troops were forced to retreat into nearby montgomery county.
chicago history museum usa the bridgeman art library british take rejected howes offer and chose to con new york tinue the war a decision that led inevitably to a succession of rapid defeats.
the british pushed the defenders off long island compelled them to abandon manhattan and then drove them in slow retreat over the plains of new jersey across the delaware river and into pennsylvania.
for eighteenth century europeans warfare was a seasonal activity.
fighting generally stopped in cold weather.
the british settled down for the winter at various points in new jersey leaving an outpost of hessians german mercenaries at trenton on the delaware river.
but washington did not sit still.
on christmas night 1776 he boldly recrossed the icy river surprised and scattered the hessians and occupied the town.
then he advanced to princeton and drove a british force from their base in the college there.
but washington was unable to hold either princeton or trenton and he finally took refuge for the rest of the winter in the hills around morristown new jersey.
for their campaigns of 1777 the british devised a strategy to cut the united states in two.
howe would move north from britains new york city up the hudson to albany strategy while another british force would come south from canada to meet him.
one of the younger british officers the dashing john burgoyne secured command of this northern force and planned a two pronged attack along both the mohawk and the upper hudson approaches to albany.
but after setting this plan in motion howe himself abandoned it.
he decided instead to launch an assault on the rebel capital philadelphia an assault that would he hoped discourage the patriots rally the loyalists and bring the war to a speedy conclusion.
he removed the bulk of his forces from the american revolution 137 british forces american forces british victory the revolution in the north 1775 1776 after initial battles in and around boston the british forces left massachusetts and after a brief stay in halifax canada moved south to new york.
in the meantime american forces moved north in an effort to capture british strongholds in montreal and quebec with little success.
why would the british have considered new york a better base than boston.
new york by sea landed at the head of the chesapeake bay brushed washington aside at the battle of brandywine creek on september 11 and proceeded north to philadelphia which he was able to occupy with little resistance.
meanwhile washington after an unsuccessful october 4 attack at germantown just outside philadelphia went into winter quarters at valley forge.
the continental congress now dislodged from its capital reassembled at york pennsylvania.
howes move to philadelphia left burgoyne to carry out the campaign in the north alone.
burgoyne sent colonel barry st leger up the st lawrence river toward lake ontario and the headwaters of the mohawk while burgoyne himself advanced directly down the upper hudson valley.
he got off to a flying start.
he seized fort ticonderoga easily and with it an enormous store of powder and supplies this caused such dismay in congress that the delegates removed general philip schuyler from command of american forces in the north and replaced him with horatio gates.
by the time gates took command burgoyne had already experienced two staggering defeats.
in one of them at oriskany new york on august 6 a patriot band of german farmers led by nicholas herkimer held off a force of indians and tories commanded by st leger.
that gave benedict arnold time to go to the relief of fort stanwix and close off the mohawk valley to st legers advance.
in the other battle at bennington vermont on august 16 new england militiamen under the bunker hill veteran john stark severely mauled a british detachment that burgoyne had sent out to seek supplies.
short of materials with all help cut off burgoyne fought several costly engagements and then withdrew to saratoga where gates surrounded him.
on october 17 1777 burgoyne ordered what was left of his army nearly 5 000 men to surrender to the americans.
to the patriots and peoples watching from around the patriot world the new york campaign was a remarkable victory.
the british surrender at saratoga became a major turning point in the war above all perhaps because it led directly to an alliance between the united states and france.
the british failure to win the war during this period a period in which they had overwhelming advantages was in large part victory at saratoga british a result of their own mistakes.
and in assess blunders ing them the role of william howe looms large.
he abandoned his own most important strategic initiative the northern campaign leaving burgoyne to fight alone.
and even in pennsylvania where he chose to 138 chapter 5 the battle of bunker hill 1775 british troops face patriot forces outside boston on june 17 1775 in the first great battle of the american revolution.
the british ultimately drove the americans from their positions on breeds hill and bunker hill but only after suffering enormous casualties.

private collection peter newark american pictures bridgeman images engage the enemy he refrained from moving in for a final attack on the weakened continental army even though he had several opportunities.
instead he repeatedly allowed washington to retreat and regroup and he permitted the american army to spend a long winter unmolested in valley forge where weak and hungry they might have been easy prey for a british attack.
some british critics believed that howe did not want to win the war that he was secretly in sympathy with the american cause.
his family had close ties to the colonies and he was linked politically to those forces within the british government that opposed the war.
others pointed to personal weaknesses howes apparent alcoholism his romantic attachment he spent the winter of 1777 1778 in philadelphia with his mistress when many of his advisers were urging him to move elsewhere.
but the most important problem it seems clear was his failure to understand the nature of the war that he was fighting or even to understand that it was truly a war.
the iroquois and the british the campaign in upstate new york was not just a british defeat.
it was also a setback for the ambitious efforts of several iroquois leaders who had hoped to involve indian forces in the english military effort believing that a british victory would help stem white movement onto tribal lands.
the iroquois confederacy had declared itself neutral in the war in 1776 but not all its members were content to remain passive in the northern campaign.
among those who worked to expand the native american role in the war were a mohawk brother and sister joseph brant and mary brant.
both were people of stature within the mohawk nation joseph was a celebrated warrior mary was a charismatic woman and the widow of sir william johnson the british superintendent of indians who had achieved wide popularity among the tribes.
the brants persuaded their own tribe to contribute to the british cause and attracted the support of the seneca and cayuga as well.
they played an important role in burgoynes unsuccessful campaigns in the north.
but the alliance was also a sign of the growing divisions within the iroquois confederacy.
only three of the six nations of the confederacy supported the british.
the oneida and the tuscarora backed the americans the onondaga split into several factions.

the large map on the left shows the two prongs of the british strategy first a movement of british forces south from canada into the hudson valley and second a movement of other british forces under general william howe out from new york and south into new jersey and pennsylvania.
the strategy was designed to trap the american army between the two british movements.
the two smaller maps on the right show detailed pictures of some of the major battles.

the lower one shows a series of inconclusive battles between new york and philadelphia in 1777 and 1778.
what movements of howe helped thwart that plan.
confederacy weakened by the aftermath of the french and indian war continued to unravel.
the alliance had other unhappy consequences for the iroquois.
a year after oriskany indians joined british troops in a series of raids on outlying white settlements in upstate new york.
months later patriot forces under the command of general john sullivan harshly retaliated wreaking such destruction on tribal settlements that large groups of iroquois fled north into canada to seek refuge.
many never returned.
securing aid from abroad the failure of the british to crush the continental army in the mid atlantic states combined with the stunning american victory at saratoga was a turning point in the war.
it transformed the conflict and ushered it into a new and final phase.
central to this transformation of the war was american success in winning support from abroad indirectly from several european nations and directly from france.
even before the declaration of independence congress dispatched representatives to the capitals of europe to negotiate commercial treaties with the governments there if america was to leave the british empire it would need to cultivate new trading partners.
such militia treaties would of course require european diplomats governments to recognize the united states as an independent nation.
john adams called the early american representatives abroad militia diplomats unlike the diplomatic regulars of europe they had little experience with the formal art and etiquette of old world diplomacy.
since transatlantic communication was slow and uncertain it took from one to three months for a message to cross the atlantic they had to interpret the instructions of congress very freely and make crucial decisions entirely on their own.
140 chapter 5 the most promising potential ally for the united states was france.
king louis xvi who had come to the throne in 1774 and his astute foreign minister the count de vergennes were eager to see britain lose a crucial part of its empire.
through a series of secret bargains facilitated by the creation of a fictional trading firm and the use of secret agents on both sides among them the famed french dramatist caron de beaumarchais france began supplying the americans large quantities of much needed supplies.
but the french government remained reluctant to provide the united states with what it most wanted diplomatic recognition.
finally benjamin franklin himself went to france to represent the united states.
a natural diplomat franklin became a popular hero among the french aristocrats and common people alike.
his popularity there greatly helped the american cause.
of even greater help was the news of the american victory at saratoga which arrived in london on december 2 1777 and in paris two days later.
on february 6 1778 in part to forestall a british peace offensive that vergennes feared might persuade the americans to abandon the war france formally recognized the united states as a sovereign nation and laid the groundwork for greatly expanded assistance to the american war effort.
frances intervention made the war an international conflict.
in the course of the next two years france spain and the pivotal netherlands all drifted into another general french aid war with great britain in europe and all contributed both directly and indirectly to the ultimate american victory.
but france was americas truly indispensable ally.
not only did it furnish the new nation with most of its money and munitions it also provided a navy and an expeditionary force that proved invaluable in the decisive phase of the revolutionary conflict.
the final phase the sooth the last phase of the military struggle in america was very different from either of the first two.
the british government had never been fully united behind the war after the defeat at saratoga and the intervention of the french it imposed new limits on its commitment to the conflict.
instead of a full scale military struggle against the american army therefore the british decided to try to enlist the support of those elements of the american population a majority they continued to believe who were still loyal to the crown in other words they would work to undermine the revolution from within.
since the british believed loyalist sentiment was strongest in the southern colonies despite their earlier failure to enlist loyalist support in north carolina the main focus of their effort shifted there and so it was in the south for the most part that the final stages of the war occurred.
the new british strategy was a dismal failure.
british forces spent three years from 1778 to 1781 moving through the south fighting small battles and large and attempting to neutralize the territory through which they traveled.
all such efforts ended in frustration.
the british badly overestimated the extent of loyalist sentiment.
there were many tories in georgia and the carolinas some of them disgruntled members of the regulator movement.
but there were also many more patriots than the british had believed.
in virginia support for independence was as fervent as in massachusetts.
and even in the lower south loyalists often refused to aid the british because they feared reprisals from the patriots around them.
the british also harmed their own cause by encouraging southern slaves to desert their owners in return for promises of emancipation.
many slaves perhaps 5 percent of the total took advantage of this offer despite the great difficulty of doing so.
but white southerners were aghast and even many who might otherwise have been inclined to support the crown now joined the patriot side which posed no such threat to slavery.
the british also faced severe logistical problems in the south.
patriot forces could move at will throughout the region living off the resources of the countryside blending in with the civilian population and leaving the british unable to distinguish friend from foe.
the british by contrast suffered all the disadvantages of an army in hostile territory.
it was this phase of the conflict that made the war truly revolutionary not only because it introduced a new kind of combat but also because it had the effect of mobilizing and politicizing large groups of the population who had previously remained aloof from the struggle.
with the war expanding into previously isolated communities with many civilians forced to involve themselves whether they liked it or not the political climate of the united states grew more heated than ever.
and support for independence far from being crushed as the british had hoped greatly increased.
that was the context in which the important military encounters of the last years of the war occurred.
in the north where significant numbers of british troops remained the fighting settled into a relatively quiet stalemate.
sir henry clinton replaced the hapless william howe in 1778 and moved what had been howes army from philadelphia back to new york city.
there the british troops stayed for more than a year with washington using his army to keep watch around them.
the american forces in new york did so little fighting in this period that washington sent some troops west to fight hostile indians who had been attacking white settlers.
in that same winter george rogers clark under orders from the state of virginia not from either washington or congress led a daring expedition over the mountains and captured settlements in the illinois country from the british and their indian allies.
during this period of relative calm general benedict arnold shocked the american forces and washington in particular by becoming a traitor.
arnold had been one of the early heroes of the war but now convinced that the american cause was ope ess he conspired with british agents to betray the patriot revolutionary consequences of the southern campaign the american revolution 141 british forces american forces french fleet british victory american victory d estaing sept oct 1779 the revolution in the south 1778 1781 the final phase of the american revolution occurred largely in the south which the british thought would be a more receptive region for their troops.

the scheme unraveled before arnold could complete it and he fled to the safety of the british camp where he spent the rest of the war.
in the meantime decisive fighting was in progress in the south.
the british did have some significant military successes during this period.
on december 29 1778 they captured savannah on the coast of georgia and on may 12 1780 they took the port of charles town south carolina.
they also inspired some loyalists to take up arms and advance with them into the interior.
but although the british were able to win conventional battles they were constantly harassed as they moved through the countryside by patriot guerrillas led by such resourceful fighters as thomas sumter andrew pickens and francis marion the swamp fox moving inland to camden south carolina lord cornwallis clintons choice as british commander in the south met nathanael anc crus e a patriot force under horatio greene gates on august 16 1780.
congress recalled gates and washington gave the southern command to nathanael greene a quaker and a former blacksmith from rhode island and probably the ablest of all the american generals of the time next to washington.

the british took nearly 3 000 prisoners when the patriots surrendered on november 16 1776.
thomas davies painted this watercolor of the british landing at the time.
fotosearch getty images even before greene joined the southern army the tide of battle began to turn against cornwallis.
at kings mountain near the north carolina south carolina border on october 7 1780 a band of patriot riflemen from the backwoods killed wounded or captured an entire force of 1 100 new york and south carolina tories that cornwallis was using as auxiliaries.
once greene arrived he confused and exasperated cornwallis further by dividing the american forces into small fast moving contingents and refraining from a showdown in open battle.
one of the contingents inflicted what cornwallis admitted was a very unexpected and severe blow at cowpens on january 17 1781.
finally after receiving reinforcements greene combined all his forces and maneuvered to meet the british on ground of his own choosing at guilford court house north carolina.
after a hard fought battle there on march 15 1781 greene withdrew from the field but cornwallis had lost so many men that he decided at last to abandon the carolina campaign.
cornwallis withdrew to the port town of wilmington north carolina to receive supplies being sent to him by sea later he moved north to launch raids in the interior of virginia.
but clinton concerned for the armys safety ordered him to take up a position on the peninsula between the york and james rivers and wait for ships to carry his troops to new york city or charles town.
so cornwallis retreated to yorktown and began to build fortifications there.
george washington along with count jean baptiste de rochambeau commander of the french expeditionary force in america and admiral francois joseph paul de grasse commander of the french fleet in american waters set out to trap yorktown cornwallis at yorktown.
washington and rochambeau marched a french american army from new york city to join other french forces under lafayette in virginia while de grasse sailed with additional troops for chesapeake bay and the york river.
these joint operations perfectly timed and executed caught cornwallis between land and sea.
after a few shows of resistance he capitulated on october 17 1781 four years to the day after the surrender of burgoyne at saratoga.
two days later as a military band played the old tune the world turnd upside down cornwallis claiming to be ill sent a deputy who formally sur rendered the british army of more than 7 000 men.
the american revolution 143 except for a few skirmishes the fighting was now over but the united states had not yet won the war.
british forces continued to hold the seaports of savannah charles town wilmington and new york city.
before long a british fleet met and defeated admiral de grasses fleet in the west indies ending washingtons hopes for further french naval assistance.
for more than a year although there was no significant further combat between british and american forces it remained possible that the war might resume and the struggle for independence might still be lost.
winning the peace cornwalliss defeat provoked outcries in england against continuing the war.
lord north resigned as prime minister lord shelburne emerged from the political wreckage to succeed him and british emissaries appeared in france to talk informally with the american diplomats in paris.
the three american principals were benjamin franklin john adams and john jay.
the americans were under instructions to cooperate fully with france in their negotiations with england.
but vergennes insisted that france could not agree to any settlement of the war with england until its ally spain had achieved its principal war aim winning back gibraltar from the british.
there was no real prospect of that happening soon and the americans began to fear that the alliance with france might keep them at war indefinitely.
as a result franklin jay and adams began proceeding on their own without informing vergennes and signed a preliminary treaty with great britain on november 30 1782.
franklin in the meantime skillfully pacified vergennes and avoided an immediate rift in the french american alliance.
the british and americans reached a final settlement the treaty of paris on september 3 1783 when both spain and france agreed to end hostilities.
it was on the whole remark treaty of ably favorable to the united states in grant paris ing a clear cut recognition of its independence and a generous though ambiguous cession of territory from the southern boundary of canada to the northern boundary of florida and from the atlantic to the mississippi.
with good reason americans celebrated in the fall of 1783 as the last of the british occupation forces embarked from new york and general washington at the head of his troops rode triumphantly into the city.
war and society historians have long debated whether the american revolution was a social as well as a political revolution.
some have argued that the colonists were struggling not only over the question of home rule but also over who should rule at home others claim that domestic social and economic concerns had little to do with the conflict.
see debating the past pp.
whatever the motivations of americans however there can be little doubt that the war for independence had important effects on the nature of american society.
loyalists and minorities the losers in the american revolution included not only the british but also american loyalists.
there is no way to be sure how many americans remained loyal to england during the revolution but it is clear that there were many at least a fifth and some historians estimate as much as a third of the white population.
their motivations were varied.
some were officeholders in the imperial government who stood to lose their positions as a result of the revolution.
others were merchants engaged in trade closely tied to the imperial system.
most merchants however supported the revolution.
still others were people who lived in relative isolation and had not been exposed to the wave of discontent that had turned so many americans against britain.
there were cultural and ethnic minorities who feared that an independent america would not offer them sufficient protection.
there were settled cautious people who feared social instability.
and there were those who expecting the british to win the war were simply currying favor with the anticipated victors.
what happened to these men and women during the war was a turbulent and at times tragic story.
hounded by patriots in their communities harassed by legislative and the loyalists judicial actions the position of many plight loyalists became intolerable.
up to 100 000 fled the country.
those who could afford to moved to england where many lived in difficult and lonely exile.
thomas hutchinson who was a wealthy businessman historian and loyalist of the king served in the massachusetts government for many years as lieutenant governor and from 1758 to 1774 as governor.
he was a polarizing figure and as the revolution began his boston mansion was ransacked during protests against the stamp acts.
after being replaced as governor in may 1774 by general thomas gage hutchinson left boston and moved first to canada and then to england.
loyalists of modest means moved to canada establishing the first english speaking community in the province of quebec.
some returned to america after the war and as the earlier passions and resentments faded managed to reenter the life of the nation.
others remained abroad for the rest of their lives.
most loyalists were people of average means but a substantial minority consisted of men and women of wealth.
they left behind large estates and vacated important positions of social and economic leadership.
even some who remained in the country saw their property confiscated and their positions forfeited.
the result was new opportunities for patriots to acquire land and influence a situation that produced significant social changes in many communities.
it would be an exaggeration however to claim that the departure of the loyalists was responsible for anything approaching a social revolution or that the revolution created a general assault on the wealthy and powerful in america.
when the war the age of revolutions pp y y y j american revolution was a result of specific tensions and conflicts between britain h e and its north american colonies.
but it was also a part and a cause of what historians have come to call an age of revolutions that spread through much of the western world in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
the modern idea of revolution the overturning of old systems and regimes and the creation of new ones was largely a product of the ideas of the enlightenment.
among those ideas was the storming the bastille this painting portrays the storming of the great parisian fortress and prison the bastille on july 14 1789.
the bastille was a despised symbol of royal tyranny to many of the french because of the arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned people who were sent there.
the july assault was designed to release the prisoners but in fact the revolutionaries found only seven people in the vast fortress.
even so the capture of the bastille which marked one of the first moments in which ordinary frenchmen joined the revolution became one of the great moments in modern french history.
the anniversary of the event bastille day remains the french national holiday.
musee de la ville de paris musee carnavalet paris france the bridgeman art library notion of popular sovereignty articulated by the english philosopher john locke and others.
locke argued that political authority did not derive from the divine right of kings or the inherited authority of aristocracies but rather from the consent of the governed.
a related enlightenment idea was the concept of individual freedom which challenged the traditional belief that governments had the right to prescribe the way people act speak and even think.
champions of individual freedom in the eighteenth century among them the french philosopher voltaire advocated religious toleration and freedom of thought and expression.
the swiss french enlightenment theorist jean jacques rousseau helped spread the idea of political and legal equality for all people the end of special privileges for aristocrats and elites the right of all citizens to participate in the formation of policies and laws.
the american revolution was the first and in many ways the most influential of the enlightenment derived uprisings against established orders.
it served as an inspiration to people in other lands who were trying to find a way to oppose unpopular regimes.
in 1789 a little over a decade after the beginning of the american revolution revolution began in france.
the monarchy was abolished and the king and queen publicly executed in 1793 the authority of the catholic church was challenged and greatly weakened and at the peak of revolutionary chaos during the jacobin period 1793 1794 more than 40 000 suspected enemies of the revolution were executed and hundreds of thousands of others imprisoned.
the most radical phase of the revolution came to an end in 1799 when napoleon bonaparte a young general seized power and began to build a new french empire.
but france s ancien regime of king and aristocracy never wholly revived.
the american and french revolutions helped inspire uprisings in many other parts of the atlantic world weakening of the anglican church ended those who had been wealthy at its beginning were for the most part still wealthy at the end.
most of those who had wielded social and political influence continued to wield it.
the war had a significant effect on other minorities as well and on certain religious groups in particular.
no sect suffered more than the anglicans many of whom were loyalists.
in virginia and maryland where the colonial governments had recognized anglicanism as the official religion and had imposed a tax for its maintenance the new revolutionary regimes disestablished the anglican church and eliminated the subsidy.
by the time the fighting ended many anglican parishes no longer had clergymen for there were few ministers to take the place of those who had died or who had left the country as loyalist refugees.
anglicanism survived in america but the losses during the revolution permanently weakened it.
the revolution also weakened the quakers in pennsylvania and elsewhere.
they incurred widespread unpopularity because of their pacifism which destroyed much of the social and political prestige they had once enjoyed.
while the war was weakening the anglicans and the quakers it was strengthening the position of the roman 144 the american revolution 145 in 1791 a major slave uprising began in haiti and soon attracted more than 100 000 rebels.
the slave army defeated both the white settlers of the island and the french colonial armies sent to quell their rebellion.
linder the leadership of general toussaint l ouverture they began to agitate for independence which they obtained on january 1 1804 a few months after toussaint s death.
revolution spread next into the spanish and portuguese colonies in the americas particularly among the so called creoles people of european ancestry born in the americas.
in the late eighteenth century they began to resist the authority of colonial officials sent from spain and portugal and to demand a greater say in governing their own lands.
napoleon s invasion of spain and portugal in 1807 weakened the ability of the european regimes to sustain authority over their american colonies.
in the years that followed revolutions swept through much of latin america.
mexico became an independent nation in 1821 and provinces of central america that had once been part of mexico guatemala el salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica established their independence three years later.
simon bolivar modeling his efforts on those of george washington led a great revolutionary movement that won independence for brazil in 1822 and also helped lead revolutionary campaigns in venezuela ecuador and peru all of which won their independence in the 1820s.
across the atlantic greek patriots drawing from the examples of other revolutionary nations launched a movement to win their independence from the ottoman empire which finally succeeded in 1830.
the age of revolutions left many new independent nations in its wake.
it did not however succeed in establishing the ideals of popular sovereignty individual freedom and political equality in all the nations it affected.
slavery survived in the united states and in many areas of latin america.
new forms of aristocracy and even monarchy emerged in france mexico brazil and elsewhere.
women many of whom had hoped the revolutionary age would win new rights for them made few legal or political gains in this era.
but the ideals that the revolutionary era introduced to the western world continued to shape the histories of nations throughout the nineteenth century and beyond.

the war and slavery african american desire for freedom for the largest of america s minorities the african american population the war had limited but nevertheless profound significance.
for some it meant freedom because many slaves took advantage of the british presence in the south in the final years of the war to escape.
the british enabled many of them to leave the country not so much as any principled commitment to emancipation but more as a way of disrupting the american war effort.
in south carolina for example nearly a third of all slaves defected during the war.
africans had constituted over 60 percent of the population in 1770 by 1790 that figure had declined to about 44 percent.
for other african americans the revolution meant an increased exposure to the concept although seldom to the reality of liberty.
most black americans could not read but few could avoid the new and exciting ideas circulating through the towns and cities and even at times on the plantations.
the results included incidents in several communities in which african americans engaged in open resistance to white control.
in charles town south carolina for example thomas jeremiah a free black was executed in 1775 after patriot leaders accused him of conspiring to smuggle british guns to south carolina slaves.
the revolution also produced some eloquent efforts by black writers mostly in the north to articulate its lessons for their people.
liberty is a jewel which was handed down to man from the cabinet of heaven the black new englander lemuel hayes wrote in 1776.
even an african has equally good a right to his liberty in common with englishmen shall a mans couler be the decisive criterion wherby to judg of his natural right that was one reason why in south carolina and georgia where slaves constituted half or more of the population there was great ambivalence about the revolution.
slaveowners opposed british efforts to emancipate their slaves but they also feared that the revolution itself would foment slave rebellions.
the same fears helped prevent english colonists in the caribbean islands who were far more greatly outnumbered by african slaves from joining with the continental americans in the revolt against britain.
in much of the north the combination of revolutionary sentiment and evangelical christian fervor helped spread antislavery sentiments widely through society.
but in the south white support for slavery survived.
southern churches rejected the antislavery ideas of the north and worked instead to develop a rationale for slavery in part by reinforcing ideas about white superiority in part by encouraging slaveowners to make slavery more humane.
146 chapter 5 as in so many other periods of american history the revolution exposed the continuing tension between the nations commitment to liberty and its commitment to slavery.
to people in our time and even to some people in revolutionary times it seems obvious that liberty and slavery are incompatible.
but to many white americans in the eighteenth century especially in the south that did not seem obvious.
many white southerners believed in fact that enslaving africans whom they considered inferior and unfit for citizenship was the best way to ensure liberty for white people.
they feared the impact tension between of free black people livin alonsslde liberty and whites.
they also feared that without slavery slaves it would be necessary to recruit a servile white workforce in the south and that the resulting inequalities would jeopardize the survival of liberty.
one of the ironies of the american revolution therefore was that white americans were fighting both to secure freedom for themselves and to preserve slavery for others.
native americans and the revolution most indians viewed the american revolution with considerable uncertainty.
the american patriots tried to persuade them to remain neutral in the conflict which they described as a family quarrel between the colonists and britain that had nothing to do with the tribes.
but in fact a great deal was at stake for native americans in the american revolution.
during the colonial period the british government struggled for many years to restrain the growth of white migration into the indian lands west of the appalachian mountains.
such efforts were mostly unsuccessful.
the white colonists the royal governor of virginia wrote do not conceive that the government has any right to forbid taking possession of a vast tract of country but the british believed that the government did have a right to protect the lands of the indians not because of benevolence but because of their desire to avoid further battles with the tribes especially on land that had been promised to the indians.
once the revolutionary war began the role of the indians became of critical significance to both sides of the conflict.
for the american patriots among the goals of battle for independence was their right to expand into the western lands at the expense of the indians.
some of the most eminent figures in the new nation were themselves land speculators in the west among them george washington and many such men had long complained about the proclamation of 1763 which had forbidden white movement into tribal lands.
other colonial grievances against the british included the recruitment of indians to join the royal army.
in fact both sides tried to recruit indians to help them.
in the western carolinas and virginia a cherokee faction led by dragging canoe attacked outlying white settlements in the summer of 1776.
patriot militias responded with overwhelming force ravaging cherokee lands and forcing dragging canoe and many of his followers to flee west across the tennessee river.
those cherokees who remained behind agreed to a new treaty by which they gave up still more land.
not all native american military efforts were so unsuccessful.
some iroquois despite the setbacks at oriskany continued to wage war against white americans in the west and caused widespread destruction in large agricultural areas of new york and pennsylvania areas whose crops were of crucial importance to the patriot cause.
and although the retaliating united states armies inflicted heavy losses on the indians the attacks continued throughout the war.
in the end however the revolution generally weakened the position of native americans in several ways.
the patriot victory increased the white demand for western lands many american whites associated restrictions on settlement with british oppression and expected the new nation to remove the obstacles.
at the same time white attitudes toward the tribes seldom friendly in the best of times took a turn for taking sides the worse many whites deeply resented the assistance the mohawk and other indian nations had given the british and insisted on treating them as conquered people.
others adopted a paternalistic ueorge komney painted this portr joseph brant chtef of the mohawks 1742 1807 to depict the mohawk leader who led lour the six iroquois nations against the american forces in support of the british.

canada the ridgeman art library the american revolution 147 view of the tribes that was only slightly less dangerous to them.
thomas jefferson for example came to view the native americans as noble savages uncivilized in their present state but redeemable if they were willing to adapt to the norms of white society.
among the tribes themselves the revolution both revealed and increased the deep divisions that made it difficult for them to form a common front to resist the growing power of whites.
in 1774 for example the shawnee indians in west growing ern virginia had attempted to lead an up divisions rising against white settlers moving into among the the lands that would later become indians kentucky.
they attracted virtually no al lies and in a conflict known as lord dunmores war were defeated by the colonial militia and forced to cede more land to white settlers.
and the iroquois whose power had been eroding since the end of the french and indian war were similarly unable to act in unison in the revolution.
bands of native americans continued to launch raids against white settlers on the frontier.
white militias often using such raids as pretexts continued to attack indian tribes who stood in the way of expansion.
perhaps the most vicious massacre of the era occurred in 1782 after the british surrender when white militias slaughtered a peaceful band of delaware indians at gnadenhuetten in ohio.
they claimed to be retaliating for the killing of a white family several days before but few white settlers believed this band of delaware who were both christian converts and pacifists had played any role in the earlier attack.
the white soldiers killed ninety six people including many women and children.
such massacres did not become the norm of indian white relations.
but they did reveal how little the revolution had done to settle the basic conflict between the two peoples.
the triumph of the american patriots in the revolution contributed to the ultimate defeat of the indian tribes.
to white americans independence meant among other things their right to move aggressively into the western lands despite the opposition of the indians.
to the indians american independence was the greatest blow that could have been dealt us one tribal leader warned.
women s rights and womens roles the long revolutionary war which touched the lives of people in almost every region naturally had a significant effect on american women.
the departure of so many men to fight in the patriot armies left wives mothers sisters and daughters in charge of farms and businesses.
other women whose husbands or fathers went off to war did not have even a farm or shop to fall back on.
many cities and towns developed significant populations of impoverished women who on occasion led popular protests against price increases.
on a few occasions hungry women rioted and looted for food.
elsewhere in new jersey and on staten island women launched attacks on occupying british troops whom they were required to house and feed at considerable expense.
not all women however stayed behind when the men went off to war.
sometimes by choice but more often out of economic necessity or because they had been driven from women of their homes by the enemy and by the the army smallpox and dysentery the british army carried with it women flocked in increasing numbers to the camps of the patriot armies to join their male relatives.
george washington looked askance at these female camp followers convinced that they were disruptive and distracting even though his own wife martha spent the winter of 1778 1779 with him at valley forge.
other officers were even more hostile voicing complaints that reflected a high level of anxiety over this seeming violation of traditional gender roles and also perhaps over the generally lower class backgrounds of the camp women.
one described them in decidedly hostile terms their hair falling their brows beady with the heat their belongings slung over one shoulder chattering and yelling in sluttish shrills as they went in fact however the women were of significant value to the new army.
it had not yet developed an adequate system of supply and auxiliary services and it profited greatly from the presence of women who increased army morale and performed such necessary tasks as cooking laundry and nursing.
but female activity did not always remain restricted to womens tasks.
in the rough environment of the camps traditional gender distinctions proved difficult to maintain.
considerable numbers of women became involved at least intermittently in combat including the legendary molly pitcher so named because she carried pitchers of water to soldiers on the battlefield.
she watched her husband fall during one encounter and immediately took his place at a field gun.
a few women even disguised themselves as men so as to be able to fight.
after the war of course the soldiers and the female camp followers returned home.
the experience of combat had little visible impact on how society or on how women themselves defined female roles in peacetime.
the revolution did however call certain assumptions about women into question in other ways.
the emphasis on liberty and the rights of man led some women to begin to question their position in society as well.
by the way abigail adams wrote to her husband john adams in 1776 in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors adams was calling for a very modest expansion of womens rights.
she wanted new protections against abusive and tyrannical men.
a few women however went further.
judith sargent murray one of the leading essayists of the late eighteenth century wrote in 1779 that womens minds were as good as mens and that girls as well as boys therefore deserved access to education.
some political leaders among them benjamin franklin and benjamin rush also voiced support for the education 148 chapter 5 calls for womens rights of women and for other feminist reforms.
yale students in the 1780s debated the question whether women ought to be admitted into the magistracy and government of empires and republics and there was for a time wide discussion of the future role of women in a new re public that had broken with so many other traditions already.
but few concrete reforms became either law or common social practice.
in colonial society under the doctrines of english common law an unmarried woman had some legal rights to own property to enter contracts and others but a married woman had virtually no rights.
she could own no property and earn no independent wages everything she owned and everything she earned belonged to her husband.
she had no legal authority over her children the father was in the eyes of the law the autocrat of the family.
because a married woman had no property rights she could not engage in any legal transactions buying or selling suing or being sued writing wills.
she could not vote.
nor could she obtain a divorce in most states that too was a right reserved mostly for men although in much of the south men could not obtain divorces either.
these restrictions were what abigail adams who herself enjoyed a successful marriage was describing when she appealed to her husband not to put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands the revolution did little to change any of these legal customs.
in some states it did become easier for women to obtain divorces.
and in new jersey women obtained the right to vote although that right was repealed in 1807.
otherwise there were few advances and some setbacks including widows loss of the right to regain their dowries from their husbands estates.
that change left many widows without any means of support and was one of the reasons for the increased agitation for female education such women needed a way to support themselves.
the revolution in other words far from challenging the patriarchal structure of american society actually confirmed and strengthened it.
few american women challenged the belief that they occupied a special sphere distinct from that of men.
most accepted that their place remained in the family.
nevertheless the revolutionary experience did contribute to a subtle but important alteration of womens roles.
in the past they had often been little better than servants in their husbands homes.
but the revolution encouraged people of both genders to reevaluate the contribution of women to the family and the society.
one reason for this was a reevaluation of american life during and after the revolutionary struggle.
as the republic the british infantry the worlds greatest military power raised its armies in almost haphazard fashion command of a british.

with that incentive they were hardly picky and the foot soldiers of the british army were mo t e psitined gen emen who enlisting through a combination of liquor and cash.

brown the american revolution 149 searched for a cultural identity for itself it began to place additional value on the role of women as mothers.
the new nation a strengthened was many americans liked to believe patriarchal producing a new kind of citizen steeped structure in the principles of liberty.
mothers had a particularly important task therefore in instructing their children in the virtues the republican citizenry was expected now to possess.
wives were still far from equal partners in marriage but their ideas interests and do mestic roles received increased respect from many men.
the war economy inevitably the revolution produced important changes in the structure of the american economy.
after more than a century of dependence on the british imperial system american trade suddenly found itself on its own.
no longer did it have the protection of the great british navy on the contrary english ships now attempted to drive american vessels from the seas.
no longer did american merchants have access to the markets of the empire those markets were now hostile ports lnclud ing of course the most important source of american trade england itself.
yet while the revolution disrupted traditional economic patterns in the long run it strengthened the american economy.
well before the war was over american ships had learned to evade the british navy with light fast easily maneuverable vessels.
indeed the yankees began to prey on british commerce with hundreds of privateers.
for many shipowners privateering proved to be more profitable than ordinary peacetime trade.
more important in the long run the end of imperial restrictions on american shipping opened up enormous new areas of trade to the nation.
enterprising merchants in new england and elsewhere began to develop new commerce in the caribbean and in south america.
by the mid 1780s american merchants were developing an important new pattern of trade with asia and by the end of that decade yankee ships were regularly sailing from the eastern seaboard around cape horn to the pacific coast of north america there exchanging manufactured goods for hides and furs and then proceeding across the pacific to barter for goods in china.
there was also a substantial increase in trade among the american states.
when english imports to america were cut off first by the prewar boycott then by the war itself there were desperate new patterns efforts throughout the states to stimulate of trade domestic manufacturing of certain necessities.
no great industrial expansion resulted but there were several signs of the economic growth that was to come in the next century.
americans began to make their own cloth homespun which became both patriotic and fashionable to replace now unobtainable british fabrics.
it would be some time before a large domestic textile industry would emerge but the nation was never again to rely exclusively on foreign sources for its cloth.
there was of course pressure to build factories for the manufacture of guns and ammunition.
and there was a growing general awareness that america need not forever be dependent on other nations for manufactured goods.
the war stopped well short of revolutionizing the american economy not until the nineteenth century would that begin to occur.
but it did serve to release a wide range of entrepreneurial energies that despite the temporary dislocations encouraged growth and diversification.
banner of the society of pewterers members of the american society of pewterers carried this patriotic banner when they marched in a new york city parade in july 1788.
its inscription celebrates the adoption of the new federal constitution and predicts a future of prosperity and freedom in columbias land.
the banner also suggests the growing importance of american manufacturing which had received an important boost during the revolution when british imports became unavailable.
collection of the new york historical society usa the bridgeman art library international 150 chapter 5 the creation of state governments at the same time that americans were struggling to win their independence on the battlefield they were also struggling to create new institutions of government to replace the british system they had repudiated.
that struggle continued for more than fifteen years but its most important phase occurred during the war itself at the state level.
the assumptions of republicanism if americans agreed on nothing else when they began to build new governments for themselves they agreed that those governments would be republican.
to them that meant a political system in which all power came from the people rather than from some supreme authority such as a king.
the success of such a government depended on the nature of its citizenry j if the population consisted of sturdy inde civic virtue pendent property owners imbued with civic virtue then the republic could survive.
if it consisted of a few powerful aristocrats and a great mass of dependent workers then it would be in danger.
from the beginning therefore the ideal of the small freeholder the independent landowner was basic to american political ideology.
another crucial part of that ideology was the concept of equality.
the declaration of independence had given voice to that idea in its most ringing phrase all men are created equal it was a belief that stood in direct contrast to the old european assumption of an inherited aristocracy.
the innate talents and energies of individuals not their positions at birth would determine their roles in society.
some people would inevitably be wealthier and more powerful than others.
but all people would have to earn their success.
there would be no equality of condition but there would be equality of opportunity.
in reality of course the united states was never a nation in which all citizens were independent property holders.
from the beginning there was a sizable dependent labor force.
white laborers enjoyed some of the privileges of citizenship.
persistent black workers were allowed virtually none.
inequality american women remained both politically and economically subordinate.
native americans were systematically exploited and displaced.
nor was there ever full equality of opportunity.
american society was more open and more fluid than the societies of most european nations but the condition of a persons birth was almost always a crucial determinant of success.
nevertheless in embracing the assumptions of republicanism americans were adopting a powerful even revolutionary ideology and their experiment in statecraft became a model for many other countries.
it made the united states for a time the most admired and studied nation on earth.
the first state constitutions the first and perhaps most basic decision about the character of government was that the constitutions were to be written down because americans believed the written vagueness of englands unwritten constitu candtstrongs tion had produced corruption.
the second legislatures decision was that the power of the executive which americans believed had grown too great in england must be limited.
pennsylvania eliminated the executive altogether.
most other states inserted provisions that limited the power of governors to make appointments and veto legislation.
most states also prevented governors from dismissing the legislature.
most important every state forbade the governor or any other executive officer from holding a seat in the legislature thus ensuring that unlike in england the executive and legislative branches of government would remain wholly separate.
but the new constitutions did not embrace direct popular rule.
in georgia and pennsylvania the legislature consisted of one popularly elected house.
but in every other state there was an upper and a lower chamber and in most cases the upper chamber was designed to represent the higher orders of society.
there were property requirements for voters some modest some substantial in all states.
revising state governments by the late 1770s many americans were growing concerned about the apparent divisiveness and instability of their new state governments.
most states were having trouble accomplishing anything.
many believed the problem was one of too much democracy.
as a result most of the states began to revise their constitutions to limit popular power.
massachusetts which waited until 1780 to ratify its first constitution was the first to act on the new concerns.
two changes in particular differentiated the massachusetts and later constitutions from the earlier ones.
the first was a change in the process of constitution writing itself.
most of the first documents had been written by state legislatures and thus could easily be amended or violated by them.
massachusetts and later other states sought a way to protect the constitutions from ordinary politics and created the constitutional convention a special assembly of the people that would meet only for the purpose of writing the constitution and that would never except under extraordinary circumstances meet again.
the second change was a significant strengthening of the executive a reaction to what many americans believed was the instability of the original state governments that had weak governors.
the 1780 massachusetts constitution made the governor one of the strongest in any strom state.
he was to be elected directly by the executives people he was to have a fixed salary in ther words he would not be dependent the american revolution.
151 on the goodwill of the legislature each year for his wages he would have significant appointment powers and a veto over legislation.
other states followed.
those with weak or nonexistent upper houses strengthened or created them.
most increased the powers of the governor.
pennsylvania which had no executive at first now produced a strong one.
by the late 1780s almost every state had either revised its constitution or drawn up a new one in an effort to produce stability in government.
toleration and slavery the states moved far in the direction of complete religious freedom.
most americans continued to believe that religion statute of should play some role in government but religious rhey did not wish to give special powers to liberty any particular denomination.
the privileges that churches had once enjoyed were now largely stripped away.
in 1786 virginia enacted the statute a free black man john singleton copley the great american portraitist of the revolutionary age painted this picture of a young african american in 1777 1978.

more difficult to resolve was the question of slavery.
in areas where slavery was already weak in new england where there had never been many slaves and in pennsylvania where the quakers opposed slavery it was abolished relatively early.
even in the south there were some pressures to amend or even eliminate the institution every state but south carolina and georgia prohibited further importation of slaves from abroad and south carolina banned the slave trade during the war.
virginia passed a law encouraging manumission the freeing of slaves.
nevertheless slavery survived in all the southern and border states.
there were several reasons racist assumptions among whites about the inferiority of blacks the enormous economic investments many white southerners had in their slaves and the inability of even such men as washington and jefferson who had moral misgivings about slavery to envision any alternative to it.
if slavery were abolished what would happen to the black people in america.
few whites believed blacks could be integrated into american society as equals.
in maintaining slavery jefferson once remarked americans were holding a wolf by the ears however unappealing it was to hold on to it letting go would be even worse.
the search for a national government americans were much quicker to agree on state institutions than they were on the structure of their national government.
at first most believed that the central government should remain a relatively weak and unimportant force and that each state would be virtually a sovereign nation.
it was in response to such ideas that the articles of confederation emerged.
the confederation the articles of confederation which the continental congress had adopted in 1777 provided for a national government much like the one already in place.
congress wrote for ratification of the articles permit us then earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.
let them be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strengths to maintain and defend our common liberties under the articles congress remained the central indeed the only institution of national authority.
its powers expanded to give it authority to conduct wars and foreign relations 152.
chapter 5 limited power of the national government and to appropriate borrow and issue money.
but it did not have power to regulate trade draft troops or levy taxes directly on the people.
for troops and taxes it had to make formal requests to the state legislatures which could and often did refuse them.
there was no separate executive the president of the united states was merely the presiding officer at the sessions of congress.
each state had a single vote in congress and at least nine of the states had to approve the admission of a new state.
all thirteen state legislatures had to approve any amendment of the articles.
during the process of ratifying the articles of confederation which required approval by all thirteen states broad disagreements over the plan became evident.
the small states had insisted on equal state representation but the larger states wanted representation to be based on population.
the smaller states prevailed on that issue.
more important the states claiming western lands wished to keep them but the rest of the states demanded that all such territory be turned over to the national government.
new york and virginia had to give up their western claims before the articles were finally approved.
they went into effect in 1781.
the confederation which existed from 1781 until 1789 was not a complete failure but it was far from a success.
it lacked adequate powers to deal with interstate issues or to enforce its will on the states and it had little stature in the eyes of the world.
diplomatic failures evidence of the low esteem in which the rest of the world held the confederation was its difficulty in persuading great britain and to a lesser extent spain to live up to the terms of the peace treaty of 1783.
the british had promised to evacuate american territory but british forces continued to occupy postwar disputes with britain and spain maine 7 mass.
lmew hampshirl connecticut atlantic ocean ceded by spain 1795 ceded by georgia 1802 f 1 v massachusetts w rhode island the conflict over western lands the american victory in the revolution transformed the colonies into states within a new nation whose central government claimed at least some sovereignty over the individual units.
an early conflict between national and state power took place over the state claims to western lands claims established during the colonial period.
this map shows the extensive western lands claimed by most of the original thirteen colonies to land in the west and it illustrates the shifting nature of those claims over time as colonies and then states transferred land to one another.
the new national government gradually persuaded the states to give it control of the western lands and in 1784 and 1785 it issued ordinances governing the process of settling those lands.
why did the national government consider it important for the states to give up their claim to these territories.

nor did the british honor their agreement to make restitution to slaveowners whose slaves the british army had confiscated.
there were also disputes over the boundaries of the new nation.
americans wanted full access to british markets england however placed sharp restrictions on that access.
in 1784 congress sent john adams as minister to london to resolve these differences but adams made no headway with the english who were never sure whether he represented a single nation or thirteen different ones.
throughout the 1780s the british government refused even to send a diplomatic minister to the american capital.
the confederation and the northwest the confederations most important accomplishment was its resolution of controversies over the western lands.
when the revolution began only a few thousand whites lived west of the appalachian mountains but by 1790 their numbers had increased to 120 000.
the confederation had to find a way to include these new settlements in the political structure of the nation.
the landed states began to yield their western claims to the national government in 1781 and by 1784 the confederation controlled enough land to permit congress to begin making policy for the western lands.

chicago history museum usa the bridgeman art library 154 chapter 5 the ordinances of 1784 and 1785 the ordinance of 1784 based on a proposal by thomas jefferson divided the western territory into ten self governing districts each of which could petition congress for statehood when its population equaled the number of free inhabitants of the smallest existing state.
the provision reflected the desire of the revolutionary generation to avoid creating second class citizens in subordinate territories.
then in the ordinance of 1785 congress created a system for surveying and selling the western lands.
the territory north of the ohio river was to be surveyed and marked off into neat rectangular townships each divided into thirty six identical sections.
in every township four sections were to be set aside for the united states the revenue from the sale of one of the other sections was to support creation of a public school.
sections were to be sold at auction for no less than one dollar an acre.
among the many important results of the ordinance of 1785 was the establishment of an enduring pattern of divid the grid in8 up an fr human use.
many such systems have emerged throughout history.
some have relied on natural boundaries rivers mountains and other topographical features.
some have reflected informal claims of landlords over vast but vaguely defined territories.
some have rested on random allocations of acres to be determined by individual landholders.
but many enlightenment thinkers began in the eighteenth century to imagine more precise even mathematical forms of land distribution which required both careful surveying and a clear method for defining boundaries.
the result was the method applied in 1785 in the northwest territory which came to be known as the grid the division of land into carefully measured and evenly divided squares or rectangles.
this pattern of land distribution eventually became the norm for much of the land west of the appalachians.
it also became a model for the organization of many towns and cities which distributed land in geometrical patterns within rectangular grids defined by streets.
although older land distribution systems survive within the united states the grid has become the most common form by which americans impose human ownership and use on the landscape.
the original ordinances were highly favorable to land northwest speculators and less so to ordinary settlers ordinance many of whom could not afford the price of the land.
congress compounded the problem by selling much of the best land to the ohio and scioto land companies before making it available to anyone else.
criticism of these policies led to the passage in 1787 of another law governing western settlement legislation that became known as the northwest ordinance the 1787 ordinance abandoned the ten districts established in 1784 and created a single northwest territory out of the lands the seven ranges first area survey geographer s line base line u oc c u to oc c.

these maps illustrate the way in which the lands were divided in an area of ohio.
note the highly geometrical grid pattern that the ordinance imposed on these lands.
each of the squares in the map on the left was subdivided into 36 sections as illustrated in the map at the lower right.
why was this grid pattern so appealing to the planners of the western lands.
1 mile the american revolution 155 north of the ohio the territory could eventually be divided into between three and five territories.
it also specified a population of 60 000 as a minimum for statehood guaranteed freedom of religion and the right to trial by jury to residents of the northwest and prohibited slavery throughout the territory.
the western lands south of the ohio river received less attention from congress and development was more chaotic there.
the region that became kentucky and tennessee developed rapidly in the late 1770s and in the 1780s speculators and settlers began setting up governments and asking for recognition as states.
the confederation was never able to successfully resolve the conflicting claims in that region.
indians and the western lands on paper at least the western land policies of the confederation created a system that brought order and stability to the process of white settlement in the northwest.
but in reality order and stability came slowly and at great cost because much of the land the confederation was neatly subdividing and offering for sale consisted of territory claimed by the indians of the region.
congress tried to resolve that problem in 1784 1785 and 1786 by persuading iroquois choctaw chickasaw and cherokee leaders to sign treaties ceding substantial western lands in the north and south to the united states.
but those agreements proved ineffective.
in 1786 the leadership of the iroquois confederacy repudiated the treaty it had signed two years earlier and threatened to attack white settlements in the disputed lands.
other tribes had never accepted the treaties affecting them and continued to resist white movement into their lands.
violence between whites and indians on the northwest frontier reached a crescendo in the early 1790s.
in 1790 and again in 1791 a group of tribes led by the famed miami war d rior little turtle defeated united states fallen forces in two major battles near what is timbers now the western border of ohio in the second of those battles on november 4 1791 630 white americans died in fighting at the wabash river the greatest military victory indians had ever or would ever again achieve in their battles with whites.
efforts to negotiate a settlement failed because of the miamis insistence that no treaty was possible unless it forbade white settlement west of the ohio river.
negotiations did not resume until after general anthony wayne led 4 000 soldiers into the ohio valley in 1794 and defeated the indians in the battle of fallen timbers.
a year later the miami signed the treaty of greenville ceding substantial new lands to the united states which was now operating under the constitution of 1789 in exchange for a formal acknowledgment of their claim to the territory they had managed to retain.
in doing so the united states was affirming that indian lands could be ceded only by the tribes themselves.
that hard won assurance however proved a frail protection against the pressure of white expansion westward in later years.
debts taxes and daniel shays the postwar depression which lasted from 1784 to 1787 in postwar creased the perennial american problem of depression an inadequate money supply a problem that weighed particularly heavily on debtors.
in dealing with this problem congress most clearly demonstrated its weakness.
the confederation itself had an enormous outstanding debt that it had accumulated at home and abroad during the revolutionary war.
it had few means with which to pay it having no power to tax.
it could only make requisitions of the states and it received only about one sixth of the money it requisitioned.
the fragile new nation was faced with the grim prospect of defaulting on its obligations.
this alarming possibility brought to the fore a group of leaders who would play a crucial role in the shaping of the little turtle little turtle led the miami confederacy in its wars with the united states in what is now ohio and indiana in the early 1790s.
for a time he seemed almost invincible but in 1794 little turtle was defeated in the battle of fallen timbers.
in this sketch a rough copy of a painting attributed to gilbert stuart little turtle wears a medal bearing the likeness of george washington awarded him by the united states after the signing of the treaty of greenville.
the granger collection new york 156 chapter 5 daniel shays and job shattuck shays and shattuck were the principal leaders of the 1786 uprising by poor farmers in massachusetts demanding relief from their indebtedness.
shattuck led an insurrection in the east which collapsed when he was captured on november 30.
shays organized the rebellion in the west which continued until the state militia dispersed the rebels in late february 1787.
the following year state authorities pardoned shays even before that the legislature responded to the rebellion by providing some relief to the impoverished farmers.

committed nationalists they sought ways to increase the powers of the central government and to meet its financial obligations.
robert morris the head of the confederations treasury alexander hamilton his young protege james madison of virginia and others called for a continental impost a 5 percent duty on imported goods to be levied by congress and used to fund the debt.
many americans however feared that the impost plan would concentrate too much financial power in the hands of morris and his allies in philadelphia.
congress failed to approve the impost in 1781 and again in 1783.
angry and discouraged the nationalists largely withdrew from any active involvement in the confederation.
political disputes over economic issues the states had war debts too and they generally relied on increased taxation to pay them.
but poor farmers already burdened by debt and now burdened again by new taxes considered such policies unfair even tyrannical.
they demanded that the state governments issue paper currency to increase the money supply and make it easier for them to meet their obligations.
resentment was especially high among farmers in new england who felt that the states were squeezing them to enrich already wealthy bondholders in boston and other towns.
throughout the late 1780s therefore mobs of distressed farmers rioted periodically in various parts of new england.
dissidents in the connecticut valley and the berkshire hills of massachusetts many of them revolutionary veterans ral shayss hed behind daniel shays a former captain rebellion in the continental army.
shays issued a set of demands that included paper money tax relief a moratorium on debts the relocation of the state capital from boston to the interior and the abolition of imprisonment for debt.
during the summer of 1786 the shaysites concentrated on preventing the collection of debts private or public and used force to keep courts from sitting and sheriffs from selling confiscated property.
in boston members of the legislature including samuel adams denounced shays and his men as rebels and traitors.
when winter came the rebels advanced on springfield hoping to seize weapons from the arsenal there.
an army of state militiamen financed by a loan from wealthy merchants set out from boston to confront them.
in january 1787 this army met shayss band and dispersed his ragged troops.
as a military enterprise shayss rebellion was a failure although it produced some concessions to the aggrieved farmers.
shays and his lieutenants at first sentenced to death were later pardoned and massachusetts offered the protesters some tax relief and a postponement of debt payments.
the rebellion had more important consequences for the future of the united states however for it added urgency to a movement already gathering support throughout the new nation the movement to produce a new national constitution.
looking back between a small inconclusive battle on a village green in new england in 1775 and a momentous surrender at yorktown in 1781 the american people fought a great and terrible war against the mightiest military nation in the world.
no one outside america and few within it would have predicted in 1775 that the makeshift armies of the colonies could withstand the armies and navies of the british empire.
but a combination of luck brilliance determination and timely aid from abroad allowed the patriots as they began to call themselves to make full use of the advantages of fighting on their home soil and to frustrate british designs time and again.
the war was not just a historic military event.
it was also a great political one for it propelled the colonies to unite to organize and in july 1776 to declare their independence.
having done so they fought with even greater determination defending now not just a set of principles but an actual fledgling nation.
by the end of the war they had created new governments at both the state and national level and had begun experimenting with new political forms that would distinguish the united states from any previous nation in history.
the war was also important for its effects on american society for the way it shook although never overturned the the american revolution 157 existing social order for the way it caused women to question although seldom openly to challenge their place in society and for the way it spread notions of liberty and freedom throughout a society that in the past had often been rigidly hierarchical and highly deferential.
even african american slaves absorbed some of the ideas of the revolution although it would be many years before they would be in any position to make much use of them.
victory in the american revolution solved many of the problems of the new nation but it also produced others.
what should the united states do about its relations with the indians and with its neighbors to the north and south.
what should it do about the distribution of western lands.
what should it do about slavery.
how should it balance its commitment to liberty with its need for order.
these questions bedeviled the new national government in its first years of existence and ultimately led americans to create a new political order.

what were the most important questions debated at the constitutional convention of 1787 and how were they resolved.
what were the main tenets of the federalist and antifederalist arguments on ratification of the constitution.
3 what were the origins of america s first party system.
setting the stage by the late 1780s most americans had grown deeply dissatisfied with the confederation government with its inability to deal with factions and instability its powerlessness as shown in dealing with shays s rebellion and its failure to handle economic problems effectively.
a decade earlier americans had deliberately avoided creating a strong national government fearing that it would encroach on the sovereignty of the individual states.
now they reconsidered.
in 1787 they produced a new constitution that created a new powerful national government the new government created in 1787 has survived for more than two centuries as one of the stablest and most successful in the world.
many americans have described the constitution s provisions as unassailable fundamental law from which all public policies all political principles all solutions of controversies must spring.
yet the adoption of the constitution did not complete the creation of the republic it only defined the terms in which debate over the future of government would continue.
americans may have agreed that the constitution was a nearly perfect document but they disagreed at times fundamentally on what that document meant.
they still do.
out of such disagreements emerged the first great political battles of the new nation.
framing a new government so unpopular and ineffectual had the confederation congress become by the mid 1780s that it began to lead an almost waiflike existence.
in 1783 its members timidly withdrew from philadelphia to escape from the clamor of army veterans demanding back pay.
they took refuge for a while in princeton a weak new jersey then moved to annapolis and in 1785 settled in new york.
through central delegates were often conspicuous largely by their absence.
only government with great difficulty did congress secure a quorum to ratify the treaty with great britain ending the revolutionary war.
eighteen members representing only eight states voted on the confederation s most important piece of legislation the northwest ordinance.
in the meantime a major public debate was beginning over the future of the confederation.
advocates of centralization weak and unpopular though the confederation was it had for a time satisfied a great many probably a majority of the people.
they believed they had fought the revolutionary war to avert the danger of what they considered remote and tyrannical authority now they wanted to keep political power centered in the states where they could carefully and closely control it.
but during the 1780s some of the wealthiest and most powerful groups in the country began to clamor for a more genuinely national government capable of dealing with the nations problems supporters of particularlv rhe economic problems that most directly afflicted them.
some a strong military men many of them members of the exclusive and hereditary society of national tlle cincinnati formed by revolutionary army officers in 1783 were disgrun government tied at the refusal of congress to fund their pensions.
they began aspiring to in fluence and invigorate the national government some even envisioned a form of military dictatorship and flirted briefly in 1783 in the so called newburgh conspiracy with a direct challenge to congress until george washington intervened and blocked the potential rebellion.
american manufacturers the artisans and mechanics of the nations cities and towns wanted to replace the various state tariffs with a uniformly high national duty merchants and shippers wanted to replace the thirteen different and largely ineffective state commercial policies with a single national one.
land speculators wanted the indian menace finally removed from their western tracts.
people who were owed money wanted to stop the states from issuing paper money which would lower the value of what they received in payment.
investors in confederation securities wanted the government to fund the debt and thus enhance the value of their securities.
large property owners looked for protection from the threat of mobs a threat 160.

this fear of disorder and violence expressed a tension between the resolute defense of individual rights which was a core principle of the revolution and found reflection in the bill of rights p 168 and the public concern for safety and security which the occasional chaos of the confederation period had reinforced.
frequent conflicts between liberty and order became and remain a central feature of american democracy.
by 1786 these diverse demands had grown so powerful that the issue was no longer whether the confederation should be changed but how drastic the changes should be.
even the defenders of the existing system reluctantly came to agree that the government needed strengthening at its weakest point its lack of power to tax.
the most resourceful of the reformers was alexander hamilton political genius new york lawyer onetime military aide to general washington and illegitimate son of a scottish alexander merchant in the west indies.
from the be hamilton ginning hamilton had been unhappy with the articles of confederation and the weak central government they had created.
he now called for a national convention to overhaul the entire document.
he found an important ally in james madison of virginia who persuaded the virginia legislature to convene an interstate conference on commercial questions.
only five states sent delegates to the meeting held in annapolis maryland in 1786 but the delegates approved a proposal drafted by hamilton who was representing new york recommending that congress call a convention of special delegates from all the states to gather in philadelphia the next year and consider ways to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union at that moment in 1786 there seemed little possibility that the philadelphia convention would attract any more interest than the meeting at annapolis had attracted.
only by winning the support of george washington the centralizers believed could they hope to prevail.
but washington at first showed little interest in joining the cause.
then early in 1787 the news of shayss rebellion spread throughout the nation.
thomas jefferson then the american minister in paris was not alarmed.
t hold he confided in a letter to james madison that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical but washington took the news less calmly.
in may he left his home at mount vernon in virginia for the constitutional convention in philadelphia.
his support gave the meeting immediate credibility.
