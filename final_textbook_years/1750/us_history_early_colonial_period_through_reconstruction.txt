hamilton eventually married into a wealthy new york family and began practicing law.
he served as washington s aide and as a delegate to four continental congresses.
national debt as secretary of the treasury hamilton s biggest challenge was paying off the national debt money owed by the united states from the revolutionary war.
the united states owed about 11 7 million to foreign countries and about 40 4 million to u s citizens.
during the war the government raised money with bonds.
bonds are certificates of debt that carry a promise to buy back the bonds at a higher price.
the new government could not afford to keep this promise.

hamilton wanted to pay the foreign debt immediately and gradually repay the total value of all bonds.
the second part of his plan caused disagreements because paying full value would allow speculators to make a profit.
hamilton thought this was fair.
he said he the speculator paid what the commodity bond was worth and took the risks.
thomas jefferson disagreed.
he thought the idea cheated bondholders who had sold their bonds at low prices.
jefferson wrote immense sums were thus filched stolen from the poor and ignorant.
but more politicians agreed with hamilton.
in 1790 the government exchanged old bonds for new more reliable ones that were guaranteed.
states debts the states owed 25 million for revolutionary war expenses.
hamilton wanted the federal government to pay for 21 5 million of this debt.
hamilton believed that this action would help the federal government.
he thought that paying the states debts would help the national economy.
debtor states would not have to spend so much on repayment and would have money to develop business and trade.
increased business and trade would put more money back into the national economy.

reading check.
a national bank hamilton s and jefferson s differences became more and more public in early 1791.
the two men had very different opinions about how the government should approach its economic problems.
hamilton s plan for a national bank hamilton wanted to start a national bank where the government could safely deposit its money.
the bank would also make loans to the government and businesses.
hamilton also thought that the united states should build a national mint a place to make coins.
then the country could begin issuing its own money.
hamilton knew that people who wanted to protect states rights might have a strong reaction to the idea of a national bank so he suggested limiting it to a 20 year charter.
after that time congress could decide whether to extend the charter.
hamilton also asked each state to start its own bank so the national bank would not have a monopoly.
the impact today beginning in 2008 the u s mint has tried to increase the use of 1 00 coins for several reasons including the ability to recycle the metal used to make them.
launching the nation 241 jefferson opposes the bank both jefferson and madison believed that hamilton s plans for the economy gave too much power to the federal government.
they also thought the u s constitution did not give congress the power to create a bank.
but hamilton quoted the elastic clause which states that congress can make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to govern the nation.
hamilton declared that the clause allowed the government to create a national bank.
hamilton believed in loose construction of the constitution.
loose construction means that the federal government can take reasonable actions that the constitution does not specifically forbid.
jefferson thought that the elastic clause should be used only in special cases.
he wrote to president washington the constitution allows only the means which are necessary not those which are merely convenient.
jefferson believed in strict construction of the constitution.
people who favor strict construction think that the federal government should do only what the constitution specifically says it can do.
president washington and congress agreed with hamilton.
they hoped a bank would offer stability for the u s economy.
in february 1791 congress enacted the charter for the bank of the united states the country s first national bank.

washington presented his opinion to congress on april 22 1793 the duty and interest of the united states require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial unbiased towards the belligerent fighting powers.
george washington quoted in the real george washington by parry et al.
this neutrality proclamation stated that the united states would not take sides with any european countries that were at war.
washington believed his plan was the safest for the long run but not everyone agreed.
some members of congress criticized washington s ideas.
james madison believed that the president had gone beyond his authority.
he questioned washington s right to issue the proclamation without the approval of congress.
the french question france s new representative to the united states edmond genet zhuh nay asked american sailors to help france fight england by commanding privateers.
privateers were private ships hired by a country to attack its enemies.
washington told genet that using american privateers violated u s neutrality.
jefferson wanted the french revolutionaries to succeed but even he agreed that allowing france to use american privateers against england was a bad idea.
jefferson was still upset by u s policy toward france.
he believed that the united states should back france because france had supported the united states during the revolutionary war.
hamilton on the other hand was pro british.
he hoped to strengthen trading ties with britain the most powerful trading nation in the world at the time.

hundreds of the ships were neutral american merchant ships.
also british officers were helping native americans fight settlers.
washington wanted to prevent another war with the british.
he sent chief justice john jay to london to work out a compromise.
the british knew the united states lacked a strong navy and that u s businesses relied heavily on british trade.
however the british did not want to fight another war in america.
in november 1794 the two sides signed jay s treaty.
jay s treaty settled the disputes that had arisen between the united states and great britain in the early 1790s.
the british would pay damages on seized american ships and abandon their forts on the northwestern frontier.
the united states agreed to pay debts it owed the british.
the treaty was unpopular and sparked violent protests.
citizens and congressional leaders thought the treaty hurt trade and did not punish britain enough for some of its actions.
southerners were especially angry that the treaty did not ask britain to repay them for slaves that britain had set free during the revolutionary war.
washington did not like the treaty but believed it was the most that could be done.
at his urging the senate approved the treaty.
pinckney s treaty american businesses faced problems as well.
the spanish disputed the border between the united states and florida.
spain closed the port of new orleans to u s trade in 1784.
this hurt the american economy because all goods moving down the mississippi to places in the east or overseas had to pass through new orleans.
washington asked ambassador thomas pinckney to meet with spanish officials to discuss the problem.
he asked the spaniards to reopen new orleans to u s trade.
pinckney also asked for the right of deposit in new orleans.
this right would allow american boats to transfer goods in new orleans without paying cargo fees.
spanish minister manuel de godoy goh thoy tried to delay reaching an agreement hoping pinckney would become desperate and sign a treaty that favored the spanish.
he was worried that the united states and great britain might join against spain after signing jay s treaty.
pinckney was patient however and his patience was rewarded.
in october 1795 godoy agreed to pinckney s treaty which settled the border and trade disputes with spain.

that setthe stage for war.
first continental congress to many colonists the closing of boston harbor was the final insult in a long list of abuses.
in response to the mounting crisis all the colonies except georgia sent representatives to a meeting in october 1774.
this meeting known as the first continental congress was a gathering of colonial leaders who were deeply troubled about the relationship between great britain and its colonies in america.
at carpenters hall in philadelphia the leaders remained locked in weeks of intense debate.
patrick henry and others believed that violence was unavoidable.
on the other hand delegates from pennsylvania and new york had strict orders to seek peace.
wisely the delegates compromised.
they encouraged colonists to continue boycotting british goods but told colonial militias to prepare for war.
meanwhile they drafted the declaration of rights a list of 10 resolutions to be presented to king george iii.
included was the colonists right to life liberty and property.
the first continental congress did not seek a separation from britain.
its goal was to state the colonists concerns and ask the king to correct the problems.
but before they left philadelphia the delegates agreed to meet in 1775 if the king refused their petition.
patrick henry returned from the congress and reported to his fellow virginians.
to encourage them to support the patriot cause chapter 4 henry voiced these famous words they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.
but when will we be stronger.
gentlemen may cry peace peace but there is no peace.
i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death patrick henry quoted in eyewitnesses and others in time many colonists came to agree with henry.

identifying cause and effect why did the delegates attend the first continental congress.
what were the results.
reading check.
shot heard round the world the continental congress planned to meet again in 1775.
before it could the situation in the colonies had changed for the worse.
the ride of paul revere british military leaders in the colonies grew uneasy when local militias seemed to be preparing for action.
the governor of massachusetts thomas gage learned that a stockpile of weapons was stored in concord about 20 miles from boston.
in april 1775 he decided to seize the supplies.
the american revolution 113 academic vocabulary reaction response gage thought he had kept his plan a secret.
however boston was full of spies for the patriot cause.
they noticed the british were preparing for action and quickly informed the patriots.
unsure of how the british would strike sons of liberty member paul revere enlisted the aid of robert newman.
newman was to climb into the steeple of the old north church and watch for british soldiers.
if they advanced across land newman would display one lantern from the steeple.
if they rowed across the charles river newman would display two lanterns.
when revere and fellow patriot william dawes saw two lights shine they set off on horseback.
using two different routes out of boston they sounded the alert.
as the riders advanced drums and church bells called out the local militia or minutemen who got their name because they were ready to fight at a minute s notice.
another rider a free african american named wentworth cheswell rode north to new hampshire and maine to gather reinforcements.
battles at lexington and concord at dawn on april 19 the british troops arrived at the town of lexington near concord and about 15 miles from boston where 70 armed minutemen waited.
patriot captain john parker yelled to his troops don t fire unless fired upon.
suddenly a shot rang out.
to this day no one knows who fired this shot heard round the world.
the battle at lexington ended in minutes with only a few volleys fired.
when the smoke cleared 8 of the badly outnumbered minutemen lay dead and 10 were wounded.
the british with only one soldier wounded marched on to concord.
although revere had been arrested the citizens of concord were warned by another rider samuel prescott.
most of the weapons in concord had already been hidden but the few that were left were now concealed.
some of the british troops frustrated because the stockpile had disappeared set fire to a few buildings.
in reaction the minutemen charged forward.
for the skilled colonial marksmen of concord the british soldiers made an easy target.
they were wearing the british military uniform with its bright red jacket.
for some time the colonists had called the british soldiers redcoats because of these jackets.
the british were forced to retreat to boston suffering many casualties along the way.
reading check drawing inferences why did the patriots need several riders.
why did they take different routes.
second continental congress king george iii had refused to address the concerns listed in the declaration of rights.
in may 1775 delegates from 12 colonies met again in philadelphia for the second continental congress.
this second group of delegates from the colonies was still far from unified but represented the first attempt at a republican government in the colonies.
some of the delegates called for a war others for peace.
once again they compromised.
although the congress did not openly revolt delegates showed their growing dissatisfaction.
they sent word to colonial authorities asking for new state constitutions.
states set up conventions to write them.
they also authorized the massachusetts militia to become the continental army.
this force would soon include soldiers from all colonies and would carry out the fight against britain.
congress named a virginian george washington to command the army.
as washington prepared for war the congress pursued peace.
on july 5 the delegates signed the olive branch petition as a final attempt to restore harmony.
king george refused to read it.
instead he looked for new ways to punish the colonies.
14 chapter 4 reading check summarizing what did the second continental congress accomplish.
early battles while the congress discussed peace the massachusetts militia began to fight.
boston was a key city in the early days of the war.
both patriots and the british fought to hold it.
bunker hill desperate for supplies leaders in boston sent benedict arnold and a force of 400 men to new york state.
their objective was to attack the british at fort ticonderoga.
in may 1775 arnold captured the fort and its large supply of weapons.
meanwhile the poorly supplied patriots kept the british pinned down inside boston.
although british leaders were trying to form a battle plan they awoke on june 17 to a stunning sight.
the colonial forces had quietly dug in at breed s hill a point overlooking north boston.
the redcoats would have to cross boston harbor and fight their way uphill.
as the british force of 2 400 advanced 1 600 militia members waited.
low on gunpowder the commander ordered his troops not to fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
as they climbed the exposed hillside with their heavy packs the british soldiers were cut down.
twice they retreated.
stepping over the dead and wounded they returned for a third try.
the colonists were now out of ammunition and eventually they had to retreat.
this famous conflict is now known as the battle of bunker hill although it was actually launched from breed s hill.
while the patriots lost they proved they could take on the redcoats.
for the british the battle was a tragic victory.
to win they had sacrificed about double the number of patriot soldiers.
dorchester heights shortly after the battle of bunker hill general washington arrived in boston to command the continental army.
washington knew that he would need heavier guns to drive the british out of boston and he knew where to get them fort ticonderoga.
colonel henry knox was assigned to transport the captured cannons from fort ticonderoga to boston.
he successfully brought the heavy guns over 300 miles of rough terrain in the middle of winter.
when knox delivered the cannons washington was ready to regain control of boston.
on march 4 1776 washington moved his army to dorchester heights an area that overlooked boston from the south.
he stationed the cannons and his troops on nook s hill overlooking british general william howe s position.
when howe awoke the next morning and saw the patriots well positioned artillery he knew he would have to retreat.
the rebels have done more in one night than my whole army could do in months howe declared.
on march 7 howe retreated from boston to canada.

this plainspoken argument against british rule over america appeared in common sense a 47 page pamphlet that was distributed in philadelphia in january 1776.
common sense was published anonymously that is without the author s name.
the author thomas paine argued that citizens not kings and queens should make laws.
at a time when monarchs ruled much of the world this was a bold idea.

paine reached a wide audience by writing as a common person speaking to common people.
common sense changed the way many colonists viewed their king.
it made a strong case for economic freedom and for the right to military self defense.

in june 1776 the second continental congress began writing a document declaring independence.
a committee also created a seal for the new country with the latin motto epluribus unum or out of many one.
this motto recognized the new union of states.
a new philosophy of government the declaration of independence formally announced the colonies break from great britain.
in doing so it expressed three main ideas.
first thomas jefferson the document s main author argued that all people possess unalienable rights or rights that are a natural part of being bom and cannot be taken away.
these include the rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
next jefferson listed the complaints of the colonists.
he asserted that king george iii had violated the colonists rights by taxing them without their consent.
jefferson accused the king of passing unfair laws and interfering with colonial governments.
he also believed that stationing a large british army within the colonies was a burden.
third jefferson stated that the colonies had the right to break from britain.
influenced by the enlightenment ideal of the social contract he maintained that governments and rulers must protect the rights of citizens.
in exchange the people agree to be governed.
jefferson argued that king george iii had broken the social contract.
on july 4 1776 the continental congress approved the declaration of independence.
this act broke all ties to the british crown.
the united states of america was bom.
choosing sides the signing of the declaration made the rebellion a full scale revolt against britain.
those who supported it would be considered traitors.
colonists who chose to side with the british were known as loyalists often called tories.

however because the declaration was not approved until july 4 the fourth is celebrated today as independence day.
primary source points of view choosing sides when ben franklin s son william was a child he helped his father experiment with lightning.
but by the time william had grown and the revolution started the two men viewed the conflict differently.
they exchanged letters on the subject.
am indeed of the opinion that the parliament has no right to make any law whatever binding on the colonies.
i know your sentiments differ from mine on these subjects.
you are a thorough government man which i do not wonder at nor do i aim at converting you.

mi signing the declaration of independence w k jefferson writes.
j the declaration jk of independence history historians estimate that 40 to 45 percent of americans were patriots while 20 to 30 percent were loyalists.
the rest were neutral.
because of persecution by patriots more than 50 000 loyalists fled the colonies during the revolution.
most went to canada where britain allowed them more self rule after the revolution.
in doing so they abandoned their homes and property.
divided allegiances tore apart families and friendships even benjamin franklin became separated from his loyalist son william.
native americans were at first encouraged by both sides to remain neutral.
by the summer of 1776 however both patriots and the british were aggressively recruiting indian fighters.
most sided with the british.
in northern new york four of the six iroquois nations fought for the british.
however the oneida and tuscarora helped the patriots even delivering food to the soldiers at valley forge.
drawing conclusions why would native americans have lost out no matter who won the war.
reading check unfinished business today we recognize that the declaration of independence excluded many colonists.
while it declared that all men are created equal the document failed to mention women enslaved africans or native americans.
the rights of these minorities would be subject to the rule of the majority.
women although many women were patriots the declaration did not address their rights.
at least one delegate s wife abigail adams tried to influence her husband john to include women s rights in the declaration.
in a failed effort she expressed her concerns remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors.
do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.
if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are and will not hold ourselves bound by laws in which we have no voice or representation abigail adams quoted in notable american women 10 chapter 4 african and native americans the declaration did not recognize the rights of enslaved africans either.
the authors had compared life under british rule to living as an enslaved people.
the obvious question arose why did any form of slavery exist in a land that valued personal freedom.
even thomas jefferson the main author of the declaration was a slaveholder.
in july 1776 slavery was legal in all the colonies.
by the 1780s the new england colonies were taking steps to end slavery.
even so the conflict over slavery continued long after the revolutionary war.
the declaration of independence also did not address the rights of native americans to life liberty or property.
despite the proclamation of 1763 american colonists had been quietly settling on lands that belonged to native americans.

the american revolution 121 1 thomas jefferson wrote the first draft of the declaration in a little more than two weeks.
how is the declaration s idea about why governments are formed still important to our country today.
exploring thedocument vocabulary impel force endowed provided usurpations wrongful seizures of power evinces clearly displays f despotism unlimited power tyranny oppressive power exerted by a government 1 or ruler i candid fair i here the declaration lists the charges that the colonists had against king george iii.
how does the language in the list appeal to people s emotions.
exploring thedocument the declaration of independence in congress july 4 1776 the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.
he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within.
he has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws of naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
he has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.
he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislature.
he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.
he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states j vocabulary relinquish release yield inestimable priceless formidable causing dread annihilation destruction convulsions violent disturbances naturalization of foreigners the process by which foreign born persons become citizens i appropriations of lands i setting aside land for i settlement i tenure term a multitude of many quartering lodging housing mum bett a massachusetts slave believed that the words all men are created equal should apply to her and other enslaved africans.

what do you think tyrant means in this passage.
exploring the document for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislature and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.
he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people.
he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands.
he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions.
in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
nor have we been wanting in attention to our british brethren.
we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.

winter at valley forge the entry of france and spain into the war came at a crucial moment.
the continental army was running very low on food and clothing.
in december 1777 washington settled his 12 000 men at valley forge north of philadelphia.
to this day the name of valley forge brings to mind suffering and courage.
yet no battles took place here.
the only enemy was the brutal winter of 1777 78.
washington s men lacked even the most basic protections against shin deep snows.
in spite of the general s repeated requests for supplies conflicts over funding between state authorities and congress kept supplies from coming.
washington wrote in a letter to see men without clothes without blankets to lie upon without shoes without a house or hut to cover them until those could be built and submitting without a murmur is a proof of patience and obedience which in my opinion can scarcely be paralleled matched george washington quoted in george washington a collection as winter roared in soldiers quickly built crude shelters that offered little protection against the weather.
some soldiers had no shirts.
others had marched the shoes off their feet.
at their guard posts they stood on their hats to keep their feet from touching the freezing ground.

during that terrible winter some 2 000 soldiers died of disease and malnutrition.
amazingly the survivors not only stayed they drilled and marched to the orders of baron von steuben becoming better soldiers.

each area posed tough challenges.
war at sea the entry of the french navy into the war greatly aided the colonists.
many people had thought that the mighty british navy would crush the much smaller american fleet.
however the british failed to use their powerful navy effectively during the war.
in the fall of 1775 the continental congress made plans to build four american warships.
soon afterward the congress formally established the marines and the continental navy.
by adapting merchant vessels the navy had eight fighting ships ready for combat by february 1776.
that month the tiny american navy launched a major offensive to damage the operating ability of the british fleet located off the carolina coast.
rather than attack the fleet directly the patriots went after the british supply base on nassau in the bahamas.
the american troops seized the main supply fort on the island.
they then raised the newly created flag of the american revolution over nassau.
after that campaign the american navy focused on seizing british supply ships and weakening britain s naval forces in the west indies.
john paul jones the patriots owed much of their success on the seas to naval hero john paul jones.
jones had once been considered an outlaw.
he was bom john paul in scotland and began working on ships at a young age.
after accidentally killing the leader of a mutiny he fled to america and added jones to his name.
when the war broke out jones volunteered his services to the newly created navy.
he quickly established himself as a brave and clever sailor.
considered a pirate by the british jones captured many british supply ships.
the french greatly admired jones.
when france entered the war in 1778 french leaders presented him with a small fleet of seven vessels to command.
he named his flagship bonhomme richard gentleman richard in honor of benjamin franklin s poor richard s almanac.
one of jones s most famous victories was the capture of the british warship serapis on september 23 1779.
early in the battle the british knocked out the heaviest artillery on the bonhomme richard.
captain richard pearson of the serapis then called out to jones has your ship struck surrendered.
jones replied i have not yet begun to fight.
the battle continued for more than two hours.
finally the americans wore down the british who surrendered at 10 30 p m.
the continental navy used fewer than 100 ships over the course of the war.
yet the british lost more than 200 ships to the small but effective american naval force.
war in the west the lands west of the appalachian mountains were controlled by native american nations.
both the british and the patriots tried to enlist these groups in their cause.
george rogers clark volunteered to lead the western campaign.
clark had been a surveyor along the ohio and kentucky rivers.
by the time the war broke out he knew the lands of the midwest well.
clark created an army from the scattered settlements in the area.
one of the best known groups was the over mountain men a band of settlers from present day tennessee.
determined to weaken british support systems clark targeted trading villages.
following the ohio river to the tennessee clark s force set out on a 120 mile overland trek to kaskaskia in present day illinois.
the village s leaders learned of the attack and surrendered.

they also managed to bring enough patriot flags for an army of hundreds.
the flags were displayed near the fort and the skilled pioneers sustained enough musket fire to indicate a much larger army.

then copy the graphic the american revolution 139 social studies skills analysis critical thinking civic participation study constructing time lines define the skill time lines are a good way to organize historical information.
time lines clearly show a sequence of historical events eras or people s achievements over a certain period of time.
using a time line to describe the events in the sequence in which they happened is using relative chronology.
in addition to showing events in the order they happened time lines also show the amount of time between events.
using the specific dates of events is ordering events with absolute chronology.
when you construct a time line to sequence events you can often better understand the context of certain events.
it can help you determine cause and effect relationships among them or see specific themes within a time period.
the first step in actually constructing the time line is to draw a straight line using a ruler.
then mark intervals of time on the line.
these represent the dates that divide the time line into smaller equal time periods.
for example a time line of the revolution might include three year intervals 1770 1773 1776 and so on.
then add events in the correct places on the time line.
the beginning and end of the time line each interval and each event should be labeled with dates.
as a final touch the time line needs a title.
once you have completed the time line you can use it to interpret the events.
look for events that are similar such as the meetings of the first and second continental congresses.
you can describe how far apart they are and which events led to each one.
learn the skill practice the skill when you construct a time line you need to make some basic decisions.
first the time line needs a topic.
this topic can be general or specific.
for example it might be as general as the american revolution or more specific such as important battles of the revolution.
the time line should span a period that includes the main events related to the topic.
a time line on all the major events of the revolution might cover the period 1770 1783.
the next step in constructing a time line is taking notes on events from the chosen time period and topic.
write down the date when each event happened.
if there are too many events it is a good idea to include only the most important ones.
follow these instructions to construct a time line.
using your textbook choose a topic related to the revolution for your time line.
decide on the dates your time line will need to cover.
use your textbook to take notes on events to include in your time line and their dates.
put the events in order.
following the steps described above construct your time line.
the finished time line should include clearly labeled dates at least six events and a title.
look for relationships between the events and then write a summary of the time line.

i taking notes use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the new american government.
ideas about government the american colonies had taken a bold step in declaring their independence from great britain in july 1776.
their next political goal was to form a new government.
to do so the american people drew from a wide range of political ideas.
english laws and the enlightenment one source of inspiration was the rule of law.
this rule makes even government officials subject to law.
england had limited the power of its kings and queens in two documents.
these were magna carta and the english bill of rights.
magna carta a document signed by king john in 1215 made the king subject to law.
the english bill of rights passed in 1689 declared the supremacy of parliament.
it kept the king or queen from changing laws without parliament s consent.
as a result the people s representatives had a strong voice in england s government.
many americans were also influenced by the enlightenment a philosophical movement that emphasized the use of reason to 152 chapter 5 examine old ideas and traditions.
philosopher john locke believed that a social contract existed between political rulers and the people they ruled.
baron de montesquieu argued that the only way to achieve liberty was through the separation of governmental powers.
american models of government americans had their own models of self government to follow like town meetings the virginia house of burgesses and the mayflower compact.
in 1639 the people of connecticut drew up the english colonies first written constitution.
a constitution is a set of basic principles and laws that states the powers and duties of the government.
in addition the declaration of independence clearly set forth the beliefs on which americans thought government should be based.
to keep individual leaders from gaining too much power the new state constitutions created limited governments or governments in which all leaders have to obey the laws.
most state constitutions had rules to protect the rights of citizens or those accused of crimes.
some banned slavery.
the massachusetts constitution of 1780 is the oldest state constitution still in effect.
thomas jefferson s ideas about religious freedom were included in the virginia statute for religious freedom.
this document declared that no person could be forced to attend a particular church or be required to pay for a church with tax money.
right to vote under british rule only free white men that owned land could vote.
many states constitutions expanded suffrage or the right to vote by allowing any white man who paid taxes to vote.
in every state however only land owners could hold public office.
some states originally allowed women and free african americans to vote but these rights were soon taken away.
suffrage would not be restored to these groups for decades to come.
comparing what two principles were common to state constitutions written during the revolutionary war.
reading check.
articles of confederation the second continental congress was organized to create a national government.
the continental congress appointed a committee of thirteen with one member from each colony.
this group was assigned to discuss and draft the articles of confederation the new national constitution.
under the articles of confederation congress would become the single branch of the national government but it would have limited powers in order to protect the liberties of the people.
each state had one vote in the congress.
congress could settle conflicts among the states issue coins borrow money and make treaties with other countries and with native americans.
congress could also ask the states for money and soldiers.
however states had the power to refuse these requests.
the government did not have a president or a national court system.
the second continental congress passed the articles of confederation on november 15 1777.
then it sent the articles to each state legislature for ratification or official approval before the new national government could take effect.
conflicts over claims to western lands slowed the process but by 1779 every state except maryland had ratified the articles.
maryland s leaders refused to ratify until other states gave up their western land claims.
thomas jefferson assured maryland that western lands would be made into new states rather than increasing territory for existing states.
satisfied with this condition in march 1781 maryland ratified the articles.
this put the first national government of the united states into effect.
summarizing what were two weaknesses of the new national government.
reading check j 4 chapter 5 northwest territory congress had to decide what to do with the western lands now under its control and how to raise money to pay debts.
it tried to solve both problems by selling the western lands.
congress passed the land ordinance of 1785 which set up a system for surveying and dividing western lands.
the land was split into townships which were 36 square miles divided into 36 lots of 640 acres each.
one lot was reserved for a public school and four lots were given to veterans.
the remaining lots were sold to the public.
to form a political system for the region congress passed the northwest ordinance of 1787.
the ordinance established the northwest territory which included areas that are now in illinois indiana michigan ohio minnesota and wisconsin.
the northwest ordinance created a system for bringing new states into the union.
congress agreed that the northwest territory would be divided into several smaller territories with a governor appointed by congress.
when the population of a territory reached 60 000 its settlers could draft their own constitution and ask to join the union.
in addition the law protected civil liberties and required that public education be provided.
finally the ordinance stated that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude forced labor in the.
this last condition banned slavery in the territory and set the standard for future territories.
the system of land allotment and political structures created by the two ordinances would become the typical method of organizing all new land added to the united states.
however slavery would continue to be a controversial issue.

i summary and preview the new govem i ment settled the future of the northwest territory.

the first amendment s freedom of religion clauses were based on thomas jefferson s virginia statute for religious freedom.

he said that any attempt to do so would be opposed by the thousands of british soldiers who had settled in canada after the revolution who are ready to fly to arms at a moment s warning.
58 chapter 5 trade with britain the united states also faced problems trading with great britain.
after the signing of the treaty of paris britain closed many of its ports to american ships.
before the revolutionary war colonial ships had traded a great deal with the british west indies and stopped there on their way to other destinations.
this travel and trading stopped after 1783.
in addition britain forced american merchants to pay high tariffs taxes on imports or exports.
the tariffs applied to goods such as rice tobacco tar and oil that were grown or mined in the united states and then sold in britain.
merchants had to raise prices to cover the tariffs.
ultimately the costs would be passed on to customers who had to pay higher prices for the goods.
the economic condition of the country was getting worse by the day.
trade with spain in 1784 spanish officials closed the lower mississippi river to u s shipping.
western farmers and merchants were furious because they used the mississippi to send goods to eastern and foreign markets.
congress tried to work out an agreement with spain but the plan did not receive a majority vote in congress.
the plan could not be passed.
as a result spain broke off the negotiations.
many state leaders began to criticize the national government.
rhode island s representatives wrote our federal government is but a name a mere shadow without substance power.
critics believed that spain might have continued to negotiate if the united states had possessed a strong military.
these leaders believed that the national government needed to be more powerful.
forming a government 159 impact of closed markets the closing of markets in the british west indies seriously affected the u s economy.
james madison of virginia wrote about the crisis.
the revolution has robbed us of our trade withthe west indies.
without opening any other channels to compensate make up for it.
in every point of view indeed the trade of this country is in a deplorable terrible condition james madison quoted in independence on trial by frederick w marks iii farmers could no longer export their goods to the british west indies.
they also had to hire british ships to carry their goods to british markets which was very expensive.
american exports dropped while british goods flowed freely into the united states.
this unequal trade caused serious economic problems for the new nation.
british merchants could sell manufactured products in the united states at much lower prices than locally made goods.
this difference in prices hurt american businesses.
the confederation congress could not correct the problem because it did not have the authority either to pass tariffs or to order the states to pass tariffs.
the states could offer little help.
if one state passed a tariff the british could simply sell their goods in another state.
most states did not cooperate in trade matters.
instead states worked only to increase their own trade rather than working to improve the trade situation for the whole country.
in 1785 the situation led a british magazine to call the new nation the dis united states.
as a result of the trade problems with britain american merchants began looking for other markets such as china france and the netherlands.
despite such attempts britain remained the most important trading partner of the united states.
reading check analyzing why was the confederation congress unable to solve america s international trade problems.
economic problems in addition to international trade issues other challenges soon appeared.
trade problems among the states war debts and a weak economy plagued the states.
trade among states because the confederation congress had no power to regulate interstate commerce trade between two or more states states followed their own trade interests.
as a result trade laws differed from state to state.
this situation made trade difficult for merchants whose businesses crossed state lines.
inflation after the revolutionary war most states had a hard time paying off war debts and struggled to collect overdue taxes.
to ease this hardship some states began printing large amounts of paper money.

inflation occurs when there are increased prices for goods and services combined with the reduced value of money.
congress had no power to stop states from issuing more paper money and thus stop inflation.
weak economy in rhode island the state legislature printed large amounts of paper money worth very little.
this made debtors people who owe money quite happy.
they could pay back their debts with paper money worth less than the coins they had borrowed.
however creditors people who lend money were upset.
hundreds of creditors fled rhode island to avoid being paid back with worthless money.

virginia plan after the delegates had met for four days edmund randolph of virginia presented the virginia plan.
he proposed a new federal constitution that would give sovereignty or supreme power to the central government.
the legislature would be bicameral made 4 chapter 5 this painting shows the signing of the constitution on september 17 1787 james madison number 4 on the diagram became known as the father of the constitution for his ideas about government and his ability to lead the delegates to agreement.

up of two houses or groups of representatives and chosen on the basis of state populations.
larger states would thus have more representatives than would smaller states.
delegates from the smaller states believed that it would give too much power to the larger states.
new jersey plan the smaller states came up with a plan to stop the larger states from getting too much power.
new jersey delegate william paterson presented the small state or new jersey plan which called for a unicameral or one house legislature.
the plan gave each state an equal number of votes and thus an equal voice in the federal government.
the plan gave the federal government the power to tax citizens in all states and it allowed the government to regulate commerce.
compromise is reached after a month of debate the delegates were unable to agree on how states should be represented.
the convention reached a deadlock.
finally roger sherman of connecticut proposed a compromise plan.
the legislative branch would have two houses.
each state regardless of its size would have two representatives in the senate or upper house.
this would give each state an equal voice pleasing the smaller states.
in the house of representatives or lower house the number of representatives for each state would be determined by the state s population.
this pleased the larger states.

gouverneur morris of new york spoke with much emotion against the three fifths compromise.
also the idea of banning the foreign slave trade prompted southerners such as john rutledge of south carolina to defend the practice.
if the convention thinks that north carolina south carolina and georgia will ever agree to the plan to prohibit the slave trade unless their right to import slaves be untouched the expectation is vain useless john rutledge quoted in the atlantic monthly february 1891 by frank gaylord cook the admission of slaves into the representation comes to this that the inhabitant of a state who goes to the coast of africa and tears away his fellow creatures from their dearest connections and damns them to the most cruel bondage slavery shall have more votes in a government established for protection of the rights of mankind gouverneur morris quoted in founding the republic edited by john j patrick finding main ideas how did these two views of slavery differ.
three fifths compromise the debate over representation also involved regional differences.
southern delegates wanted enslaved africans to be counted as part of their state populations.
this way they would have more representatives and more power in congress.
northerners disagreed.
they wanted the number of slaves to determine taxes but not representation.
to resolve this problem some delegates thought of a compromise.
they wanted to count three fifths of the slaves in each state as part of that state s population to decide how many representatives a state would have.
after much debate the delegates voted to accept the proposal called the three fifths compromise.
under this agreement only three fifths of a state s slave population would count when determining representation.
another major issue was the foreign slave trade.
some of the delegates believed slavery was wrong and wanted the federal government to ban the slave trade.
others said that the southern states economies needed the slave trade.
many southern delegates said they would leave the union if the constitution immediately ended the slave trade.
also at issue was congress s ability to tax imports and exports.
worried delegates reached another compromise.
the commerce compromises allowed congress to levy tariffs on imports but not exports and allowed the importation of slaves until the end of 1807.
the delegates omitted or left out the words slavery and slave in the constitution.
they referred instead to free persons and all other persons.

reading check a 66 chapter 5 a new system of government most of the delegates to the convention wanted a stronger central government than the articles of confederation could provide.
they believed it was necessary for the protection and administration of the group of states.
but delegates also wanted to protect the individual rights that had been won in the revolution.
they wanted the new system of government to support the ideals stated in the declaration of independence.
the right of individual citizens to maintain the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness was supported by the idea of popular sovereignty.
this is the idea that political authority is in the hands of the people.
in the new nation people expressed this power through their votes.
the power of the government is limited by the power of voters.
in a republic the government consists of people elected by voters to represent them.
in this system voters can limit the actions of government by removing representatives who do not truly work for the goals of voters.
checks and balances the delegates also divided the roles of government into three branches the legislative the executive and the judicial.
the legislative branch is congress.
it is responsible for proposing and passing laws which are also called legislation.
it is made up of two houses as created in the great compromise.
members of the senate and members of the house of representatives are elected through different systems which helps balance the power among voters from different states.
the executive branch includes the president and the departments that help run the government.
the executive branch makes sure that laws are carried out.
the judicial branch is made up of all of the national courts.
this branch is responsible for interpreting laws punishing criminals and settling disputes between states.
the framers of the constitution created a system of checks and balances which keeps any single branch of government from becoming too powerful.
for example congress has the power to pass bills into law.
the president has the power to veto or reject laws that congress passes.
however congress can override the president s veto with a two thirds majority vote.
the supreme court has the power to review laws passed by congress and strike down any law that violates the constitution.
federalism even though many of the delegates wanted a stronger central government they did not want to destroy state governments.
in order to balance the power between these two types of government they created the system of federalism.
federalism is the sharing of power between a central government and the states that make up a nation.
under the previous confederal system states were only loosely joined together.
under the constitution each state must obey the authority of the federal or national government.
states have control over government functions not specifically assigned to the federal government.
this includes control of local government education the chartering of corporations and the supervision of religious bodies.
states also have the power to create and oversee civil and criminal laws.
states must protect the welfare of their citizens.
amending the constitution one of the most important decisions the framers made was to include a method for changing or adding to the constitution.
they wanted the government to be able to adapt as changes were needed.
the process for amending the constitution was made difficult however so that major changes to the government would require the support of a large majority of voters.
two thirds of each house of congress and three fourths of forming a government 167 states must approve a change before it can take effect.
although many amendments or changes to the constitution have been suggested only twenty seven have been approved.
the purposes of these amendments have usually focused on protecting civil and voting rights and on procedures for administering the government.
even though the final draft of the constitution was adopted by the convention many disagreements still existed among delegates.
debates continued around the power of state governments and the role of each branch.
almost as soon as the document was adopted different interpretations of the language used began to appear.
some of the disagreements reading check.
