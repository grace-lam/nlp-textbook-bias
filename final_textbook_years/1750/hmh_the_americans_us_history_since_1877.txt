taking notes use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the major events of the conflict between great britain and the american colonies.
crispus attucks was a sailor of african and native american ancestry.
on the night of march 5 1770 he was part of a large and angry crowd that had gathered at the boston customs house to harass the british soldiers stationed there.
more soldiers soon arrived and the mob began hurling stones and snowballs at them.
attucks then stepped forward.
a personal voice john adams this attucks appears to have undertaken to be the hero of the night and to lead this army with banners up to king street with their clubs.
this man with his party cried do not be afraid of them.
he had hardiness enough to fall in upon them and with one hand took hold of a bayonet and with the other knocked the man down.
quoted in the black presence in the era of the american revolution crispus attucks attucks s action ignited the troops.
ignoring orders not to shoot civilians one soldier and then others fired on the crowd.
five people were killed several were wounded.
crispus attucks was according to a newspaper account the first to die.
the colonies organize to resist britain because the proclamation of 1763 sought to halt expansion by the colonists west of the appalachian mountains it convinced the colonists that the british government did not care about their needs.
a second result of the french and indian war britain s financial crisis brought about new laws that reinforced the colonists opinion.
the sugar act great britain had borrowed so much money during the war that it nearly doubled its national debt.
king george iii who had succeeded his grandfather in 1760 hoped to lower that debt.
to do so in 1763 the king chose a financial expert george grenville to serve as prime minister.
revolution and the early republic chapter 2 main idea analyzing issues how did the sugar act cause tension between the colonists and britain.
j main idea summarizing jbj how did the colonists respond to the stamp act and the townshend acts.
by the time grenville took over tensions between britain and one colony massachusetts were on the rise.
during the french and indian war the british had cracked down on colonial smuggling to ensure that merchants were not doing business in any french held territories.
in 1761 the royal governor of massachusetts authorized the use of the writs of assistance a general search warrant that allowed british customs officials to search any colonial ship or building they believed to be holding smuggled goods.
because many merchants worked out of their residences the writs enabled british officials to enter and search colonial homes whether there was evidence of smuggling or not.
the merchants of boston were outraged.
grenville s actions however soon angered merchants throughout the colonies.
the new prime minister noticed that the american customs service which collected duties or taxes on imports was losing money.
grenville concluded that the colonists were smuggling goods into the country without paying duties.
in 1764 he prompted parliament to enact a law known as the sugar act.
the sugar act did three things.
it halved the duty on foreign made molasses in the hopes that colonists would pay a lower tax rather than risk arrest by smuggling.
it placed duties on certain imports that had not been taxed before.
most important it provided that colonists accused of violating the act would be tried in a vice admiralty court rather than a colonial court.
there each case would be decided by a single judge rather than by a jury of sympathetic colonists.
colonial merchants complained that the sugar act would reduce their profits.
merchants and traders further claimed that parliament had no right to tax the colonists because the colonists had not elected representatives to the body.
the new regulations however had little effect on colonists besides merchants and traders.
the stamp act in march 1765 parliament passed the stamp act.
this act imposed a tax on documents and printed items such as wills newspapers and playing cards.
a stamp would be placed on the items to prove that the tax had been paid.
it was the first tax that affected colonists directly because it was levied on goods and services.
previous taxes had been indirect involving duties on imports.
in may of 1765 the colonists united to defy the law.
boston shopkeepers artisans and laborers organized a secret resistance group called the sons of liberty to protest the law.
meanwhile the colonial assemblies declared that parliament lacked the power to impose taxes on the colonies because the colonists were not represented in parliament.
in october 1765 merchants in new york boston and philadelphia agreed to a boycott of british goods until the stamp act was repealed.
the widespread boycott worked and in march 1766 parliament repealed the law.
but on the same day that it repealed the stamp act parliament passed the declaratory act which asserted parliament s full right to bind the colonies and people of america in all cases whatsoever.
then in 1767 parliament passed the townshend acts named after charles townshend the leading government minister the townshend acts taxed goods that were imported into the colony from britain such as lead glass paint and paper.
the acts also imposed a tax on tea the most popular drink in the colonies.
led by men such as samuel adams one of the founders of the sons of liberty the colonists again boycotted british goods.
e sow thejy proposition 13 a more recent tax revolt occurred in california on june 6 1978 when residents voted in a tax reform law known as proposition 13.
by the late 1970s taxes in california were among the highest in the nation.
the property tax alone was fifty two percent above the national norm.
proposition 13 initiated by ordinary citizens limited the tax on real property to one percent of its assessed value in 1975 1976.
it passed with sixty five percent of the vote.
because of the resulting loss of revenue many state agencies were scaled down or cut.
in 1984 california voters approved a state lottery that provides supplemental funds for education.
but proposition 13 still remains a topic of heated debate as californians like other americans across the country struggle with conflicting desires more government services vs less taxes.

this colonial engraving was meant to warn of the effects of the stamp act.
tension mounts in massachusetts as hostilities between the colonists and the british mounted the atmosphere in boston grew increasingly tense.
the city soon erupted in bloody clashes and later in a daring tax protest all of which pushed the colonists and britain closer to war.
violence erupts in boston on march 5 1770 a mob gathered in front of the boston customs house and taunted the british soldiers standing guard there.
shots were fired and five colonists including crispus attucks were killed or mortally wounded.
colonial leaders quickly labeled the confrontation the boston massacre.
despite strong feelings on both sides the political atmosphere relaxed somewhat during the next three years.
lord frederick north who later followed grenville as the prime minister realized that the townshend acts were costing more to enforce than they would ever bring in in their first year for example the taxes raised only 295 pounds while the cost of sending british troops to boston history through background pounds are the basic monetary unit of british currency.
art the boston massacre 1770 paul revere was not only a patriot but a silversmith and an engraver as well.
one of the best known of his engravings depicting the boston massacre is a masterful piece of anti british propaganda.
widely circulated reveres engraving played a key role in rallying revolutionary fervor.
the sign above the soldiers reads butchers hall the british commander captain preston standing at the far right of the engraving appears to be inciting the troops to fire.
in fact he tried to calm the situation.

was over 170 000 pounds.
north persuaded parliament to repeal the townshend acts except for the tax on tea.
tensions rose again in 1772 when a group of rhode island colonists attacked a british customs schooner that patrolled the coast for smugglers.
the colonists boarded the vessel which had accidentally run aground near providence and burned it to the waterline.
in response king george named a special commission to seek out the suspects and bring them to england for trial.
the plan to haul americans to england for trial ignited widespread alarm.
the assemblies of massachusetts and virginia set up committees of correspondence to communicate with other colonies about this and other threats to american liber ties.
by 1774 such committees formed a buzzing communication network linking leaders in nearly all the colonies.
colonists threw into boston harbor during the boston tea party.
the boston tea party in 1773 lord north devised the tea act in order to save the nearly bankrupt british east india company.
the act granted the company the right to sell tea to the colonies free of the taxes that colonial tea sellers had to pay.
this action would have cut colonial merchants out of the tea trade by enabling the east india company to sell its tea directly to consumers for less.
north hoped the american colonists would simply buy the cheaper tea instead they protested dramatically.
on the moonlit evening of december 16 1773 a large group of boston rebels disguised themselves as native americans and proceeded to take action against three british tea ships anchored in the harbor.
in this incident later known as the boston tea party the indians dumped 18 000 pounds of the east india company s tea into the waters of boston harbor.
main idea analyzing motives what do you think king george set out to achieve when he disciplined massachusetts.
the intolerable acts an infuriated king george iii pressed parliament to act.
in 1774 parliament responded by passing a series of measures that colonists called the intolerable acts.
one law shut down boston harbor.
another the quartering act authorized british commanders to house soldiers in vacant private homes and other buildings.
in addition to these measures general thomas gage commander in chief of british forces in north america was appointed the new governor of massachusetts.
to keep the peace he placed boston under martial law or rule imposed by military forces.
in response to britain s actions the committees of correspondence assembled the first continental congress.
in september 1774 56 delegates met in philadelphia and drew up a declaration of colonial rights.
they defended the colonies right to run their own affairs and stated that if the british used force against the colonies the colonies should fight back.
review unit 49 the battle of lexington as depicted in a mid nineteenth century painting.
the road to revolution after the first continental congress met colonists in many eastern new england towns stepped up military preparations.
minutemen civilian soldiers who pledged to be ready to fight against the british on a minute s notice quietly stockpiled firearms and gunpowder.
general thomas gage soon learned about these activities.
in the spring of 1775 he ordered troops to march from boston to nearby concord massachusetts and to seize illegal weapons.
fighting at lexington and concord colonists in boston were watching and on the night of april 18 1775 paul revere william dawes and samuel prescott rode out to spread word that 700 british troops were headed for concord.
the darkened countryside rang with church bells and gunshots prearranged signals sent from town to town that the british were coming.
the king s troops known as redcoats because of their uniforms reached lexington massachusetts five miles short of concord on the cold windy dawn of april 19.
as they neared the town they saw 70 minutemen drawn up in lines on the village green.
the british commander ordered the minutemen to lay down their arms and leave and the colonists began to move out without laying down their muskets.
then someone fired and the british soldiers sent a volley of shots into the departing militia.
eight minutemen were killed and ten more were wounded but only one british soldier was injured.
the battle of lexington the first battle of the revolutionary war lasted only 15 minutes.
the british marched on to concord where they found an empty arsenal.
after a brief skirmish with minutemen the british soldiers lined up to march back to boston but the march quickly became a slaughter.
between 3 000 and 4 000 minutemen had assembled by now and they fired on the marching troops from behind stone walls and trees.
british soldiers fell by the dozen.
bloodied and humiliated the remaining british soldiers made their way back to boston that night.
colonists had become enemies of britain and now held boston and its encampment of british troops under siege.
main idea evaluating 4 do you think the british underestimated the colonists in 1770 1775.
50 chapter 2 revolution and the early republic vocabulary reconciliation the restoration of a former state of harmony or friendship main idea developing historical perspective do you think that the olive branch petition was too little too late.
the second continental congress in may of 1775 colonial leaders called the second continental congress in philadelphia to debate their next move.
the loyalties that divided colonists sparked endless debates at the second continental congress.
some delegates called for independence while others argued for reconciliation with great britain.
despite such differences the congress agreed to recognize the colonial militia as the continental army and appointed george washington as its commander.
the battle of bunker hill cooped up in boston british general thomas gage decided to strike at militiamen on breed s hill north of the city and near bunker hill.
on june 17 1775 gage sent 2 400 british soldiers up the hill.
the colonists held their fire until the last minute and then began to mow down the advancing redcoats before finally retreating.
by the time the smoke cleared the colonists had lost 450 men while the british had suffered over 1 000 casualties.
the misnamed battle of bunker hill would prove to be the deadliest battle of the war.
by july the second continental congress was readying the colonies for war though still hoping for peace.
most of the delegates like most colonists felt deep loyalty to george iii and blamed the bloodshed on the king s ministers.
on july 8 congress sent the king the so called olive branch petition urging a return to the former harmony between britain and the colonies king george flatly rejected the petition.
furthermore he issued a proclamation stating that the colonies were in rebellion and urged parliament to order a naval blockade to isolate a line of ships meant for the american coast.

the patriots declare independence despite the growing crisis many colonists were uncertain about the idea of independence.
following the olive branch petition public opinion began to shift.
the ideas behind the revolution this shift in public opinion occurred in large part because of the enlightenment ideas that had spread throughout the colonies in the 1760s and 1770s.
one of the key enlightenment thinkers was english philosopher john locke.
locke maintained that people have natural rights to life liberty and property.
furthermore he contended every society is based on a social contract an agreement in which the people consent to choose and obey a government so long as it safeguards their natural rights.
if the government violates that social contract by taking away or interfering with those rights people have the right to resist and even overthrow the government.
other influences on colonial leaders who favored independence were religious traditions that supported the cause of liberty.
one preacher of the time jonathan mayhew wrote that he had learned from the holy scriptures that wise brave and virtuous men were always friends of liberty.
some ministers even spoke from their pulpits in favor of liberty.
yet the ideas of limited government and civil rights had been basic to english law since even before a d 1215 when the english nobility had forced king john to sign magna carta or the great charter.
magna carta acknowledged certain specific rights of the barons against the king including some rights to due process a speedy trial and trial by a jury of one s peers.
its main significance though was to recognize that the sovereign did not have absolute authority but was subject like all men and women to the rule of law.
this principle was reaffirmed by the english bill of rights accepted by king william and queen mary in 1689.
to the colonists however various acts of parliament between 1763 and 1775 had clearly violated their rights as englishmen.
in addition to due process a speedy trial and trial by a jury of one s peers those rights included taxation only by consent of property owners a presumption of innocence no standing army in peacetime without consent no quartering of troops in private homes freedom of travel in peacetime and the guarantee of regular legislative sessions.
thomas paines common sense just as important were the ideas of thomas paine.
in a widely read 50 page pamphlet titled common sense paine attacked king george and the monarchy.
paine a recent immigrant argued that responsibility for british tyranny lay with the royal brute of britain.
paine explained that his own revolt against the king had begun with lexington and concord.
a personal voice thomas paine no man was a warmer wisher for a reconciliation than myself before the fetal nineteenth of april 1775 but the moment the event of that day was made known i rejected the hardened sullen tempered pharaoh of england for ever the wretch that with the pretended title of father of his people can unfeelingly hear of their slaughter and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul 5 common sense main idea making inferences why might the ideals of the enlightenment appeal to the colonists.
paine declared that independence would allow america to trade more freely.
he also stated that independence would give american colonists the chance to create a better society one free from tyranny with equal social and economic opportunities for all.
common sense sold nearly 500 000 copies in 1776 and was widely applauded.
in april 1776 george washington wrote i find common sense is working a powerful change in the minds of many men.
52 chapter 2 revolution and the early republic main idea summarizing g what reasons did jefferson give to justify revolt by the colonies.
declaring independence by the early summer of 1776 the wavering continental congress finally decided to urge each colony to form its own government.
on june 7 virginia delegate richard henry lee moved that these united colonies are and of a right ought to be free and independent states while talks on this fateful motion were under way the congress appointed a committee to prepare a formal declaration of independence.
virginia lawyer thomas jefferson was chosen to prepare the final draft.
drawing on locke s ideas of natural rights jefferson s document declared the rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to be unalienable rights ones that can never be taken away.
jefferson then asserted that a government s legitimate power can only come from the consent of the governed and that when a government denies their unalienable rights the people have the right to alter or abolish that government.
jefferson provided a long list of violations committed by the king and parliament against the colonists unalienable rights.
on that basis the american colonies declared their independence from britain gj the declaration states flatly that all men are created equal.
when this phrase was written it expressed the common belief that free citizens were political equals.
it did not claim that all people had the same ability or ought to have equal wealth.
it was not meant to embrace women native americans or african american slaves a large number of americans.
however jefferson s words presented ideals that would later help these groups challenge traditional attitudes.
in his first draft jefferson included an eloquent attack on the cruelty and injustice of the slave trade.
however south carolina and georgia the two colonies most dependent on slavery objected.
in order to gain the votes of those two states jefferson dropped the offending passage.
on july 2 1776 the delegates voted unanimously that the american colonies were free and on july 4 1776 they adopted the declaration of independence.
the colonists had declared their freedom from britain.
they would now have to fight for it.

although the text frequently refers to eighteenth century events its enlightenment philosophy and politics have continuing relevance today.
for more than 200 years the declaration of independence has inspired leaders of other independence movements and has remained a crucial document in the struggle for civil rights and human rights.
in congress july 4 1776.
jefferson begins the declaration by attempting to legally and philosophically justify the revolution that was already underway.
here jefferson is saying that now that the colonists have begun to separate themselves from british rule it is time to explain why the colonists have taken this course of action.
these passages reveal the influence of the english philosopher john locke.
in two treatises of government 1690 locke argued that if a government does not allow its citizens to enjoy certain rights and freedoms the people have a right to replace that government.
a declaration by the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled.
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.
here begins the section in which jefferson condemns the behavior of king george listing the kings many tyrannical actions that have forced his american subjects to rebel.
he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
54 chapter 2 he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasions from without and convulsions within.
he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
he has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.
he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the i consent of our legislatures.
he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.
he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
historical spotlight independence and slavery the declaration of independence went through many revisions before the final draft.
jefferson a slaveholder himself regretted having to eliminate one passage in particular a condemnation of slavery and the slave trade.
however in the face of opposition of delegates from southern states the anti slavery passage was deleted.
this is a reference to the 10 000 troops that the british government stationed in north america after the french and indian war.
although the british government saw the troops as protection for the colonists the colonists themselves viewed the troops as a standing army that threatened their freedom.
here jefferson condemns both the king and parliament for passing the intolerable acts.
most of these laws were intended to punish the people of massachusetts for the boston tea party.
for example the quartering act of 1774 forced colonists to provide lodging for british troops.
another act allowed british soldiers accused of murder to be sent back to england for trial.
the boston port bill closed the port of boston cutting off our trade with all parts of the world here jefferson refers to the quebec act which extended the boundaries of the province.
he then refers to another act that changed the charter of massachusetts and restricted town meetings.
review unit 55 vv rspici v men would be tyrants if they could although the declaration dealt with issues of equality justice and independence it did not address conditions of inequality within the colonies themselves.
husbands dominated their wives for example and slaves lived under complete control of their owners.
speaking on behalf of women abigail adams above had this to say to her husband john who served in the continental congress remember the ladies and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors.
do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.
remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
if particular care is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion here jefferson turns his attention away from the king and toward the british people.
calling the british the common kindred of the colonists jefferson reminds them how often the americans have appealed to their sense of justice.
reluctantly the colonists are now forced to break their political connections with their british kin.
in this passage the delegates declare independence.
he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.
he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people.
he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to com pleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands.
he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions.
in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren.
we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.
we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends.
we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.
56 chapter 2 congress.

benjamin franklin the famous american writer scientist statesman and diplomat represented the colonies in london throughout the growing feud with britain.
as resistance in the colonies turned to bloodshed however franklin fled london in 1775 and sailed home to philadelphia.
ironically the issue of loyalty versus independence that was dividing the american colonies from their mother country was also dividing franklin s own family.
franklin s son william the royal governor of new jersey was stubbornly loyal to king george and opposed the rebellious atmosphere in the colonies.
in one of his many letters to british authorities regarding the conflict in the colonies william stated his position and that of others who resisted revolutionary views.
a personal voice william franklin there is indeed a dread in the minds of many here that some of the leaders of the people are aiming to establish a republic.
rather than submit we have thousands who will risk the loss of their lives in defense of the old constitution.
they are ready to declare themselves whenever they see a chance of its being of any avail.
quoted in a little revenge benjamin franklin and his son because of william s stand on colonial issues communication between him and his father virtually ceased.
the break between benjamin franklin and his son mirrored the chasm that now divided the colonies from britain.
the notion of fighting britain frightened and horrified some colonists even as it inspired others.

in time however the colonists would battle their way back.
loyalists and patriots as the war began americans found themselves on different sides of the conflict.
loyalists those who opposed independence and remained loyal to the british king included judges and governors as well as people of more modest means.
many loyalists thought that the british were going to win and wanted to avoid punishment as rebels.
still others thought that the crown would protect their rights more effectively than the new colonial governments would.
patriots the supporters of independence drew their numbers from people who saw political and economic opportunity in an independent america.
many americans remained neutral the conflict presented dilemmas for other groups as well.
many african americans fought on the side of the patriots but others joined the loyalists because the british promised freedom to slaves who would fight for the crown.
most native americans supported the british because they viewed colonial settlers as a greater threat to their lands.
early victories and defeats as part of a plan to stop the rebellion by isolating new england the british quickly attempted to seize new york city.
the british sailed into new york harbor in the summer of 1776 with a force of about 32 000 soldiers.
they included thousands of german mercenaries or hired soldiers known as hessians because many of them came from the german region of hesse.

place what characteristic did many of the battle sites have in common.
why do you think this was so.
although the continental army attempted to defend new york in late august the untrained and poorly equipped colonial troops soon retreated.
by late fall the british had pushed washington s army across the delaware river into pennsylvania.
desperate for an early victory washington risked everything on one bold stroke set for christmas night 1776.
in the face of a fierce storm he led 2 400 men in small rowboats across the ice choked delaware river.
they then marched to their objective trenton new jersey and defeated a garrison of hessians in a surprise attack.
the british soon regrouped however and in september of 1777 they captured the american capital at philadelphia.
saratoga and valley forge in the meantime one british general was marching straight into the jaws of disaster.
in a complex scheme general john burgoyne planned to lead an army down a route of lakes from canada to albany where he would meet british troops as they arrived from new york city.
the two regiments would then join forces to isolate new england from the rest of the colonies.
as burgoyne traveled through forested wilderness militiamen and soldiers from the continental army gathered from all over new york and new england.
while he was fighting off the colonial troops burgoyne didn t realize that his fellow british officers were preoccupied with holding philadelphia and weren t coming to meet him.
american troops finally surrounded burgoyne at saratoga where he surrendered on october 17 1777.
the surrender at saratoga turned out to be one of the most important events of the war.
although the french had secretly aided the patriots since early 1776 the saratoga victory bolstered france s belief that the americans could win the war.
as a result the french signed an alliance with the americans in february 1778 and openly joined them in their fight.
while this hopeful turn of events took place in paris washington and his continental army desperately low on food and supplies fought to stay alive at winter camp in valley forge pennsylvania.
more than 2 000 soldiers died yet the survivors didn t desert.
their endurance and suffering filled washington s letters to the congress and his friends.
main idea developing historical perspective why were these early victories so important to the continental army.
bgeorge washington 1732 1799 during the revolutionary war commander in chief george washington became a national hero.
an imposing man washington stood six feet two inches tall.
he was broad shouldered calm and dignified and he was an expert horseman.
but it was washingtons character that won hearts and ultimately the war.
washington persistently roused dispirited men into a fighting force.
at princeton he galloped on his white horse into the line of fire shouting and encouraging his men.
at valley forge he bore the same cold and privation as every suffering soldier.
time and again washingtons tactics saved his smaller weaker force to fight another day.
by the end of the war the entire nation idolized general washington and adoring soldiers crowded near him just to touch his boots when he rode by.

to see the men without clothes to cover their nakedness without blankets to lie upon without shoes.
and submitting without a murmur is a proof of patience and obedience which in my opinion can scarcely be paralleled quoted in ordeal at valley forge life during the revolution one huge problem that the continental congress faced was paying the troops.
when the congress ran out of hard currency silver and gold it printed paper money called continentals like the revolutionary soldiers.
as congress printed more and more money its value plunged causing rising prices or inflation.
the congress also struggled against great odds to equip the beleaguered army.

main idea summarizing what important contributions did women make in the revolutionary war.
in 1781 the congress appointed a rich philadelphia merchant named robert morris as superintendent of finance.
his associate was haym salomon a jewish political refugee from poland.
morris and salomon begged and borrowed on their personal credit to raise money to provide salaries for the continental army.
they raised funds from philadelphia s quakers and jews.
on september 8 1781 a continental major wrote in his diary this day will be famous in the annals of history for being the first on which the troops of the united states received one month s pay in specie coin.
the demands of war also affected civilians.
when men marched off to fight many wives stepped into their husbands shoes managing farms and businesses as well as households and families.
hundreds of women also followed their husbands to the battlefield where they washed and cooked for the troops while some including molly pitcher even risked their lives in combat.
the war opened some doors for african americans.
thousands of slaves escaped to freedom in the chaos of war.
about 5 000 african americans served in the continental army where their courage loyalty and talent impressed white americans.
native americans however remained on the fringes of the revolution preferring to remain independent and true to their own cultures.
winning the war in february 1778 in the midst of the frozen winter at valley forge american troops began an amazing transformation.
friedrich von steuben a prussian captain and talented drill master helped to train the continental army.
other foreign military leaders such as the marquis de lafayette mar ke da laf e et also arrived to offer their help.
lafayette lobbied france for french reinforcements in 1779 and led a command in virginia in the last years of the war.
with the help of such european military leaders the raw continental army became an effective fighting force.
historical spotlight john paul jones as the revolutionary war raged on land britain and the colonies also engaged each other at sea.
the newly formed continental navy was no match for the mighty british fleet.
it was only after france and spain joined the colonists cause that britain lost its maritime supremacy.
nonetheless the colonists scored several morale boosting victories over the british navy due in large part to the heroics of american naval commander john paul jones.

the war becomes a symbol of liberty revolutionary ideals set a new course for american society.
during the war social distinctions had begun to blur as the wealthy wore homespun clothing and as military leaders showed respect for all of their soldiers.
changes like these stimulated the rise of egalitarianism i gan tar e e niz om a belief in the equality of all people.
this belief fostered a new attitude the idea that ability effort and virtue not wealth or family background defined one s worth.
the egalitarianism of the 1780s however applied only to white males.
it did not bring any new political rights to women.
a few states made it possible for women to divorce but common law still dictated that a married woman s property belonged to her husband.
moreover most african americans were still enslaved and even those who were free usually faced discrimination and poverty.
however by 1804 many new england and middle states had taken steps to outlaw slavery.
for native americans the revolution brought uncertainty.
during both the french and indian war and the revolution many native american communities had been either destroyed or displaced and the native american population living east of the mississippi had declined by about 50 percent.
postwar developments further threatened native american interests as settlers began taking triballands left unprotected by the treaty of paris.
in the closing days of the revolution the continental congress had chosen a quotation from the works of the roman poet virgil as a motto for the reverse side of the great seal of the united states.
the motto novus ordo seclorum means a new order of the ages.

f main idea making inferences why do you think news of shayss rebellion made states eager to participate in the philadelphia convention.
after the revolution many americans favored a republic a government in which citizens rule through their elected representatives.
however many also feared that a democracy government directly by the people placed power in the hands of the uneducated masses.
these fears and concerns deeply affected the planning of the new government.
the articles of confederation the second continental congress set up a new plan of government in a set of laws called the articles of confederation.
the plan established a form of government called a confederation or alliance among the thirteen states.
the articles set up a congress in which each state would have one vote regardless of population.
powers were divided between the states and the national government.
the national government had the power to declare war make peace and sign treaties.
it could borrow money set standards for coins and for weights and measures and establish a postal service.
after approval by all thirteen states the articles of confederation went into effect in march 1781.
one of the first issues the confederation faced had to do with the the northwest territory lands west of the appalachians where many people settled after the revolutionary war.
to help govern these lands congress passed the land ordinance of 1785 which established a plan for surveying the land.
see geography spotlight on page 72.
in the northwest ordinance of 1787 congress provided a procedure for dividing the land into no fewer than three and no more than five states.
the ordinance also set requirements for the admission of new states which however overlooked native american land claims j weaknesses of the articles of confederation congress could not enact and collect taxes.
each state had only one vote in congress regardless of population.
nine out of thirteen states needed to agree to pass important laws.
articles could be amended only if all states approved.
there was no executive branch to enforce laws of congress.
there was no national court system to settle legal disputes.
there were thirteen separate states that lacked national unity.
the land ordinance of 1785 and the northwest ordinance of 1787 became the confederation s most significant achievements.
overshadowing such successes however were the confederation s many problems.
the most serious problem was that each state functioned independently by pursuing its own interests rather than considering those of the nation as a whole.
the government had no means of raising money or enforcing its laws.
moreover there was no national court system to settle legal disputes.
the articles of confederation created a weak central government and little unity among the states.
shayss rebellion the need for a stronger central government became obvious in 1786 when many farmers in western massachusetts rose up in protest over increased state taxes.
the farmers discontent boiled over into mob action in january of 1787 when daniel shays a fellow farmer led an army of 1 200 farmers toward the arsenal at springfield massachusetts.
state officials hurriedly called out the militia to head off the army of farmers killing four of the rebels and scattering the rest.
shays s rebellion as the farmers protest came to be called caused panic and dismay throughout the nation.
it was clearly time to talk about a stronger national government.
because the states had placed such severe limits on the government to prevent abuse of power the government was unable to solve many of the nation s problems.
news of the rebellion spread throughout the states.
the revolt persuaded twelve states to send delegates to a convention called by congress in philadelphia in may of 1787 kl history video shays s rebellion dsbbbq review unit 67 i tv player james madison 1751 1836 the oldest of 12 children james madison grew up in virginia.
he was a sickly child who suffered all his life from physical ailments.
because of a weak speaking voice he decided not to become a minister and thus entered politics.
madisons virginia plan resulted from extensive research that he had done on political systems before the convention.
he asked edmund randolph a fellow delegate from virginia to present the plan because his own voice was too weak to be heard throughout the assembly.
besides providing brilliant political leadership madison kept a record of the debates that took place at the convention.
because of his plan and his leadership madison is known as the father of the constitution.
creating a new government most of the delegates at the constitutional convention recognized the need to strengthen the central government.
within the first five days of the meeting they gave up the idea of fixing the articles of confederation and decided to form an entirely new government that would replace the one created by the articles.
conflict and compromise one major issue that the delegates faced was giving fair representation to both large and small states.
james madison proposed the virginia plan which called for a bicameral or two house legislature with membership based on each state s population.
delegates from the small states vigorously objected to the virginia plan because it gave more power to states with large populations.
small states supported william paterson s new jersey plan which proposed a single house congress in which each state had an equal vote.
the debate became deadlocked and dragged on through the hot and humid summer days.
eventually roger sherman suggested the great compromise which offered a two house congress to satisfy both small and big states.
each state would have equal representation in the senate or upper house.
the size of the population of each state would determine its representation in the house of representatives or lower house.
voters of each state would choose members of the house.
the state legislatures would choose members of the senate.
the great compromise settled one major issue but led to conflict over another.
southern delegates whose states had large numbers of slaves wanted slaves included in the population count that determined the number of representatives in the house.
northern delegates whose states had few slaves disagreed.
not counting the slaves would give the northern states more representatives than the southern states in the house of representatives.
the delegates eventually agreed to the three fifths compromise which called for three fifths of a state s slaves to be counted as part of the population.
division of powers after the delegates reached agreement on the difficult questions of slavery and representation they dealt with other issues somewhat more easily.
they divided power between the states and the national government and they separated the national government s power into three branches.
thus they created an entirely new government.
the new system of government that the delegates were building was a form of federalism in which power is divided between a national government and several state governments.
the powers granted to the national government by the constitution are known as delegated powers or enumerated powers.
these include such powers as the control of foreign affairs and regulation of trade between the states.
powers not specifically granted to the national government but kept by the states are called reserved powers.
these include powers such as providing for and supervising education.
some powers such as the right to tax and establish courts were shared by both the national and the state governments.

making inferences why did the delegates fear that one branch of the government would gain too much power.
separation of powers the delegates also limited the authority of the national government.
first they created three branches of government a legislative branch to make laws an executive branch to carry out laws and a judicial branch to interpret laws.
then the delegates established a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the other two.
the procedure the delegates established for electing the president reflected their fear of placing too much power in the hands of the people.
instead of choosing the president directly each state would choose a number of electors equal to the number of senators and representatives that the state had in congress.
this group of electors chosen by the states known as the electoral college would then cast ballots for the presidential candidates.
jg changing the constitution the delegates also provided a means of changing the constitution through the amendment process.
after four months of debate and compromise the delegates succeeded in creating a constitution that was an enduring document.
the constitution has been amended for a variety of reasons throughout history.
amendments help government change along with the values of the nation s people.
for example several amendments have expanded voting rights for various groups as society s expectations of equality have evolved see tracing themes on pages 104 105.
the twenty first amendment was passed to cancel or repeal the eighteenth amendment after social values shifted.
other amendments have altered the structure of government by establishing electoral procedures or setting limits on certain branches.
ratifying the constitution george washington adjourned the constitutional convention on september 17 1787.
the convention s work was over but the new government could not become a reality until at least nine states ratified or approved the constitution.
thus the battle over ratification began.
federalists and antifederalists supporters of the constitution called themselves federalists because they favored the new constitution s balance of power between the states and the national government.
their opponents became known as antifederalists because they opposed having such a strong central government and thus were against the constitution.
review unit 69 both sides waged a war of words in the public debate over ratification.
the federalist a series of 85 essays defending the constitution appeared in new york newspapers.
these were essays written by three influential supporters of ratification alexander hamilton james madison and john jay.
all three writers felt that there were defects in the new constitution but they also felt that its stronger central government was superior to the weak congress provided by the articles of confederation.
using the pen name publius the authors addressed those who argued that ratification should be delayed until a more perfect document could be written.
in the following excerpt from one of the essays now known to be written by madison the author asks his readers to compare the admittedly flawed constitution with its predecessor the articles.
a personal voice james madison it is a matter both of wonder and regret that those who raise so many objections against the new constitution should never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it the articles.
it is not necessary that the former should be perfect it is sufficient that the latter is more imperfect.
the federalist number 38 1788 james madison the antifederalists main opposition to the new constitution was that it contained no guarantee that the government would protect the rights of the people or of the states.
antifederalists included such notable figures as patrick henry george mason and richard henry lee.
letters from the federal farmer most likely written by lee was the most widely read antifederalist publication.
lee listed the rights that antifederalists believed should be protected such as freedom of the press and of religion guarantees against unreasonable searches of people and their homes and the right to a trial by jury.
the antifederalists demand for a bill of rights a formal summary of citizens rights and freedoms stemmed from their fear of a strong central government.
all state constitutions guaranteed individual rights and seven of them included a bill of rights.
the states believed they would serve as protectors of the people.
yet in the end the federalists yielded to people s overwhelming desire and promised to add a bill of rights if the states would ratify the constitution.
in june 1788 new hampshire became the ninth state to approve the constitution making it the law of the land.
je adoption of a bill of rights by december 1791 the states also had ratified ten amendments to the constitution which became known as the bill of rights.
the first eight amendments spell out the personal liberties the states had requested.
the first amendment guarantees citizens rights to freedom of religion speech the press and political activity.
according to the second and third amendments the government cannot deny citizens the right to bear arms as members of a militia of citizen soldiers nor can the government house troops in private homes in peacetime.
the fourth amendment prevents the search of citizens homes without proper warrants.
the fifth through eighth amendments guarantee fair treatment for individuals accused of crimes.
the ninth and tenth amendments impose general limits on the powers of the federal government.
j main idea summarizing why did the antifederalists insist that the constitution must have a bill of rights.
70 chapter 2 revolution and the early republic the protection of rights and freedoms did not apply to all americans at the time the bill of rights was adopted.
native americans and slaves were excluded.
women were not mentioned in the constitution.
the growing number of free blacks did not receive adequate protection from the constitution.
although many states permitted free blacks to vote the bill of rights offered them no protection against whites discrimination and hostility.
i main idea drawing conclusions how did the adoption of the bill of rights show the flexibility of the constitution.
continuing relevance of the constitution the united states constitution is the oldest written national constitution still in use.
it is a living document capable of meeting the changing needs of americans.
one reason for this capability lies in article i section 8 which gives congress the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers that the constitution enumerates.
this clause is referred to as the elastic clause because it stretches the power of the government.
the framers of the constitution included these implied powers in order to allow the authority of the government to expand to meet unforeseen circumstances.
the constitution also can be formally changed when necessary through amendments.
the constitution provides ways for amendments to be proposed and to be ratified.
only 27 amendments have been added to the constitution.
these amendments have helped the government meet the challenges of a changing world while still preserving the rights of the american people.
since its ratification the u s constitution has served as a model for other democracies.
it has been one of our nation s most important exports influencing the constitutions of dozens of other nations.
it is a flexible document that continues to protect americans and inspire people around the world.

review unit 71 citizenship spotlight symbols of patriotism patriotism or a love of and identification with one s country and its citizens is an important characteristic.
feelings of patriotism make citizens willing to act in a way that benefits their nation.
since the formation of the united states following the revolutionary war americans have found different symbols to represent their sense of patriotism.
some of these symbols have been long lasting and others have changed over time but all have given americans a sort of common ground.
they have also served as a way to demonstrate that patriotism to others.
stars and stripes perhaps the most recognizable symbol of the united states is the american flag.
in 1777 the continental congress passed an act that established an official flag for the new nation.
the design of the flag has changed as new states have joined the nation and today the flag consists of 13 red and white stripes representing the original colonies and 50 stars on a field of blue representing the states of the union.
americans demonstrate their patriotism by honoring the flag as a symbol of freedom.
i nearest recruiting station for u s army uncle sam as the story goes uncle sam made his first appearance during the war of 1812.
meatpacker samuel wilson supplied beef to the u s army during the war.
he stamped his barrels of beef with u s for united states but soldiers knew the food was supplied by uncle sam a newspaper reported the story and uncle sam became a widely accepted nickname for the united states.
the most famous visual representation of uncle sam is probably from the world war i recruiting poster at left which was created by artist james montgomery flagg.
the image was repurposed for world war ii and has become well known as a symbol of the united states.
72 chapter 2 revolution and the early republic the medal of honor one way to demonstrate patriotism is to serve in the armed services.
the armed services award medals to soldiers to acknowledge the sacrifices they have made in defense of their country.
the most prestigious of these awards is the medal of honor shown below which is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force that an individual serving in the u s armed forces can earn.
it is sometimes called the congressional medal of honor because it is presented by the president on behalf of congress.
medal of honor recipients represent americans of all races and genders.
african american vernon j baker was awarded the medal for his brave service in world war ii and the heroic actions of hispanic american roy benavidez in vietnam led to his medal.
there has been only one female recipient mary edwards walker who served as a surgeon during the civil war.
these brave men and women inspire others with their acts of heroism and the medal of honor is an important way to call attention to their patriotism and gallantry.
national mottoes mottoes are used to briefly convey principles or ideals.
u s currency includes two mottoes that have historical significance to the nation.
the motto e pluribus unum meaning out of many one has appeared on the great seal of the united states since the seal was originally adopted by the continental congress in 1782.
it represents the idea that many individual americans make up one nation which continues to be an important ideal.
in 1956 president eisenhower signed legislation adopting in god we trust as the nations official motto.
the phrase has appeared on u s coins since 1795.
the mottos adoption in 1956 reflects the tension of the cold war and the desire to distinguish the united states from the soviet union and its policy of atheism.
today though some americans are uncomfortable with the religious nature of the motto most support it.
a 2003 gallup poll found that 90 percent of americans approve of including the words in god we trust on u s coins.

american s george washington as the hero of the revolution george washington was the unanimous choice in the nation s first presidential election.
when the news reached him on april 14 1789 washington accepted the call to duty despite his uncertainty about how to lead the new country.
two days later he set out for new york city to take the oath of office.
a personal voice george washington 66 about ten oclock i bade adieu farewell to mount vernon to private life and to domestic felicity happiness and with a mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than i have words to express set out for new york.
with the best dispositions intentions to render service to my country in obedience to its call but with less hope of answering its expectations 99 the diaries of george washington when washington took office as the first president of the united states under the constitution he and congress faced a daunting task to create an entirely new government.
the momentous decisions that these early leaders made have resounded through american history.
washington heads the new government although the constitution provided a strong foundation it was not a detailed blueprint for governing.
to create a working government washington and congress had to make many practical decisions.
perhaps james madison put it best we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us.
judiciary act of 1789 one of the first tasks washington and congress faced was the creation of a judicial system.
the judiciary act of 1789 provided for a supreme court and federal circuit and district courts.
the judiciary act allowed state court decisions to be appealed to a federal court when constitutional issues 74 chapter 2 revolution and the early republic were raised.
it also guaranteed that federal laws would remain the supreme law of the land.
washington shapes the executive branch the nation s leaders also faced the task of building an executive branch.
to help the president govern congress created three executive departments the department of state to deal with foreign affairs the department of war to handle military matters and the department of the treasury to manage finances.
to head these departments washington chose capable leaders thomas jefferson as secretary of state alexander hamilton as secretary of the treasury henry knox as secretary of war.
these department heads soon became the president s chief advisers or cabinet.
main idea contrasting how did jeffersons and hamiltons views of government differ.
hamilton and jefferson two conflicting visions hamilton and jefferson held very different political ideas.
hamilton believed in a strong central government led by a prosperous educated elite of upper class citizens.
jefferson distrusted a strong central gov ernment and the rich.
he favored strong state and local governments rooted in popular participation.
hamilton believed that commerce and industry were the keys to a strong nation jefferson favored a society of farmer citizens.
hamiltons economic plan as secretary of the treasury hamilton s job was to put the nation s economy on a firm footing.
to do this he called on the nation to pay off its debts a large amount of which was incurred during the revolution.
he also proposed the establishment of a national bank that would be funded by both the federal government and wealthy private investors.
this bank would issue paper money and handle taxes and other government funds.
opponents of a national bank such as james madison argued that since the constitution made no provision for such an institution congress had no right to authorize it.
this argument began the debate between those like hamilton who favored a loose interpretation of the constitution and those like madison who favored a strict interpretation a vital debate that has continued throughout u s history.
key players thomas jefferson 1743 1826 the writer of the declaration of independence thomas jefferson began his political career at age 26 when he was elected to virginias colonial legislature.
in 1779 he was elected governor of virginia and in 1785 he was appointed minister to france.
he served as secretary of state from 1790 to 1793.
a southern planter jefferson was also an accomplished scholar the architect of monticello his virginia house an inventor of among other things a machine that made copies of letters and the founder of the university of virginia in 1819.
despite his elite background and his ownership of slaves he was a strong ally of the small farmer and average citizen.
alexander hamilton 1755 1804 born into poverty in the british west indies alexander hamilton was orphaned at age 13 and went to work as a shipping clerk.
he later made his way to new york where he attended kings college now columbia university.
he joined the army during the revolution and became an aide to general washington.
intensely ambitious hamilton quickly moved up in society.
although in his humble origins hamilton was the opposite of jefferson he had little faith in the common citizen and sided with the interests of upper class americans.
hamilton said of jefferson s beloved common people your people sir your people is a great beast review unit 75 contrasting views of the federal government hamilton concentrating power in federal government fear of mob rule republic led by a well educated elite loose interpretation of the constitution national bank constitutional loose interpretation economy based on shipping and manufacturing payment of national and state debts favoring creditors supporters merchants manufacturers landowners investors lawyers clergy jefferson sharing power with state and local governments limited national government fear of absolute power or ruler democracy of virtuous farmers and tradespeople strict interpretation of the constitution national bank unconstitutional strict interpretation economy based on farming payment of only the national debt favoring debtors supporters the plain people farmers tradespeople skillbuilder interpreting charts 1.
whose view of the federal government was a wealthy person more likely to favor.
how do you think jefferson differed from hamilton in his view of people and human nature.
the first political parties the differences within washington s cabinet intensified and soon helped to give rise to a two party system.
those who shared hamilton s vision of a strong central government mostly northerners called themselves federalists.
those who supported jefferson s vision of strong state governments mostly southerners called themselves democratic republicans.
french revolutionaries storm the bastille an infamous prison in paris france on july 14 1789.
the whiskey rebellion during washington s second term an incident occurred that reflected the tension between federal and regional interests.
previously congress had passed a protective tariff an import tax on goods produced abroad meant to encourage american production.
to generate even more revenue secretary hamilton pushed through an excise tax a tax on a product s manufacture sale or distribution to be levied on the manufacture of whiskey.
in 1794 furious whiskey producers in western pennsylvania refused to pay the tax and attacked the tax collectors.
the federal government responded by sending some 13 000 militiamen to end the conflict.
the whiskey rebellion as it came to be known marked the first use of armed force to assert federal authority.
background in addition to promoting american goods the tariff of 1789 as well as tariffs that followed provided the majority of the federal governments revenue until the 20th century.
challenges at home and abroad at the same time the new government faced critical problems and challenges overseas as well as at home along the western frontier.
addressing foreign affairs in 1789 a stunning revolution in france ended the french monarchy and brought hope for a government based on the will of the people.
by 1793 france was engaged in war with great britain as well as with other european countries.
in the united states reaction to the conflict tended to split along party lines.
democratic republicans supported france.
main idea developing historical perspective why did the united states want access to the mississippi river.
federalists wanted to back the british.
president washington took a middle position.
he issued a declaration of neutrality a statement that the united states would support neither side in the conflict.
washington remained wary of foreign involvement throughout his tenure in office.
in his farewell address in 1796 he warned the nation to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.
in another significant foreign matter thomas pinckney negotiated a treaty with spain in 1795.
according to pinckney s treaty spain agreed to give up all claims to land east of the mississippi except florida and recognized the 31st parallel as the northern boundary of florida.
spain also agreed to open the mississippi river to american traffic and allow traders to use the port of new orleans.
the treaty was important because it helped pave the way for u s expansion west of the appalachians.
challenges in the northwest meanwhile americans faced trouble along their western border where the british still maintained forts and native americans continued to resist white settlers.
in 1794 after numerous skirmishes the u s military led by general anthony wayne defeated a confederacy of native americans at the battle of fallen timbers near present day toledo ohio.
the victory helped to establish the settlers supremacy in the region.
jays treaty at the time of the battle of fallen timbers john jay the chief justice of the supreme court was in london to negotiate a treaty with great britain.
one of the disputed issues was which nation would control territories west of the appalachian mountains.
when news of wayne s victory at fallen timbers arrived the british agreed to evacuate their posts in the northwest territory because they did not wish to fight both the united states and the french with whom they were in conflict at the same time.
although jay s treaty signed on november 19 1794 was a diplomatic victory the treaty provoked outrage at home.
for one thing it allowed the british to continue their fur trade on the american side of the u s canadian border.
this angered western settlers.
also the treaty did not resolve a dispute over neutral american trade in the caribbean.
americans believed that their ships had the right to free passage there.
the british however had seized a number of these ships confiscating their crews and cargo.
despite serious opposition the treaty managed to pass the senate.
the bitter political fight over jay s treaty along with the growing division between the federalists and democratic republicans convinced washington not to seek a third term.
adams provokes criticism in the election of 1796 the united states faced a new situation a contest between opposing parties.
the federalists nominated vice president john adams for president while the democratic republicans chose thomas jefferson.
in the election adams received 71 electoral votes while jefferson received 68.
because the constitution stated that the runner up should become vice president the country found itself with a federalist president and a democratic republican vice president.
the election also underscored the growing danger of sectionalism placing the interests of one region over those of the nation as a whole.
almost all the electors from the southern states voted for jefferson while all the electors from the northern states voted for adams.
portrait of a young john adams by joseph badger review unit 77 adams tries to avoid war soon after taking office president adams faced his first crisis a looming war with france.
the french government regarded the u s british agreement over the northwest territory a violation of the french american alliance.
in retaliation they began to seize american ships bound for britain.
adams sent a three man team to paris to negotiate a solution.
4s this team which included future chief justice john marshall planned to meet with the french foreign minister talleyrand.
instead the french sent three low level officials whom adams in his report to congress called x y and z.
the french officials demanded a 250 000 bribe as payment for seeing talleyrand.
news of this insult which became known as the xyz affair provoked a wave of anti french feeling at home.
millions for defense but not one cent for tribute became the slogan of the day.
in 1798 congress created a navy department and authorized american ships to seize french vessels.
for the next two years an undeclared naval war raged between france and the united states.
the federalists called for a full scale war against france but adams refused to take that step.
through diplomacy the two countries eventually smoothed over their differences.
adams damaged his standing among the federalists but he kept the united states out of war.
main idea analyzing motives why did the french begin to seize u s ships.
the alien and sedition acts although democratic republicans cheered adams for avoiding war with france they criticized him mercilessly on many other issues.
tensions between federalists and democratic republicans rose to a fever pitch.
adams regarded democratic republican ideas as dangerous to the welfare of the nation.
he and other federalists accused the democratic republicans of favoring foreign powers.
many immigrants were active in the democratic republican party.
some of the most vocal critics of the adams administration were foreign born.
they included french and british radicals as well as recent irish immigrants who lashed out at anyone who was even faintly pro british including the federalist adams.
to counter what they saw as a growing threat against the government the federalists pushed through congress in 1798 four measures that became known as the alien and sedition acts.
three of these measures the alien acts raised the residence requirement for american citizenship from 5 years to 14 years and allowed the president to deport or jail any alien considered undesirable.

78 chapter 2 revolution and the early republic the fourth measure the sedition act set fines and jail terms for anyone trying to hinder the operation of the government or expressing false scandalous and malicious statements against the government.
under the terms of this act the federal government prosecuted and jailed a number of democratic republican editors publishers and politicians.
outraged democratic republicans called the laws a violation of freedom of speech guaranteed by the first amendment.
virginia and kentucky resolutions the two main democratic republican leaders thomas jefferson and james madison saw the alien and sedition acts as a serious misuse of power on the part of the federal government.
they decided to organize opposition to the alien and sedition acts by appealing to the states.
madison drew up a set of resolutions that were adopted by the virginia legislature while jefferson wrote resolutions that were approved in kentucky.
the resolutions warned of the dangers that the alien and sedition acts posed to a government of checks and balances guaranteed by the constitution.
a personal voice let the honest advocate of confidence in government read the alien and sedition acts and say if the constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to the government it created and whether we should be wise in destroying those limits 8th resolution the virginia and kentucky resolutions j main idea analyzing issues how did the kentucky resolutions challenge the authority of the federal government.
the kentucky resolutions in particular asserted the principle of nullification the states had the right to nullify or consider void any act of congress that they deemed unconstitutional.
virginia and kentucky viewed the alien and sedition acts as unconstitutional violations of the first amendment that deprived citizens of their rights.
the resolutions also called for other states to adopt similar declarations.
no other state did so however and the issue died out by the next presidential election.
nevertheless the resolutions showed that the balance of power between the states and the federal government remained a controversial issue.
in fact the election of 1800 between federalist john adams and democratic republican thomas jefferson would center on this critical debate.

review unit 81 end of chapter skill activity understanding historians interpretations of the past defining the skill historians ask questions to learn how or why something happened why someone acted in a certain way or how different conditions might have changed events.

81 sk2 iwmw a r the revolution v sfc t the american revolution led to the formation of the united states of america in 1776.
beginning in the 1760s tensions grew between american colonists and their british rulers when britain started passing a series of new laws and taxes for the colonies.
with no representation in the british government however colonists had no say in these laws which led to growing discontent.
after fighting broke out in 1775 colonial leaders met to decide what to do.
they approved the declaration of independence announcing that the american colonies were free from british rule.

in its elasticity lies its chief greatness.
president woodrow wilson purposes of the constitution the official charge to the delegates who met in philadelphia in 1787 was to amend the articles of confederation.
they soon made a fateful decision however to ignore the articles and to write an entirely new constitution.
these delegates the framers set themselves five purposes to fulfill in their effort to create an effective constitution.
establish legitimacy first the framers of the constitution had to establish the new government s legitimacy its right to rule.
the patriots theory of government was set out in the declaration of independence which explained why british rule over the colonies was illegitimate.
now the framers had to demonstrate that their new government met the standards of legitimacy referred to in the declaration.
for the framers of the constitution legitimacy had to be based on a compact or contract among those who are to be ruled.
this is why the constitution starts with the words we the people of the united states do ordain and establish this constitution.
create appropriate structures the framers second purpose was to create appropriate structures for the new government.
the framers were committed to the principles of representative democracy.
they also believed that any new government must include an important role for state governments and ensure that the states retained some legitimacy to rule within their borders.
to achieve their goals the framers created the congress the presidency and the judiciary to share the powers of the national government.
they also created a system of division of powers between the national government and the state governments.
the original manuscript of the constitution is now kept in the national archives in washington d c am d 82 the living constitution 3.
describe and distribute power researching a constitutional question as you study the constitution think about a constitutional question that interests you.
here are some possible questions how much if at all can the federal government or a state government restrict the sale of firearms.
under what conditions does the president have the power to order american troops into battle without congressional approval.
under what conditions may a police officer conduct a search of the inside of an automobile.
the framers had as their third purpose to describe governmental powers and to distribute them among the structures they created.
the powers of the legislative branch which are those of congress are listed in article 1 section 8 of the constitution.
many of the executive powers belonging to the president are listed in article 2 sections 2 and 3.
the courts are given judicial powers in article 3.
the words of article 4 imply that the states retain authority over many public matters.
once you have chosen a constitutional question research that question in articles and books on the constitution.
also check the indexes of well known newspapers such as the new york times for articles that are relevant.
limit government powers the fourth purpose of the framers was to limit the powers of the structures they created.
limits on the congress s powers are found in article 1 section 9.
some of the limits on the powers of state governments are found in article 1 section 10.
there the framers enumerate functions that are delegated to the national government and so cannot be directed by the states.
allow for change the framers fifth purpose was to include some means for changing the constitution.
here they faced a dilemma they wanted to make certain that the government endured by changing with the times but they did not want to expose the basic rules of government to so many changes that the system would be unstable.
so in article 5 they created a difficult but not impossible means for amending the constitution.
how to read the constitution the constitution which appears on pages 84 103 is printed on a beige background while the explanatory notes next to each article section or clause are printed on blue.
each article is divided into sections and the sections are subdivided into clauses.

71 research web links review unit 83 ji i preamble constitutional insight preamble why does the preamble say we the people of the united states.
ordain and establish the new government.
the articles of confederation was an agreement among the states.
but the framers of the constitution wanted to be sure its legitimacy came from the american people not from the states which might decide to withdraw their support at any time.
this is a basic principle of the constitution.
article 1 constitutional insight section 1 why does the first article of the constitution focus on congress rather than on the presidency or the courts.
the framers were intent on stressing the central role of the legislative branch in the new government because it is the branch that most directly represents the people and is most responsive to them.
critical thinking do you think congress is still the branch of the federal government that is most directly responsible to the people.
why or why not.
constitutional insight section 2 1 why are members of the house of representatives elected every two years.
the house of representatives was designed to be a truly representative body with members who reflect the concerns and sentiments of their constituents as closely as possible.
the framers achieved this timely representation by establishing two years as a reasonable term for members of the house to serve.
critical thinking do you think electing members of the house of representatives every two years is a good idea.
why or why not.
the constitution preamble.
purpose of the constitution we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america.

the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand but each state shall have at least one representative and until such enumeration shall be made the state of new hampshire shall be entitled to choose three massachusetts eight rhode island and providence plantations ene connecticut five new york six new requirements for holding federal office position j minimum age residency citizenship representative 25 state in which elected 7 years senator 30 state in which elected 9 years president supreme court 35 14 years in the united states natural born justice none none none jersey four7 pennsylvania eight delaware one maryland six virginia ten north carolina hve j south carolina five and georgia three.
vacancies when vacancies happen in the representation from any state the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.
officers and impeachment the house of representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers and shall have the sole power of impeachment.
84 the living constitution 1 section 3.
the senate 1.
numbers the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature thereof for six years and each senator shall have one vote.
classifying terms immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes.
the seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year so that one third may be chosen every second year and if vacancies happen by resignation or otherwise during the recess of the legislature of any state the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the leg islaturc which shall then fill such vacancies.
qualifications no person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years and been nine years a citizen of the united states and who shall not when elected be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.
role of vice president the vice president of the united states shall be president of the senate but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided.
officers the senate shall choose their other officers and also a president pro tempore in the absence of the vice president or when he shall exercise the office of president of the united states.
impeachment trials the senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
when sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation.
when the president of the united states is tried the chief justice shall preside and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.
punishment for impeachment judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law.
congressional elections 1.
regulations the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of choosing senators.
sessions the congress shall assemble at least once in every year stteh meeting shall be on the fir3t monday in december unless they shall by law appoint a different day.
constitutional insight section 3 1 why are members of the senate elected every six years.
the framers feared the possibility of instability in the government.
so they decided that senators should have six year terms and be elected by the state legislatures rather than directly by the people.
the seventeenth amendment as you will see later changed this.
the framers also staggered the terms of the senators so that only one third of them are replaced at any one time.
this stabilizes the senate still further.
critical thinking do you think it is important today for the senate to have more stability than the house of representatives.
constitutional insight sections 3 6 and 3 7 must an impeached president step down from office.
not necessarily.
an impeachment is a formal accusation of criminal behavior or serious misbehavior.
by impeaching the president the u s house of representatives is officially accusing the nations chief executive of one or more wrongdoings that warrant possible removal from office.
it is then the responsibility of the senate to conduct a trial to determine whether the president is guilty or not guilty of the charges and thus whether or not the president must step down.
conviction requires a two thirds vote of the senate.
critical thinking do you think a president should be put on trial for a crime while he or she is still in office.
review unit constitutional insight section 5 2 what kinds of rules does congress make for itself.
the constitution gives each house control over most of its rules of procedure and membership.
rules are important for they help shape the kinds of laws and policies that pass each body.
senate rules allow a filibuster whereby a senator holds the floor as long as he or she likes in order to block consideration of a bill he or she dislikes.
in recent years a cloture rule has been used to end debate if 60 or more members vote to do so.
in contrast the house of representatives has rules to limit debate.
a rules committee has the primary task of determining how long a bill on the floor of the house may be discussed and whether any amendments can be offered to the bill.
in recent years the power of the rules committee has been limited but being able to shape the rules remains a powerful tool of members of congress.
critical thinking why do you think the chair of the rules committee is in a powerful position.
constitutional insight section 7 1 why must all bills to raise revenue originate in the house.
because its members all stand for election every two years the house was expected to be more directly responsive to the people.
the tradition of restricting the powers of taxation to the peoples representatives dates prior to the english bill of rights 1689 which granted to parliament and withheld from the king the right to raise taxes.
when colonists protesting the stamp act and the intolerable acts protested no taxation without representation they were appealing to a longstanding right codified in the english bill of rights.
constitutional insight section 7 2 how often do presidents use the veto and how often is that action overridden.
the use of the veto which is the refusal to approve a bill depends on many factors especially the political conditions of the time.
until 1865 only nine presidents exercised the veto for 36 pieces of legislation including andrew jackson who used it 12 times.
since 1865 every president has used the veto power some on relatively few occasions others as frequently as over a hundred times.
usually congress is unable to produce the votes those of two thirds of the members present in each house needed to override presidential vetoes.
critical thinking do you think it should be easier for congress to override a presidents veto.
why or why not.
rules and procedures 1.
quorum each house shall be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide.
rules and conduct each house may determine the rules of its proceedings punish its members for disorderly behavior and with the concurrence of two thirds expel a member.
congressional records each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings and from time to time publish the same excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy and the yeas and nays of the members of either house on any question shall at the desire of one fifth of those present be entered on the journal.
adjournment neither house during the session of congress shall without the consent of the other adjourn for more than three days nor to any other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.
payment and privileges 1.
salary the senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for their services to be ascertained by law and paid out of the treasury of the united states.
they shall in all cases except treason felony and breach of the peace be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses and in going to and returning from the same and for any speech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place.
restrictions no senator or representative shall during the time for which he was elected be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the united states which shall have been created or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time and no person holding any office under the united states shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.
how a bill becomes a law 1.
tax bills all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.
lawmaking process every bill which shall have passed the house of representatives and the senate shall before it become a law be presented to the president of the united states if he approves he shall sign it but if not he shall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated who shall enter the objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it.
if after such reconsideration two thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill it shall be sent together with the objections to the other house by which it shall likewise be reconsidered and if approved by two thirds of that house it shall become a law.
but in all such 86 the living constitution cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively.
if any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days sundays excepted after it shall have been presented to him the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return in which case it shall not be a law.
role of the president every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of adjournment shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or being disapproved by him shall be repassed by two thirds of the senate and house of representatives according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.
balances reflected in the process of a bills becoming a law.
review unit 87 constitutional insight section 8 the powers given to congress are in section 8 of article 1.
the first 17 clauses of section 8 are often called the enumerated powers because they name individually congresss specific powers.
these powers deal with issues ranging from taxation and the national debt to calling out the armed forces of the various states to governing the nations capital district washington d c.
the 18th and final clause is different.
it gives congress the power to do what is necessary and proper to carry out the enumurated powers.
thus the enumerated powers of congress to lay and collect taxes to borrow money to regulate commerce and to coin money imply the power to create a bank in order to execute these powers.
early in the countrys history this elastic clause as it has been called was used by congress to establish the controversial bank of the united states in 1791 and the second bank of the united states in 1816.
critical thinking why do you think the elastic clause is still important today.
modern money technological advances such as color copiers have led to increased counterfeiting.
in response the bureau of engraving and printing bep the federal agency that prints u s currency began adding advanced security features to paper money.
the bep also made a commitment to redesign the nations currency every seven to ten years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.
the 5 10 20 50 and 100 bills were all redesigned between 2003 and 2010 ixixd oogooooot iqoj section 8.
powers granted to congress 1.
taxation the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the com mon defense and general welfare of the united states but all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states 2 credit to borrow money on the credit of the united states 3.

district of columbia to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyards and other needful buildings and 18.

constitutional insight section 9 why didnt the framers include a bill of rights in the original constitution.
actually they did.
article 1 section 9 defines limits on the powers of congress just as the first ten amendments which we call the bill of rights do.
while some of the provisions focus on such issues as slavery and taxation there are three explicit prohibitions dealing with citizens rights writ of habeas corpus.
section 9 clause 2 says that except in time of rebellion or invasion congress cannot suspend peoples right to a writ of habeas corpus.
this means that people cannot be held in prison or jail without being formally charged with a crime.
bill of attainder.
clause 3 prohibits the passage of any law that convicts or punishes a person directly and without a trial.
any legislative action that would punish someone without recourse to a court of law is called a bill of attainder.
ex post facto law.
the same clause prohibits ex post facto laws.
such a law would punish a person for an act that was legal when it was performed.
the fact that these particular rights were protected by the original document issued by the framers reflects both the framers experiences during the revolution and their fear of excessive government power.
q critical thinking why are american citizens today so intent on having protections against government violations of their rights.
review unit 89 article 2 constitutional insight section 1 1 what exactly is executive power.
ne know the president has it but nowhere is it explicitly defined.
it is most often defined as the power to carry out the laws of the land but of course no one person can handle such a chore alone.
a more appropriate definition is found in section 3 of this article which empowers the president to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
in this sense the president is the chief administrator.
o critical thinking why is it important to have an executive who is the chief administrator.
peacetime and war restraints no state shall without the consent of congress lay any duty of tonnage keep troops or ships of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.
article 2 the executive section 1.
the presidency 1.
terms of office the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america.
he shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vice president chosen for the same term be elected as follows 2.
electoral college each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress but no senator or representative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the united states shall be appointed an elector.
former method of electing president the electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by balfo t for two persons of wham one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.
and they shall make a list of all the persons voted for.
and of the number of votes for each which list t foey shall sign and eerti fy and transmit scaled to the seat of the government of the united states directed to the president of the senate.
the president ef the senate shall in the presence of the senate and house of representatives open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.
the person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president if such number be a majority of the whole number of clce tors appointed and if there be more than one who have 3uch major ity end have an equal number of votes then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president and if no person have a majority then from the five high est on the list the said house shall in like manner choose the president.
but in choosing the president the votes shall be taken by states the representation from each state having one vote a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states and a majority of ar the sta tes shall be necessary to a eheice.
in every case after the choice of the president the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the viee president.
but if there should remain two or more who have equal votes the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice president.
election day the congress may determine the time of choosing the electors and the day on which they shall give their votes which day shall be the same throughout the united states.
90 the living constitution 5.
qualifications no person except a natural born citizen er a citizen of the united states amhc time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states.
succession in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or a president shall be elected.
salary the president shall at stated times receive for his services a compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the united states or any of them.
oath of office before he enter on the execution of his office he shall take the following oath or affirmation i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states.
powers of the president 1.
military powers the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states he may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states except in cases of impeachment.
treaties appointments he shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur and he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments.
vacancies the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.
constitutional insight section 1 6 what happens when the vice president succeeds a dead or incapacitated president.
section 1 6 provides that the vice president shall assume the powers and duties of the presidential office.
but until the twenty fifth amendment was added to the constitution in 1967 there was no explicit statement in the document that the vice president is to become president.
that procedure owes its origin to john tyler the tenth president of the united states who in 1841 succeeded william henry harrison the first president to die in office.
tyler decided to take the oath of office and assume the title of president of the united states.
congress voted to go along with his decision and the practice was repeated after lincoln was assassinated.
it would take another century for the written provisions of the constitution to catch up with the practice.
critical thinking why is it important to know the order of succession if a president dies in office.
constitutional insight section 2 1 just how much authority does the president have as commander in chief of the armed forces.
the president has the power to give orders to american military forces.
there have been several instances in u s history when presidents have used that authority in spite of congressional wishes.
president harry truman involved the armed forces of the united states in the korean war from 1950 to 1953 without a congressional declaration of war.
reacting to criticism of the vietnam war congress in 1973 enacted the war powers resolution making the president more accountable to congress for any military actions he or she might take.
every president since richard nixon has called the resolution unconstitutional.
nevertheless every president has reported to congress within 48 hours of sending troops into an international crisis as is required by the war powers resolution.
critical thinking why is it important that the commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states be a civilian the president rather than a military general.
review unit constitutional insight section 3 is it necessary for the president to deliver a state of the union address before a joint session of congress at the start of each legislative year.
the constitution requires only that the president report to congress on the state of the union from time to time and nowhere does it call for an annual address.
in 1913 president woodrow wilson wanted to influence congress to take action without delay on some legislation that he thought was important.
wilson revived the tradition which had been discontinued by jefferson of delivering the state of the union address in person.
o critical thinking how does the president use the state of the union address today.
constitutional insight section 4 have high level public officials ever been impeached.
in all of american history the house has impeached two presidents and neither had to leave office.
in 1868 the senate found president andrew johnson not guilty by one vote after the house impeached him charging him with violating a congressional act.
in 1999 senators acquitted president bill clinton after the house impeached him with charges of lying under oath and obstructing justice in the attempted cover up of a white house scandal.
the only other president to come close to impeachment was richard nixon.
in 1974 the house judiciary committee in what is the first step of the impeachment process recommended three articles of impeachment against nixon for his role in the infamous watergate scandal.
before the full house could vote for or against the articles of impeachment however nixon resigned from office.
critical thinking why do you think the framers of the constitution created such an elaborate and seemingly difficult procedure for removing a sitting president.
presidential duties he shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient he may on extraordinary occasions convene both houses or either of them and in case of disagreement between them with respect to the time of adjournment he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed and shall commission all the officers of the united states.
impeachment the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
above rep henry hyde chairman of the house judiciary committee swears in independent counsel kenneth starr during the committees hearings on impeachment charges against president bill clinton in 1998 right president andrew johnson is handed the articles of impeachment before his trial in 1868 nmiulco.

the courts authority article 3 1.
general authority the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority to all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to controversies to which the united states shall be a party to controversies between two or more states between a state and citizens of another state between citizens of different states between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizcns or subjects.
supreme court in all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls and those in which a state shall be party the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction.
in all the other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make.
trial by jury the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed but when not committed within any state the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed.
constitutional insight section 2 1 what is judicial review.
is it the same as judicial power.
actually they are not the same.
judicial power is the authority to hear cases involving disputes over the law or the behavior of people.
judicial review in contrast is a courts passing judgment on the constitutionality of a law or government action that is being disputed.
interestingly nowhere does the constitution mention judicial review.
there are places where it is implied for example in section 2 of article 6 but the only explicit description of the responsibility of the courts is the reference to judicial power in section 1 of article 3.
the supreme courts power to review laws passed by congress was explicitly affirmed by the court itself in marbury v madison.
see page 118.
critical thinking why is judicial review although not mentioned in the constitution an important activity of the supreme court.
definition treason against the united states shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort.
no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court.
punishment the congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.
the supreme court of the united states as of august 2010.
in the front row left to right are associate justices clarence thomas and antonin scalia chief justice john roberts and associate justices anthony kennedy and ruth bader ginsburg.
in the back row left to right are associate justices sonia sotomayor stephen breyer samuel alito and elena kagan.
article 4 constitutional insight section 2 1 why do college students attending public universities outside their state of residence have to pay higher tuition fees.
the supreme court has interpreted the privileges and immunities clause to allow higher tuition fees and fees for hunting permits etc.
for nonresidents when a state can give a substantial reason for the difference.
since state colleges and universities receive some financial support from the states taxpayers the difference is regarded as justified in most states.
if a student establishes residency in the state he or she can pay in state tuition after one year.
critical thinking do you think it is fair that a nonresident must pay higher tuition fees at a state college than a resident of the state must pay.
constitutional insight section 3 1 should there be a west virginia.
the constitution states that no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state without the permission of the legislature of the state involved and of the congress.
vermont kentucky tennessee and maine were created from territory taken from existing states with the approval of the sitting legislatures.
west virginia however is a different story.
during the civil war the residents of the westernmost counties of virginia were angry with their states decision to secede from the union.
they petitioned congress to have their counties declared a distinct state.
congress agreed and so the state of west virginia was created.
after the civil war the legislature of virginia gave its formal approval perhaps because it was in no position to dispute the matter.
critical thinking suppose a section of texas should decide to become a new state today.
could it do this.
why or why not.
relations among states section 1.
state acts and records full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state.
and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof.
rights of citizens 1.
citizenship the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.
extradition a person charged in any state with treason felony or other crime who shall flee from justice and be found in another state shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.
fugitive slaves no person held to service or labor in one stater under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such sendee or labor may be due.

the constitution and all federal laws and treaties are the highest law of the land.
to be supreme federal laws must be constitutional.
all state constitutions and laws and all local laws rank below national law and cannot be enforced if they contradict national law.
for example if the united states enters into a treaty protecting migratory canadian birds the states must change their laws to fit the provisions of that agreement.
that was the decision of the supreme court in the case of missouri v holland 1920.
the state of missouri argued that the national government could not interfere with its power to regulate hunting within its borders but the supreme court concluded that the treaty was a valid exercise of national power and therefore took priority over state and local laws.
the states had to adjust their rules and regulations accordingly.
critical thinking what would happen if the national law were not supreme.
article 7 constitutional insight why was ratification by only 9 states sufficient to put the constitution into effect.
in taking such a momentous step as replacing one constitution the articles of confederation with another the framers might have been expected to require the agreement of all 13 states.
but the framers were political realists.
they knew that they would have a difficult time winning approval from all 13 states.
but they also knew that they had a good chance of getting 9 or 10 of the states on board and that once that happened the rest would follow.
their strategy worked but just barely.
although they had the approval of 9 states by the end of june 1788 2 of the most important states virginia and new york had not yet decided to ratify.
without the approval of these influential states the new government would have had a difficult time surviving.
finally by the end of july both had given their blessing to the new constitution but not without intense debate.
and then there was the last holdout rhode island.
not only had rhode island refused to send delegates to the constitutional convention in 1787 but it turned down ratification several times before finally giving its approval in 1790 under a cloud of economic and even military threats from neighboring states.
critical thinking do you think all 50 states would ratify the constitution today.
why or why not.
review unit 95 bill of rights constitutional insight amendment 1 do americans have an absolute right to free speech.
the right to free speech is not without limits.
in the case of schenck v united states 1919 justice oliver wendell holmes wrote that this right does not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic thus there are some forms of speech that are not protected by the first amendment and congress is allowed to make laws regarding certain types of expression.
see schenck v united states on page 396.
critical thinking why is there controversy over freedom of speech today.
constitutional insight amendment 4 can the police search your car without a court issued search warrant when they stop you for speeding.
the answer according to supreme court decisions depends on whether they have good reasons called probable cause for doing so.
if a state trooper notices bloody clothing on the back seat of a vehicle she stops for a traffic violation there might be probable cause for her to insist on searching the vehicle.
there is probably not sufficient reason for a search if the trooper is merely suspicious of the driver because of the way he is acting.
in such cases the trooper may make a casual request such as do you mind if i look inside your vehicle if the answer is no then according to the court the driver has waived his or her constitutional right against unreasonable searches.
critical thinking why do you think the right against unreasonable searches and seizures is highly important to most people.
constitutional insight amendment 5 can you be tried twice for the same offense.
the prohibition against double jeopardy protects you from having the same charge twice brought against you for the same offense but you can be tried on different charges related to that offense.
critical thinking what do you think could happen if a person could be tried twice for the same offense.

constitutional insight amendment 6 what are the miranda rights.
the term comes from the supreme courts decision in miranda v arizona 1966 in which the justices established basic rules that the police must follow when questioning a suspect.
if suspected of a crime you must be told that you have a right to remain silent and that anything you say can and will be used against you.
you also need to be informed that you have a right to an attorney and that the attorney may be present during questioning.
see miranda v arizona on page 694.
critical thinking how do the miranda rights protect you.
constitutional insight amendment 7 what are the rules of the common law.
the common law is the body of legal practices and decrees developed in england and english speaking america from a d 1066 through the present.
it includes magna carta 1215 which acknowledges versions of rights affirmed in the fifth sixth and seventh amendments as well as the english bill of rights 1689 which codified rights asserted in the first second seventh and eighth amendments.
the common law also includes the decisions and published opinions of state and federal appeals courts including the u s supreme court.
constitutional insight amendment 9 do you have a right to privacy.
until 1965 no such right had ever been explicitly stated by the courts.
that year in the case of griswold v connecticut the court said there is an implied right of american citizens to make certain personal choices without interference from the government this case concerned the right to use birth control.
years later in roe v wade 1973 the same logic was used to declare unconstitutional a texas law restricting a womans right to an abortion in the first stages of pregnancy.
since that decision both the right to privacy and abortion rights have become the focus of major political controversies.
critical thinking how do you define the right to privacy.

constitutional insight amendment 12 how did the election of 1800 lead to the twelfth amendment.
the election ended in a tie vote between the republican running mates.
the election was decided in jeffersons favor on the houses 36th ballot.
almost immediately alexander hamilton and others designed an amendment that established that the presidential electors would vote for both a presidential and a vice presidential candidate.
this amendment prevents a repeat of the problem experienced in the 1800 election.
critical thinking why is the twelfth amendment important.
election reform a new wave of electoral reform efforts was triggered by the controversial presidential election of 2000 in which george w bushs narrow victory over al gore left many americans questioning the system in which a candidate can lose the popular vote but win the election.
eliminating or reworking the electoral college has been historically the most frequently proposed constitutional amendment.
other reform proposals have included improving access to polling places by allowing voting on weekend hours or making election day a national holiday.
still other proposals would modernize inaccurate polling and counting machines or replace them with computer stations or online voting.

but in choosing the president the votes shall be taken by states the representation from each state having one vote a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.
and if the house of representatives shall not choose a president whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them before the fourth day of march next following then the vice president shall act as president as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the president.
the person having the greatest number of votes as vice president shall be the vice president if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed and if no person have a majority then from the two highest numbers on the list the senate shall choose the vice president a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two thirds of the whole number of senators and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice.

section 1 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside.

constitutional insight amendment 14 section 1 which personal status takes priority that of u s citizen or that of state citizen.
the fourteenth amendment firmly notes that americans are citizens of both the nation and the states but that no state can abridge the privileges or immunities of u s citizens deprive them of life liberty or property without due process of law or deny them equal protection of the laws what does it mean to have equal protection of the laws.
equal protection means that the laws are to be applied to all persons in the same way.
the legal system may discriminate between persons treat them differently or unequally if there are relevant reasons to do so.
for example a persons income and number of dependents are relevant for how much income tax the person should pay a persons gender is not.
the supreme courts 1954 decision in brown v board of education of topeka see page 708 which declared segregated public schools unconstitutional was based on an equal protection claim a childs race is not a relevant reason for the state to assign that child to a particular school.

constitutional insight amendment 19 when did women first get the right to vote in the united states.
women had the right to vote in the state of new jersey between 1776 and 1807.
in the late 19th century some states and territories began to extend full or limited suffrage to women.
then in 1920 the nineteenth amendment prohibited the united states or any state from denying women the right to vote.
o critical thinking how does the right of women to vote affect politics today.
constitutional insight amendment 20 why is the twentieth amendment usually called the tame duck amendment.
a lame duck is a person who continues to hold office after his or her replacement has been elected.
such a person is called a lame duck because he or she no longer has any strong political influence.
the twentieth amendment reduces the time between the election of a new president and vice president in november and their assumption of the offices which it sets at january 20 instead of march 4.
it also reduces the time new members of congress must wait to take their seats from 4 months to about 2 months.
they are now seated on january 3 following the november election.
as a result the lame duck period is now quite short.
q critical thinking why may the framers have specified a longer lame duck period.
constitutional insight amendment 21 what is unique about the twenty first amendment.
besides being the only amendment that explicitly repeals another it was the first and is so far the only one to have been ratified by the state convention method outlined in article 5.
congress probably fearing that state legislatures would not deal swiftly with the issue of repeal chose to have each state call a special convention to consider the amendment.
the strategy worked well for the elected delegates to the conventions represented public opinion on the issue and ratified the amendment without delay.
critical thinking why is it necessary to pass another amendment to revoke or remove an existing amendment.
review unit 101 congressional term limits in 1995 the supreme court struck down all state laws limiting congressional terms stating that they were unconstitutional.
the court ruled that only a constitutional amendment such as the twenty second which limits the president to two terms could impose term limits on members of congress.
proposed constitutional amendments for congressional term limits were defeated in congress in 1995 and in 1997.
constitutional insight amendment 23 why were residents of the district of columbia without a vote in presidential elections.
first the district was merely an idea at the time the constitution was written.
second no one expected the district to include many residents.
third the framers designed the electoral college on a state framework.
by 1960 however the fact that nearly 800 000 americans living in the nations capital could not vote in presidential elections was an embarrassment.
the twenty third amendment gives washington d c residents the right to vote in presidential elections by assigning them electoral votes.
critical thinking do you think the district of columbia should be made a separate state.
constitutional insight amendment 24 why was the poll tax an issue important enough to require an amendment.
the poll tax was used in some places to prevent african american voters at least the many who were too poor to pay the tax from participating in elections.
as the civil rights movement gained momentum the abuse of the poll tax became a major issue but the national government found it difficult to change the situation because the constitutional provisions in article 1 section 4 leave the qualifications of voters in the hands of the states.
the twenty fourth amendment changed this by prohibiting the united states or any state from including payment of any tax as a requirement for voting.
0 critical thinking what impact do you think the twenty fourth ment has had on elections.

constitutional insight amendment 26 why was the twenty sixth amendment passed.
granting 18 year olds the right to vote became an issue in the 1960s during the vietnam war when people questioned the justice of requiring 18 year old men to submit to the military draft but refusing them the right to vote.
in 1970 congress passed a voting rights act giving 18 year olds the right to vote in elections.
when the constitutionality of this act was challenged the supreme court decided that states had to honor the 18 year old vote for congressional and presidential elections but could retain higher age requirements for state and local elections.
to avoid confusion at the polls the twenty sixth amendment was passed.
it guarantees 18 year olds the right to vote in national and state elections.
o critical thinking do you think 18 year olds should have the right to vote.

review unit 103 tracing themes voting rights when the american colonists declared their independence from great britain in 1776 their struggle to create a representative government was just beginning.
one of the key elements of that government is the right to vote.
voting is a civic responsibility our democratic system relies on its citizens to participate in politics.
voting is an act of patriotism that reinforces the strength of the republic and its democratic ideals.
it is a part of our national ethos or character.
while the right to vote is not unique to the united states americans take great pride in their democratic history and the efforts that they have made to preserve and protect their voting rights.
however the right to vote has not always been extended to all groups.
as a result excluded groups used various methods to expand suffrage so that they too could exercise this important right.
such methods have included amendments to the u s constitution lobbying nonviolent protests and litigation.
as more americans have been granted this right we have moved closer to the constitutional goal of forming a more perfect union.
amendments in 1870 the fifteenth amendment was ratified as part of reconstruction following the civil war.
it attempted to guarantee african american males the right to vote by stating that the right of u s citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude this extension of suffrage added millions of potential new voters.
unfortunately the amendment did not protect against denial of suffrage for reasons other than race so poll taxes grandfather clauses and literacy tests were used to prevent african american males from exercising their voting rights.
the twenty fourth amendment ratified in 1964 abolished poll taxes which extended suffrage yet again.
more recently the twenty sixth amendment ratified in 1971 granted the right to vote to citizens eighteen years of age or older on the whole amendments have been an effective means of expanding voting rights.
5w ib lobbying when the delegates to the seneca falls convention gathered in 1848 to begin their campaign for womens rights they had no idea that it would take them 72 years of organizing lobbying and persuading before they finally won the right to vote.
several organizations took up the banner of womens suffrage such as the national american woman suffrage association nawsa and the national womens party nwp shown lobbying at left.
they used a variety of tactics to achieve their goals.
one tactic was lobbying or exerting pressure on public officials to achieve political goals.
for example the purpose of nawsas congressional committee led by alice paul and lucy burns was to convince congress to pass an amendment granting women the vote.
eventually the lobbying efforts of this and other suffrage groups paid off when the nineteenth amendment ratified in 1920 expanded voting rights to include women.
chapter 2 living constitution nonviolent protests in the 1960s the african american civil rights movement adopted a strategy of nonviolent protest to seek expansion of voting rights.
although the fifteenth amendment guaranteed that voting rights could not be denied due to race states had implemented other methods to discriminate against african americans and keep them from the polls.
members of the civil rights movement staged sit ins boycotts marches and other forms of nonviolent civil action in order to protest discrimination and segregation.
in 1965 martin luther king jr began a campaign of nonviolent protests and marches in selma alabama to gain voting rights for african americans.
in response to these events president johnson asked for the speedy passage of the voting rights act of 1965.
the new law gave the federal government the power to break down longstanding barriers to african american voting rights.
litigation in many instances litigation has been used to protect and reclaim voting rights.
for example in the 1915 decision guinn v united states the u s supreme court struck down oklahomas grandfather clause because it violated the rights guaranteed to african americans in the fifteenth amendment.
litigation has also been used to ensure that minority votes carry equal weight.
in 1973 for instance the mexican american legal defense and educational fund maldef won a victory in white v regester by arguing that reapportionment plans for the texas legislature disenfranchised african american and mexican american voters.
the supreme court upheld a lower court decision requiring certain counties to be redistricted.
through these and other cases litigation has proven to be an important tool for protecting the expansion of hi voting rights in the united states.
