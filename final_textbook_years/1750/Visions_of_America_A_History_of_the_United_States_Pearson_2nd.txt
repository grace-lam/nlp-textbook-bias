the adoption of the constitution did little to lessen the divisions in america that had arisen during ratification.
the federalist supporters of the constitution splintered into two opposing groups.
one side rallied around alexander hamilton who became the chief theorist and driving force for an ambitious federalist agenda.
for hamilton and his allies the adoption of the constitution was simply the first step in creating a powerful central government.
these federalists envisioned america as a great commercial empire that would inspired by britains lead develop a strong military and pursue economic development aggressively.
opposing this bold agenda was a group that coalesced around thomas jefferson who with his friend james madison a former ally of hamilton helped define the core of the republican opposition.
this movement although lacking the coherence and formal organization of a modern political party battled its federalist opponents over political economic and constitutional issues.
republicans sought to limit the powers of the new federal government and opposed the creation of a powerful financial and military state.
the radicalism of the french revolution further polarized american political life and political passions intensified during the turbulent 1790s.
federalists denounced the excesses of revolutionary france even as republicans affirmed their support for france.
by the end of the 1790s the partisan animosities had grown intense as reflected in this pro federalist political cartoon the times a political portrait.

in a close election power was peacefully transferred from the federalists to their opponents and jefferson became the nations third president.

the constitution created a system designed to check the dangers of factionalism.
leaders were expected to put the good of the nation above any factional interest.
fortunately for america the nations first president george washington was such a figure a leader who tried to remain above partisanship.
appointing alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson to his cabinet demonstrated his commitment to this ideal.
these were men whose views on government were almost at opposite extremes and from them washington sought policy alternatives to deal with the pressing issues facing the new nation.
choosing the first president 6 1 triumphal arch near trenton new jersey at trenton women erected a 20 foot 20 foot arch made of evergreens and laurels.
on the right washington w ashing ash ington ton rides rides toward the arch.
the constitution had created an electoral college a group of electors appointed by the states who had the responsibility of picking the president.
on february 4 1789 electors from all the states that had ratified the constitution met in their state capitals and unanimously selected george washington to be the nations first president.
john adams another prominent revolutionary leader received half that number of votes becoming the first vice president.
the remaining votes were split among ten other candidates.
the nation celebrated washingtons election in a grand style.
he traveled from his home at mount vernon in virginia to the site of his inaugural in new york city feted along the way.
many towns erected triumphal arches such as this one near trenton 6 1.
although leading men in the community typically greeted washington giving him a military salute in trenton he met the local women who had erected the arch and who serenaded him.
a placard on the arch proudly proclaimed that the defender of the mothers will also defend the daughters the first federal elections completing the constitution although there had been little doubt that washington would be americas first president the divisions why did madison shift his views on the need for a bill of rights.
between federalists and anti federalists influenced the first congressional elections.
the issue of constitutional amendments was among the most contentious issues debated in the first federal elections.
federalists were eager to have james madison run for congress.
madison agreed to run but he balked at actively campaigning for a seat believing that behaving in such a partisan fashion was inconsistent with republican ideals.
fortunately madisons supporters persuaded him that if he did not take his case directly to the people virginia would send an anti federalist dominated delegation to congress.
madison set aside his reluctance to appeal for votes and won election to congress.
one group critical to madisons success were the baptists who were eager to obtain explicit protection for freedom of religion in the constitution.
the task of shaping a set of amendments thus fell to federalist james madison.
madison recognized that if properly framed amendments might go a long way to eliminating lingering anti federalist suspicions of the new federal government.
thus although he had originally opposed anti federalist calls for amendments during the struggle over ratification madison now recognized their political necessity.
he accepted what he described as the nauseous project of amendments knowing that the process would be deeply politicized and that the few ardent anti federalists in congress would agitate for weakening the federal government.
still madison pared down the view the image george washingtons arrival in new york city 1789 launching the new government dozens of amendments proposed by the state ratification conventions to seventeen.
the senate then whittled these down to twelve provisions and sent them to the states to ratify.
the states did not adopt the first two proposed amendments which dealt with legislative apportionment and congressional salaries.
more than 200 years later the states finally adopted what became the twenty seventh amendment which prohibits raises for congress from taking effect until a new house of representatives has taken office a restraint that makes it more difficult for congress to vote itself frequent salary increases.
the first ten of the original twelve amendments to the constitution eventually became known as the bill of rights and included protections for both basic individual liberties and for the states.
the first amendment protected freedom of the press and religion.
the second amendment guaranteed that the people would have a right to keep and bear arms in a well regulated militia.
this right has since been expanded to include private arms used for individual self defense within the home.
the third amendment forbade the government to quarter troops in the homes of private citizens.
several amendments protected the procedural rights associated with jury trial.
the ninth amendment declared that enumeration of some rights did not mean the denial of others retained by the people.
finally lest the new government try to expand its powers by exploiting the vague clauses of the constitution the tenth amendment stated that those powers not delegated to the federal government were reserved to the states and the people.
these amendments assuaged the concerns of most moderate anti federalists even if they did not placate the most ardent opponents of federal power who wished to restrict the powers of the new central government to those expressly delegated by the text of the new constitution.
their adoption resolved the most important issue remaining from the struggle between federalists and anti federalists clearing the way for new issues to come to the fore.
filling out the branches of government the constitution created a blueprint for the new federal government but congress and the president still had to work out important details including the structure of the executive and the judiciary departments.
congress took almost six months to work out a structure for the new federal courts.
lingering fears about the power of the federal government complicated drafting legislation to set up the federal courts.
senator william maclay of pennsylvania warned for example that the federal courts would swallow all the state constitutions by degree eventually congress created a three tier system of district courts circuit courts and the supreme court.
each state would have at least one district court.
circuit courts composed of a district court judge and two members of the supreme court were supposed to ride circuit travel to hear appeals from the district courts and to have primary jurisdiction in certain types of cases such as those between citizens of different states.
for the executive branch congress created new cabinet positions for a secretary of state to advise the president on foreign affairs a secretary of the treasury for economic policy a secretary of war to oversee the army and an attorney general to be the chief legal advisor to government.
for his cabinet washington assembled an impressive group of leaders who had distinguished themselves in american public life.
henry knox the secretary of war was a leading general edmund randolph the new attorney general had introduced the virginia plan in the constitutional convention thomas jefferson the secretary of state had been the primary author of the declaration of independence and the first american minister to france the first secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton had been one of the co authors of the federalist along with john jay who became the first chief justice of the supreme court.
although none of these men had been anti federalists washingtons choices cut across a wide section of the political spectrum with hamilton representing the extreme nationalist position and jefferson far more sympathetic to state power.
during ratification anti federalists had expressed fear that the constitution would create a large expensive government with a vast bureaucracy.
in reality the federal government was far less imposing.
scattered among buildings near new york citys wall street the temporary home of the new government the government offices bore slight resemblance to the nightmare that anti federalists had predicted.
the scale of the new government was modest and its bureaucracy small about 350 officers.
jeffersons state department employed two clerks two assistants and a part time translator.
the modern state department employs 8 000 people in washington d c and 11 000 overseas.
the largest department was hamiltons treasury.
within a year of its creation it boasted nearly ten times the number of employees of the department of state.
its budget was more than triple the combined budgets of the state and war departments.
apart from his close relationship to washington his role as secretary of the treasury ensured that hamilton was a figure to be reckoned with in the new government.
why were some ardent anti federalists not satisfied with the madisons proposed amendments.
chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 hamiltons ambitious program in 1789 congress requested that secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton issue a report on the new nations economy.
between 1790 and 1791 hamilton responded with a series of reports each corresponding to a major part of his overall plan to bolster americas economy.
these included reports on public credit a national bank the establishment of a mint to coin money and manufactures.
hamilton saw a strong national government as a necessity to promote american prosperity and protect the young nations economic interests against foreign threats.
in his view the constitution had created a central government with considerable power over the economy.
in his reports he urged congress and the president to use this authority to encourage economic growth.
to accomplish this hamilton looked to britain as a model.
with a robust manufacturing and financial section and the powerful bank of england to energize its economy britain had the most diverse and sophisticated economy in europe.
hamiltons vision for the new republic alexander hamilton envisioned america as a powerful nation with a strong government and a vigorous commercial economy.
before he could implement his ambitious program to realize this vision however hamilton would have to overcome opponents at nearly every turn.
hamiltons bold program not only frightened former antifederalists but also alarmed strong supporters of the constitution notably james madison who did in place of that noble love of liberty and republican government which carried us triumphantly through the war a pro british monarchical aristocratical party has sprung up whose avowed object is to draw over us the substance as they have already done the forms of the british government thomas jefferson 1796 why did hamilton believe that america needed to create a national bank.
not wish to see the new government become a powerful state modeled on that of britain.
hamiltons economic vision also clashed with thomas jeffersons vision of a nation of small farmers.
the new opposition to federalist efforts to create a powerful centralized government who called themselves republicans united former anti federalists and those federalists who shared the concerns of madison and jefferson.
republicans believed that liberty could flourish only if the states remained powerful enough to protect their citizens from the new federal government.
the leader who conceived this audacious federalist agenda a vision that would transform america was a self made man who lacked the aristocratic upbringing of his chief opponents virginians jefferson and madison.
hamilton came from a modest background.
born in the west indies the illegitimate son of a scottish merchant and a planters daughter hamilton was orphaned at an early age but became an apprentice clerk in a merchant firm.
at age 14 he wrote my ambition is so prevalent that he loathed the grovling condition of a clerk or the like to which my fortune etc.
condemns me and would willingly risk my life tho not my character to exalt my station hamilton was talented ambitious and hard working.
the proprietor of the merchant firm recognized his talent and helped him finance his education.
hamilton attended kings college now columbia university in new york city.
during the american revolution he rose rapidly through the ranks of the continental army to become read the document alexander hamilton opposing visions for the new nation hamiltons ambitious program in almost all the questions great and small which have arisen since the first session of congress mr jefferson and mr madison have been found among those who are disposed to narrow the federal authority.
alexander hamilton 1792 washingtons personal aide.
marrying into a prominent new york family he became an important political figure in that state.
a successful lawyer he had many friends and allies within new yorks merchant community.
new york merchants commissioned this portrait 6 2 of alexander hamilton to honor his contribution to their prosperity.
it provides one measure of his power and influence particularly within the new nations financial world.
yet the painting is as notable for what the artist omitted as for what he included.
hamilton insisted that no references to his important political accomplishments be included something that commissioners of the portrait had requested.
realizing that his political life was controversial hamilton directed the artist to avoid such references.
rather than depicting the complex often contentious quality of his life the painting presents the image of a disinterested republican statesman and writer.
hamilton was an unabashed american nationalist and an elitist who viewed democracy with suspicion.
he believed that there would always be class divisions.
to survive and prosper the new nation had to win the allegiance of the rich and powerful binding their interests to those of the new federal government.
the assumption of state debts hamiltons report on public credit addressed the war debt of the states and the federal government.
the new nation and the states had incurred 6 2 alexander hamilton new york citys merchants commissioned a portrait of hamilton in 1792.
hamilton decided against having the painting represent his political career which was steeped in controversy he chose instead to have himself painted in a plain brown suit standing beside a table with an inkwell and quill.
considerable debt financing the american revolution.
this debt consisted of many different types of paper currency and securities that the confederation government and the individual states had issued.
the new nation owed 75 million a figure that alarmed some but not hamilton who saw the debt as a means of bringing america into the modern era in which debt was an essential tool of state finance.
how does hamiltons own life help explain his vision for americas future.
chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 hamilton proposed consolidating the debt of the individual states and the federal government.
his scheme called for the assumption of the state debts by which the federal government would fund any outstanding debts that the states owed.
creditors who held state paper would exchange it for a new type of paper that promised to pay interest until the bearer redeemed the original value of the note.
hamiltons second report on public credit focused on financing this scheme and included a plan for taxing whiskey.
he envisioned a permanently funded national debt in which income from taxes would service the interest allowing the federal government to pay its other expenses.
the most controversial feature of hamiltons plan dealt with the problem posed by speculation in these paper notes.
the value of state and would become a potential source of corruption.
republicans favored paying the full value of the debt to the original holders but not to the speculators.
the republicans would have given speculators a reasonable return on their investment but not a huge profit.
hamilton argued that this policy would violate the sanctity of contracts and undermine the credit of the new government.
eventually he defeated his opponents and state debt certificates would be exchanged for federal ones at full face value.
madisons opposition hamilton was shocked to find his former ally james madison leading the opposition to his policies.
during ratification madison had sided with hamilton and together with john jay wrote in an agricultural country like this therefore to erect and concentrate and perpetuate a large moneyed interest.
produce one or other of two evils the prostration of agriculture at the feet of commerce or a change in the present form of federal government fatal to the existence of american liberty virginias remonstrance against the assumption of state debts 16 december 1790 confederation issued paper had declined steadily by the 1790s as the hard pressed states and the fledgling national government simply printed more paper to pay their debts.
after the adoption of the constitution a few financial speculators had purchased large amounts of this devalued paper hoping that the new government would redeem it at face value and net them a huge profit.
believing it was vital for the new nation to maintain excellent credit with investors hamilton insisted that government had an obligation to honor the debt at full face value.
republicans feared that hamiltons funding scheme would give a windfall to speculators.
besides being unjust they argued such a plan would create a powerful financial interest that why did virginians including madison and jefferson oppose hamiltons economic program.
the federalist.
madison had also supported hamiltons efforts to create an effective treasury department under the articles of confederation.
why did madison change his position and oppose hamilton in 1789.
madison was motivated by his desire to preserve the constitutional system he had labored so hard to create.
the speculative frenzy caused by hamiltons policy of assumption shocked madison who came to believe that hamiltons program would undermine the republican values that the constitution was designed to protect.
although hamilton dreamed of a powerful state that might rival britain madison was more interested in preserving his constitutional vision.
in madisons view hamiltons system would create vast hamiltons ambitious program inequalities of wealth encourage corruption and undermine republican government.
hamilton believed that madison had been unduly influenced by jefferson indeed madison had always shared with his fellow virginian a similar republican vision of an agrarian republic.
hamilton by contrast the product of new yorks commercial ethos believed that americas future depended on creating a powerful fiscal military state.
the split between hamilton and madison reflected a profound shift in american political life.
a few years before madison had decried faction in federalist no.
now faced with the rise of hamiltons federalist agenda madison revised his thinking about factions and politics.
in an essay in the national gazette a candid state of parties he conceded that america had become divided into a republican party and an anti republican party the federalists.
opposition to his plan of assumption took a personal toll on hamilton.
indeed jefferson described him as somb er haggard and dejected beyond comparison jefferson invited hamilton to dinner with madison where the three worked out a deal to break the impasse over assumption.
in exchange for support for his economic program hamilton agreed to move the new capital of the united states from new york city to a site on the potomac river.
southerners such as jefferson and madison feared that keeping the nations capital in new york city invited domination by commercial and financial interests.
although hamilton might gain in the short run madison and jefferson believed that the bargain they struck would lessen the influence of financial interests over the government.
meanwhile the government temporarily relocated to philadelphia.
this cartoon 6 3 which shows congress embarked on the ship constitution as it sails to its eventual home on the potomac captures the republicans association of urban commercial centers with corruption.
the devil lures the ship to its clear doom on the rocky falls leading to philadelphia.
6 3 congress embarked on the ship constitution jefferson and madison hoped that by relocating the capital to the potomac they would reduce the dangers of federal corruption.
in this cartoon the devil lures congress to its temporary home in philadelphia.
what did madison and jefferson gain by moving the location of the new capital to what is now washington d c.
chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 the bank the mint and the report on manufactures in his report on a national bank hamilton recommended that the federal government charter a national bank.
the bank of the united states would serve as a depository for government funds bolster confidence in government securities make loans and provide the nation with a stable national currency.
the government would own part of the stock in the new bank but would allow private investors to buy the majority of stock.
at the time of his proposal there were only three private banks in the united states.
a national bank would help stabilize the economy of the new nation and link the interests of the wealthy to the prosperity of the new nation.
again madison opposed hamiltons plan.
much of the debate on this proposal focused on its constitutionality.
madison wanted to see the constitution interpreted according to the original understanding of the states that ratified it in 1788.
arguing for the narrow interpretation of congressional power he denied that the constitution authorized congress to charter a national bank.
ultimately however hamiltons ideas prevailed and the federalist controlled congress chartered the bank of the united states.
republicans then hoped for a presidential veto.
washington sought advice from his cabinet about the constitutionality of the bank.
attorney general edmund randolph and thomas jefferson both agreed with madison.
jefferson took advantage of the occasion to articulate his own views on how to interpret the new constitution.
he acknowledged that the constitution empowered congress to enact laws that were necessary and proper however although the creation of a bank was convenient and useful it was not in his view necessary for congress to fulfill its obligations to raise revenues.
this theory of strict construction approached the text of the constitution in an almost literal manner.
if the constitution did not grant a power then according to the theory of strict construction the tenth amendment reserved that power to the states and the people.
madison and jefferson designed their slightly different theories of constitutional interpretation to protect the rights of the people and the powers of the states against encroachment by the federal government.
with the weight of randolph madison and jeffersons opinions weighing heavily in favor of a veto hamilton set out to refute his critics and how did hamilton and jefferson differ in their interpretations of the phrase necessary and proper in the process frame his own alternative theory of how to interpret the constitution.
hamiltons theory of loose construction interpreted the language of the constitution broadly.
hamilton believed the federal government enjoyed enormous latitude in determining the appropriate means for accomplishing any legitimate constitutional end.
even if a specific power was not listed such as the power to charter a bank hamilton believed the constitution implied such a power.
hamilton argued that jeffersons reasoning would restrict the powers of congress to enact only those laws that were absolutely necessary and proper in response to madison and jeffersons suggestion of consulting the original intent of the state ratification conventions hamilton argued that the intention is to be sought in the instrument itself interpreters of the constitution should follow well established legal rules for understanding statutes and apply them to the constitution.
in other words the actual text of the constitution not the arguments of federalists anti federalists or state ratification conventions ought to be given primary consideration in constitutional interpretation.
the struggle over the proper way of interpreting the constitution had emerged as a major political battlefield in the new republic.
indeed the proper interpretation of the constitution is still controversial and arguments over its original meaning are as contentious today as they were more than 200 years ago.
as he would throughout his first term in office washington sided with hamilton against madison and jefferson.
the chartering of the bank of the united states was hamiltons second major victory in the struggle to define the character of the new republic.
hamiltons report on the necessity of a federal mint was the one part of his program that jefferson enthusiastically endorsed.
hamilton proposed a currency that would include a variety of coins in different denominations emblazoned with patriotic symbols.
jefferson not only recognized the need for a federal currency but as a part time inventor he was also fascinated by the mechanics of minting money.
hamiltons report on manufactures detailed the remaining part of his plan to reshape the american economy.
he called for a comprehensive program to encourage domestic industry by providing incentives for industrial development and tariffs to help american industry compete against imported foreign goods which were cheaper.
congress refused hamiltons ambitious program 6 4 political views hamilton versus jefferson hamilton jefferson commercial republic agrarian republic broad construction strict construction standing army militia pro british pro french to follow hamiltons recommendation to raise these tariffs sharply.
hamiltons more grandiose scheme to encourage industrial development generated little interest in congress.
congress did enact new taxes including one on whiskey.
in the struggle to shape the new nations economy hamiltons federalists had defeated jefferson madison and the republican opposition at nearly every turn.
hamilton was largely successful at implementing his visionary economic program.
jefferson and hamilton contrasting visions of the republic jefferson and hamilton were a study in contrasts.
their backgrounds varied greatly jefferson was a southern slave owner hamilton a northerner with abolitionist sympathies.
jefferson grew up a virginia aristocrat with every advantage hamilton was a self made man who confessed that he was determined to escape his humble origins at almost any cost.
over several of the most important issues facing the new american nation the two men found themselves in separate camps as summarized in the table 6 4.
in general hamilton sought to endow the national government with additional powers jefferson sought to limit the powers of the federal government and protect state authority.
the two men also approached the economy from radically different philosophies.
hamiltons idea of a thriving commercial republic was diametrically opposed to jeffersons vision of a nation of independent yeoman farmers.
while we have land to labour jefferson wrote let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a work bench hamilton believed that america needed to emulate the powerful diversified economy of britain and foster commerce and manufacture.
a gulf separated the two men over constitutional law as well.
hamilton believed in a broad or loose construction of the constitution the federal government had to have wide latitude to choose whatever means was best suited to accomplish its legitimate objects.
jefferson by contrast believed in a strict construction of the constitution so that the powers of the new government would be limited to those clearly established by the constitution.
in foreign affairs the two men also opposed one another.
hamilton was an anglophile who believed that britains path to economic power ought to guide america.
jefferson savored all things french from wine to pastry.
he thought americas interests were better served by supporting france.
read the document thomas jefferson notes on virginia what were the most important points of disagreement between hamilton and jefferson.
chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 partisanship without parties the idea of political parties was inimical to the republican values of the post revolutionary era.
in the struggle over ratification in 1788 madison had written in federalist no.
10 that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties the partisan struggles that dominated american politics after ratification forced madison to rethink his view of parties.
in 1792 madison conceded that in every political society parties are unavoidable although americans increasingly used terms like party to describe the bitter conflicts of the 1790s the partisan alignments they described had not yet achieved the organized structure of modern political parties.
political conflict in the 1790s was a transitional phase in the evolution of a modern two party system.
some historians describe this period as that of the first party system but many characterize it as a proto party system that set the stage for the later developments of modern parties.
indeed although americans were deeply divided politically neither federalists nor republicans functioned as disciplined modern political parties.
neither group organized loyal supporters around well defined messages at a national level.
nor did either side create permanent political structures that brought local and state politics under the umbrella of a coherent national organization.
the partisan conflicts of this era produced two proto parties the federalists and the republicans.
a new type of politician although the aristocratic thomas jefferson and james madison dominated the republican movement its success owed much to a new type of politician whose expertise lay in mobilizing voters and creating effective political organizations.
the most influential of these new politicians was virginias john beckley.
in contrast to jefferson and madison who were connected to the gentry elite that dominated political life in virginia beckley rose from the status of an indentured servant to become the clerk of the u s house of representatives.
he became indispensable in advancing the republican cause.
indeed although aristocratic politicians such as jefferson and madison continued to view themselves as members of a virtuous elite who were not motivated by party spite beckley and others of this new class of professional politicians immersed themselves in the sometimes sordid task of coordinating campaigns and attacking their opponents.
beckley and other republicans who did much of the grassroots organizing were more at home in taverns and coffee houses than they were in the elegant dinner parties that jefferson and madison attended.
having worked as a clerk beckley felt a kindred spirit with the artisans and merchants of new york what role did the partisan press play in the politics of the 1790s.
city and philadelphia.
he felt a particular kinship with other self made men many of whom joined the republican movement.
beckleys life more closely resembled hamiltons than jeffersons.
yet beckley threw himself into promoting jeffersons fortunes and attacking hamilton.
gossip became one means of political warfare that beckley developed to a fine art.
he leaked information about an adulterous affair hamilton was having with the wife of a shady financier.
when the press reported rumors that hamilton had provided sensitive financial information to his lovers husband republican politicians pounced on hamilton who was forced to admit the affair but denied any financial improprieties.
beckleys efforts weakened hamilton but did not destroy the new yorkers influence among federalists.
the growth of the partisan press the expansion of the press facilitated the rise of partisan politics.
the number of newspapers increased from around 100 in 1788 to well over 200 in 1800.
while eastern ports still supported the majority of papers many interior market towns also boasted papers by the 1790s.
many of these papers aligned partisanship without parties themselves with one or the other main political movements in the country.
john fennos gazette of the united states which he established to endear the general government to the people articulated the federalist point of view.
to combat fennos influence jefferson and madison persuaded the poet philip freneau to found the national gazette which rallied opposition to hamilton and the federalists.
the resulting battle of words between the two publications intensified the already charged political atmosphere.
federalists and republicans recognized that political success meant managing public opinion.
all power madison noted has been traced to public opinion a free government therefore calls for a circulation of newspapers through the entire body of the people partisan rancor in the press grew during the 1790s.
no person was sharper in his attacks than federalist william cobbett who often wrote under the pen name peter porcupine a choice that reflected his prickly personality and barbed writing.
jefferson lamented that a single sentence got hold of by the porcupines will suffice to abuse and persecute me in their papers for months cobbett lambasted the republicans as atheists and radical democrats who sought to destroy government.
he compared the leading republican newspaper the aurora to a lewd and common strumpet whose illegitimate offspring were falsehood and slander.
the republicans replied with their own stinging attacks.
this republican political cartoon 6 5 casts cobbett literally represented as peter porcupine doing the devils work as he is encouraged by great britain represented as a lion.
society asserted that public opinion is the foundation of all our liberties and constitutes the only solid groundwork for all our rights in addition to publishing their sentiments about political issues the societies staged celebrations gave festive dinners and sponsored public orations.
republicans viewed the societies as a way to improve understanding of political issues and refine public opinion.
federalists denounced these self created societies for sowing the seeds of jealousy and distrust of the government for federalists the societies not only sapped the peoples confidence in their government but also fomented radical ideas.
federalists viewed the role of elected representatives differently from republicans.
federalists supported a more traditional republican ideal of virtue in which citizens deferred to the wisdom of their leaders once they had been placed in office.
republicans embraced a more democratic ideal in which the voice of the people could be brought to bear on public questions through organizations such as the democratic republican societies.

the democraticrepublican societies the emergence of a new type of political organization helped transform the political life of the new nation.
between 1793 and 1794 35 democratic republican societies sprouted up across america.
although not official organs of the republican movement most of the societies had close ties to local republican organizations.
their goal was to influence public opinion.

chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 conflicts at home and abroad the french revolution the bloody toppling of the monarchy followed by the rise of a radical republican government shocked europe and profoundly affected american politics.
republicans supported the revolution.
federalists quickly came to see it as the embodiment of evil and denounced its excesses.
revolutionary france soon became embroiled in conflict with britain and the two nations went to war with one another in 1793.
although republicans and federalists continued to support washington the contest over the vice presidency in 1792 demonstrated how divided america had become.
federalist john adams defeated his republican rival the former anti federalist george clinton but the republicans carried the entire south.
the line separating foreign affairs and domestic matters in the new republic was often thin.
america still needed to secure its borders against potentially hostile european powers.
the british continued to occupy forts in the old northwest the modern states of ohio indiana and michigan and engaged in trade with indians including the sale of firearms.
the spanish presence in florida and louisiana gave them control of the mississippi a vital artery for western trade.
american shipping no longer enjoyed the protection of the british navy.
in the mediterranean pirates based in north africa harassed american ships and captured american sailors and cargoes.
resistance to hamiltons economic program erupted into violence in western pennsylvania and kentucky.
angry over the tax on whiskey farmers turned to violence to vent their frustration.
washington felt compelled to call out the militia to quell the rebellion.
the new federal government had survived its most serious test but the repression of the rebellion did little to heal the divisions in american political life.

mankind republican james madison added that events in france were so glorious to this country because it has grown as it were out of the american revolution pro french republicans began addressing each other as citizen a custom borrowed from revolutionary france.

when the french revolution turned more radical and violent however many americans began to re examine their support for it.
the execution of king louis xvi and queen marie antoinette in 1793 outraged federalists.
this commemorative plate 6 6 showing the execution of the king captures the zeal of the french the french revolution in america in 1789 a financial crisis in france precipitated a revolution that transformed a powerful european monarchy into a republic.

the hand painted plate prominently features the guillotine a new device for executions developed in revolutionary france that used a heavy blade to decapitate its victims.
the executioner proudly displays the kings lifeless head as a trophy a chilling reminder of the french revolutions radicalism.
the french revolution became a symbol for both republicans and federalists.
the former championed the democratic ideals of the revolution and excused its violence as a small price to pay for liberty.
the latter decried its violence and radicalism.

philadelphias republican women turned out in red white and blue to welcome him.
although republican men wore the tricolor red white and blue cockade a small rosette like decoration on their hats women attached tricolor pins to their chests to affirm support for france.

federalists not only opposed the french revolution but events in france intensified their desire to align america with britain.
when revolutionary france declared war on britain in 1793 americans found themselves reluctantly drawn into european affairs.
attitudes toward france became a political lightning rod concentrating and focusing political feelings for both republicans and federalists.
the french revolution came to symbolize many of the hopes and fears of americans struggling to come to terms with their own revolutionary heritage.
republicans defined the revolution by its ideals of liberty equality and fraternity federalists focused on the revolutions bloody policies and saw it as confirmation of the danger of taking liberty and equality too far.
adams versus clinton a contest for vice president by 1792 washington feared that partisan conflict might tear apart the political fabric of the nation.
although hamilton and jeffersons mutual antagonism had hardened both men agreed that washington was the one figure who could rise above partisan squabbles and unite the nation.
hamilton implored washington to make a further sacrifice of your tranquility and happiness to the public good although republicans did not wish to challenge washington directly they decided to run the popular former anti federalist governor of new york george clinton against john adams for vice president.
republican newspapers praised washington but charged that adams was an avowed supporter of monarchy and aristocracy.
invoking recent events in france one radical newspaper editor even suggested that the time had arrived in america to lop off every unfruitful branch and root out of the soil of freedom all of the noxious weeds of aristocracy although adams defeated clinton by a comfortable margin the sectional character of politics was evident in the electoral college.
clinton carried the entire south the most solidly republican region.
diplomatic controversies and triumphs the new american nation had many diplomatic challenges some arising from the french revolution but others stemming from unresolved issues with britain.
american ships no longer enjoyed the protection of the british navy.
closer to home the british retained control of their forts in the northwest defying the treaty of paris 1783 which required them to relinquish them.
spains control of the mississippi river and new orleans both of which were vital to the prosperity of the old southwest modern kentucky tennessee alabama and mississippi was another concern 6 7.
war between france and britain opened opportunities for american merchants who traded with both sides.
although britain remained americas chief trading partner trade with france was increasingly important.
britain hoped to use its naval advantage to cut off trade between france and other nations including america.
the british navy impounded more than 250 ships and cargoes of american merchants who violated the british blockade against france.
angry republicans proposed an embargo on trade with the british.
federalists however argued that american economic wellbeing depended on good relations with britain not with france.

in 1783 jay had helped negotiate the treaty of paris ending conflict between america and britain.
now in 1794 he negotiated a treaty called jays treaty by which britain agreed to compensate america for cargoes seized in 1793 1794 and to vacate forts in the northwest territory.
however the british refused to accept the right of neutral nations to trade freely with belligerents.
when the details of jays treaty were leaked to the press republicans were outraged finding the treaty too generous to the british.
across the mid atlantic and south where republican sympathies were strongest protesters burned effigies of jay and copies of the treaty.
the treaty also provoked a fierce debate in congress over the role of the house of representatives in foreign affairs.
republican congressmen demanded to see jays negotiating instructions believing that federalists had never intended to exact major concessions from the british.
the house how did french ideas influence american political culture.
spanish even threatened to withhold funding to implement the treaty until the instructions were published.
federalists denounced this as an unconstitutional intrusion on the treaty making powers of the president and the senate.
jay had negotiated with britain from a position of weakness but the american envoy charged with obtaining concessions from spain was in a stronger position.
the u s minister to britain federalist thomas pinckney traveled to spain to begin negotiations about american access to the mississippi and new orleans.
the result was pinckneys treaty 1795 which secured americas right to navigate the mississippi river and use new orleans.
it also settled the boundary between america and spanish florida.
spain had feared that america might try to acquire florida and louisiana by force so it was more than willing to cede favorable terms over trade and negotiate the boundary dispute between the two nations.

the radical turn of the revolution however particularly its zealous embrace of violence caused hamilton and other federalists to abandon their support.
despite the increasingly bloody turn of events in france jefferson retained his faith in the essential justice of the revolutions goals.
he believed that the revolutions accomplishments the destruction of the old regime and of the institutions of aristocracy and monarchy were worth the cost in blood.
federalists not only denounced france but they took great pains to contrast anglo american concepts of ordered liberty with the licentiousness of the french revolution.
for jefferson the revolutions contribution to the destruction of tyranny justified whatever means were necessary to accomplish its worthy ends.
he compared the innocent victims of revolutionary justice to the casualties of war.

thomas jefferson to william short philadelphia jan 3.
1793 in the early periods of the french revolution a warm zeal for its success was in this country a sentiment truly universal.
the love of liberty is here the ruling passion of the citizens of the united states pervading every class animating every bosom.
as long therefore as the revolution of france bore the marks of being the cause of liberty it united all hearts and centered all opinions.
but this unanimity of approbation has been for a considerable time decreasing.
the excesses which have constantly multiplied with greater and greater aggravations have successively though slowly detached reflecting men from their partiality for an object which has appeared less and less to merit their regard.
dear sir the tone of your letters had for some time given me pain on account of the extreme warmth with which they censured the proceedings of the jacobins of france.
in the struggle which was necessary many guilty persons fell without the forms of trial and with them some innocent.
these i deplore as much as any body and shall deplore some of them to the day of my death.
but i deplore them as i should have done had they fallen in battle.
it was necessary to use the arm of the people a machine not quite so blind as balls and bombs but blind to a certain degree.
a few of their cordial friends met at their hands the fate of enemies.
but time and truth will rescue and embalm their memories while their posterity will be enjoying that very liberty for which they would never have hesitated to offer up their lives.
the liberty of the whole earth was depending on the issue of the contest and was ever such a prize won with so little innocent blood.
my own affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrs to this cause but rather than it should have failed i would have seen half the earth desolated and an adam and an eve left in every country and left free alexander hamilton unpublished thoughts on the french revolution philadelphia 1794 the tricolor french flag was adopted after the french revolution and became the official flag of the new french republic in 1794.

chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 dealing with the indian nations that occupied much of this land.
the government also faced resentments from farmers over federal taxation of locally distilled whiskey.
settlers streamed into western territories invariably resulting in conflicts with the indigenous populations.
in the old northwest the shawnee delaware and miami confederated to defend their lands against settlers incursions.
in 1790 little turtle a war chief of the miami led a pan indian force of twelve different tribes that defeated an american army led by general josiah harmar in ohio.
a year later indians in ohio dealt an even more crushing blow to an army led by general arthur st clair.
more than 900 american soldiers were killed or wounded and st clair barely escaped with his life.
these demoralizing defeats prompted a reorganization of the war department.
in 1794 a new more professional army under general anthony wayne decisively defeated ohios indian tribes at the battle of fallen timbers.
in 1795 the treaty of greenville stipulated that the twelve ohio tribes relinquish their claims on most of ohio.
in indian cultures the signing of treaties was a ceremonial occasion in which certain rituals were observed including the exchange of gifts.
indians gave this wampum belt 6 8 an important ceremonial item to american negotiators at the treaty of greenville ceremony.
chippewa chief mash i pi nash i wish explained the meaning of this gift when i show you this belt i point out to you your children at one end of it and mine at the other.
remember we have taken the great spirit to witness our present actions we will make a new world and leave nothing on it to incommode our children wayne and the other american negotiators however did not understand the gift of wampum in the same way as the chippewa did.
for americans indians had joined the american family as dependents not equals.
the most serious test of the new republics ability to govern came in 1794 when anger over hamiltons economic policies turned violent.
resentment against the hated whiskey tax had festered since its enactment in 1791.
the whiskey rebellion erupted when farmers from pennsylvania and kentucky took up arms to protest the whiskey excise tax.
distilling had long been important economically in western pennsylvania and kentucky where farmers distilled grain into whiskey.
farmers could transport the alcohol more cheaply than the bulky and heavy grains from which it was produced.
whiskey also 6 8 wampum belt beads usually made from seashells were strung together in a wampum belt.
this belt given during the treaty of greenville ceremony symbolized the indian belief that they would now join with the united states in one great family.
the american negotiators interpreted the gift as a sign of indian submission.
how did american and indian views of the treaty of greenville differ.

protest against the whiskey tax began peacefully.
opponents of federalist policy sought repeal of the law and attacked it in the local press.
as anger intensified angry farmers drew on the rich traditions of protest that americans had used during the revolution such as the one depicted in this contemporary cartoon 6 9.
the scene shows angry tax protesters who have executed and burned in effigy a local tax collector.
by july 1794 frustration turned violent.
five hundred western pennsylvania farmers many armed with muskets marched on the home of a tax collector john neville to intimidate him.
two protestors were killed in the attack and nevilles house was burned to the ground.
two weeks later 6 000 armed men threatened to attack pittsburgh if the government did not repeal the tax.
federalists and republicans differed over the causes of the rebellion and how to respond to it.
federalists blamed the democratic republican societies for fomenting discord and favored a swift and decisive military response.
republicans faulted hamiltons economic program and counseled moderation and patience.

chapter 6 the new republic an age of political passion 1789 1800 choices and consequences washingtons decision to crush the whiskey rebellion the armed resistance of western farmers to the detested whiskey tax posed a serious dilemma for washington.
should the president negotiate with the rebels or use force to put down the rebellion.
washingtons cabinet members differed over the best course of action.
the whiskey rebellion tested the new government created by the constitution.
the situation was complicated by uncertainty over the militia.
even if washington wished to use it it was not clear if the militia would respond.
during shayss rebellion chapter 5 the militia had refused to fire on other citizens and sided with the rebels.
washington had to consider this issue and the larger question of how the new government ought to respond to a direct challenge to its authority.
washington had three choices choices call up the militia and dispatch them to western pennsylvania and crush the rebellion swiftly.
adopt a conciliatory posture make concessions to the rebels including repealing the tax and thereby avoid an armed response.
offer the rebels a chance to end their protest mobilize the militia and have it ready to march if the offer was rejected.
decision republican leaders outside the administration had hoped washington would adopt a conciliatory posture and recognize that since an unjust tax was the root of the problem it would make sense to accede to the rebels demands.
hamilton and other federalists counseled a decisive show of force.
washington opted instead for the third choice.
after efforts to peacefully persuade the rebels to stand down failed he acted decisively to put down the rebellion.
concerns that the militias of neighboring states might side with the rebels proved unfounded.
the rebels were no match for the militia and the rebellion fizzled once troops marched westward.
consequences washingtons decision to put down the rebellion ended it in western pennsylvania.
in other parts of the nation however such as kentucky where support for tax resistance was more pervasive resistance proved effective.
in kentucky few citizens were willing to act as tax collectors and juries were unlikely to convict people who refused to pay the taxes.
one consequence of the rebellion was the undermining of the authority of the democratic republican societies who were blamed for stirring up opposition to the government and fanning the resentments of the whiskey rebels.
continuing controversies why were some federalists reluctant to use force to put down the whiskey rebellion.
washingtons decision to use force has prompted controversy.
supporters of his actions argue that he wisely sought to demonstrate that armed resistance to government authority was not an affirmation of liberty but threatened to undermine liberty and the rule of law.
detractors of washingtons actions argue that pennsylvanias own government felt that it was unnecessary to mobilize the militia and that a peaceful resolution to the crisis was possible.
washington reviews the militia why did federalist enforcement of the whiskey tax fail in kentucky.
cultural politics in a passionate age cultural politics in a passionate age politics seeped into every aspect of popular culture after the adoption of the constitution.
even fashion became a political battleground so much so that sporting the wrong color badge could lead to violence.
the bitter political disputes of the day were also woven into the fabric of a new literary art form the novel.
novels were particularly important to women who were among the main readers of novels.
in a few exceptional cases women even became successful authors of novels.
the way the nation confronted race and slavery were influenced by the political conflicts of the era.
the slave uprising in the french caribbean colony of saint domingue modern haiti focused renewed attention on abolitionism and slavery.
political fashions and fashionable politics nearly every aspect of american culture was swept up in the political passions of the age.
in the politically charged 1790s political debates spilled over into the new nations streets and town squares.
ordinary citizens read newspapers or attended political meetings to keep abreast of the latest developments.
they also used taverns to host political meetings where federalists and their republican opponents toasted everything from the militia to the french revolution.
even the simple act of hoisting a glass of ale could become a political gesture particularly when the press reported the accompanying toasts.
citizens marched in parades and even rioted to express their frustrations with political developments.
even fashion was swept up into the political conflicts.
americans signaled their political allegiances and foreign policy preferences by adopting the latest paris or london styles.
republican supporters of the french revolution adorned their hats with a tricolor cockade.
federalists favored a black cockade a decoration soldiers had used during the american revolution.
by the end of the decade sporting the wrong type of ornament on ones hat in the streets of philadelphia could easily trigger a riot.
literature education and gender by the 1790s americans could choose from a staggering range of printed materials.
in addition to the expansion of newspapers books magazines broadsides and pamphlets proliferated.
the market for books increased dramatically in the 30 years between view the image ladys magazine the american revolution and 1800.
the number of booksellers in boston new york philadelphia and charleston almost quadrupled in that time.
in the 1790s 266 new lending libraries opened across america.
the new libraries were not restricted to prosperous coastal cities but as one contemporary noted in our inland towns of consequence social libraries have been instituted composed of books designed to amuse rather than to instruct although the cost of books may have been beyond those of modest means a subscription to one of these libraries was often not.
americans could also turn to magazines for education and amusement.
the titles of new magazines suggested an effort to appeal to both men and women.
for example the gentlemen and ladies town and country magazine began publishing in 1789.
the ladys magazine and repository of entertaining knowledge founded in 1791 in philadelphia targeted the growing audience of female readers.
the rise of a new literary form the novel in eighteenth century england and france helped to spur the enormous expansion in americas publishing industry.
some novelists wove political themes prominently into their tales.
americans eagerly consumed imported novels and new works written by american authors also appeared.
women became an important audience for the novel they also wrote many of the most successful early novels.
susanna rowsons charlotte temple first published in england 1791 was reprinted in america in 1794 where the first edition quickly sold out.
the storys american setting made it particularly popular in the new republic.
the moral of the novel was unmistakable.
the heroine charlotte temple foolishly leaves england for america where she elopes with a knave who reneges on his promise to marry her.
how did fashion become politicized in the 1790s.

immigrating to america in 1793 rowson fared much better than charlotte.
after a brief career as an actress rowson established the young ladies academy in boston 1797.
her curriculum included reading writing arithmetic and needlework.
another female author judith sargent murray became an outspoken advocate of equality and education for women.
her essay on the equality of the sexes published in the massachusetts magazine in 1790 under the pen name constantia argued that womens intellectual abilities were equal to those of men and that if properly educated women could equal men in accomplishment.
murray also used the novel to spread her ideals about the equality of the sexes.
her novel the story of margaretta 1798 recast the conventions of sentimental novels such as charlotte temple to reflect her views of female education.
rather than fall prey to seduction abandonment and ruin a fate typical of many female characters in popular novels margaretta uses her intelligence and superior education to avoid these perils.
murray helped found the dorchester ladies academy in massachusetts.
a 15 year old student at the academy maria crowninshield produced this allegory of female education 6 10.
although at one level this fine needlework conformed to the traditional ideas of female education which included sewing skills the subject matter signals the artists commitment to a modern expansive conception of female education.
the young girl depicted is reading a copy of english author hannah moores strictures on the modern system of female education 1799.
moores book which advocated an expansion of educational opportunities for women was one of many tracts defending womens education.
the most radical voice demanding changes in womens roles was mary wollstonecraft an english writer whose a vindication of the rights of women 1792 sparked a lively debate on both sides of the atlantic in the 1790s about the need for equality of education for men and women.
federalists republicans and the politics of race the political passions and divisions of the age also extended to the politics of race.
this became a major concern as a result of events in the caribbean where slaves in saint domingue modern haiti rose up against their french masters and seized control of the colony in 1791.
federalists and republicans were divided over how to respond to events there.
toussaint louverture a former slave forged an all black fighting force that routed the planters.
america was forced to decide between supporting this slave revolution and siding with france which sought to repress it.
at first the washington administration supported the ruling white elite but as louvertures forces solidified their hold over saint domingue the american government accepted the need to establish stable relations with the new government.
indeed as relations with france worsened many federalists began to urge washington to strengthen relations with saintdomingue hoping to renew the lucrative trade with the former french colony.
however whereas federalists supported recognition of saintdomingue republicans in congress opposed it.
how is virtue represented in maria crowninshields allegory of female education.
read the document james wilson on womans legal disabilities in james wilson an introductory lecture to a course of law lectures 1791 cultural politics in a passionate age their opposition was motivated in part by their loyalty to france which was eager to recapture the colony but also reflected the partys commitment to protecting slavery.
republicans feared that american slaves might emulate their oppressed brethren in the caribbean.
saint domingue conjured up a nightmare for slave owners such as the depiction of bloodletting during the revolution produced by a german engraver 6 11.
although fears of slave insurrection were most keen in the south northern republicans also voiced concerns.
congressman albert gallatin of pennsylvania warned that supporters of louvertures ideas might spread their views among the negro people there in america and excite dangerous insurrections among them even among those most opposed to slavery few were willing to support racial equality.
racist attitudes were found among ardent supporters of abolitionism.

the library company directors asked jennings to include the goddess of liberty along with symbols of painting architecture mechanics astronomy including a broken chain at the feet of the goddess a symbol of the paintings abolitionist sentiments.
although jennings added his own ideas he followed the directors suggestions.
the painting reflected the influence of the classical world including copies of the writings of homer and virgil two of its greatest authors but the goddess of liberty holds a liberty pole topped by a liberty cap.
jennings did not slight the intellectual and cultural achievements of the modern world.
he used books by john milton and shakespeare to represent modern literary achievements at least of the english speaking world.
a telescope symbol of the advancement of science appears in the lower righthand corner.
finally as instructed by his patrons jennings included the goddess of liberty with a liberty pole and cap two symbols linked with the american revolution.
jennings included a group of negroes who are paying homage to liberty for the boundless blessings they receive through her cast in the subservient pose of bowing to liberty the african americans do not appear as masters of their own destinies.

the stormy presidency of john adams the stormy presidency of john adams george washington did not seek a third term a decision that set a precedent for subsequent presidents.
the unofficial two term limit that washington established bound presidents until 1940 when franklin delano roosevelt won a third term.
in the election of 1796 the federalist congressional caucus selected john adams and thomas pinckney as candidates while republicans put forward thomas jefferson and aaron burr.
party discipline however was lax.
when the electoral college met and voted for president and vice president 52 of the 136 electors voted for men not selected by either the federalist or republican congressional caucuses.
adams won the most votes and became president and jefferson polled the next most votes and became vice president.
although adams defeated jefferson the bitter electoral contest intensified the partisan divisions within america.
conflict in europe only exacerbated these tensions.
events in europe threatened to drag america into war.
fearful that america was threatened from abroad and concerned that domestic radicals were undermining american interests federalists passed repressive measures that prompted republicans to intensify their opposition to federalist power and rally around their leader thomas jefferson.
in 1800 jefferson again faced adams in a presidential election.
this time jefferson won but the election resulted in a tie between jefferson and his vice presidential running mate aaron burr.
the constitution provided that under these circumstances the house of representative would determine the outcome.
after a flurry of politicking federalists agreed to select jefferson who became president.
in richmond virginia the debate over liberty inspired a slave named gabriel to lead a rebellion to liberate virginias slaves.
although the rebellion failed it highlighted the inescapable conflict between american ideals of liberty and the realities of racial slavery.
washingtons farewell address washington never wavered in his belief that he acted above party but by the middle of his second term in office he had adopted most of hamiltons federalist agenda which prompted the most outspoken republican editors to attack washington.
rather than respond to these attacks directly washington used his farewell address a written statement widely printed in newspapers across the nation in september 1796 to reiterate his political ideals.
in his farewell address washington attacked the growing factionalism partisanship and regional tensions in american politics.
he warned the nation in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally recognizing that foreign policy disputes had been particularly divisive he advised that america steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world washington was not counseling strict isolation but rather suggesting that america enter only into temporary alliances that served its interests.
above all he wished to see america pursue a policy free of irrational hatreds or allegiances to foreign nations.
the address sought to fuse idealism and realism into a workable approach to foreign policy.
in this famous portrait of washington done at the end of his presidency 1796 gilbert stuart created a painting filled with symbolism that captured the central role of washingtons presidency in launching the new nation 6 12.
when the painting was first displayed publicly the announcement noted that washington was surrounded with allegorical emblems of his public life in the service of his country read the document george washingtons farewell address what advice did washington offer in his farewell address.

although stuarts portrait suggested that the nation had weathered its worst storms the period after washingtons retirement from politics was even more contentious.
the election of 1796 was closely fought and bitterly divisive.
john adams defeated thomas jefferson by only three electoral votes.
intrigue had marred the election.
alexander hamilton sought to undermine adamss candidacy by backing thomas pinckney who was running with adams.
when adams learned of hamiltons plan he arranged to have his supporters in new england divert votes from pinckney.
the constitution did not anticipate the rise of parties nor did it envision the idea of presidential tickets with a designated candidate for president and vice president running together.
the founders system was simpler the president was the candidate with the most votes and the vice president was the runner up.
in accordance with republican theory this system would ensure that the executive contained the two men best qualified to lead the nation.
when federalist plots diverted votes from pinckney jefferson received the second most votes and hence became the new vice president.
the most obvious pattern in the election 6 12 portrait of president george washington gilbert stuarts painting included allegorical elements.

the american envoys respond we will not give you six pence years from 1798 to 1800.
in addition to creating a new department of the navy congress tripled the size of the regular army and created a special provisional army numbering 50 000 men.
washington reluctantly agreed to head the provisional army if hamilton were appointed his second in command a request that would have given hamilton authority over many military leaders more experienced than he.
hamiltons bold effort to elevate himself above so many other qualified officers angered many federalists who aligned themselves with adams.
federalists were now divided into adams and hamilton factions.
why did the federalists believe it was vital to american security to restrict immigration.
the alien and sedition acts federalists enacted a broad program to deal with the threats posed by the quasi war.
to pay for the enormous expansion of the military the federalistcontrolled congress passed a new property tax on land slaves and buildings.
federalists in congress then proposed laws the alien and sedition acts to protect america from foreign and domestic subversion.
the alien acts which included three separate laws made it more difficult to become a citizen and gave the government far reaching powers to read the document the alien and sedition acts the stormy presidency of john adams deport resident aliens.
the sedition act made it a crime to combine or conspire together with the intent to oppose any measure or measures of the government of the united states the act criminalized any attempt to write print utter or publish statements false scandalous or malicious against the government of the united states or either house of congress of the united states or the president conspicuously absent were penalties for attacking republican vice president thomas jefferson.
the federalist press was free to hurl whatever invectives it chose at jefferson with impunity.
federalists used the sedition act to prosecute 25 people all republican sympathizers including printers outspoken politicians and other prominent figures.
federalists even prosecuted one drunken republican for declaring that he did not care if a cannon salute to president adams fired thro his a the harshest sentence a 400 fine and an 18 month prison sentence went to david brown an itinerant preacher and political agitator who had raised a liberty pole in dedham massachusetts with a placard that read no stamp act no sedition no alien bills no land tax downfall to the tyrants of america peace and retirement to the president long live the vice president republicans had tried to use every constitutional means at their disposal to protest the sedition act.
they first sought to petition congress to repeal it and then tried to use the courts to challenge its constitutionality.
when both of these means failed republicans cast about for a new strategy.
in 1798 madison and jefferson articulated such a strategy in two separate documents the virginia resolution by madison and the kentucky resolution by jefferson both documents defended the rights of the states to judge the constitutionality of federal laws and if necessary to protect their citizens against the federal government.
republicans based this idea on the notion that the constitution was a compact among the people of the states who not only retained all powers not delegated to the new government but also retained a right to judge when acts of the federal government violated the constitution.
neither madison nor jefferson took the next logical step and asserted a right of the states to actively nullify an unconstitutional act of the federal government.
both men hoped that the states would use persuasion not force to challenge an unconstitutional exercise of federal power.
in keeping with this notion virginia and kentucky distributed their resolutions to the other state legislatures hoping that other states would also rally against the sedition act.
however legislatures in the federalist dominated new england states attacked the resolutions as dangerous and unconstitutional assertions of state power.
federalists argued that the final arbiter of the constitutionality of acts of congress ought to be the federal courts not the state legislatures.
angered by the northern federalist legislatures reactions jefferson authored a second set of kentucky resolutions 1799.
in these he introduced the constitutional doctrine of nullification which asserted that states could nullify unconstitutional laws.
jefferson did not explain how a state would accomplish the goal of constitutional nullification.
the virginia and kentucky resolutions became the foundation for subsequent arguments about states rights the theory that the constitution was a compact among the states and that the individual states retained the right to judge when the federal governments actions were unconstitutional.
the alien and sedition crisis also led to the development of a new theory of freedom of the press.
this new theory the basis for modern theories of freedom of the press argued that political opinions were not subject to government control.
rather than try to limit dissenting ideas the new view embraced the idea of a marketplace of ideas.
more speech not less was the antidote to the threat posed by dangerous ideas.
the disputed election of 1800 the quasi war with france which was winding down by 1800 had split federalists into two factions.
although adams supported a military build up he never abandoned hope of a negotiated settlement.
hamilton by contrast believed that war with france provided an opportunity to crush domestic opposition and forge an alliance with britain.
adams had little interest in such grandiose schemes which may have included vague plans for a joint anglo american conquest of spanish america.
the president also resented hamiltons meddling in his administration.
changes in the french government now made a peaceful solution likely.
the radical phase of the french revolution ended when napoleon view the closer look competing visions congressional debates over the sedition act what strategies were used to challenge the sedition act.

eager to gain u s support for his military campaigns against spain and britain napoleon negotiated a treaty with adams that ended the naval conflict.
however adamss statesmanlike effort to seek peace angered hamiltonians.
adams also privately attacked hamiltons british faction in turn believing that adams lacked the resolve to deal with france or the republicans hamilton published a pamphlet denouncing the president.
the split among federalists could hardly have come at a worse time the election of 1800 loomed.
the election of 1800 presented a clear choice between federalist adams and republican jefferson.
each party indulged in more rancorous campaigning than either side had experienced in previous elections.
federalists attacked jefferson as an atheist and radical supporter of the french revolution themes captured in this political cartoon 6 16 which shows jefferson in league with the devil.
one connecticut minister declared i do not believe that the most high will permit a howling atheist to sit at the head of this nation republicans in why did the federalist political cartoon show jefferson about to burn the constitution.
turn prayed for deliverance from tories from aristocrats despite dire predictions about the dangers of electing jefferson some new englanders hid their family bibles fearing that president jefferson might confiscate them republicans garnered enough votes to win.
still the election was close.
as the map 6 17 shows support for adams was strongest in new england while jefferson carried the south and parts of the mid atlantic.
only eight votes marked the margin of victory between the two sides.
the republican victory triggered a constitutional crisis that few would have predicted.
the actual vote in the electoral college had produced a tie between jefferson and the republican candidate for vice president aaron burr.
the constitution did not direct electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
a tie meant that the sitting house of representatives dominated by federalists would decide the election.
the new republican dominated house would not take its seats until march 1801.
the political situation was tense.
rumors of deals and conspiracies circulated widely.
pennsylvania and virginia both mobilized their militias a clear message that they would not sit by while scheming politicians in congress cast aside the will of the people.
the politicians indeed schemed and negotiated thus making resolution of the deadlock time consuming.
many federalists believed that jefferson was a fanatic viewing burr as a safer alternative.
alexander hamilton however who had been burrs rival in new york politics for more than a decade disagreed.
rather than see burr win hamilton persuaded federalists that jefferson was the lesser of the two evils.
jefferson had also assured federalists including hamilton that he would not undermine all hard won federalist policies of the previous decade.
with hamiltons support and assurances from jefferson a deal was finally struck.
it took five days and 35 ballots before the house finally elected jefferson.
jeffersons victory averted another constitutional crisis.
despite the mobilization of the virginia and pennsylvania militias while the house was voting the election of 1800 peacefully transferred power from federalists to republicans a notable achievement given the tense political atmosphere of the 1790s.
to avert future deadlock in presidential elections the twelfth amendment adopted in 1804 required that electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president.
the stormy presidency of john adams 9 4 6 17 electoral map of 1800 adamss support in the election of 1800 was concentrated chiefly in new england.

chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 tightening the reins of empire the british victory in the french and indian war in 1763 secured north america against french attack.
it also forced the british government to chart a new direction for dealing with america.
a cornerstone of the new policy was the proclamation of 1763 which prohibited settlement in lands west of the appalachian mountains see chapter 3.
having just fought an expensive war against the french the british were keen to prevent colonists and indians from starting a new war.
britain also felt a renewed urgency to raise funds to pay off the war debt and cover the costs of administering the colonies.
taxation without representation in 1763 george grenville the new prime minister ordered a detailed investigation of colonial revenues and was unhappy to discover that american customs duties produced less than 2 000 a year.
the lucrative trade in molasses between british north america and the caribbean islands alone should have yielded approximately 200 000 a year apart from all of the other goods traded between north america and britain which should also have generated customs duties.
to make the colonies pay their share of taxes grenville was determined to enforce existing laws and enact new taxes to bring in additional revenue.
as the figures in envisioning evidence a comparison of annual per capita tax rates in britain and the colonies in 1765 show compared to the inhabitants of britain and ireland the tax burden on the american colonists in the 1760s was low.
americans and britons had come to view taxation differently and these different visions of the morality and legality of britains new policies put the two on a collision course.
the very act of taxing exercised over those who are not represented appears to me to be depriving them of one of their most essential rights as freemen james otis the rights of the british colonies asserted and proved 1764 why is the scale in the cartoon the great financier out of balance.
the first step in grenvilles new program was the revenue act 1764 popularly known as the sugar act.
it lowered the duties colonists had to pay on molasses but taxed sugar and other goods imported to the colonies and increased penalties for smuggling.
it also created new ways for enforcing compliance with these laws.
violators could be prosecuted in british vice admiralty courts which operated without jury trials.
for some americans the sugar act violated two longheld beliefs the idea that colonists could not be taxed without their consent and the equally sacred notion that englishmen were entitled to a trial by a jury of their peers.
the massachusetts lawyer james otis attacked the sugar act as a violation of the rights of englishmen.
otis had already achieved notoriety for his opposition to the use of writs of assistance by customs officials.
otis insisted that under british law a court could issue a search warrant only for a specific place where there was probable cause to suspect illegal activity.
rather than require that officials designate where they intended to search the new general writs allowed customs officials to search any private property without first demonstrating probable cause or seeking the approval of a magistrate.
in his pamphlet attacking the sugar act the rights of the british colonies asserted and proved otis denied that the british had the authority to tax the colonists without their consent.
but otis stopped short of recommending active resistance to the sugar act.
instead he counseled patience reminding his readers that we must and ought to yield obedience to an act of parliament though erroneous till repealed whereas americans viewed the new tax on sugar and other imports as a burden and a view the closer look tea tax tempest tightening the reins of empire envisioning evidence a comparison of annual per capita tax rates in britain and the colonies in 1765 given the stridency of colonial opposition to british taxation one might think that americans were the most heavily taxed people in the british empire.
in fact however they were the least heavily taxed part of the empire.
americans were also generally wealthier than their countrymen across the atlantic.
american grievances were less about the levels of taxation than about the constitutional and political issues taxation raised.
policy makers in britain had trouble understanding this distinction which had profound consequences for relations with the colonies.

4 2 stamp act protests this map shows the scope of opposition to the detested stamp act.
protest was most intense in the seaports.
the stamp act crisis britain reacted to the colonists resistance to the sugar act by imposing another harsher tax the stamp act which required colonists to purchase special stamps and place them on everything from newspapers to playing cards.
a similar tax existed in britain and parliament believed that requiring colonists to pay such a tax at a lower rate than their brethren in britain was entirely reasonable.
many colonists however rejected this notion.
for them taxation without consent was a violation of their rights.
opposition was most intense in the seaports the map 4 2 shows how widespread anger against this latest tax was.
stamps had to be affixed to virtually all legal transactions and most printed documents so the new tax act alienated more americans than had any previous parliamentary tax.
the british could hardly have picked a worse target for their new scheme of taxation.
among those most burdened by the tax were lawyers and printers two of the most vocal and influential groups in the colonies.
protests against the stamp act filled colonial newspapers and produced a spate of pamphlets defending colonial rights.
the massachusetts house of representatives called on other colonial assemblies to send delegates to new york to frame a response to the stamp act crisis.
nine of the thirteen colonies view the image stamp act tightening the reins of empire sent a representative to the stamp act congress and although framed in respectful terms the declaration of the rights and grievances of the colonies was an important step toward articulating a common response to british policy forcing representatives from different colonies to work together for a common goal.
protest against this latest attack on american liberty was not limited to newspapers or legislative chambers.
opposition to the stamp act spilled out of doors into the streets of american cities and towns.
angry crowds attacked tax collectors and officials.
in a few cases crowds also attacked the homes of british officials including the home of the lieutenant governor of massachusetts thomas hutchinson.
george iii dismissed george grenville in 1765 leaving the task of responding to the american crisis to a young english nobleman charles wentworth marquess of rockingham the new prime minister.
rockingham shepherded two key pieces of legislation through parliament to deal with the crisis created by the stamp act.
the declaratory act affirmed parliaments authority to make laws and statutes binding on the colonies in all cases whatsoever the second piece of legislation repealed the hated stamp act.
britain believed that it had reasserted its authority over the colonies while removing the main cause of colonial protest.
british officials misjudged the reaction of colonists opposed to recent policy.
for critics of british policy it appeared that parliament had embarked on a path that would lead inevitably to the destruction of the colonists liberty.
colonial politics had moved from the margins to the center of british politics.
the issue of what to do about the colonies would define british politics for the next decade.
in the colonies the conflict over british policy also transformed american politics bringing to the fore a group of patriots aggressive supporters of american rights including the sons of liberty a group devoted to opposing british policy and defending american rights.
an assault on liberty the resolution of the stamp act crisis did not eliminate britains pressing financial need for colonial revenue nor did it reduce colonial determination to resist further efforts to tax americans.
what good will the repeal of the stamp act generated britain quickly squandered as it renewed its efforts to impose new taxes on the colonies.
the townshend acts 1767 named for charles townshend an ambitious british finance minister levied new taxes on glass paint paper and tea imported into the colonies.
townshend misinterpreted the stamp act protests.
he believed that colonists opposed internal taxes targeted at commerce within the colonies but that americans would accept external taxes such as customs duties that affected trade between the colonies and other parts of the british empire.
again many americans saw things differently.
the townshend acts prompted americans to clarify their views about taxation.
pennsylvania lawyer john dickinsons pamphlet letters from a farmer in pennsylvania 1767 1768 was an important statement of american views.
dickinson disputed parliaments right to tax the colonists at all.
parliament could regulate trade among different parts of the empire he acknowledged but only the peoples representatives could enact taxes designed primarily to raise revenues.
since americans had no representation in parliament that institution could not tax them.
in response to the townshend acts americans began a nonimportation movement an organized boycott against the purchase of any imported british goods.
women took an active role in the boycott urging that instead of imported fabrics americans wear only clothes made from domestic homespun fabrics.
the nonimportation movement offered american women a chance to contribute actively to the defense of american rights.
it also raised womens political consciousness.
as thirteen year old anna green winslow wrote in her journal regarding the decision to abandon imported fabrics i am as we say a daughter of liberty i chuse to wear as much of our manufactory as possible another import tea had become the basis of an important social ritual in colonial society.
amid the growing frustration with british policy tea drinking took on new political significance.
in 1774 penelope barker and a group of women in edenton north carolina organized a tea boycott.
word of the edenton protest eventually reached england where a british cartoonist lampooned its support for the american cause 4 3 on page 102.
this satire casts the edenton women as a motley assortment of hags and harlots whose unfeminine actions and neglect of their proper duties as women demonstrate their lack of virtue.
the tea boycott even inspired nine year old susan boudinot the daughter of a wealthy philadelphia family to demonstrate her solidarity with the read the document john dickinson letters from farmer in pennsylvania how did nonimportation transform womens political role in the colonies.

the caricature shows the women as unfeminine and neglectful of their proper subordinate roles as wives and mothers.
virginia gazette january 20 1774 colonial cause in her own way.
when invited to tea at the home of the royal governor of new jersey susan curtsied respectfully raised her teacup to her lips and then tossed the contents out of a window.
the new duties imposed by the british were only one part of a more aggressive policy toward the colonies.
between 1765 and 1768 the british transferred the bulk of their military forces in america from the frontier to the major seaports sites of the most violent opposition to the stamp act.
this increased the already tense situation in these localities.
in 1768 the simmering tensions between colonists and the british government came to a head when british customs officials in boston seized merchant john hancocks ship liberty.
customs officials had long suspected hancock of smuggling and thought that seizing the liberty would give them the proof to prosecute him.
the decision proved to be a serious blunder.
the symbolic significance of the british assault on a ship named liberty was not lost on bostonians who saw this as an assault on the idea of liberty itself.
in response to the seizure of the liberty bostonians rioted driving customs officials from the town.
to quell unrest in boston the british dispatched additional troops and warships to the area.
by 1769 the british had stationed almost 4 000 troops dubbed redcoats because of their red uniforms in a city with a population of roughly 15 000.
how does revere stage the events of the boston massacre to evoke sympathy for the colonists cause.
relations between bostonians and the occupying forces were tense.
on march 5 1770 a group of citizens taunted a patrol of soldiers and pelted them with snowballs.
in the melee that followed some of the soldiers fired on the crowd killing five civilians.
the boston silversmith and engraver paul revere published a popular engraving of the boston massacre as the confrontation came to be called in which he portrayed the british as having deliberately fired on the unarmed crowd 4 4.
revere aligns the soldiers in a formal military pose and portrays the commanders as giving an order to fire.
when the soldiers responsible for the shootings were indicted for murder john adams a vocal critic of british policy volunteered to defend them.
adams sought to demonstrate to the british that the americans were not a lawless mob but a law abiding people.
a gifted lawyer he secured acquittals for all those accused except for two soldiers who were convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter.
the evidence presented at the trial revealed that reveres version of the event while excellent propaganda was not an accurate rendering of the circumstances.
the new taxes and pressure for compliance had stiffened the colonists resistance.
so although parliament repealed most of the townshend acts in 1770 relations between the colonies and britain remained strained.
colonists continued to demand the traditional rights of englishmen such as trial by jury but american protests had moved in a new view the closer look images as history the hanging of absalom tightening the reins of empire 4 4 boston massacre paul reveres influential engraving of the boston massacre takes liberties with the facts to portray the british in the worst possible light.
the orderly arrangement of the troops and the stance of the officer at their side suggest that they acted under orders.
behind the troops revere has renamed the shop butchers hall though it made tea cheaper and merchants resented the monopoly it gave to the east india company.
others saw the act as a subtle way of reasserting britains right to tax the colonies.
one group of angry colonists in philadelphia calling themselves the tar and feathering committee warned that they would tar and feather any ships captain who landed with british tea.
the british found the colonists actions thuggish.
in this hostile british cartoon bostonians pay the excise man 4 5 a cruel looking bunch of colonists force a british customs official covered in tar and feathers to drink tea until he becomes sick.
a form of public humiliation tarring and feathering involved pouring hot tar onto the victims skin and then attaching a coat of feathers.
scraping off the resulting mess was painful and laborious.
4 5 bostonians paying the exciseman in this pro british cartoon bostonians are cruel thugs who have tarred and feathered the customs official and are forcing tea down his throat.
direction including the view that taxation without representation was a violation of fundamental rights.
resistance to british policy was also becoming more organized.
the sons of liberty created during the stamp act crisis continued their criticism and intensified their efforts to coordinate and enforce protests against parliament s policies.
after the repeal of the townshend acts americans enjoyed a brief respite from parliaments attentions as britain turned its focus elsewhere in its far flung empire especially to india.
however colonists soon faced another effort to tax them.
the intolerable acts and the first continental congress in 1773 parliament decided to help the flagging east india company increase its tea sales to the colonies.
many members of parliament had sizable investments in the company.
the new law lowered the price of tea to americans but kept the tax on tea and also gave the east india company a monopoly on the tea trade with the colonies.
again british authorities miscalculated american reactions.
colonists resented the new law even why did british policy seem to strike at the essence of colonists liberty.

lord chief justice mansfield a symbol of british law holds america down.
the prime minister lord north shown with a copy of the boston port bill one of the intolerable acts protruding from his pocket forces tea down her throat.
the most dramatic response to the tea act occurred in december 1773 when bostonians dressed as indians boarded a british ship and tossed over 340 chests of tea into the harbor in what came to be known as the boston tea party.
to punish the colonists responsible for this act of what the british considered vandalism parliament passed the coercive acts known to colonists as the intolerable acts.
this legislation closed the port of boston annulled the massachusetts colonial charter dissolved or severely restricted that colonys political institutions and allowed the british to quarter house troops in private homes.
a generation later americans adopted the third amendment to the bill of rights which forbade quartering troops in civilian homes a direct response to this detested british practice.
the acts also allowed british officials charged with capital crimes to be tried outside the colonies.
some colonists called the last provision the murder act since they feared it would allow soldiers charged with murder to avoid prosecution.
americans were divided over how to respond to the intolerable acts.
some saw the bostonians who dumped tea into the harbor as radicals whose actions besmirched americans reputation as lawabiding subjects of the king.
others expressed outrage at the british policy that had forced bostonians what is the symbolic significance lord chief justice mansfields actions in this political cartoon.
to resort to such a dramatic protest.
this cartoon the able doctor or america swallowing the bitter draught 4 6 gives a different view of bostonians from the lawless ruffians depicted in bostonians paying the excise man 4 5.
here the british prime minister lord north brutally accosts america a half clad indian princess forcing tea down her throat while lord chief justice lord mansfield the symbol of british law pins her arms down.
the most important consequence of the intolerable acts was the decision by the colonies to convene a continental congress in philadelphia in late 1774.
all the colonies except georgia sent representatives.
among the colonial leaders who attended were patrick henry john adams and george washington.
congress endorsed the resolves of suffolk county massachusetts which denounced the intolerable acts and asserted the intention of colonists to nullify such a manifest violation of their rights and liberties the congress also recommended that every town county and city create a committee to enforce the boycott of british goods.
the informal network of committees that had opposed british policy now acquired a quasi legal status from congress.
although many americans hoped that a peaceful solution to the deepening crisis was possible in march 1774 the brilliant virginia orator patrick henry urged his fellow delegates in the read the document patrick henry give me liberty or give me death tightening the reins of empire virginia legislature to prepare for the inevitable conflict that loomed between the colonies and britain.
although no contemporaneous copy of his dramatic speech exists henrys words were recounted many years later assuming almost legendary status in american culture.
in response to british assaults henry declared give me liberty or give me death between the passage of the sugar act in 1764 and the meeting of the first continental congress in 1774 relations between britain and america had steadily deteriorated.
as the chart 4 7 shows britain had tried various revenue measures to raise funds from the colonies.
americans however remained opposed to taxation without representation.
rather than subdue the colonies british policy only strengthened the resolve of americans to defend their rights.
lexington concord and lord dunmores proclamation living on the edge of the british empire colonists had come to depend on their own militias as their primary means of public defense.
the laws of the individual colonies regulated these organizations of citizen soldiers.
during the colonial period the militia was more than just a force available to protect the colonists from hostile indians or attacks from the french or spanish.
in an era before police forces the militia also helped enforce public order putting down riots rebellions and other civil disturbances.
in january 1775 virginias george mason called on the colonists to put their militia in good order.

chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 if we view the whole of the conduct of the british ministry and parliament i do not see how any one can doubt but that there is a settled fixd plan for inslaving the colonies or bringing them under arbitrary government.
connecticut minister the reverend ebenezer baldwin 1774 mason declared that a well regulated militia composed of gentlemen freeholders and other free man is the natural strength and only stable security of a free government the british too understood the importance of the militia to colonial resistance.
not only did they pose a military threat but they were also indispensable to helping mobilize americans and organizing their opposition to british policy.
disarming the militias became a priority for the british.
their first target was massachusetts which had become a hotbed of resistance the british dispatched troops to concord in april 1775 to seize gunpowder and other military supplies.
paul revere an outspoken member of the sons of liberty was charged with riding from boston to lexington and concord to warn citizens that british troops were on the march.
revere got as far as lexington before a british patrol captured him.
fortunately for revere he had already encountered another member of the sons of liberty that night dr samuel prescott who was returning from the home of his fiance.
prescott agreed to carry word that british troops were marching from boston.
the alarm spread throughout the countryside.
when the 700 british regulars finally arrived at lexingtons town green they faced 60 70 militiamen.
although the militia agreed to disperse someone it is not clear who fired a shot and the two sides exchanged fire.
the battle of lexington marked the first military conflict between britain and america and the colonists had demonstrated their mettle.
the british then marched to concord where they confronted a larger and better organized militia detachment at the north bridge.
the militia stood their ground and exchanged fire with the british why did british regulars choose concord as their military objective.
regulars who were forced to retreat.
while the british retreated back to boston colonial reinforcements poured into concord and the surrounding countryside.
the british column was an easy target for militiamen who took up positions along the roadside and in the adjacent woods.
a rhode island newspaper captured the views of patriots when it commented that british aggression marked the start of a war which shall hereafter fill an important page in history although the british had mounted a direct assault on the massachusetts militia they opted for a stealthier plan for disarming the virginia militia.
under cover of darkness a detachment of royal marines entered virginias capital of williamsburg seized the gun powder and destroyed the firing mechanisms on the muskets stored in the militias magazine storehouse.
when citizens of williamsburg learned of the assault they marched on the governors mansion to protest.
as word of the british raid spread through the colony militia led by patrick henry planned to march on williamsburg.
lord dunmore the royal governor warned that if the militia entered williamsburg he would declare freedom to slaves and reduce the city of williamsburg to ashes at the last moment a compromise was worked out and the governor made restitution for the stolen powder and damaged guns.
still dunmores threat to free virginias slaves had shocked the colony.
two weeks later colonists learned of lord dunmores proclamation.
dunmore offered freedom to any slave who joined the british forces in putting down the american rebellion.
within a month 300 slaves had joined dunmores ethiopian regiment whose ranks would swell to 800 or more.
the uniforms of this unit included a sash emblazoned with the motto liberty to slaves virginians complained that the british were using every art to seduce the negroes while others viewed dunmores decision as diabolical many virginians who were wavering on the issue of american independence now concluded that a break with britain was inevitable even desirable.
some virginians recognized that virginias slaves were seeking the same liberty that colonists claimed.
for example lund washington who managed his cousin georges mount vernon estate including his slaves observed that there is not a man of them but would leave us if they could make their escape patriots versus loyalists patriots versus loyalists by 1775 the rift between britain and the colonies had grown precipitously large.
indeed it was not just colonists who believed that if britain continued on its present course it would end in disaster.
a satirical british cartoon the political cartoon for the year 1775 4 8 published in london vividly captured this view.
it depicts king george iii riding in a coach heading straight over a cliff.
lord chief justice mansfield holds the reins of the carriage of state which rides roughshod over the magna carta a legal text closely linked with the rights of englishmen and the british constitution another symbol of liberty.
the cartoonists symbolism suggested a view that was becoming increasingly popular in the colonies americans could no longer expect the political and legal system of britain to protect their liberty.
although some americans were persuaded that britain was intent on trampling their liberty other colonists remained loyal to the crown.
for patriots it was becoming increasingly clear that they could no longer count on the legal protections that had safeguarded their liberty for generations.
loyalists by contrast disputed this claim.
for those loyal to george iii liberty could be maintained only by upholding english law.
loyalists viewed patriots actions as lawlessness not affirmations of liberty.
the battle of bunker hill two months after lexington and concord the two sides clashed again in charlestown across the charles river from boston.
american forces had dug in at bunker hill and nearby breeds hill prepared to hold off the british in boston.
the main fighting actually took place at breeds hill which was closer to the harbor.
the british underestimated the colonists resolve to hold their ground.
although the british took bunker and breeds hills they had purchased their victory at a steep cost in dead and wounded.
even more important americans had shown the british that they were not the untrained rabble the british had portrayed and that they could become a formidable fighting force.
the painter john trumbull immortalized the battle in his painting the death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.
for a discussion of this painting and how it reflected the realities of a battle in which neither side won a clear victor see images as history trumbulls the death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill page 108.
despite the armed confrontations at lexington concord and bunker hill the continental congress had not abandoned hope of reconciliation with king george iii.
in july 1775 congress drafted the 4 8 the political cartoon for the year 1775 george iii rides next to lord chief judge mansfield in a carriage heading toward the edge of a cliff.
the carriage crushes the magna carta and the british constitution symbols of the rule of law while flames engulf boston in the background.
what does the political cartoon for the year 1775 reveal about the nature of relations between the colonies and britain.
chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 images as history trumbulls the death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill american john trumbulls painting the death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill 1786 painted eleven years after the battle captured an important moment in the american war for independence.
like benjamin wests the death of general wolfe see page 90 trumbulls painting depicts the heroic death of a military figure but the two paintings differ in a number of fascinating ways.
while the death of general wolfe portrayed a clear victory for the british the death of general warren showed a more complex event in which neither side was completely victorious while the americans lost the battle they proved themselves an effective fighting force and exacted a high price from the british for their victory.
how did trumbulls composition reflect the realities of this battle a struggle in which neither side won a clear victory.
trumbullspainting the death of general warren was part of a series of paintings he began to commemorate the great events of our countrys revolution the artist intended to use his painting as the basis for a set of engravings that he could sell as cheap prints to a popular market on both sides of the atlantic.
with this in mind trumbull captured the chaotic horror of a battle scene in which both armies displayed heroism and nobility.
the american general warren lies mortally wounded cradled in the arms of one of his troops in the same pose in which benjamin west portrayed british general wolfe.
one element of the painting meant to appeal to british viewers is the depiction of british major john small in the center ofthe composition near warren.
small stays the hand of one of his infantryman poised to bayonet the dying warren.
by placing these two noble gestures warrens sacrifice and smalls humanitarian intervention at the center of the painting trumbull shifts attention away from the actual outcome of the battle to the idea that virtuous men on both sides performed noble deeds.
this decision enhanced the moral complexity of the events while also making it and later engravings based on it attractive to british and american customers effectively doubling the size of his potential market.
trumbulls canvas also advanced the democratization of art begun by benjamin west.
in this painting virtue resides neither in one nation nor in any particular class of men.
trumbull portrays a broad range of soldiers heroically from a gentlemanly british officer to a barefoot colonial soldier.
indeed abigail adams an outspoken supporter of american independence and the wife of the prominent politician john adams noted that trumbull teaches mankind that it is not rank nor titles but character alone which interests posterity trumbull all but ignored african americans consigning the two he did include to minor roles in the painting.
trumbull described the african american standing in the lower right corner behind an injured colonial the death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill how did trumbull craft his painting so it would appeal to both an american and british audience.
patriots versus loyalists officer as a faithful negro at least fourteen african americans were among the troops defending breeds hill and bunker hill.
the african american peter salem played an important role in the actual battle perhaps firing the shot that killed major pitcairn the british figure collapsing near the center of the painting.
the paintings slighting of that role probably general warrens pose evokes the image of jesus being cradled in the arms of mary.
reflected trumbulls own racial ideas and those of his audience who were not used to seeing african americans depicted in anything but a subservient role.
for the moment the democratization of art was restricted to those of european descent.
african americans treatment in american art mirrored their marginalization in the larger society.
trumbull highlights the idea of virtue and honor as universal values by showing a british officer preventing a soldier from bayoneting the dying warren.
rather than portray an african american as heroic warren marginalizes this figure literally placing him in the shadow of a white officer at the end of the canvas.
major pitcairn who led the british assault on concord is mortally wounded in this battle.
what does trumbulls portrayal of african americans tell us about his views and those of his likely audiences.
chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 olive branch petition asking george iii to intervene on their behalf.
the king rejected the american appeal.
with that rejection the time for reconciliation passed and the supporters of american independence in the continental congress gained momentum.
the push for independence opened a division within colonial society between colonists who supported independence and those who remained loyal to the british.
common sense and the declaration of independence in january 1776 thomas paine a recent immigrant to america from england wrote a pamphlet that argued forcefully for american independence.
in common sense paine not only attacked recent british policy he framed a stinging indictment of monarchy and defended a democratic theory of representative government.
after stating the simple facts plain arguments and common sense of the matter paine concluded that separation from britain was the only action that made sense for america.
paines work was printed in a cheap format that allowed artisans farmers and others with little money to purchase a copy.
he wrote in plain forceful prose avoiding literary and classical allusions that would have required knowledge of latin.
the book was a phenomenal publishing success.
common sense did more than simply fuel americans desire for independence it helped change the framework in which americans thought about politics itself.
before paines pamphlet most americans even those who believed that reconciliation with britain was impossible still maintained a respectful attitude toward george iii.
most americans had grown up in a culture that venerated constitutional monarchy but paines savage critique of this institution had a liberating impact.
paine called monarchy ridiculous after demonstrating that history proved that monarchy was incompatible with liberty paine turned to the current british monarch george iii whom he equated with savagery itself.
he denounced the king for his assaults on american liberty noting that even brutes do not devour their young those who supported reconciliation with britain found paines scathing attacks on george iii appalling.
paine also gave a voice to many who wished to radically transform american political life.
he was unabashedly democratic at a time when many including those most eager to separate from britain viewed democracy as a danger to be avoided what arguments did paines common sense present.
at all cost.
common sense became a blueprint for those who wished to experiment with democratic government although not everyone who ardently supported american independence appreciated paines ideas.
there is something absurd in supposing a continent to be perpetually governed by an island thomas paine common sense 1776 in july 1775 a month after congress drafted the olive branch petition pleading with george iii to abandon the cruel policies of his ministers and such statutes as immediately distress the colonists the king declared that the american colonists were in open and avowed rebellion the prohibitory act which the british parliament enacted into law in december 1775 banned all trade with the thirteen colonies.
word of the ban arrived in america in february 1776.
coming on the heels of paines indictment of british tyranny the policy further inflamed american resentments against britain.
after the adoption of the prohibitory act support for independence gained ground.
in may congress instructed the individual colonies to adopt such government as shall in the opinion of the representatives of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents congress added a preamble five days later that affirmed the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed although congress had not formally declared independence it had effectively asserted that the colonies had become independent states no longer under the authority of parliament or the king.
richard henry lee of virginia introduced a resolution that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states congress then debated the lee resolution and on june 11 1776 appointed a committee to draft a formal declaration of independence.
with john adams massachusetts as its chair the committee included robert livingston new york thomas jefferson virginia read the document thomas paine common sense patriots versus loyalists roger sherman connecticut and benjamin franklin pennsylvania.
adams designated jefferson to take the lead in drafting the formal resolution.
on june 28 the committee presented the congressional delegates with the draft.
congress cut about a quarter of the text and made some other revisions to the document.
on july 4 1776 congress approved the final text of the declaration of independence a public defense of americas decision to declare independence from britain that was to be printed and sent to the individual states.
copies of the declaration were then widely distributed.
thomas jefferson admitted that his text reflected the sentiments of the day whether expressed in conversation or letters printed essays the introductory paragraph explained the reasons for separating from britain.
the second paragraph provided a powerful defense of the liberty and equality and affirmed that all men are created equal and therefore entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a long list of grievances against george iii took up the bulk of the text.
printed as a single broadside the indented list of charges against george iii was immediately recognizable 4 9.
the drafters of the declaration of independence aimed it at both a domestic and a foreign audience.
it made the case for independence to the american people and announced to the british government the reasons for taking up arms.
the declaration also sought to help american diplomacy.
if america were to fight the most powerful nation on earth it would need help from other european powers such as holland spain and especially of britains long time rival france.
because a powerful monarch then ruled france the declaration refrained from using the inflammatory antimonarchical rhetoric favored by thomas paine in common sense.
george iiis misdeeds not monarchy itself were to blame for americas demand for independence.
the plight of the loyalists the division between patriots colonists who supported american independence and loyalists those wishing to remain loyal to the king drove a deep wedge in colonial society.
john adams speculated that americans were evenly divided among patriots loyalists and those striving to remain neutral.
although it is difficult to establish hard figures for how colonists divided over 4 9 the declaration of independence the declaration of independence was printed as a broadside.
this single sheet format made it easy to post in public places.
the layout of the declaration the typography and paragraphing guides the reader through the main parts of its argument.
what audiences did the declaration of independence address.
chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness declaration of independence 1776 4 10 magna britannia her colonies reduced this image created by benjamin franklin plays on the dismemberment of the empire as fatal to both the colonies and the mother country.
franklin used this image early in americas opposition to british policy.
loyalists later used the dismemberment metaphor to persuade americans to oppose independence.
independence historians estimate that patriots constituted about 40 percent of the white population neutrals another 40 percent and loyalists probably about 20 percent.
many prominent loyalists had opposed british policy toward the colonies but refused to accept the decision for independence.
minister samuel seabury captured the view of many loyalists when he wrote to talk of a colony independent of the mothercountry is no better sense than to talk of a limb independent of the body to which it belongs the image of the dismemberment of the empire was a powerful one in the minds of colonials and britons alike.
in the 1760s supporters of american rights had used such images to persuade britain to change its policy toward the colonies.
at the time benjamin franklin was a colonial lobbyist in london working to repeal british taxes.
he designed an engraving magna britannia her colonies reduced to appeal to parliament evoking the horror of a possible separation between the colonists and the mother country 4 10.
how did the metaphor of dismemberment influence loyalist thought.
seaburys reassertion of the horrors that would follow from the dismemberment of the empire tapped into powerful fears and anxieties among americans unsure about independence.
loyalists suffered hardships during the struggle for independence.
in some places where patriot feelings were strongest individuals could be ostracized for refusing to support the patriot cause.
legal disabilities were also imposed on individuals who refused to take a loyalty oath including exclusion from service on juries and disarmament.
many states passed laws seizing loyalist property.
a complicated issue arising from these laws was how to deal with women married to loyalists.
some women brought property from their own family into their marriage.
was this property also liable to confiscation.
the story of grace growden galloway illustrates the rapid reversal of fortune that could befall anyone who opposed the patriots side in the american revolution.
see choices and consequences a loyalist wifes dilemma.
the loyalist cause appealed to many americans not just wealthy men and women like grace and joseph galloway.
new york boasted a sizeable loyalist population as did parts of the backcountry in the carolinas.
some religious sects particularly groups such as the quakers who were pacifists opposed the violence of war.
beginning with lord dunmores proclamation many slaves had sensed that a british victory not independence offered them the best chance for freedom.
as many as 100 000 slaves freed themselves by running away during the dislocation created by the war.

her husband joseph galloway was wealthy and influential in pennsylvania politics.
throughout the escalating conflict with britain joseph galloway supported reconciliation and when war broke out he became a loyalist.
realizing that he could no longer count on the goodwill of his former friends and neighbors to protect him galloway and his daughter fled philadelphia perhaps the most ardent patriot city outside new england for british controlled new york in 1776.
the government of pennsylvania confiscated galloways property but grace galloway was determined to protect the property she had inherited from her own family and had brought into her marriage.
she faced a difficult set of choices concerning her property choices follow her husband and daughter into exile accepting that neither she nor her husband would probably ever recover their property.
continuing controversies what does grace growden galloways plight reveal about the situation of loyalists during the american revolution.
the legal status of the property of a woman married to a loyalist was complicated.
this issue came before american courts in martin v commonwealth 1805.
building on a new conception of women as independent political actors massachusetts claimed that a womans choice to stay or flee was hers alone.
the massachusetts high court however disagreed with this new view of womens legal autonomy.
the court held that the womans decision to leave the state had been her husbands not her own and therefore the state did not have the right to seize her land.
although a defeat for womens rights the outcome of the case would have certainly pleased grace growden galloway.
follow her husband and daughter into exile and use every legal means available to prevent the confiscation of her own property and fight an uphill battle to protect it from afar.
stay in philadelphia and use every legal option to protect the properties that she had brought into her marriage.
decision grace chose to stay and fight.
she hoped that by remaining in her home she could avoid eviction.
she also concluded that the chances of defending her own property against confiscation would be easier if she stayed in philadelphia.
consequences grace endured great hardship while defending her rights but was ultimately evicted.
snubbed and shunned by many of her former friends and acquaintances and driven from her home she lived in a modest set of rented rooms.
in her diary grace recounts her struggles and the indignities she suffered including the time she saw my own chariot standing at my door for the use of others while i am forced to walk she never rejoined her family and died alone in 1781.
although evicted from her home she was more successful at protecting the property she had brought into the marriage which eventually passed on to her descendents.
eighteenth century coach what does martin v commonwealth reveal about womens roles in revolutionary era america.
chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 america at war the british had reason to be confident when they contemplated their military advantages over the colonies at the start of the war.
britains navy was the most powerful in the world and its army was formidable.
the population of the british isles was more than four times greater than that of the colonies.
america began the war with only a citizens militia.
fighting a powerful army meant that america would have to create a professional force.
congress appointed george washington the commander of the new continental army.
although britains population was much larger than that of the colonies the relative size of the two armies in the field was not that lopsided.
at the start of the conflict british general howe enjoyed something like a two to one advantage over general washington.
numbers alone do not tell the whole story.
british supply lines were stretched thin and american forces were supplemented by militia forces which not only increased the size of the patriot forces but forced the british to deal with fighting both a conventional army and a nonconventional one as well.
even if the british were able to defeat the american armed forces in the field and gain control of americas cities conquering and pacifying all thirteen colonies would be virtually impossible.
the british also never grasped that they were fighting a new type of war not a struggle against another european power but a battle against a decentralized independence movement.
the war in the north stiff resistance at breeds hill and bunker hill had convinced the british military that the colonial militias were not an undisciplined rabble that would retreat if confronted by a well trained professional army.
the creation of a continental army under to place any dependance upon militia is assuredly resting upon a broken staff.
men accustomed to unbounded freedom and no controul cannot brook the restraint which is indispensably necessary to the good order and government of an army without which licentiousness and every kind of disorder triumphantly reign.
to bring men to a proper degree of subordination is not the work of a day a month or even a year george washington to the president of congress september 24 1776 the leadership of george washington underscored this fact and led the british to change their tactics.
rather than employing the army to subdue a rebel population the british prepared for a sustained military conflict.
realizing that patriot sympathies in new england were strong the british retreated to new york a colony with many loyalists.
new york not only provided a safer base of operations but the british also believed that if they could hold new york they would cut new england off from the rest of america.
although determined to defend new york washington suffered a major defeat at brooklyn heights in august 1776.
washington then retreated to manhattan but british major general sir william howe soon drove the americans from new york.
retreating south through new jersey washington eventually crossed the delaware river into pennsylvania.
during the winter however washingtons ranks dwindled as many militiamen returned home.
these citizen soldiers had repulsed the immediate threat.
they would also protect the countryside and prevent loyalist pockets from forming outside of british controlled territory but they were ill suited to sustained battle.
washington lamented their unpredictable coming and going come in you cannot tell how and go you cannot tell when and act you cannot tell where the militias lack of discipline why did washington have paines the american crisis read to the troops before he crossed the delaware to attack british and german mercenaries.
america at war the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women thomas paine the american crisis 1776 and long term commitment to fight was a constant source of frustration to washington and american military leaders.
still the militia remained vital contributing both to the military and political success of the war effort.
believing that he had decisively defeated washington an overconfident howe established his base camp in new york city and planned to enjoy the winter holidays.
realizing that america desperately needed a victory washington launched a surprise attack on christmas night 1776.
he ordered that thomas paines inspirational essay the american crisis be read to his troops.
paine enjoined americans not to abandon hope.
leading his soldiers across the partially frozen delaware river under cover of darkness washington overwhelmed an outpost manned by german mercenaries at trenton.
a week later washington won another daring victory at princeton.
howe had squandered his advantage and allowed washington to regroup and score two important victories.
washington shrewdly abandoned his early strategy of fighting a conventional war.
he now realized that his primary goal was to wear down his opponents and avoid a decisive defeat.
such a strategy played to americas natural advantages and would eventually force the british to accept that they could not conquer america.
to commemorate washingtons victory at princeton the trustees of princeton college commissioned the eminent american painter charles wilson peale to paint washington at the battle of princeton 4 11.
the portrait replaced a painting of george iii damaged during the battle when a cannonball removed the kings head.
british strategy shifted in 1777.
howe decided to make more effective use of british naval power.
a key element of this plan was a coordinated effort to capture american cities including the rebellions political center philadelphia which fell in september.
the british also sought to isolate ardently patriot new england from the rest of the nation.

in addition to providing americans with an important victory and morale boost the british defeat at saratoga persuaded the french to commit troops and naval forces to aid the colonists.

in 1778 france and america signed a treaty promising to fight until american independence was secured.
spain soon joined france as an opponent of britain and attacked british outposts in the mississippi valley and florida.

they also saw the south with its cash crops of tobacco indigo and rice as more valuable economically than the north.
initially the british strategy seemed to pay off.
in 1780 british troops scored impressive victories at savannah georgia charleston south carolina and camden south carolina.

with the guns of the british navy at their disposal and new supplies coming from new york and london yorktown seemed like a strategic location to regroup.
but things went awry for the british when early in the fall of 1781 the french dispatched a formidable fleet under the command of admiral paul de grasse from the caribbean to north america.

what was the treaty of paris.
the radicalism of the american revolution the radicalism of the american revolution the american revolution encompassed two interrelated struggles.
the revolution was both a colonial war for independence and a revolutionary struggle to change american government and society.
thus the war was both a struggle for home rule the right of americans to govern themselves and a war for who should rule at home a contest to determine the nature of american government and the structure of society.
the american revolution set in motion a social and political transformation that affected nearly every aspect of american society.
the declaration of independence had articulated the twin ideals of equality and liberty.
some americans took the declarations bold affirmation of liberty and equality to be an endorsement of more than colonial independence.
for them these words were revolutionary.
the declaration inspired them to undertake a radical transformation of american politics and society.
the first constitutions drafted by the states in 1776 included language that echoed the declarations affirmation of liberty and equality.
few americans doubted the importance of this affirmation how far to take it however proved controversial.
the pennsylvania constitution went further than any other state constitution in embracing a democratic conception of equality at least for white men.
not every group in america benefited equally from the promise of the revolution.
african slaves indians and women were either excluded from or not included fully in the revolutions promise of equality and liberty.
although the promise of the revolution remained unfilled for many in america oppressed groups throughout american history would use it to seek the full rights of citizenship.
popular politics in the revolutionary era british taxation was not the only set of policies that produced violent resistance during the revolutionary era.
colonists also opposed unfair taxes imposed by their own colonial governments.
the colonial elites who dominated government also came under attack.
in the carolinas a movement sought reform of colonial government.
the regulators as their name implied sought to regulate society by eliminating corruption and bringing the rule of law to places that lacked it.
the regulators resented planters and merchants who lived near the coast and were eager to tax western farmers but were not willing to share political power with them.
thus in backcountry north carolina regulators opposed taxes including those enacted to pay for a lavish new palace for the royal governor.
some regulators such as herman husband combined religious themes with democratic ideas to attack corruption and inequality in north carolina.
husband fused his religious rhetoric with a class conscious critique of the eastern elites who dominated state politics.
he noted that obedience to just laws and subjection to slavery were not the same.
resistance to unjust authority was legitimate because god gave all men a knowledge of their privileges and a true zeal to maintain them in contrast with husbands views the royal governor and his supporters among the clergy asserted that subjection to lawful authority not resistance was the plain and principal doctrine of christianity in 1770 1 000 regulators marched on the courthouse in hillsborough.
the protesters not only shut down the court but also publicly whipped a court official who was notorious for charging excessive fees to process legal documents.
the angry crowd also punished lawyers whose high fees angered backcountry residents.
such fees fell heavily on poor folk and blocked their access to the courts.
the protests prompted the governor to dispatch the militia which defeated the regulators and restored order.
although the regulators were not victorious their class conscious rhetoric and critique of power and corruption resonated in the carolina backcountry.
who were the regulators.

revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 constitutional experiments testing the limits of democracy when the continental congress directed the states to draft new constitutions they became laboratories for constitutional experimentation.
different visions of constitutional government were set against one another in this vibrant public debate.
virginia broke new ground by framing a detailed declaration of rights that became a model for other states.
by contrast virtually every other state apart from vermont rejected pennsylvanias radical democratic experiment.
massachusetts like virginia also became a model for other states pioneering constitutional developments that became essential features of american constitutionalism particularly in the separation of powers and checks and balances between the different branches of government.
in june 1776 the new state of virginia drafted a declaration of rights and a constitution.
the chief architect of the declaration of rights was george mason an influential patriot leader.
the declaration what made pennsylvanias constitution so radical for its day.
asserted that life liberty and property were fundamental rights and that all men are by nature equally free and independent some virginians worried that this language might encourage slaves to revolt.
another delegate calmed these fears by pointing out that the militia would be more than adequate to protect virginia from its slaves.
indeed the declaration of rights also affirmed that a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the proper natural and safe defense of a free state that standing armies in time of peace should be avoided as dangerous to liberty and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to and be governed by the civil power the declaration also protected other basic liberties trial by jury freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
pennsylvania drafted its constitution not long after virginias.
while members of a slave owning planter elite drafted virginias declaration of rights and constitution a more democratic coalition that included urban artisans influenced by the ideas of thomas paine and backcountry farmers resentful of the old eastern colonial elites and similar to the regulators drafted pennsylvanias constitution.
echoing paines common sense the pennsylvania constitution created a form of representative government with a single legislature a system known as unicameralism.
responding to the frustration of frontier settlers who had sought the creation of a state militia to protect them from indian attack and the necessities of fighting britain the pennsylvania constitution also created a citizens militia and became the first state constitution to expressly protect the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state in keeping with paines democratic ideas the constitution rejected property requirements for voting.
any male taxpayer who resided in the state for a year could vote.
timothy matlack who had helped write this radical constitution commissioned a portrait that reflected its diverse influences 4 15.
a powder horn and musket appear in the background.
the pennsylvania constitution and important british legal texts rest on the table behind him.
the revolution prompted a public debate over how far to take the idea of democracy.
although pennsylvania went further than most in implementing these ideas similar debates occurred in the press in other states.
the traditional whig theory of representation assumed that only property owners could exercise the independent judgment necessary to vote.
individuals without property would be at the mercy of the rich and powerful who could influence their votes on election day.
whig theory also viewed read the document pennsylvania constitution of 1776 the radicalism of the american revolution the possession of property as an essential way of demonstrating that one had a permanent stake in society.
according to the whigs only men with such an interest could act in the long term interests of society.
the revolution nurtured a far more democratic vision of government.
the anonymous author of the pamphlet the people the best governors asserted that the people know best their own wants and necessities and therefore are best able to rule themselves according to this view a propertied elite was not needed to act as a check on the people.
those who rejected the radical notion of equality implicit in democracy ridiculed the new more democratic theories.
the reverend charles bullman of south carolina for example suggested that if these ideas were not checked every silly clown and illiterate mechanic will take upon him to censure the conduct of his prince or governor among the patriot elite no figure expressed greater reservations about the dangers of too much democracy and of unicameralism than john adams who reluctantly conceded that paine had helped rally americans to the idea of independence but also feared that paines work had a better hand at pulling down than building up governments.
indeed adams worried that paines feeble ideas about government would mislead americans when the time came to draft new state constitutions.
adams incorporated his own views on the matter into his short but influential thoughts on government which he wrote in response to a request from north carolinas provincial congress the body responsible for framing its new constitution.
most states were unwilling to follow pennsylvanias radical model opting to retain a property requirement for voting and office holding.
in general however the new property requirements the states adopted were lower than they had been during the colonial period so on balance the pool of eligible voters increased.
although not a resounding victory for those who shared the democratic views of thomas paine and the author of the people the best government the revolution clearly led to a greater democratization of politics.
although not the most democratic experiment in government the massachusetts constitution produced interesting innovations.
john adams played a leading role in helping to draft it.
adopted in 1780 it remains the oldest continuously functioning written constitution in the world.
setting the terms for nearly all subsequent constitution making in america massachusetts took revolutionary era constitutional ideas in new directions.
massachusetts saw a constitution as the supreme law that had to rest on the express consent of the people.
legislative bodies had drafted earlier state constitutions but a special convention drafted the massachusetts constitution which it then submitted directly to the people for ratification.
massachusetts also took the unprecedented step of eliminating property requirements for this special ratification process.
thus even those white men who would not meet the property requirements for voting for the legislature under the proposed constitution could vote on the constitution.
the notion that a constitution had to be submitted to the people directly for ratification was a radical innovation that quickly john adams to james sullivan became an accepted may 1776 feature of american constitutional life.
the massachusetts constitution was also the first to implement an effective system of checks and balances.
while all the early state governments supported the principle of separation of powers making the powers of the legislative executive and judicial functions of government distinct these constitutions had not built in the checks and balances that would make this ideal a practical reality.
to make separation of powers effective the different branches of government had to be able to check one anothers power.
massachusetts went further than any other state in achieving this goal.
the massachusetts governor had considerable power including the right to veto acts of the legislature.
this enabled the executive to check the legislature.
the legislature could check the governor through its ability to override a veto by a two thirds vote.
finally massachusetts made the governor an office directly elected by the people not appointed by the legislature as many other states had opted to do.
another important experiment in constitutional government was the articles of confederation the constitution that congress framed for the new united states of america.
although congress drafted the articles in 1777 the states did not ratify them for another four years.
the articles did not create a national government but rather a firm league of friendship among the sovereign states.
thus article ii affirmed that each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the united shall we say that every individual of the community old and young male and female as well as rich and poor must consent expressly to every act of legislation why did the traditional whig view of representation oppose democracy.
chapter 4 revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 states in congress assembled because fighting the british was the top priority congress cobbled together the articles of confederation without providing many features that the individual states had included in their constitutions.
fear of british style government also shaped the minds of congress.
having just cast off a powerful central government with a king the articles abandoned the idea of a single unified executive to enforce the law.
nor did congress have the power to tax another power that the british had abused.
the articles created a weak government whose ability to raise revenue engage in military actions and conduct diplomacy depended entirely on the goodwill of the states.
african americans struggle for freedom the great english literary figure dr samuel johnson pointed out the hypocrisy of americans claiming to be champions of liberty while enslaving africans.
some slaves invoked the ideas of the revolution explicitly whereas others voted with their feet and freed themselves.
the dislocations associated with americas dr samuel johnson 1775 war for independence provided opportunities for african americans to escape bondage.
for some fleeing to the british provided the best chance for freedom.
other slaves seized on the ideas nurtured by the broader revolutionary changes that accompanied the war for independence.
the ideas of liberty and equality intensified the burgeoning movement for the abolition of slavery.
although the revolution did not eradicate slavery it did put it on the road to extinction in new england and the mid atlantic regions.
slaves eager to cast off their own shackles appropriated the revolutions language of liberty.
during the stamp act protests in south carolina 1765 slaves staged their own parade chanting liberty white south carolinians viewed such activities as evidence of a plan for rebellion.
to thwart the imagined threat they mobilized the militia which also served as slave patrols.
blacks in new england fared better when they invoked the revolutions ideals than did blacks in the south.
in 1773 1774 and 1777 slaves petitioned the government of massachusetts for their freedom using the language of the declaration of independence including the idea of natural rights and the notion that government rested how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes what was the impact of the american revolution on the institution of slavery.
on the consent of the governed.
they asserted we have in common with all other men a naturel right to our freedoms without being deprivd of them by our fellow men less than a decade later another slave mum bett successfully sued for her freedom.
a jury in western massachusetts based its verdict on the language of the states declaration of rights which stated that all men are born free and equal and have certain natural essential and unalienable rights among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties mum bett changed her name to elizabeth freeman worked as a housekeeper for the lawyer who defended her and became a respected midwife and nurse.
citing this precedent the states highest court abolished slavery in massachusetts in the 1780s.
new england went further than any other region in its support for the abolition of slavery.
vermonts 1777 constitution expressly prohibited slavery the first constitution in the nation to take such a step.
in the mid atlantic pennsylvania and new york adopted gradual emancipation laws.
the american revolution in indian country the struggle between britain and the american colonies had enormous consequences for american indians.
although neutrality appealed to many indians avoiding entanglement in the conflict between britain and america became impossible.
faced with the need to make a choice many indian nations sided with britain whose colonial policies including the proclamation of 1763 had blocked american westward expansion.
an american victory would mean more settlers streaming into indian country and destruction of the habitats that indians depended on for their survival.
the declaration of independence had underscored americas deep seated fear and hostility toward indians.
among the complaints jefferson leveled against the king was he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions jeffersons description of indians as savages engaged in acts of barbarism rallied americans against the british.
one event that whipped up anti indian feelings among americans was the murder of jane mccrea read the document slave petition to the governor of massachusetts 1774 the radicalism of the american revolution in upstate new york by mohawk indians.
jane was traveling to meet her fianc a british soldier when probritish mohawks attacked her.
mccreas political sympathies did not prevent her from becoming a martyr for the patriot cause.
colonial newspapers lamented her fate which was also memorialized in poetry.
in 1780 a novel about her demise appeared and the painter john trumbull made several sketches of mccreas murder for a possible painting before moving on to other projects.
joel barlow a close friend of jefferson and important literary figure in early america memorialized the event in one of his poems and john vanderlyn portrayed the event in this dramatic painting 4 16 which was displayed in 1804.
vanderlyns representation of the light skinned mccrea and the dark skinned indians underscores the role of the painting as a morality tale between good and evil.
the indians are depicted as cruel savages about to murder mccrea.
pro british tribes scored notable victories on the western frontier during 1782.
after these successes many indians were stunned to learn that the british had surrendered at yorktown.
indians were excluded from the negotiations that ended the war.
many viewed the treaty of paris 1783 which ceded indian country between the appalachians and the mississippi river to america as a betrayal.
and virtuous american patriots whose names brutus and honestus signified their commitment to ancient roman republican virtue.
women also served in the war effort.
when mustered into service the militia often depended on support from women.
an eyewitness to such a mobilization in cambridge massachusetts in 1774 noted that women surpassed the men for eagerness spirit in the defense of liberty by arms women not only provided moral support animating their husbands sons to fight for their liberties but also helped making cartridges some women became molly pitchers who hauled water and carried supplies to soldiers.
deborah sampson disguised herself as a man and served in the continental army.
a physician discovered sampson while treating her for fever.
the continental army also had camp followers women including the wives of soldiers who washed cooked nursed and tended to other needs of soldiers.
the revolutions emphasis on liberty and equality boosted notions of gender equality.
abigail adams wife of john adams demanded that her husband remember the ladies and work toward greater legal equality for women see competing 4 16 death of jane mccrea john vanderlyn painted this scene decades after the event occurred.
he took liberties with history.
mccreas fianc the military figure rushing to rescue her circled in red wears the blue uniform of a continental soldier.
in reality mccrea was a loyalist and her fianc a british regular.
libertys daughters women and the revolutionary movement women took an active role in the revolutionary cause.
one of the most outspoken female patriots was mercy otis warren wife of patriot leader james warren and sister of james otis.
warrens gifts as a poet playwright and eventually historian allowed her to champion the american cause in literary endeavors.
her satirical plays mocked british policy and leading british politicians and military figures.
the fictional names of the characters in her plays communicated warrens disdain for the british.
her scathing satire mocked the actions of general hateall secretary of state dupe and governor rapatio.
these sinister plotters against american liberty were matched by talented why did so many indians side with the british during the american revolution.

4 18 right cadwalader family charles wilson peales portrait of the cadwalader family evokes the ideal of companionate marriage in which husbands and wives enjoyed an intimate and egalitarian relationship within marriage.
revolutionary america change and transformation 1764 1783 visions remember the ladies.
a few women even demanded a measure of political equality at least for women who owned property.
one supporter of this idea was hannah corbin sister of patriot leader richard henry lee.
while abigail adams was a model of female propriety corbins unconventional lifestyle made her acutely aware of the inferior legal status of women.
after her husband died at age 35 corbin managed their plantation.
her husbands will stipulated that if she ever remarried corbin would lose control of the estate.
corbin was unwilling to accept the choice of remaining a widow or losing control of her property.
rejecting contemporary moral codes she began a common law relationship with another man living together as husband and wife without being legally married.
the fact that they were not legally married allowed her to preserve control of her estate.
the defiant and independent corbin later asked her brother why women who owned property were prohibited from voting.
lee could provide no reasonable response.
he even conceded that in theory allowing such women to vote was plausible but noted that it has never been the practice either here or in england and speculated that perhaps twas thought rather out of character for women to press into those tumultuous assemblages of men every state except new jersey limited suffrage to men.
it is not clear if new jerseys omission was deliberate or accidental.
still new jersey women who fulfilled the states property requirements took full advantage of this omission and voted in elections until the state legislature revoked this right in 1807.
was hannah corbins argument for womens suffrage consistent with whig theory.
although the revolution did not usher in the legal or political changes sought by adams and corbin the ideas of equality espoused by the revolution did influence marriage and family life.
lucy knox wife of general henry knox told her husband a year after the declaration of independence to not consider yourself as commander in chief of your own house but recognize that there is such a thing as equal command she viewed marriage as an egalitarian relationship between husband and wife in which the two lived together as companions.
scholars describe this as companionate marriage.
the revolution not only altered ideas about marriage but also changed attitudes about patriarchal authority a fact reflected in the portraiture of the day.
these changes are evident if one compares the pre revolutionary era painting of the winslow family 4 17 and the revolutionaryera portrait of the cadwalader family 4 18.
in his painting of the cadwalader family charles wilson peale gives a model of a companionate marriage.
a comparison of the portraits shows how ideas of family relations including the relationship between husband and wife and parents and children had changed.
in peales painting john and elizabeth cadwalader look directly at one another.
his hand rests on hers and their young child reaches for the peach held by her father.
the intimacy of the family is evidenced in the physical closeness of its members.
by contrast the portrait of the winslow family reveals little of this closeness.
the husband has no physical contact with his wife or his children.
read the document adams family correspondence between abigail and john march april 1776 the radicalism of the american revolution competing visions remember the ladies a strong supporter of independence and an articulate and forceful personality abigail adams believed that the american revolution provided an opportunity for women to gain much needed legal reform.
this was particularly needed in property law where women were considered legally dead once they married.
in this spirited letter written shortly before congress declared independence from britain abigail made her displeasure with the inferior legal status of women clear to her husband.
in a dismissive reply adams nevertheless revealed how the revolutions ideas about equality permeated american society.
abigail adams to john adams 31 mar.
1776 i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors.
do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.
remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.
john adams to abigail adams 14 apr.
1776 as to your extraordinary code of laws i cannot but laugh.
we have been told that our struggle has loosened the bands of government every where.
that children and apprentices were disobedient that schools and colleges were grown turbulent that indians slighted their guardians and negroes grew insolent to their masters.
but your letter was the first intimation that another tribe more numerous and powerful than all the rest were grown discontented this is rather too coarse a compliment but you are so saucy i wont blot it out.
depend upon it we know better than to repeal our masculine systems.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 in 1776 patriot leader john adams wrote that public virtue is the only foundation of republics.
there must be a positive passion for the public good the public interest adams echoed many americans views when he wrote that republican government depended on the concept of civic virtue which meant pursuing the public good and placing it ahead of personal interest or local attachments.
men were expected to serve in the militia sit on juries and if they were truly virtuous and wise take on the burden of public service as elected representatives.
women too were expected to play a major role in the political life of the new republic assuming the role of republican mothers and wives who would instill patriotism and virtue in their children and spouses.
americans of the revolutionary generation took their cues from the lessons of history particularly the example of the roman republic and its ideal of public virtue.
when dr joseph warren physician and patriot leader addressed bostonians on the fifth anniversary of the boston massacre in 1775 he literally donned a roman toga the long flowing gown that symbolized a free adult roman mans freedom and citizenship.
warrens dramatic gesture linking himself with roman republicanism was mirrored in the pages of nearly every american newspaper of the day where letters and essays on political matters were signed with pen names drawn from the history of the roman republic such as the senators brutus and cato and the general cincinnatus.
to mold a new generation of virtuous citizens americans looked to education religion and even architecture.
no american was more enthusiastic about architectures capacity to instruct than thomas jefferson.
public buildings jefferson wrote should be more than things of beauty and convenience above all they should state a creed rather than emulate contemporary georgian style buildings such as the pennsylvania state house see chapter 3 where the declaration of independence was drafted jefferson argued for a return to the purity of roman architecture.
in his design for the virginia state capitol pictured here jefferson recreated the simple beauty of roman architecture.
he believed that the capitol would inspire citizens to emulate the ideals of the ancient roman republic which included an emphasis on civic participation and public virtue.
in the decade following independence americans faith in their ability to create a virtuous republic was challenged.
an aborted coup led by disgruntled continental army officers conflicts between debtors and creditors and an uprising in western massachusetts drove the nation to a political crisis.
the postwar period tested americas faith in republicanism and led some leaders to abandon traditional republican theory with its emphasis on virtue and to embrace a new approach to constitutional government that relied on a balance of conflicting interests and a system of checks and balances.
the culmination of this struggle between the two competing visions of constitutional government was the u s constitution and the bill of rights.
we may look up to armies for our defense but virtue is our best security.
it is not possible that any state should long remain free where virtue is not supremely honored samuel adams 1775 chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 republicanism and the politics of virtue the american revolution marked a decisive break from ideas and values that had defined british culture for centuries.
monarchy and aristocracy were swept away.
america was now a republic.
republicanism placed a premium on the ideal of virtue.
as the poet playwright and historian mercy otis warren observed americans needed to cherish true genuine republican virtue the postwar period would test this commitment in a host of ways.
george washington the american cincinnatus no individual in america was more closely identified with the ideal of virtue than george washington.
a symbol of the virtuous citizen soldier responding to the summons of his nation and retiring to private life once his service was no longer needed washington was a model of civic virtue.
his reputation for public virtue and ability to command the respect of his troops had helped the beleaguered continental army during some of its more dire campaigns.
in 1783 washington faced a different challenge.
this time it was not the threat of enemy troops but the rumors of a military coup by the continental armys officers.
washington wielded his personal authority to win over disgruntled members of the corps and made an impassioned appeal to reason and virtue crushing the revolt without firing a shot.
washington had learned of rumors that the armys leadership would no longer tolerate congresss failure to deal with complaints about their pay and pensions.
an anonymous essay had circulated among officers suggesting that the time might soon come to turn their arms against congress itself.
the officers anger had been simmering for some time.
frustration with the confederation congress was widespread washington was well aware of the officers grievances.
he had complained about the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of congress on many occasions.
with no power to tax congress had to depend on voluntary contributions from the states.
without reliable revenue it was difficult to wage war or conduct the routine business of governing.
faced with a possible rebellion by his own officers washington resolved to why did americans believe washington was the modern cincinnatus.
address his men in person and persuade them of the folly of their plan.
on a dark wintry day in march 1783 washington traveled to newburgh new york to address the officer corps.
the assembled officers met in a makeshift building that some of them had dubbed the temple of virtue washington prepared to read a letter that he hoped would persuade the officers that their demands would be met.
fumbling to find a pair of glasses he had recently acquired he paused and then addressed the hushed crowd gentlemen you must pardon me.
i have grown grey in your service and now find myself growing blind the impact on his audience was dramatic.
there was something so natural so unaffected in his appeal major samuel shaw later wrote as rendered it superior to the most studied oratory and you might see sensibility moisten every eye washingtons own wartime sacrifices had already provided a powerful role model for the officer corps.
now the figure of their beloved commander growing gray and blind in the service of his country struck a resonant chord.
he exhorted his men to give posterity proof of unexampled patriotism and patient virtue civic virtue had triumphed over corruption and the newburgh conspiracy was crushed without a shot being fired.
another event that enhanced washingtons reputation as the embodiment of republican virtue was the public ceremony of turning over his military commission to congress after the war.
in annapolis maryland where congress was convened washington addressed a room crowded with congressional delegates and a gallery packed with well wishers.
having now finished the work assigned me he informed his audience many of whom were brought to tears i here offer my commission and take read the document george washington the newburgh address 1783 republicanism and the politics of virtue my leave of the employments of public life by abandoning public life and returning to his plow washington was seen as placing the good of the nation ahead of personal glory.
in the publics view washington had transformed himself into the modern cincinnatus an allusion to the ancient worlds great symbol of public virtue the roman general cincinnatus.
after serving the roman republic as its supreme commander cincinnatus had returned to his farm.
after resigning washington went on a triumphal tour of the nation.
in philadelphia he was saluted by cannons and ringing bells from the citys steeples.
he sat for portraits by americas leading painters and enjoyed listening to commemorative verses that compared him to cincinnatus.
well schooled in the history of the ancient roman republic americans understood that a popular military leaders decision to emulate romes dictatorial general julius caesar rather than cincinnatus would lead to despotism.
years later the virginia legislature commissioned the french sculptor jean antoine houdon to create a life sized statue of washington as the modern cincinnatus 5 1.
washington stands before a plow the symbol of the virtuous farmer the ideal embodied by cincinnatus.
no free government or the blessing of liberty can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice moderation temperance frugality and virtue.
virginia declaration of rights 1776 the politics of virtue views from the states the republican emphasis on virtue suffused american culture.
the first state constitutions drafted after independence used their declarations of rights to outline the rights of citizens and also instruct citizens in the premises of republican government.
in these declarations of rights the ideal of virtue was literally written into american law.
the virginia declaration of rights 1776 asserted that free government could not survive without a virtuous citizenry a point echoed by the massachusetts constitution four years later.
educating citizens in the importance of republican ideals became a priority for the new nation.
art architecture and even fashion were pressed into service to mold the character of a new generation of citizens.
jeffersons design for the new virginia capitol was the most ambitious visible symbol of instilling republican values by reforming architecture.
see the chapter opening image p.
the impact of the revolution was even seen in home furnishings.
before the revolution decorative elements on american furniture copied british fashions including fanciful designs such as the scrolled pediment with rosettes on this chest of drawers 5 1 george washington as the modern cincinnatus george washington is cast as the modern cincinnatus in this sculpture.
he stands in front of a plow and beside the roman fasces a bundle of rods and an ax that symbolized the legal power of magistrates.

symbols of republicanism such as the goddess of liberty replaced purely decorative elements.
after the revolution symbols that represented the republican values of the new nation replaced some of these purely decorative elements.
a beautifully crafted example of this adorns a chest of drawers made in salem massachusetts 5 3.
the broken pediment is a simple classical design.
gone is the fancy carving in the pediment of the late colonial chest 5 2.
in its place is the goddess of liberty herself.
to reinforce the ideal of roman republicanism the chest has two classical columns.
these flank another set of carvings that illustrate the prosperity that republicanism will bring to the new nation.
education was another means of inculcating virtue.
the massachusetts constitution expressly linked republicanism virtue and education.
the state achieved this by providing public primary education for boys and girls.
several of the larger towns also provided secondary education for boys.
thomas jefferson framed the most ambitious proposal to create a public system of education in 1778.
in a bill for the more general diffusion of knowledge he proposed source samuel mcintire chest on chest detail mahogany mahogany veneer ebony and satinwood inlay pine eighteenth century american arts no.

that virginia adopt a publicly funded system of education.
white children including boys and girls would be educated at public expense for three years.
the best male students would then be selected for secondary education and a small select group from among this cohort would later attend the college of william and mary.
jefferson introduced his bill in the state legislature several times although it never passed.
jeffersons faith in education reflected his debt to the ideals of the enlightenment the international philosophical movement based on the notion that reason and science would improve humanity.
see chapter 3.
following the english philosopher john locke enlightenment thinkers believed that people were born a blank slate upon which society could write its own moral code.
many american founders including jefferson were also influenced by other enlightenment ideas.
philosophers of the enlightenment believed that humans had an innate moral sense akin to the five physical senses.
in the same way that people see different shades of the color spectrum so the moral sense helped people see the difference between right and wrong.
one need only cultivate this inborn sense to produce enlightened citizens.
taken together lockean psychology and enlightenment moral theory led many americans to put enormous faith in educations ability to shape morality and mold character.
inspired by enlightenment ideals about education and the american revolutions faith in representative government americans founded new educational institutions to help create an enlightened citizenry.
ezra stiles the president of yale college wrote in 1786 that the spirit for academy making is vigorous the charter for one of these new academies in north carolina declared that the good education of youth has the most direct tendency to promote the virtue increase the wealth and extend the fame of any people north carolina was one of the states that founded a university.
georgia and vermont also established public institutions of higher education.
among the new private colleges were williams massachusetts transylvania kentucky the college of charleston south carolina and bowdoin maine.
educators also published new republican materials to instruct children in reading writing and arithmetic.
spellers and readers included patriotic lessons with illustrations that reinforced their republican message.
in a book of alphabet rhymes for example the bald eagle from the great seal of read the document noah webster an american school teacher calls for an american language 1789 republicanism and the politics of virtue america the new nations official symbol represented the letter e 5 4.
the design of the great seal had gone through many versions before congress finally approved one that included an american eagle clutching an olive branch and thirteen arrows symbolizing the new governments power to make war and negotiate peace.
the thirteen states are represented by the same number of stars stripes and arrows.
charles thomson the secretary of congress observed that the eagle bore a shield to symbolize that the united states ought to rely on their own virtue the expansion of education opened up possibilities for white women.
whereas jeffersons plan for educational reform called for basic education for women other reformers recommended more ambitious plans to educate the nations female population.
jeffersons friend the eminent philadelphia physician benjamin rush offered a robust statement of the importance of education in a republic but also framed a bold call to educate women for their role as republican citizens.
women needed to be familiar with the political ideas of republicanism.
as the mothers of future citizens of the republic women had a special role to play.
rush was not alone in championing female education.
the philadelphia young ladies academy 1787 was typical of the new institutions for educating women.
in addition to music dance and needlework these new schools taught girls subjects such as rhetoric oratory and history once exclusively taught to boys.
martha ryan a student at one of the new schools in north carolina inscribed the phrase liberty or death in her cipher book 5 5.
although influenced by republican ideas her book also revealed the continuing importance of traditional ideas about womens roles.
bound into the book were penmanship exercises that intoned such traditional moral injunctions as honour father and mother images as history womens roles tradition and change explores the effects of republican ideas on womens roles page 134.
supporters of enlightenment ideas such as rush and jefferson believed that education would help nurture the virtue necessary for the survival of republicanism.
other americans however looked to religion to foster virtue.
one minister reminded his parishioners that although the civil authority have no right to establish religion it was still true that religion is connected with the morals of the people another minister noted that by instilling good sentiments into the tender minds 5 4 book of childrens verses this book of childrens verse uses americas new national symbol the bald eagle taken from the great seal of the united states.
educational materials such as this one included republican and patriotic themes.
5 5 martha ryans cipher book the cover of martha ryans cipher book proclaims liberty.
yet the book included penmanship exercises with such traditional precepts as honour father and mother a good girl will mind why was education so important to the founders of the american republic.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 images as history womens roles tradition and change although republicanism allowed some women to transform the roles assigned to them it retained the traditional view that a womans primary duties were to her family.
in the engraving keep within the compass the woman who stays within the compass enjoys a life of harmony and prosperity.
stepping outside it carried grave consequences.
republican ideals of womanhood were stitched into a needlework sampler prepared by a school girl nabby martin of providence rhode island.
samplers were a standard part of a young womans education.
nabby included images of young couples flowers and domestic animals common to pre revolution samplers but republican themes also show through.
the home the symbol of domesticity traditionally the heart and center image of a young girls sampler has been replaced by the rhode island state house.
politics not home is the center of this piece.
nabby also showed her respect for the republican emphasis on education by including the college of rhode island brown university.
as a female nabby martin was barred from the world of the state house and the college of rhode island but the inclusion of their images in her sampler is significant.
although working with an art form closely tied to womens roles martin turned her gaze to the wider world both buildings represented.
the republican message of the sampler is clear let virtue be a guide to thee.

republicanism and the politics of virtue of children and youth you will teach them to stand fast in their liberty post revolutionary america remained a predominantly protestant culture in which religious dissent was tolerated only within limits.
some states continued to bar catholics and jews from public office.
the assumption behind such laws was that only protestants could be counted on to have the necessary virtue to seek the public good.
although excluded from the full benefits of citizenship religious dissenters were allowed to worship according to the dictates of conscience.
most state bills of rights and constitutions guaranteed the free exercise of religion.
revolutionary ideas of liberty and equality slowly led states to abandon the notion that only protestants could be trusted to hold public office.
religious tests requiring potential office holders to swear a belief in the divinity of jesus as a requirement for holding public office were abolished in virginia 1785 georgia 1789 pennsylvania 1790 south carolina 1790 delaware 1792 and vermont 1793.
before the revolution many colonies provided direct government support to religion or followed the english practice of having an official church.
spurred by revolutionary ideals america moved toward the separation of church and state.
the post revolutionary era witnessed a move to disestablish the anglican church in those places where it enjoyed public funding.
two different justifications for the separation of church and state emerged.
for champions of the enlightenment such as jefferson separation of church and state was inspired by the fear that religion might use the power of government to oppress citizens of different religious views or that religion might corrupt government.
dissenting protestant sects notably the baptists and methodists opposed state support for religion for a different reason.
these groups had long felt oppressed by the state supported anglican church particularly by taxation to support that church.
for virginias baptists separation of church and state was a means to protect the purity of religion from corruption by government.
evangelicals and supporters of the enlightenment came together in virginia in 1785 when the state legislature considered a bill for non preferential aid for ministers of the christian religion.
since the scheme was non preferential it would not establish an official state church but rather provide funds to all protestant churches in a nondiscriminatory fashion.
patrick henry and richard henry lee two of the states leading politicians campaigned in favor of the bill.
james madison and thomas jefferson champions of enlightenment values led the opposition.
madison and jefferson outlined their case against state support for religion in the memorial and remonstrance against religious assessments 1785.
this essay not only was instrumental in defeating the bill it also became a landmark in american church state relations.
democracy triumphant.
according to traditional republican theory citizens were expected to defer to their betters who were assumed to be the most virtuous members of society.
before the american revolution the state legislatures were dominated by men of wealth.
as one legislator noted it is right that men of birth and fortune in every government that is free should be invested with power and enjoy higher honours than the people virtue according to this view required one to have the wealth supposedly necessary to cultivate wisdom and knowledge.
one newspaper writer captured this traditional conception of virtue when he wrote that representatives should be able in estate able in knowledge and learning the revolution however challenged this ideal substituting a more democratic theory of virtue.
a writer calling himself democritus captured the essence of this new theory when he urged that citizens vote only for a man of middling circumstances and common understanding not members of a wealthy or educated elite.
in nearly every state a new type of politician emerged who embodied the more democratic version of republicanism men such as new yorks abraham yates a shoemaker and pennsylvanias william findley a weaver.
supporters of the elitist republican view of politics mocked the humble origins of the new politicians and questioned their ability to function as legislators.
one contemporary political satirist took aim at findleys humble origins as a weaver it will be more honourable for such men to stay at their looms and knot threads than to come forward in a legislative capacity the post revolutionary debate over the meaning of virtue and democracy shaped politics.
when william smith a prosperous baltimore why did many supporters of republicanism fear democracy.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 flour merchant ran for office in 1789 his enemies attacked him by claiming that mr.
smith has distilled riches from the tears of the poor and grown fat upon their curses smiths supporters viewed his independence as one of his main qualifications for office.
in their view he was a man of great commercial knowledge of known integrity and possessed of a character and independent fortune which place him above temptation smiths support for this traditional idea of virtue was reflected in this portrait 5 6 painted by charles wilson peale.
rather than include symbols that reflected smiths life as a prosperous city merchant peale depicted smith as a simply dressed country gentlemen.
the books that the artist included poetical works on rural life reinforce this notion.
peale also placed smith in front of a roman column another visual cue to symbolize his virtue.
the debate over what made a good representative in part reflected a process of democratization in american culture.
the revolution greatly expanded the number of white male voters eligible to participate in the political process.
most states lowered property requirements for voting and pennsylvania abandoned such requirements entirely.
taken together the expansion of democratic ideas and changes in suffrage requirements changed the character of politics in america.
as this graph 5 7 reveals the impact on the composition of state legislatures was profound.
after the revolution the percentage of wealthy citizens elected to the legislature dropped and the numbers of those of the middling sort or middling classes increased.
one boston newspaper writer complained that since the war blustering ignorant men had unfortunately pushed themselves into office not everyone saw the rise of these new politicians in negative terms.
for those who believed in democracy these trends were a positive development.
now government included a class of citizens who hither to have thought it more for their interest to be contented with a humbler walk in life 5 6 william smith and his grandson the new democratic politiin this portrait of william smith the artist conjures up an image of a country cians favored policies designed gentleman who devoted himself to contemplation.

they introduced for example higher salaries for elected representatives encouraging ordinary people to serve in government.
they also made efforts to relocate state capitals inland so that travel to them would be easier for backcountry farmers.
debtors versus creditors economic issues proved particularly contentious in post revolutionary america.
spokesmen for these new politicians favored policies to ease the burdens of farmers and artisans.
stay laws created generous grace periods for the recovery of debts and protected farmers from having their farms seized for nonpayment of debts.
tender laws allowed farmers to pay debts with goods rather than hard currency.
merchants generally opposed these policies.
the lack of specie silver and gold currency hindered economic exchange.
spokesmen for debtors argued that government had an obligation to use paper money to ease the shortage of currency.
by expanding the money supply and printing more paper currency the government encouraged inflation.
increasing the amount of money in circulation facilitated commerce.
when done cautiously this type of inflationary policy provided a means of pumping up the economy.
as long as the government did not flood the moderate 62 wealthy 12 5 7 the democratization of the state legislatures the number of wealthy legislators decreased and the number of men of moderate wealth increased.
these changes were pronounced in parts of the mid atlantic and new england and are reflected in the data regarding property holdings of legislators elected in new york new jersey and new hampshire.

by encouraging economic activity paper money could provide an important tool for economic growth.
farmers were especially fond of this system because they could repay their debts with depreciated currency money that was worth less than the amount of the original debt.
this system however could function only if merchants did not dramatically raise prices to compensate for the declining value of paper money.
a rapid rise in prices could lead inflation to spiral out of control.
most merchants however viewed paper money as a bad policy that hurt their interests.
no state was more aggressive in using paper money to solve its financial problems than rhode island.
unfortunately however the decision to print large amounts of paper money never won the support of merchants in providence and newport.
when presented with paper money merchants increased prices and eventually refused to accept depreciated paper currency.
in response the state legislature imposed a steep fine on any merchant who refused to accept paper currency.

chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 life under the articles of confederation from the outset the articles of confederation americas first federal constitution was plagued by problems.
without the power to tax or coerce states to follow the treaties it had negotiated the confederation congress could not resolve the nations economic problems and diplomatic issues.
leaders also worried that the confederation lacked the military power to deal with rebellions or foreign foes.
no taxation with representation 5 8 continental paper currency the value of continental paper currency dropped precipitously as congress printed more money and faith in the value of the currency dwindled.
americans resented british efforts to tax them prior to the revolution.
given their fears of strong government and hostility to taxation the articles of confederation the weak constitution created by the confederation congress did not empower the new central government to tax americans.
instead the articles relied on requisitions made to the states to fund government business.
few states bothered to comply with these requisitions in a timely manner and the new government of the united states was plagued by shortages of funds.
although it lacked the power to tax congress had to fund the war.
to help pay for the war effort congress printed almost 250 million in paper currency that was not backed by gold or silver and led to staggering inflation.
by 1781 it took more than 150 continental dollars to purchase what had cost one dollar in 1777.
this dramatic drop in the value of continental currency led to the phrase as worthless as a continental to describe something with no value.
as 5 8 illustrates it would take a pile of continentals to purchase what a single dollar might have paid for less than five years before.
the treaty of paris 1783 formally ended hostilities between britain and the new united states of america.
peace did not however solve the economic problems that the new nation faced.
indeed the end of the war ushered in new economic why did the articles of confederation fail to give the confederation congress power to tax.
boycotts of british goods and the disruption of trade during wartime meant that consumers had been denied access to luxury items including china textiles and wine.
demand for british goods surged after the war and the new nation was flooded with imports.
british merchants encouraged americans to buy goods on credit.
american merchants by contrast now faced a host of new obstacles to trade with britain.
in particular the loss of the lucrative trade with the british west indies was a severe blow to the american economy.
americas trade deficit with britain drained what little gold and silver reserves were available to the nation.
american banks had to curtail loans.
when merchants were forced to call in debts to satisfy their british suppliers they included the debts individuals owed them.
this constriction of credit sent the economy into a tailspin.
the combination of restricted access to trade with britain and its empire falling agricultural prices and mounting debt produced the new nations first economic depression.
diplomacy frustration and stalemate the new nation also faced military challenges.
british troops were still garrisoned in parts of the ohio valley.
relations with the indian tribes along the frontier remained tense.
farther from the nations borders americans faced different problems.
without a powerful navy to protect american commerce ships were easy prey for pirates.
piracy was particularly rampant in the mediterranean where the north african states of morocco algiers tunis and tripoli known as the barbary states sanctioned it.
the barbary pirates extorted money from merchant vessels in exchange for safe passage.
failure to pay resulted in the seizure of ships and imprisonment of sailors.

in july 1785 when pirates captured two american ships algiers demanded nearly 60 000 in ransom to release the vessels and their crews.
the american navy was too weak to challenge these pirate fleets.
while the loss of claimed by trade burdened the nations spain russia fledgling economy the sad and england fate of american captives became a source of national humiliation.
frustration with the inability to defend its interests on the high seas grew but america faced even more serious problems closer to its borders.
defending the nations interests in the mediterranean would have to wait while america dealt with the threats posed by pacific indians and the british ocean and spanish in north america.
the map 5 9 shows the british and spanish presence along americas england borders a fact that increased spain american anxiety.
russia congress had little power united states to compel the states to live british held forts up to the nations treaty obligations including provisions requiring americans to pay prewar debts and compensate loyalists for property confiscated during the war.
britain used americas failure to comply with these provisions as a pretext for retaining control of its forts in the old northwest the region of the new nation bordering the great lakes 5 9.
these outposts allowed the british to continue their lucrative fur trade with the indians.
the war against britain had strained relations between america and its indian neighbors.
many indian peoples such as the iroquois in new york and the creeks in georgia had sided with the british.

in the old southwest spain frustrated americas efforts to secure the rights to navigate the mississippi river.
while british peace negotiators had sought to protect the interests of loyalists they did nothing to secure a just peace for their indian allies.
the leader of the mohawks another indian nation that had sided with the british pointed out that the government of view the map territorial claims in eastern america after the treaty of paris what diplomatic frustrations hampered the new american nation.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 george iii had no right whatever to grant away to the states of america their rights or properties without a manifest breach of all justice and equity given the absence of indian representation in the treaty that ended hostilities between the united states and britain it is hardly surprising that the interests of indian peoples were not reflected in the final terms.
the treaty of paris ceded the entire old northwest territory to the united states.
american diplomats were not sympathetic to the claims of indians.
operating under a theory of conquest in which indians were a subdued people american negotiators assumed that defeated tribes had to relinquish all claims to western lands.
rejecting this view indians organized to resist incursions.
rather than mark the start of an era of peace the period after the revolution was one of continued conflict between indians and americans.
those tribes that were best organized politically and militarily were better able to defend their interests against american expansionism.
the indian population east of the mississippi numbered between 150 000 and 200 000 and was divided into 85 different nations.
the white population of the new united states was approximately 2 4 million.
pressure to open up indian lands for white settlement created conflict.
indians had no illusions about the goal of american policy.
the insatiable desire for indian land led the creeks to bestow the name ecunnaunuxulgee on georgians people greedily grasping after the lands of red people when confronted with the determination of indians to defend their lands americans were forced to negotiate more fairly.
american leaders soon realized that missionary work and trade were more likely to secure harmonious relations than conquest and military confrontation.
by 1787 congress had shifted both its tone and strategy for dealing with indian policy.
in place of the theory of conquest congress recommended the utmost good faith in dealing with the indians.
the spanish presence in the old southwest was another threat.
navigation of the mississippi river was crucial for the economic development of this region.
goods traveling down the mississippi needed to be unloaded at new orleans and placed on ocean bound vessels.
spain denied americans free access to the mississippi and new orleans.
congress authorized secretary of foreign affairs john jay to negotiate with the spanish.
spain proposed opening its empire to trade with america if the united states renounced its claim to navigate the what was the theory of conquest and how did it influence diplomatic relations with indian peoples.
mississippi.
the terms would have been a boon to new england merchants who would have benefited from new trade opportunities with spanish america but alienated southerners particularly those in the southwest who viewed the mississippi as their pipeline to world markets.
settling the old northwest the most important achievement of the confederation period was the plan congress devised for western settlement.
a committee chaired by thomas jefferson devised the initial plan for settling the west 5 10.
this proposal imagined a rational mathematical scheme for carving out as many as 16 new states from the northwest territory.
jeffersons plan combined republican theories of self government with enlightenment ideas about geography.
boundaries would be drawn along an orderly grid after being surveyed.
reflecting his debt to classical republicanism jeffersons chose names for the new territories such as polypotamia land of many rivers republicanism guided this plan in other ways.
in his ordinance of 1784 jefferson proposed that new territories be incorporated into the union as states on an equal footing with the original thirteen.
jefferson also sought local selfgovernment for settlers almost immediately.
when the free population reached 20 000 a constitutional convention would set up a permanent state government.
the plan banned slavery after the year 1800 and recommended that land be made available in parcels small enough for average americans to purchase.
jefferson envisioned the northwest territory populated by white yeoman farmers.
the land ordinance of 1785 adopted by congress departed from jeffersons original proposal.
it called for the creation of townships of 36 square miles.
land was to be sold for no less than one dollar an acre in hard currency.
ordinary citizens would have had trouble raising this amount of cash and therefore had little chance to purchase land directly from the government.
jeffersons hope that western land could be sold directly to citizens and create a republic of small independent farmers was jettisoned in favor of a plan that favored speculators.
the northwest ordinance of 1787 was the final plan for the governance of the new territories.
this act was considerably less democratic than jeffersons original proposal but maintained life under the articles of confederation his orderly model for dividing up the territory.
governors appointed by congress would rule the northwest territories.
when the population reached 5 000 adult males settlers could elect their own territorial legislatures.

in springfield.
the failure of shayss rebellion the most serious challenge to government authority in the new nation gave additional impetus to those eager to reform the structure of the articles of confederation and create a more powerful central government.
george washington was among the most alarmed by events in massachusetts.
the one figure among the nations patriot elite who seemed relatively unfazed by the rebellion in western massachusetts was thomas jefferson who learned of the rebellion while living in paris and serving america as a diplomat.
read the document military reports on shayss rebellion the movement for constitutional reform the movement for constitutional reform the economic political and diplomatic problems faced by the confederation government including shayss rebellion inspired a small but talented group of politicians to advocate reform of the articles of confederation.
as nationalists men who believed in the need for a stronger national government they regarded constitutional reform as imperative.
rather than continue to put their faith in virtue nationalists sought to create a powerful central government to protect american interests abroad and deal with internal threats such as shayss rebellion.
for the nationalists the postwar era was a time of crisis that demanded decisive action if america were to survive.
nationalists proposed a new model of government to protect individual liberty and promote the common good.
the federal constitution created by this group relied on a system of checks and balances not virtue to protect liberty.
the road to philadelphia delegates from maryland and virginia gathered at george washingtons home in mount vernon 1785 to discuss economic matters.
a year later in annapolis maryland 1786 delegates from five states discussed the problems of the confederation.
finally in 1787 delegates from 12 of the 13 states gathered in philadelphia to reform the articles of confederation.
the 55 delegates in philadelphia included an impressive cast of characters.
virginia sent james madison and george mason two of its most esteemed political figures.
pennsylvanias representatives included the oldest delegate benjamin franklin then aged 81 and james wilson the nations premier legal mind.
new yorks delegation boasted the brilliant but brash alexander hamilton.
the delegates chose george washington to preside over the meeting.
lawyers dominated the convention and nearly all the delegates were wealthy men.
a strict rule of secrecy was imposed on the proceedings a decision that facilitated a more frank debate among the delegates but only intensified rumors about their activities.
the rule of secrecy was stringently enforced the windows of the pennsylvania state house were nailed shut and a guard posted at the door.
writing from france where he was serving as american minister jefferson described the assembly as a meeting of demigods men of such impressive accomplishments that they seemed like the mythical heroes of antiquity part human and part divine.
some contemporaries however were suspicious of the conventions secrecy.
one pennsylvania newspaper warned of the monster being fashioned behind a thick veil of secrecy later generations of americans have tended to echo jeffersons observations that the convention was composed of extraordinarily talented politicians a view illustrated by this mid nineteenth century painting by thomas rossiter 5 12 in which the founders are bathed in light not shrouded in secrecy.
large states versus small states instead of arguing over reforming the articles of confederation as originally intended the philadelphia convention took up a bold proposal offered by the virginia delegation.
the virginia plan drafted mainly by james madison abandoned the federal system created by the articles in favor of a new we have probably had too good an opinion of human nature in forming our confederation george washington 1786 what were the main features of the virginia plan.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 5 12 constitutional convention jeffersons observation that the framers of the constitution were an assembly of demigods is captured in thomas rossiters nineteenth century painting of the philadelphia convention.
rather than appearing in a dark conclave the members of the convention are bathed in light.
model of government that had both federal and national features.
the states would retain power but the new national government would be supreme in those areas in which it was given authority.
the virginia plan created a new government composed of a single executive the branch of government charged with among other things the execution of laws a two house legislature congress the lawmaking body and a separate judiciary courts.
the lower house of congress would be directly elected by the people and the upper house would be elected by the lower house from a list provided by the state legislatures.
under the articles of confederation small states such as maryland had the same vote as large states such as virginia.
rather than this one state one vote principle each state would have representation in proportion to its population.
the new congress would have the power to legislate in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent or in which the harmony of why did small states oppose the virginia plan.
the united states may be interrupted by the exercise of individual state legislation although this did not explicitly address nettlesome issues such as the power to tax such powers were clearly within the purview of this broad grant of authority.
the authors of the virginia plan especially james madison thought that a more general grant of authority rather than a long list of enumerated powers would be more politically acceptable to the delegates.
representatives from the small states opposed the virginia plan.
two weeks after the virginia plan was introduced william patterson of new jersey made a counterproposal often dubbed the new jersey plan.
it called for a modified federal system based on the existing articles of confederation.
it proposed a single legislature in which each state would have one vote which would maintain the parity between small and large states.
in contrast to the articles of confederation the new national legislature would be the supreme law read the document virginia or randolph plan the movement for constitutional reform of the land and would be binding on the states.
the national legislature would have the power to tax and regulate interstate commerce.
although the new jersey plan was defeated it had revealed the difficulty of reaching a consensus without accommodating the concerns of the small states which feared that the new system would give larger states inordinate influence over the new government.
the figure 5 13 shows the differences between the virginia and new jersey plans and how each differed from the articles of confederation.
although both of these plans would have given the new central government broad new powers particularly over economic matters representatives from the large and small states remained divided over how the legislature would be structured.
on june 29 1787 oliver ellsworth of connecticut reintroduced an earlier compromise that he and roger sherman also of connecticut had devised.
the plan provided for equal representation for large and small states in the upper house and a lower house in which representation would be apportioned on the basis of population.
on july 16 1787 the convention adopted the great compromise sometimes known as the connecticut compromise because of ellsworth and shermans role in framing it.
the great compromise solved one of the most difficult issues facing the convention the struggle over representation based on population versus equal representation among the states.
conflict over slavery although the connecticut compromise solved one of the most difficult problems faced by the convention it also focused attention on another equally contentious issue whether to count slaves in the apportionment of the new lower house.
the southern states seeking sufficient representation in the new legislature to protect slavery were determined that their slaves be counted.
opponents of slavery by contrast wished to see slaves taxed as property but did not wish to count them when calculating representation in the new lower house.
the convention settled on a solution in which slaves were counted as three fifths of a person for purposes of taxation and legislative apportionment.
the threefifths ratio had been worked out by the confederation congress earlier when it faced another issue pertaining to slavery.
conflict flared over the slave trade.
one of the most intense attacks on the slave trade was voiced by virginian george mason the largest slave owner in the convention who warned his fellow delegates of the threat to the republic of the institution of slavery every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant slavery discourages arts manufactures mason recommended ending the slave trade as a first step toward eliminating slavery.
several delegates viewed masons actions cynically.
virginia had an excess of slaves and would profit enormously from an internal slave trade if the external trade with africa were abolished.
south carolinian articles of confederation virginia plan new jersey plan structure of the legislature single house one state one vote two houses both determined by population single house one state one vote taxation no power to tax power to tax power to tax judicial power no judicial power apart from courts to hear admiralty cases federal judiciary federal judiciary single executive chosen by national legislature single or plural executive elected by congress executive power no permanent executive a committee of the states exercises executive functions when congress is not in session 5 13 comparison of the articles of confederation virginia and new jersey plans although the virginia and new jersey plans differed on representation each would have given the new government the vital power of taxation.
watch the video lecture slavery and the constitution how did the conflict over slavery shape the debates of the constitutional convention.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 the states were divided into different interests not by their difference of size but by other circumstances the most material of which resulted partly from climate but principally from the effects of their having or not having slaves james madison 1787 charles pinckney argued that all the great republics of the ancient world had accepted the necessity of slavery.
his cousin general charles cotesworth pinckney another delegate from south carolina told delegates that his state would never accept the constitution if the slave trade was banned.
again compromise held the convention together.
the new congress was denied the authority to ban the slave trade until 1808.
although the word slavery never appears in the constitution a number of clauses in the document protected it.
article iv section 2 prevented fugitive slaves defined as any person held to service or labour in one state from fleeing to another state to seek asylum and freedom.
article i section 8 prohibited the national government from taxing the exports of any state a provision that prevented the products of slave labor such as rice indigo tobacco or sugar from being singled out for sanctions by those hostile to slavery.
in james madisons view the greatest division in the convention was not the conflict between large states and small states but slavery.
filling out the constitutional design after sorting out the structure of the legislative branch of government the convention struggled over the executive branch.
george mason argued for a three man executive.
a plural executive he argued could better represent the different regional interests of the nation.
rejecting this proposal the convention settled on a unitary executive.
there was also disagreement over how to choose the executive.
james wilson wanted to see the executive elected by the people whereas mason argued that the people lacked the wisdom to make such a decision.
roger shermans plan to have the national legislature pick how did the electoral college strengthen the powers of the states and further the ideals of republicanism.
the executive was challenged as a threat to the separation of powers.
eventually the convention settled on an electoral college composed of men chosen by each state in a manner to be determined by the individual state legislatures.
by giving the states some control over selection of the president this system provided another way of strengthening the power of the states within the new federal system.
the electoral college also reflected the ideals of republicanism held by the delegates.
by creating a filtering mechanism for the selection of the president the electoral college was designed to help ensure that the men chosen were drawn from the ranks of the leading citizens men renowned for their knowledge and virtue.
delegates also clashed over the term of office that the executive would serve.
alexander hamilton proposed that the executive have a life term but this leaned too close to monarchy for most delegates.
some delegates favored a single term of as much as seven years while others argued that a shorter term with the possibility of reelection would provide a greater check on the president.
the convention ultimately settled on a four year term with no limits on the number of terms a president might serve.
the final structure of the executive branch was detailed in article ii of the constitution.
throughout august the convention sketched the barest outline for the third branch of government the federal judiciary.
a new supreme court was created and congress was authorized to create such inferior courts as it deemed necessary.
the supreme courts authority extended in all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made under their authority although a number of delegates assumed that the courts would exercise the power of judicial review the power to declare acts of congress the movement for constitutional reform unconstitutional the constitution failed to make such power explicit.
two delegates from new york robert yates and john lansing left before the document was completed and therefore did not sign it.
three other delegates edmund randolph george mason and elbridge gerry refused to sign the constitution because of their reservations about its final draft.
despite these protests benjamin franklin captured the feelings of many delegates when he wrote that despite its faults it was doubtful whether any other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better constitution.
it therefore astonishes me sir to find this system approaching as near to perfection as it does after the convention concluded its work and the text of the constitution was made public a woman asked franklin well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic replied the doctor if you can keep it the constitution reflected the give and take and the spirit of compromise that prevailed at the convention.
the new constitution was a radical departure from the articles of confederation 5 14.
the powerful national legislature created by the constitution was given authority to enact all laws necessary and proper to carrying out responsibilities delegated by the constitution.
the new national legislature had two houses a house of representatives and a senate.
each state had two senators.
representation in the house of representatives was based on population with slaves counting as three fifths of a person.
amendments to the constitution would require the approval of three quarters of the states not the unanimous consent required under the articles.
although executive power under the articles of confederation had been weak the new president could veto legislation negotiate treaties and issue pardons.
the ill defined powers of the new supreme court left some wondering if the judiciary would be the weakest of the three branches not co equal with the legislature and the executive.
the new federal constitution also broke with well established precedents that had shaped the state constitutions drafted after the revolution.
unlike the typical state constitution the federal constitution did not include a declaration of rights stating the basic rights and liberties retained by the people nor did it reassert the basic republican principles upon which government rested.
most state constitutions created relatively weak executives another marked contrast with the new federal constitution and its strong executive branch.
articles of confederation constitution structure of the legislature single house one state one vote two houses one determined by population upper house equal state representation taxation no power to tax power to tax judicial power no judicial power apart from courts to hear admiralty cases federal judiciary executive power no permanent executive a committee of the states exercises executive functions when congress is not in session executive chosen by electors chosen by state legislators 5 14 comparison of the articles of confederation and the constitution as this chart shows the new federal government created by the constitution was far more powerful than the old government under the articles of confederation.
what were the most important differences between the federal constitution and the typical state constitutions of this period.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 the great debate the publication of the constitution inaugurated one of the most vigorous political campaigns in american history.
in taverns and town squares americans argued over the new constitution.
as one contemporary remarked the plan of a government proposed to us by the convention affords matter for conversation to every rank of beings from the governor to the door keeper soon two sides emerged in the debate over ratification.
federalists versus anti federalists the supporters of the constitution described themselves as federalists thus saddling their opponents with the name anti federalists.
never entirely happy with this name opponents of the constitution complained that they were the true supporters of federalism and attacked pro constitutional forces as consolidationists who wished to consolidate the union into a single national government and rob the states of their power.
looking back on the bitter struggle over ratification one anti federalist quipped that because the issue before the nation was ratification of the constitution the two sides were more aptly described as rats and anti rats citizens paraded raised their glasses to toast or attacked the new government.
some even rioted to express their sentiments.
anti federalists in carlisle pennsylvania burned an effigy of federalist james wilson to express their disapproval of the new constitution.
wilson a renowned lawyer and a recent immigrant from scotland was one of the most important supporters of the constitution in pennsylvania.
he was also an easy target for ridicule since he spoke with a thick scottish accent that his enemies mocked.
the supporters of the constitution also took to the streets to defend it and occasionally to intimidate their opponents.
a federalist crowd wrecked the printing presses of anti federalist publishers in new york city.
these disturbances were the exception however not the rule.
the debate could be heated but americans typically confined their passions to the printed page.
hundreds of columns of newspaper text were devoted to the debate over the merits of the constitution and dozens of pamphlets were written for and against it.
the federalist for example a sophisticated defense of the constitution written by john jay alexander hamilton and james madison was first published as newspaper essays in new york.
it is now regarded by many scholars as americas most important contribution to western why did federalist and anti federalist authors adopt names such as publius and brutus.
political philosophy.
writing under the pen name publius a hero of the roman republic the authors hoped to cloak themselves in the toga of roman virtue.
this strategy was designed to focus the publics attention on the ideas not the men responsible for the essays.
the federalist not only responded to anti federalist criticism it also provided a sophisticated analysis of republican government and a point by point discussion of the merits of the constitution.
although its influence on the outcome of ratification was modest the federalist soon became the favorite text of judges legislators and others interested in interpreting the meaning of the constitution.
it continues to be the text most often cited by the supreme court when trying to identify the original understanding of the constitution.
anti federalists produced no single text comparable to the federalist.
however the writings of elbridge gerry and george mason prominent anti federalists who had participated in the philadelphia convention but had refused to sign the constitution were widely reprinted.
authors who adopted the pen names brutus and federal farmer each framed sophisticated critiques of the constitution.
brutus invoked the same ideal of roman virtue that publius had appropriated for the supporters of the constitution.
the name federal farmer traded on the association of republican ideals of simplicity associated with the ideal of the yeoman farmer.
both texts developed an alternative vision of republican government.
rather than accept the need for a powerful central government anti federalists clung to the idea of a system in which the bulk of governmental functions would continue to reside in the states.
see competing visions brutus and publius debate the nature of republicanism.
although the struggle over ratification produced some of the most intellectually sophisticated writings in american history in other respects it was a textbook example of negative campaigning.
if publius and brutus provided an example of dispassionate reason metaphorically invoking roman ideals of virtue by their pen names other authors on both sides were not above the great debate competing visions bru brutus utus and and publius publius s debate debate the e nature nature o f republicanism repub blicanis sm of one disagreement one di between n federalists fed fe eralists and d anti federalists ant ntii federalists arose arosse from fro their different differeent views v of the nature naatu ture r of republican government.

federalists publius the anti federalist author brutus defended the traditional idea that a free republic could survive only in a small area in which the people shared the same values culture and history.
when a republic became too large he argued it became contentious and the common good was sacrificed as competing factions vied to promote their own narrow interests.
in short brutus was confident that history demonstrated the impossibility of a nation the size of the new united states remaining a free republic without a confederation style government.
if respect is to be paid to the opinion of the greatest and wisest men who have ever thought or wrote on the science of government we shall be constrained to conclude that a free republic cannot succeed over a country of such immense extent.
as that of the whole united states.
history furnishes no example of a free republic any thing like the extent of the united states.
the grecian republics were of small extent so also was that of the romans.
in a republic the manners sentiments and interests of the people should be similar.
if this be not the case there will be a constant clashing of opinions and the representatives of one part will be continually striving against those of the other.
this will retard the operations of government and prevent such conclusions as will promote the public good.
if we apply this remark to the condition of the united states we shall be convinced that it forbids that we should be one government.
writing as publius in the federalist james madison disputed the traditional theory of republicanism advanced by brutus and other anti federalists.
by increasing the number of factions and expanding the size of the republic publius argued that it would be less likely for any one faction to further their agenda and dominate politics.
according to this new theory politics would become a kaleidoscope of ever shifting alliances.
moreover in a larger republic politics itself would act like a filter and be more likely to select leaders of skill and talents.
finally madison noted that the federal system would act like a fire wall isolating factions within individual states and preventing them from spreading their wicked agendas to other states.
men of factious tempers of local prejudices or of sinister designs may by intrigue by corruption or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then betray the interests of the people.
the question resulting is whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public.
the smaller the society.
the fewer the distinct parties and interests the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party.
the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression.
extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens or if such a common motive exists it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other.
the influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states.
in the extent and proper structure of the union therefore we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government.
why did brutus and publius differ about the relationship between size and republicanism.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 slinging mud when it served their interests.
federalists for example denounced their opponents as shaysites a charge repeated in the satirical print the looking glass for 1787 5 15.
in this cartoon connecticut appears stuck in the mud a cart laden with debt is dragged in opposite directions by federalists and anti federalists.
the artist who created this pro federalist political cartoon stooped lower than most one anti federalist character has his trousers pulled down around his ankles and his bottom exposed to his federalist opponents.
anti federalists charged that federalists were part of an aristocratic elite who wished to dominate common folk.
amos singletary from massachusetts warned his fellow citizens that the lawyers and rich merchants who backed the constitution favored the interests of the aristocratic few over those of the democratic many.
in his view the new constitution would undo the democratic reforms of the revolution returning control to powerful economic groups.
although anti federalism attracted supporters of democracy such as singletary it also appealed to wealthy planters such as virginias george mason who was less concerned about the constitutions antidemocratic features and more worried about the centralization of power.
mason feared that liberty would be annihilated if a central government gained too much power.
although anti federalists did not agree about everything they shared important objections to the constitution.
the essential anti federalist critique emerged early in the debate.
at the top was the fear of consolidation the concern that the federal government would absorb all power into its orbit.
anti federalists believed that there would be too few representatives in congress to represent the diverse interests of the american people.
representatives would also live far from their constituents and lose touch with the concerns of those they served.
the extensive powers of the president and the potentially vast jurisdiction of the supreme court also worried anti federalists who feared that the federal government would become tyrannical.
the absence of a bill of rights proved to be one of the anti federalists most effective criticisms.
in their view history demonstrated that once in power even the most virtuous rulers were tempted to increase their powers at the expense of popular liberty.
a written declaration stating clearly the rights and powers retained by the people was therefore an essential safeguard for liberty.
rather than accept that the omission of a bill of rights was a serious flaw in the constitution federalists argued that it was unnecessary.
james wilson defended the absence of a bill of rights by noting that the new government was one of delegated power only and hence all powers not ceded to it were retained by the how does the looking glass for 1787 portray the anti federalists.
people and the states.
it would have been superfluous and absurd he observed to stipulate that we should enjoy those privileges of which we are not divested either by the intention or the act that brought that body into existence in the federalist publius argued that the inclusion of a bill of rights would be dangerous.
by listing exactly which rights were protected the new government would by implication exclude other rights that it did not explicitly include among those reserved to the people.
since it would be impossible to create a list of all the rights enjoyed by the people it was better not to list any.
for an overview of disagreement between federalists and anti federalists see 5 16.
ratification federalists realized that anti federalists would try to block unconditional ratification and seek prior amendments to the constitution.
early and decisive federalist successes in delaware new jersey pennsylvania georgia and connecticut established a momentum that federalists capitalized on to achieve their goal of unconditional ratification.
eventually in massachusetts fed 5 15 the looking glass for 1787 this federalist political cartoon from connecticut portrays the state as a cart stuck in the mud and weighed down by paper money and debt.
while federalists proclaim comply with congress and pull the state toward a bright sun the antifederalists exclaim success to shays and drag the cart toward a shadowy future symbolized by the dark clouds.
these lawyers and men of learning and moneyed men that talk so finely and gloss over matters so smoothly to make us poor illiterate people swallow down the pill expect to get into congress themselves.
and then they will swallow up all us little folks like the great leviathan amos singletary 1788 read the document patrick henry speaks against the constitution the great debate 5 16 anti federalist versus federalist ideas anti federalists and federalists each believed in republican government but they disagreed over how to structure such a government to protect liberty.
james madison george mason federalists anti federalists support strong central government oppose strong central government oppose bill of rights as unnecessary and perhaps even harmful to liberty favor inclusion of a bill of rights as necessary to protect liberty doubt effectiveness of militia and favor federal standing army favor militia and oppose federal standing army republicanism can survive only in a large and diverse republic republicanism can survive only in a small republic virtue is a weak foundation for republicanism a system of checks and balances is better suited to preserving a republican government against corruption republicanism depends on a virtuous population to prevent corruption eralist faced a powerful anti federalist opposition and conceded the need for subsequent amendment once the constitution was adopted.
federalists willingness to compromise also won over moderates who might have opposed the constitution in battleground states if men were angels no government would be necessary.
if angels were to govern men neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.
in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself james madison the federalist 1788 read the document federalist no.
10 such as massachusetts.
had the federalists maintained a hard line sticking to james wilsons argument that a bill of rights was unnecessary the constitution might never have been ratified.
if states with powerful wellorganized anti federalist coalitions such as virginia had held ratification conventions earlier the constitution might have been defeated or been radically altered by amendments.
new hampshires vote to ratify on june 21 1788 gave federalists the nine states needed to ratify the constitution.
although the constitution was now the new law of the land it was vital to persuade anti federalists in virginia and new york to accept it.
despite opposition from anti federalists like patrick henry virginia ratified the constitution on june 25.
that left only new york north carolina and rhode island outside the new union.
in new york city federalists staged a grand federal procession to show that the constitution enjoyed broad support particularly among the citys artisans who saw a strong government as a way to protect their economic interests from foreign competition.
the parade drew members from virtually all of the citys crafts and included dozens of floats.
printers for example marched alongside a printing press mounted on a horse drawn cart which churned out an ode that praised the constitution.
a banner with the name publius the author of the federalist flew proudly above the press and the printers sported caps with liberty of press written in large letters.
another group of artisans carried this banner 5 17 which celebrated their work with pewter an alloy of tin and lead that was widely used to make tableware.
their banner carried the following verses the federal plan most solid and secure americans their freedom will ensure all arts shall flourish in columbias land and all her sons join as one social band new york anti federalists had a dilemma should they continue to oppose the constitution or work within the new system of government.
to understand how they made their decision see choices and consequences to ratify or not.
new yorks ratification dashed the last hopes of opponents of the constitution to secure prior amendments.
federalists had secured unconditional ratification of the new frame of government.
most americans probably opposed the constitution when it was first proposed and the vote on ratification was close in many states.
several factors helped account for the federalists victory.
supporters of the constitution organized themselves around a well defined goal ratification.
by contrast why did urban artisans support the constitution.
chapter 5 a virtuous republic creating a workable government 1783 1789 choices and consequences to ratify or not by the time new yorks ratification convention met in poughkeepsie nine states had already ratified the constitution making it the new law of the land.
could anti federalists continue to oppose the constitution and thereby place new york outside the new nation.
many anti federalists considered such a prospect unrealistic so they turned to the question of amending the constitution.
the outcome of the convention depended on the decisions of moderate anti federalists led by the merchant melancton smith.
new york anti federalists faced a momentous decision continue to oppose the constitution or work within the new system of government.
choices support the constitution with the promise that the first congress would amend it.
support the constitution provisionally until it was amended but consider seceding from the union if amendments were not made.
block ratification and continue to oppose the constitution.
decision smith opted for the first choice making new york the eleventh state to ratify the constitution on july 25 1787.
in a powerful speech in the new york convention he reiterated his hope for future amendments but recognized the need to work through the mode prescribed by the constitution consequences if smith and other swing anti federalist delegates in the convention had opposed ratification new york would have remained outside the union and the new nation might have split into separate confederacies.
if smith and other moderates had insisted on amendments before ratification federalists would likely have stood their ground and the convention might have failed to ratify the constitution.
as it was smiths decision put more pressure on rhode island and north carolina to accept the new constitution.
it also gave impetus to the move to amend the constitution after ratification.
federalist newspapers seized on the visual image of a roman style temple to represent the nation and added a new column for each state that voted to ratify the constitution.
the pillars and temple metaphor like jeffersons model for the virginia state capitol evoked roman ideals of virtue and liberty.
continuing controversies why did new york anti federalists accept the constitution and wait for amendments.
although the anti federalists were defeated in 1788 many of their fears and ideals about government still resonate in american politics.
were the anti federalists backward looking politicians who failed to grasp the genius of the new constitution or visionaries who predicted that the growth and centralization of american government might pose a threat to liberty.
