in 1777 british forces stayed on the offensive.
general howe attacked the patriot capital philadelphia from the south and captured it in early october.
meanwhile general burgoyne and colonel st leger launched simultaneous invasions from canada.
with the help of thousands of new england militiamen american troops commanded by general horatio gates defeated burgoyne in august at bennington vermont and in october at saratoga new york the military turning point in the war.
not mask british military superiority.
these are the times wrote thomas paine that try mens souls armies and strategies thanks in part to general howe the rebellion survived.
howe had opposed the coercive acts of 1774 and still hoped for a political compromise.
so he did not try to destroy the american army but instead tried to show its weakness and persuade the continental congress to give up the struggle.
howes restrained tactics cost britain the opportunity to nip the rebellion in the bud.
for his part washington acted cautiously to avoid a major defeat on our side the war should be defensive he told congress.
his strategy was to draw the british away from the seacoast extend their lines of supply and sap their morale.
congress had promised washington a regular force of 75 000 men but the continental army never reached even a third of that number.

when the virginia gentry imposed a military draft and three years of service on propertyless men the lazy fellows who lurk about and are pests to society they resisted so fiercely that the legislature had to pay them substantial bounties and agree to shorter terms of service.
the identify causes continental soldiers recruited in what factors made it difmaryland by general william ficult for the continental congress to create an smallwood were poor american effective army.
youths and older foreign born men often british ex convicts and former indentured servants.
most enlisted for the 20 cash bonus about 2 000 today and the promise of 100 acres of land.
molding such recruits into an effective fighting force was nearly impossible.
inexperienced soldiers panicked in the face of british attacks thousands deserted unwilling to submit to the discipline of military life.
the soldiers who stayed resented the contempt their officers had for the camp followers the women who made do with the meager supplies provided to feed and care for the troops.
general philip schuyler of new york complained that his troops were destitute of provisions without camp equipage with little ammunition and not a single piece of cannon the continental army was not only poorly supplied but was also held in suspicion by radical whig patriots who believed that a standing army was a threat to liberty.
even in wartime they preferred militias to a professional fighting force.
given these handicaps washington and his army were fortunate to have escaped an overwhelming defeat.
victory at saratoga after howe failed to achieve an overwhelming victory lord north and his colonial secretary lord george germain launched another major military campaign in 1777.
isolating new england remained the primary goal.
to achieve it germain planned a three pronged chapter 6 attack converging on albany new york.
general john burgoyne would lead a large contingent of regulars south from quebec colonel barry st leger and a force of iroquois would attack from the west and general howe would lead troops north from new york city.
howe instead decided to attack philadelphia the home of the continental congress hoping to end the rebellion with a single decisive blow.
but instead of marching quickly across new jersey howe loaded his troops onto boats and sailed up the chesapeake bay to attack philadelphia from the south.
the plan worked.
howes troops easily outflanked the american positions along brandywine creek in delaware and in late september marched triumphantly into philadelphia.
however the capture of the rebels capital did not end the uprising the continental congress determined to continue the struggle fled to the countryside.
howes slow campaign against philadelphia contributed to the defeat of burgoynes army at saratoga.
burgoynes troops had at first advanced quickly overwhelming the american defenses at fort ticonderoga in early july and driving south toward the hudson river.
then they stalled.
burgoyne nicknamed gentleman johnny was used to high living and had fought in europe in a leisurely fashion believing his large army would easily dominate the rebels he stopped early each day to pitch comfortable tents and eat elaborate dinners with his officers.
the american troops led by general horatio gates also slowed burgoynes progress by felling huge trees in his path and raiding british supply lines to canada.
at summers end burgoynes army of 6 000 british and german troops and 600 loyalists and indians was stuck near saratoga new york.
desperate for food and horses in august the british raided nearby bennington vermont but were beaten back by 2 000 american militiamen.
patriot forces in the mohawk valley also threw st leger and the iroquois into retreat.
making matters worse the british commander in new york city recalled 4 000 troops he had sent toward albany and ordered them to philadelphia to bolster howes force.
while burgoyne waited in vain for help thousands of patriot militiamen from massachusetts new hampshire and new york joined gates blocking burgoyne in a series of skirmishes that finally gave the british no avenue of escape.
the patriots swarmed around the army like birds of prey reported an english sergeant and in october 1777 they forced burgoyne to surrender.
the victory at saratoga was the turning point of the war.
the patriots captured more than 5 000 british making war and republican governments 1776 1789 joseph brant mohawk chief thayendanegea known to whites as joseph brant was a devout member of the church of england and helped to translate the bible into the mohawk language.
brant persuaded four of the six iroquois nations to support britain in the war.
in 1778 and 1779 he led iroquois warriors and tory rangers in devastating attacks on american settlements in the wyoming valley of pennsylvania and cherry valley in new york.

the perils of war the patriots triumph at saratoga was tempered by wartime difficulties.
a british naval blockade cut off supplies of european manufactures and disrupted the new england fishing industry meanwhile the british occupation of boston new york and philadelphia reduced trade.
as patriots along with unemployed artisans and laborers moved to the countryside new york citys population declined from 21 000 to 10 000.
the british blockade cut tobacco exports in the chesapeake so planters grew grain to sell to the contending armies.
all across the land farmers and artisans adapted to a war economy.
with goods now scarce governments requisitioned military supplies directly from the people.
in 1776 connecticut officials asked the citizens of hartford to part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 american militiamen beset by continuing shortages of cloth the patriot army dressed in a variety of uniforms and fabrics.

we have sowd our oats as you desired sarah cobb paine wrote to her absent husband.
had i been master i should have planted it to corn their selfesteem boosted by wartime activities some women expected greater legal rights in the new republican society.
still goods remained scarce and pricey.
hardpressed consumers assailed shopkeepers as enemies extortioners and monopolizers and called for government regulation.
but when the new england states imposed price ceilings in 1777 many farmers and artisans refused to sell their goods.
ultimately a government official admitted consumers had to pay the higher market prices or submit to starving the fighting endangered tens of thousands of civilians.
a british officer lord rawdon favored giving free liberty to the soldiers to ravage the country at will that these infatuated creatures may feel what a calamity war is as british and american armies marched back and forth across new jersey they forced patriot and loyalist families to flee their homes to escape arrest or worse.
soldiers and partisans looted farms and disorderly troops harassed and raped women and girls.
an army even a friendly one are a dreadful scourge to any people wrote one connecticut soldier.
you cannot imagine what devastation and distress mark their steps the war divided many farm communities.
patriots formed committees of safety to collect taxes and seized the property of those who refused to pay.
every body submitted to our sovereign lord the mob lamented a loyalist preacher.
in parts of maryland the number of nonassociators those who refused to join either side was so large that they successfully defied patriot mobs.
stand off you dammed rebel sons of bitches shouted robert davis of anne arundel county i will shoot you if you come any nearer financial crisis such defiance exposed the weakness of patriot governments.
most states were afraid to raise taxes so officials issued bonds to secure gold or silver from wealthy individuals.
when those funds ran out individual states financed the war by issuing so much paper money some 260 million all told that it lost worth and most people refused to accept it at face value.
in north carolina even tax collectors eventually rejected the states currency.
the finances of the continental congress collapsed too despite the efforts of philadelphia merchant robert morris the governments chief treasury official.
because the congress lacked the authority to impose taxes morris relied on funds requisitioned from the states but the states paid late or not at all.
so morris secured loans from france and holland and sold continental loan certificates to some thirteen thousand firms and individuals.
all the while the congress was issuing paper money some 200 million between 1776 and 1779 which like state currencies quickly fell in value.
in 1778 a family needed 7 in continental bills to buy goods worth 1 in gold or silver.
as the exchange rate deteriorated to 42 to 1 in chapter 6 making war and republican governments 1776 1789 paper currency testifying to their independent status the new state governments printed their own currencies.
rejecting the english system of pounds and shillings virginia used the spanish gold dollar as its basic unit of currency although the equivalent in english pounds is also shown.
initially 1 200 was equal to 360 a ratio of 3 3 to 1.
by 1781 virginia had printed so much paper money to pay its soldiers and wartime expenses that the value of its currency had depreciated.
it now took 40 in virginia currency to buy the same amount of goods as 1 sterling.

valley forge fears reached their peak during the winter of 1777.
while howes army lived comfortably in philadelphia washingtons army retreated 20 miles to valley forge where 12 000 soldiers and hundreds of camp followers suffered horribly.

poor food hard lodging cold weather fatigue nasty clothes nasty cookery.
why are we sent here to starve and freeze nearby farmers refused to help.
some were pacifists quakers and german sectarians unwilling to support either side.
others looked out for their own families selling grain for gold from british quartermasters but refusing depreciated continental currency.
such a dearth of public spirit and want of public virtue lamented washington.
by spring more than 200 officers had resigned 1 000 hungry soldiers had deserted and another 3 000 had died from malnutrition and disease.
that winter at valley forge took as many american lives as had two years of fighting.
in this dark hour baron von steuben raised the readiness of the american army.
a former prussian military officer von steuben was one of a handful of republican minded foreign aristocrats who joined the american cause.
appointed as inspector general of the continental army he instituted a strict drill system and encouraged officers to become more professional.
thanks to von steuben the smaller army that emerged from valley forge in the spring of 1778 was a much tougher and better disciplined force.
the path to victory 1778 1783 wars are often won by astute diplomacy and so it was with the war of independence.
the patriots prospects improved dramatically in 1778 when the continental congress concluded a military alliance with france the most powerful nation in europe.
the alliance gave the americans desperately needed money supplies and eventually troops.
and it confronted britain with an international war that challenged its domination of the atlantic and indian oceans.
the french alliance france and america were unlikely partners.
france was catholic and a monarchy the united states was protestant and a federation of republics.
from 1689 to 1763 the two peoples had been enemies new englanders had brutally uprooted the french population from acadia nova scotia in 1755 and the french and their indian allies had raided british settlements.
but the comte de vergennes the french foreign minister was determined to avenge the loss of canada during the great war for empire see chapter 4 and persuaded king louis xvi to provide the rebellious colonies with a secret loan and much needed gunpowder.
when part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 news of the rebel victory at saratoga reached paris in december 1777 vergennes sought a formal alliance.
benjamin franklin and other american diplomats craftily exploited frances rivalry with britain to win an explicit commitment to american independence.
the treaty of alliance of february 1778 specified that once france entered the war neither partner would sign a separate peace without the liberty sovereignty and independence of the united states.
in return the continental congress agreed to recognize any french conquests in the west indies.
france and america warned britains lord stormont were indissolubly leagued for our destruction the alliance gave new life to the patriots cause.
there has been a great change in this state since the news from france a patriot soldier reported from pennsylvania.
farmers mercenary wretches he called them were as eager for continental money now as they were a few weeks ago for british gold its confidence bolstered the continental congress addressed the demands of the officer corps.
most officers were gentlemen who equipped themselves and raised volunteers in return they insisted on lifetime military pensions at half pay.
john adams condemned the officers for scrambling for rank and pay like apes for nuts but general washington urged the congress to grant the pensions the salvation of the cause depends upon it the congress reluctantly granted the officers half pay but only for seven years.
meanwhile the war had become unpopular in britain.
at first george iii was determined to crush the rebellion.
if america won independence he warned lord north the west indies must follow them.
ireland would soon follow the same plan and be a separate state then this island would be reduced to itself and soon would be a poor island indeed stunned by the defeat at saratoga explain however the king changed his consequences mind.
to thwart an american alliwhat were the most ance with france he authorized important results of the patriot victory at saratoga.
north to seek a negotiated settlement.
in february 1778 north persuaded parliament to repeal the tea and prohibitory acts and amazingly to renounce its power to tax the colonies.
but the patriots now allied with france and committed to independence rejected norths overture.
war in the south the french alliance did not bring a rapid end to the war.
when france entered the conflict in june 1778 it hoped to seize all of britains sugar islands.
spain which joined the war against britain in 1779 aimed to regain florida and the fortress of gibraltar at the entrance to the mediterranean sea.
britains southern strategy for its part the british government revised its military strategy to defend the west indies and capture the rich tobacco and ricegrowing colonies virginia the carolinas and georgia.
once conquered the ministry planned to use the scottish highlanders in the carolinas and other loyalists to hold them.
it had already mobilized the cherokees and delawares against the land hungry americans and knew that the patriots fears of slave uprisings weakened them militarily map 6 3.
as south carolina patriots admitted to the continental congress they could raise only a few recruits by reason of the great proportion of citizens necessary to remain at home to prevent insurrection among the negroes the large number of slaves in the south made the revolution a triangular war in which african americans constituted a strategic problem for patriots and a tempting if dangerous opportunity for the british.
britain actively recruited slaves to its cause.
the effort began with dunmores controversial proclamation in november 1775 recruiting slaves to his ethiopian regiment see chapter 5.
in 1779 the philipsburg proclamation declared that any slave who deserted a rebel master would receive protection freedom and land from great britain.
together these proclamations led some 30 000 african americans to take refuge behind british lines.
george washington initially barred blacks from the continental army but he relented in 1777.
by wars end african americans could enlist in every state but south carolina and georgia and some 5 000 slave and free fought for the patriot cause thinking like a historian p 192.
it fell to sir henry clinton acutely aware of the role slaves might play to implement britains southern strategy.
from the british armys main base in new york city clinton launched a seaborne attack on savannah georgia.
troops commanded by colonel archibald campbell captured the town in december 1778.
mobilizing hundreds of blacks to transport supplies campbell moved inland and captured augusta early in 1779.
by years end clintons forces and local loyalists controlled coastal georgia and had 10 000 troops poised for an assault on south carolina.
in 1780 british forces marched from victory to victory map 6 4.
in may clinton forced the surrender of charleston south carolina and its garrison of 5 000 troops.
then lord charles cornwallis assumed control of the british forces and at camden defeated an chapter 6 making war and republican governments 1776 1789 map 6 3 american forces 1779 d dhea bro y r hr g hen i leh ft augusta.

the southern strategy was working.
then the tide of battle turned.
thanks to another republican minded european aristocrat the marquis de lafayette france finally dispatched troops to the american mainland.

in october 1780 patriot militia defeated a regiment of loyalists at kings mountain south carolina taking about one thousand prisoners.
thinking like a historian the black soldiers dilemma for african american slaves the revolution offered no clear path to freedom.
some slaves agreed to fight for britain because of its promise to liberate slaves who fought against their masters.
while some were freed many others died fighting were forced into servitude in the army or even sold into slavery in the west indies.
patriots at first refused the service of black soldiers then enlisted them in small numbers but always upheld the property rights of masters.
dunmores proclamation 1775.
virginias governor dunmore issued this proclamation in response to the emerging rebellion and formed his recruits into the so called ethiopian regiment.
to defeat such unreasonable purposes.
that the peace and good order of this colony may be again restored.
i have thought fit to issue this my proclamation hereby declaring that until the aforesaid good purposes can be obtained i do in virtue of the power and authority to me given by his majesty determine to execute martial law and cause the same to be executed throughout this colony and to the end that peace and good order may the sooner be effected i do require every person capable of bearing arms to resort to his majestys standard or be looked upon as traitors to his majesty.
i do hereby further declare all indentured servants negroes or others appertaining to rebels free that are able and willing to bear arms they joining his majestys troops as soon as may be for the more speedily reducing this colony to a proper sense of their duty.
virginias response to dunmores proclamation 1775.
a month later virginias general assembly issued the following response.
whereas lord dunmore by his proclamation dated on board the ship william off norfolk the 7th day of november 1775 hath offered freedom to such ablebodied slaves as are willing to join him and take up arms against the good people of this colony giving thereby encouragement to a general insurrection.
it is enacted that all negro or other slaves conspiring to rebel or make insurrection shall suffer death.
we think it proper to declare that all slaves who have been or shall be seduced by his lordships proclamation or other arts to desert their masters service and take up arms against the inhabitants of this colony shall be liable to such punishment as shall hereafter be directed by the general convention.
a ll such who have taken this unlawful and wicked step may return in safety to their duty and escape the punishment due their crimes.
and we do farther earnestly recommend it to all humane and benevolent persons in this colony to explain and make known this our offer of mercy to those unfortunate people.

report of bernardo de glvez 1780.
fighting against the british in support of the patriots louisiana governor bernardo de glvez raised a mixed regiment almost half of whom were slaves and free people of color from new orleans.
he praised their efforts in this report of his campaign.
no less deserving of eulogy are the companies of negroes and free mulattoes who were continually occupied in the outposts in false attacks and discoveries exchanging shots with the enemy.

boston king gains his freedom 1783.
in 1780 boston king like many other southern slaves escaped to the british army.
here he describes his experiences at wars end.
about this time peace was restored between america and great britain which diffused universal joy among all parties except us who had escaped slavery and taken refuge in the english army for a report prevailed at newyork that all the slaves in number two thousand were to be delivered up to their masters altho some of them had been three or four years among the english.
this dreadful rumour filled us with inexpressible anguish and terror especially when we saw our old masters coming from virginia north carolina and other parts and seizing upon slaves in the streets of new york or even dragging them out of their beds.
many of the slaves had very cruel masters so that the thought of returning home with them embittered life to us.
for some days we lost our appetite for food and sleep departed from our eyes.
the english had compassion upon us in the day of our distress and issued out a proclamation importing that all slaves should be free who had taken refuge in the british lines and claimed the sanction and privileges of the proclamations respecting the security and protection of negroes in consequence of this each of us received a certificate from the commanding officer at new york which dispelled our fears and filled us with joy and gratitude.
jehu grant is re enslaved 1778.
jehu grant of narragansett rhode island was owned by a loyalist.
in august 1777 he escaped and joined the patriot side ten months later his master tracked him down and reclaimed him.
in 1837 grant applied for a pension from the u s government and supplied the following narrative of his experience.
his application was denied.
i enlisted as a soldier but was put to the service of a teamster in the summer and a waiter in the winter.
i was then grown to manhood in the full vigor and strength of life and heard much about the cruel and arbitrary things done by the british.
their ships lay within a few miles of my masters house which stood near the shore and i was confident that my master traded with them and i suffered much from fear that i should be sent aboard a ship of war.
this i disliked.
but when i saw liberty poles and the people all engaged for the support of freedom i could not but like and be pleased with such thing god forgive me if i sinned in so feeling.
and living on the borders of rhode island where whole companies of colored people enlisted it added to my fears and dread of being sold to the british.
these considerations induced me to enlist into the american army where i served faithful about ten months when my master found and took me home.
had i been taught to read or understand the precepts of the gospel servants obey your master i might have done otherwise notwithstanding the songs of liberty that saluted my ear thrilled through my heart.

british forces captured savannah in december 1778 took control of georgia during 1779 and vanquished charleston in may 1780.
over the next eighteen months brutal warfare between the british troops and loyalist units and the continental army and militia raged in the interior of the carolinas and ended in a stalemate.
hoping to break the deadlock british general charles cornwallis carried the battle into virginia in 1781.
a francoamerican army led by washington and lafayette with the help of the french fleet under admiral de grasse surrounded cornwalliss forces on the yorktown peninsula and forced their surrender.
american guerrillas commanded by the swamp fox general francis marion also won a series of small but fierce battles.
then in january 1781 general daniel morgan led an american force to a bloody victory at cowpens south carolina.
in march greenes soldiers fought cornwalliss seasoned army to a draw at north carolinas guilford court house.
weakened by this war of attrition the british general decided to concede the carolinas to greene and seek a decisive victory in virginia.
there many patriot militiamen had refused to take up arms claiming that the rich wanted the poor to fight for them exploiting these social divisions cornwallis moved easily through the tidewater region of virginia in the chapter 6 making war and republican governments 1776 1789 francis marion crossing the pedee river francis marion was a master of the ferocious guerrilla fighting that characterized the war in south carolina.
though patriot general horatio gates had little confidence in him marion led an irregular militia brigade in several successful attacks.
after chasing marion into a swamp british general banastre tarleton declared as for this damned old fox the devil himself could not catch him soon patriots began calling marion the swamp fox.

reinforcements sent from new york and commanded by general benedict arnold the infamous patriot traitor bolstered his ranks.
as arnold and cornwallis sparred with an american force led by lafayette near the york peninsula washington was informed that france had finally sent its powerful west indian fleet to north america and he devised an audacious plan.
feigning an assault on new york city he secretly marched general rochambeaus army from rhode island to virginia.
simultaneously the french fleet took control of chesapeake bay.
by the time the british discovered washingtons scheme cornwallis was surrounded his 9 500 man army outnumbered 2 to 1 on land and cut off from reinforcement or retreat by sea.
in a hopeless position cornwallis surrendered at yorktown in october 1781.

the british ministry pointed to a series of blunders by the military leadership.
why had howe not ruthlessly pursued washingtons army in 1776.
why had howe and burgoyne failed to coordinate their attacks in 1777.
why had cornwallis marched deep into the patriotdominated state of virginia in 1781.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 historians acknowledge british mistakes but they also attribute the rebels victory to french aid and the inspired leadership of george washington.
astutely deferring to elected officials washington won the support of the continental congress and the state governments.
confident of his military abilities he pursued a defensive trace change strategy that minimized casualties over time and maintained the morale of his despite being at a clear disadvantage at the start officers and soldiers through five of the war the american difficult years of war.
moreover the patriots won.
patriots control of local governments gave washington a greater margin for error than the british generals had.
local militiamen provided the edge in the 1777 victory at saratoga and forced cornwallis from the carolinas in 1781.
in the end it was the american people who decided the outcome especially the one third of the white colonists who were zealous patriots.
tens of thousands of these farmers and artisans accepted continental bills in payment for supplies and thousands of soldiers took them as pay even as the currency literally depreciated in their pockets.
rampant inflation meant that every paper dollar held for a week lost value imposing a hidden currency tax on those who accepted the paper currency.
each individual tax was small a few pennies on each dollar.
but as millions of dollars changed hands multiple times the currency taxes paid by ordinary citizens financed the american military victory.
diplomatic triumph after yorktown diplomats took two years to conclude a peace treaty.
talks began in paris in april 1782 but the french and spanish still hoping to seize a west indian island or gibraltar stalled for time.
their tactics infuriated american diplomats benjamin franklin john adams and john jay.
so the americans negotiated secretly with the british prepared if necessary to ignore the treaty of alliance and sign a separate peace.
british ministers were equally eager parliament wanted peace and they feared the loss of a rich sugar island.
consequently the american diplomats secured extremely favorable terms.
in the treaty of paris signed in september 1783 great britain formally recognized american independence and relinquished its claims to lands south of the great lakes and east of the mississippi river.
the british negotiators did not insist on a separate territory for their indian allies.
in endeavouring to assist you a wea indian complained to a british general it seems we have wrought our own ruin the cherokees were forced to relinquish claims to 5 million acres three quarters of their territory in treaties with georgia the carolinas and virginia while new york and the continental congress pressed the iroquois and ohio indians to cede much of their land as well.
british officials like those of other early modern empires found it easy to abandon allies they had never really understood america compared p 197.
the paris treaty also granted americans fishing rights off newfoundland and nova scotia prohibited the british from carrying away any negroes or other property and guaranteed freedom of navigation on the mississippi to american citizens forever in return the american government allowed british merchants to pursue legal claims for prewar debts and encouraged the state legislatures to return confiscated property to loyalists and grant them citizenship.
in the treaty of versailles signed simultaneously britain made peace with france and spain.
neither american ally gained very much.
spain reclaimed florida from britain but not the strategic fortress at gibraltar.
france received the caribbean island of tobago small consolation for a war that had sharply raised taxes and quadrupled frances national debt.
just six years later cries for tax relief and political liberty would spark the french revolution.
only americans profited handsomely the treaties gave them independence and access to the trans appalachian west.
creating republican institutions 1776 1787 when the patriots declared independence they confronted the issue of political authority.
which of us shall be the rulers asked a philadelphia newspaper.
the question was multifaceted.
would power reside in the national government or the states.
who would control the new republican institutions traditional elites or average citizens.
would women have greater political and legal rights.
what would be the status of slaves in the new republic.
the state constitutions how much democracy.
in may 1776 the second continental congress urged americans to reject royal authority and establish republican governments.
most states quickly complied.
constitutions employ every pen an observer noted.

what attributes seemed especially meaningful to the authors of these descriptions.
why would the authors have singled out the particular qualities that are remarked upon here.
how does this compare to the ways in which the british viewed their native americans.

in 1776 these insurgents ousted every officeholder of the penn familys proprietary government abolished property ownership as a qualification for voting and granted all taxpaying men the right to vote and hold office.
the pennsylvania constitution of 1776 also created a unicameral one house legislature with complete power there was no governor to exercise a veto.
other provisions mandated a system of elementary education and protected citizens from imprisonment for debt.
pennsylvanias democratic constitution alarmed many leading patriots.
from boston john adams denounced the unicameral legislature as so democratical that it must produce confusion and every evil work compare and along with other conservative contrast patriots adams wanted to restrict what aspects of the office holding to men of learning pennsylvania constitution leisure and easy circumstances were most objectionable to adams and what did he and warned of oppression under advocate instead.

the power of money was especially apparent in the southern colonies where representatives worth at least 5 000 formed a majority of the legislators.
however in the new american republic the proportion of middling legislators yeomen farmers and others worth less than 2 000 increased dramatically especially in the northern states.

adams also demanded a bicameral twohouse legislature with an upper house of substantial property owners to offset the popular majorities in the lower one.
as further curbs on democracy he proposed an elected governor with veto power and an appointed not elected judiciary.
conservative patriots endorsed adamss governmental system.
in new yorks constitution of 1777 property qualifications for voting excluded 20 percent of white men from assembly elections and 60 percent from casting ballots for the governor and the upper house.
in south carolina elite planters used property rules to disqualify about 90 percent of white men from office holding.
the 1778 constitution required candidates for governor to have a debt free estate of 10 000 about 700 000 today senators to be worth 2 000 and assemblymen to own property valued at 1 000.
even in traditionally democratic massachusetts the 1780 constitution authored primarily by adams raised property qualifications for voting and office holding and skewed the lower house toward eastern mercantile interests.
the political legacy of the revolution was complex.
only in pennsylvania and vermont were radical patriots able to create truly democratic institutions.
yet in all the new states representative legislatures had acquired more power and average citizens now had greater power at the polls and greater influence in the halls of government.
women seek a public voice the extraordinary excitement of the revolutionary era tested the dictum that only men could engage in politics.
men controlled all public institutions legislatures juries government offices but upperclass women engaged in political debate and defying chapter 6 mens scorn filled their letters diaries and conversations with opinions on public issues.
the men say we have no business with politics eliza wilkinson of south carolina complained in 1783.
they wont even allow us liberty of thought and that is all i want as wilkinsons remark suggests most women did not insist on civic equality with men many sought only an end to restrictive customs and laws.
abigail adams demanded equal legal rights for married women who under common law could not own property enter into contracts or initiate lawsuits.
the war bonds she purchased had to be held in a trust run by a male relative.
men would be tyrants if they continued to hold such power over women adams declared to her husband john criticizing him and other patriots for emancipating all nations from monarchical despotism while retaining absolute power over wives most politicians ignored womens requests and most men insisted on traditional sexual and political prerogatives.
long married husbands remained patriarchs who dominated their households and even young men who embraced the republican ideal of companionate marriage did not support legal equality for their wives and daughters.
except in new jersey which until 1807 allowed unmarried and widowed female property holders to vote women remained disenfranchised.
in the new american republic only white men enjoyed full citizenship.
nevertheless the republican belief in an educated citizenry created opportunities for some women.
in her 1779 essay on the equality of the sexes judith sargent murray argued that men and women had equal capacities for memory and that women had superior imaginations.
she conceded that most women were inferior to men in judgment and reasoning but only from lack of training we can only reason from what we know she argued and most women had been denied the opportunity of acquiring knowledge that situation changed in the 1790s when the attorney general of massachusetts declared that girls had an equal right to schooling under the state constitution.
by 1850 the literacy rates of women and men in the northeastern states were equal and educated women again challenged their subordinate legal and political status.

her letter books which run to twenty volumes were discovered only in 1984 the judith sargent murray society is now transcribing and indexing them for publication.

more responsive to their needs beyond the appalachians thousands of squatters who had occupied lands in kentucky and tennessee expected their claims to be recognized and lands to be made available on easy terms.
if the united states were to secure the loyalty of westerners it would have to meet their needs more effectively than the british empire had.
this meant among other things extinguishing native american claims to land as quickly as possible.
at wars end george washington commented on the rage for speculating in ohio valley lands.
men in these times talk with as much facility of fifty a hundred and even 500 000 acres as a gentleman formerly would do of 1000 acres if we make a right use of our natural advantages a fourth of july orator observed we soon must be a truly great and happy people native american land claims stood as a conspicuous barrier to the natural advantages he imagined.
for southern slaveholders the revolution was fought to protect property rights and any sentiment favoring slave emancipation met with violent objections.
when virginia methodists called for general emancipation in 1785 slaveholders used revolutionary principles to defend their right to human property.
they risked their lives and fortunes and waded through seas of blood to secure the possession of their rights of liberty and property only to hear of a very subtle and daring attempt to dispossess us of a very important part of our property emancipation would bring want poverty distress and ruin to the free citizen the liberties coveted by ordinary white americans bore hard on the interests of native americans and slaves.
the articles of confederation a black loyalist pass 1783 white patriots claimed their freedom by fighting against the british thousands of black slaves won their liberty by fighting for them.
this pass certifies that cato rammsay actually ramsey a negro resorted to the british lines in search of the freedom promised by virginia royal governor dunmore and british commander henry clinton to slaves who escaped from patriot owners.
now age forty five and a slim fellow ramsey had escaped from his owner john ramsey of norfolk virginia in 1776 probably fleeing to dunmores ships.
seven years later he ended up in new york reunited with his wife china godfrey thirty five and their three children james twenty betsey fifteen and nelly ramsey ten who had fled subsequently from other owners.
as the british evacuated new york in 1783 ramsey and his family were free to go to nova scotia where they worked as farmers.
nova scotia archives and records management.
as patriots embraced independence in 1776 they envisioned a central government with limited powers.
carter braxton of virginia thought the continental congress should regulate the affairs of trade war peace alliances c but should by no means have authority to interfere with the internal police governance or domestic concerns of any colony that idea informed the articles of confederation which were approved by the continental congress in november 1777.
the articles provided for a loose union in which each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence as an association of equals each state had one vote regardless of its size population or wealth.
important laws needed the approval of nine of the thirteen states and changes in the articles required unanimous consent.
though the confederation had significant powers on paper it could declare war make treaties with foreign nations adjudicate disputes between the states borrow and print money and requisition funds from the states for the common defense or general welfare it had major weaknesses as well.
it had neither a chief executive nor a judiciary.
though it could make treaties it could not enforce their provisions since the states remained sovereign.
most important it lacked the power to tax either the states or the people.
chapter 6 although the congress exercised authority from 1776 raising the continental army negotiating the treaty with france and financing the war the articles won formal ratification only in 1781.
the delay stemmed from conflicts over western lands.
the royal charters of virginia massachusetts connecticut and other states set boundaries stretching to the pacific ocean.
states without western lands maryland and pennsylvania refused to accept the articles until the land rich states relinquished these claims to the confederation.
threatened by cornwalliss army in 1781 virginia gave up its claims and maryland the last holdout finally ratified the articles map 6 5.
continuing fiscal crisis by 1780 the central government was nearly bankrupt and general washington called urgently for a national tax system without one he warned our cause is lost led by robert morris who became superintendent of finance in 1781 nationalist minded patriots tried to expand the confederations authority.
they persuaded congress to charter the bank of north america a private institution in philadelphia arguing that its notes would stabilize the inflated continental currency.
morris also created a central bureaucracy to manage the confederations finances and urged congress to enact a 5 percent import tax.
rhode island and new york rejected the tax proposal.
his state had opposed british import duties new yorks representative declared and it would not accept them from congress.
to raise revenue congress looked to the sale of western lands.
in 1783 it asserted that the recently signed treaty of paris had extinguished the indians rights to those lands and made them the property of the united states.
the northwest ordinance by 1784 more than thirty thousand settlers had already moved to kentucky and tennessee despite the uncertainties of frontier warfare and after the war their numbers grew rapidly.
in that year the residents of what is now eastern tennessee organized a new state called it franklin and sought admission to the confederation.
to preserve its authority over the west congress refused to recognize franklin.
subsequently congress created the southwest and mississippi territories the future states of tennessee alabama and mississippi from lands ceded by north carolina and georgia.
because these cessions carried the stipulation that no regulation.
shall tend to emancipate slaves these states and all those south of the ohio river allowed human bondage.
however the confederation congress banned slavery north of the ohio river.
between 1784 and making war and republican governments 1776 1789 1787 it issued three important ordinances organizing the old northwest the ordinance of 1784 written by thomas jefferson established the principle that territories could compare and become states as their populations contrast grew.
the land ordinance of in what ways did the 1785 mandated a rectangular confederation function grid system of surveying and effectively and what were specified a minimum price of 1 its greatest failings.
it also required that half of the townships be sold in single blocks of 23 040 acres each which only large scale speculators could afford and the rest in parcels of 640 acres each which restricted their sale to well to do farmers map 6 6.
finally the northwest ordinance of 1787 created the territories that would eventually become the states of ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin.
the ordinance prohibited slavery and earmarked funds from land sales for the support of schools.
it also specified that congress would appoint a governor and judges to administer each new territory until the population reached 5 000 free adult men at which point the citizens could elect a territorial legislature.
when the population reached 60 000 the legislature could devise a republican constitution and apply to join the confederation.
the land ordinances of the 1780s were a great and enduring achievement of the confederation congress.
they provided for orderly settlement and the admission of new states on the basis of equality there would be no politically dependent colonies in the west.
but they also extended the geographical division between slave and free areas that would haunt the nation in the coming decades.
and they implicitly invalidated native american claims to an enormous swath of territory a corollary that would soon lead the newly independent nation once again into war.
shayss rebellion though many national leaders were optimistic about the long term prospects of the united states postwar economic conditions were grim.
the revolution had crippled american shipping and cut exports of tobacco rice and wheat.
the british navigation acts which had nurtured colonial commerce now barred americans from legal trade with the british west indies.
moreover low priced british manufactures and some from india as well were flooding american markets driving urban artisans and wartime textile firms out of business.

for example the territories claimed by new york and virginia on the basis of their royal charters overlapped extensively.
beginning in 1781 the confederation congress and after 1789 the u s congress persuaded all of the states to cede their western claims creating a national domain open to all citizens.
in the northwest ordinance 1787 the congress divided the domain north of the ohio river into territories and set up democratic procedures by which they could eventually join the union as states.
south of the ohio river the congress allowed the existing southern states to play a substantial role in settling the ceded lands.
the fiscal condition of the state governments was dire primarily because of war debts.
well to do merchants and landowners including abigail adams had invested in state bonds during the war others had speculated in debt certificates buying them on the cheap from hard pressed farmers and soldiers.
now creditors and speculators demanded that the state governments redeem the bonds and certificates quickly and at full value a policy that would require tax increases and a decrease in the amount of paper currency.
most legislatures now including substantial numbers of middling farmers and artisans refused.

the right angled property lines in muskingum county ohio lower left contrasted sharply with those in baltimore county maryland lower right where as in most of the eastern and southern states boundaries followed the contours of the land.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 authorized new issues of paper currency and allowed debtors to pay private creditors in installments.
although wealthy men deplored these measures as intoxicating draughts of liberty that destroyed the just rights of creditors such political intervention prevented social upheaval.
in massachusetts however the new constitution placed power in the hands of a mercantile elite that owned the bulk of the states war bonds.
ignoring the interests of ordinary citizens the legislature increased taxes fivefold to pay off wartime debts and it stipulated that they be paid in hard currency.
even for substantial farmers this was a crushing burden.
when cash strapped farmers could not pay both their taxes and their debts creditors threatened lawsuits.
debtor ephraim wetmore heard a rumor that merchant stephan salisbury would have my body dead or alive in case i did not pay to protect their livelihoods farmers called extralegal conventions to protest high taxes and property seizures.
then mobs of angry farmers including men of high status closed the courts by force.
i had no intensions to destroy the publick government declared captain adam wheeler a former town selectman his goal was simply to prevent valuable and industrious members of society being dragged from their families to prison because of their debts.
these crowd actions grew into a full scale revolt led by captain daniel shays a continental army veteran.
as a revolt against taxes imposed by an unresponsive government shayss rebellion resembled american resistance to the british stamp act.
consciously linking themselves to the patriot movement shayss men placed pine twigs in their hats just as continental troops had done.
the people have turned against their teachers the doctrines which were inculcated to effect the late revolution complained fisher ames a conservative massachusetts lawmaker.
some of the radical patriots of 1776 likewise condemned the shaysites men who would lessen the weight of government lawfully place events exercised must be enemies to our in context happy revolution and common how did the shaysites liberty charged samuel adams.
draw on the revolution for inspiration.
to put down the rebellion the massachusetts legislature passed the riot act and wealthy bondholders equipped a formidable fighting force which governor james bowdoin used to disperse shayss ragtag army during the winter of 1786 1787.
although shayss rebellion failed it showed that many middling patriot families felt that american oppressors had replaced british tyrants.
massachusetts voters turned governor bowdoin out of office and debt ridden farmers in new york northern pennsylvania connecticut and new hampshire closed courthouses and forced their governments to provide economic relief.
british officials in canada predicted the imminent demise of the united states and american leaders urged purposeful action to save their republican experiment.
events in massachusetts declared nationalist henry knox formed the strongest arguments possible for the creation of a strong general government the constitution of 1787 these issues ultimately led to the drafting of a national constitution.
from its creation the u s constitution was a controversial document both acclaimed for solving the nations woes and condemned for perverting its republican principles.
critics charged that republican institutions worked only in small political units the states.
advocates replied that the constitution extended republicanism by adding another level of government elected by the people.
in the new two level political federation created by the constitution the national government would exercise limited delegated powers and the existing state governments would retain authority over all other matters.
the rise of a nationalist faction money questions debts taxes and tariffs dominated the postwar political agenda.
americans who had served the confederation as military officers officials and diplomats viewed these issues from a national perspective and advocated a stronger central government.
george washington robert morris benjamin franklin john jay and john adams wanted congress to control foreign and interstate commerce and tariff policy.
however lawmakers in massachusetts new york and pennsylvania states with strong commercial traditions insisted on controlling their own tariffs both to protect their artisans from low cost imports and to assist their merchants.
most southern states opposed tariffs because planters wanted to import british textiles and ironware at the lowest possible prices.
nonetheless some southern leaders became nationalists because their state legislatures had cut taxes and refused to redeem state war bonds.
such policies lamented wealthy bondholder charles lee of virginia led taxpayers to believe they would never be compelled chapter 6 to pay the public debt.
creditors also condemned state laws that stayed delayed the payment of mortgages and other private debts.
while men are madly accumulating enormous debts their legislators are making provisions for their nonpayment complained a south carolina merchant.
to undercut the democratic majorities in the state legislatures creditors joined the movement for a stronger central government.
spurred on by shayss rebellion nationalists in congress secured a resolution calling for a convention to revise the articles of confederation.
only an efficient plan from the convention a fellow nationalist wrote to james madison can prevent anarchy first civil convulsions afterwards the philadelphia convention in may 1787 fifty five delegates arrived in philadelphia.
they came from every state except rhode island where the legislature opposed increasing central authority.
most were strong nationalists forty two had served in the confederation congress.
they were also educated and propertied merchants slaveholding planters and monied men there were no artisans backcountry settlers or tenants and only a single yeoman farmer.
some influential patriots missed the convention.
john adams and thomas jefferson were serving as american ministers to britain and france respectively.
the massachusetts general court rejected sam adams as a delegate because he opposed a stronger national government and his fellow firebrand from virginia patrick henry refused to attend because he smelt a rat the absence of experienced leaders and contraryminded delegates allowed capable younger nationalists to set the agenda.
declaring that the convention would decide for ever the fate of republican government james madison insisted on increased national authority.
alexander hamilton of new york likewise demanded a strong central government to protect the republic from the imprudence of democracy the virginia and new jersey plans the delegates elected george washington as their presiding officer and voted to meet behind closed doors.
then momentously they decided not to revise the articles of confederation but rather to consider the so called virginia plan a scheme for a powerful national government devised by james madison.
just thirty six years old madison was determined to fashion national political institutions run by men of high character.
a graduate of princeton he had read classical and making war and republican governments 1776 1789 modern political theory and served in both the confederation congress and the virginia assembly.
once an optimistic patriot madison had grown discouraged because of the narrow ambition and outlook of state legislators.
madisons virginia plan differed from the articles of confederation in three crucial respects.
first the plan rejected state sovereignty in favor of the supremacy of national authority including the power to overturn state laws.
second it called for the national government to be established by the people not the states and for national laws to operate directly on citizens of the various states.
third the plan proposed a three tier election system in which ordinary voters would elect only the lower house of the national legislature.
this lower house would then select the upper house and both houses would appoint the executive and judiciary.
from a political perspective madisons plan had two fatal flaws.
first most state politicians and james madison statesman throughout his long public life madison kept the details of his private life to himself.
his biography he believed should be a record of his public accomplishments not his private affairs.
future generations celebrated him not as a great man like hamilton or jefferson or as a great president like washington but as an original and incisive political thinker.
the chief architect of the u s constitution and the bill of rights madison was the preeminent republican political theorist of his generation.

part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 citizens resolutely opposed allowing the national government to veto state laws.
second the plan based representation in the lower house on population this provision a delaware delegate warned would allow the populous states to crush the small ones whenever they stand in the way of their ambitious or interested views so delegates from delaware and other small states rallied behind a plan devised by william paterson of new jersey.
the new jersey plan gave the confederation the power to raise revenue control commerce and make binding requisitions on the states.
but it preserved the states control of their own laws and guaranteed their equality as in the confederation congress each state would have one vote in a unicameral legislature.
delegates from the more populous states vigorously opposed this provision.
after a month long debate on the two plans a bare majority of the states agreed to use madisons virginia plan as the basis of discussion.
this decision raised the odds that the convention would create a more powerful national government.
outraged by this prospect two new york delegates robert yates and john lansing accused their colleagues of exceeding their mandate to revise the articles and left the convention.
the remaining delegates met six days a week during the summer of 1787 debating both high principles and practical details.
experienced politicians they looked for a plan that would be acceptable to most citizens and existing political interests.
pierce butler of south carolina invoked a classical greek precedent we must follow the example of solon who gave the athenians not the best government he could devise but the best they would receive the great compromise as the convention grappled with the central problem of the representation of large and small states the connecticut delegates suggested a possible solution.
they proposed that the national legislatures upper chamber the senate have two members from each state while seats in the lower chamber the house of representatives be apportioned by population determined every ten years by a national census.
after bitter debate delegates from the populous states reluctantly accepted this great compromise other state related issues were quickly settled by restricting or leaving ambiguous the extent of central authority.
some delegates opposed a national system of courts predicting that the states will revolt at such encroachments on their judicial authority.
this danger led the convention to vest the judicial power in one supreme court and allow the new national legislature to decide whether to establish lower courts within the states.
the convention also refused to set a property requirement for voting in national elections.
eight or nine states have extended the right of suffrage beyond the freeholders george mason of virginia pointed out.
what will people there say if they should be disfranchised finally the convention specified that state legislatures would elect members of the upper house or senate and the states would select the electors who would choose the president.
by allowing states to have important roles in the new constitutional system the delegates hoped that their citizens would accept limits on state sovereignty.
negotiations over slavery the shadow of slavery hovered over many debates and gouverneur morris of new york brought it into view.
to safeguard property rights morris wanted life terms for senators a property qualification for voting in national elections and a strong president with veto power.
nonetheless he rejected the legitimacy of two traditional types of property the feudal dues claimed by aristocratic landowners and the ownership of slaves.
an advocate of free markets and personal liberty morris condemned slavery as a nefarious institution many slave owning delegates from the chesapeake region including madison and george mason recognized that slavery contradicted republican principles and hoped for its eventual demise.
they supported an end to american participation in the atlantic slave trade a proposal the south carolina and georgia delegates angrily rejected.
unless the importation of african slaves continued these rice planters and merchants declared their states shall not be parties to the union at their insistence the convention denied congress the power to regulate immigration and so the slave trade until 1808 american voices p 208.
the delegates devised other slavery related compromises.
to mollify southern planters they wrote a fugitive clause that allowed masters to reclaim enslaved blacks or white indentured servants who fled to other states.
but in acknowledgment of the antislavery sentiments of morris and other northerners the delegates excluded the words slavery and slave from the constitution it spoke only of citizens and all other persons because slaves lacked the vote antislavery delegates wanted their census numbers excluded when apportioning seats in congress.
chapter 6 southerners ironically given that they considered slaves property demanded that slaves be counted in the census the same as full citizens to increase the souths representation.
ultimately the delegates agreed that each slave would count as three fifths of a free person for purposes of representation and taxation a compromise that helped southern planters dominate the national government until 1860.
national authority having addressed the concerns of small states and slave states the convention created a powerful national government.
the constitution declared that congressional legislation was the supreme law of the land.
it gave the new government the power to tax raise an army and a navy and regulate foreign and interstate commerce with the authority to make all laws necessary and proper to implement those and other provisions.
to assist creditors and establish the new governments fiscal integrity the constitution required the united states to honor the existing national debt and prohibited the states from issuing paper money or enacting any law impairing the obligation of contracts the proposed constitution was not a perfect production benjamin franklin admitted as he urged the delegates to sign it in september 1787.
but the great statesman confessed his astonishment at finding this system approaching so near to perfection his colleagues apparently agreed all but three signed the document.
the people debate ratification the procedure for ratifying the new constitution was as controversial as its contents.
knowing that rhode island and perhaps other states would reject it the delegates did not submit the constitution to the state legislatures for their unanimous consent as required by the articles of confederation.
instead they arbitrarily and cleverly declared that it would take effect when ratified by conventions in nine of the thirteen states.
as the constitutional debate began in early 1788 the nationalists seized the initiative with two bold moves.
first they called themselves federalists suggesting that they supported a federal union a loose decentralized system and obscuring their commitment to a strong national government.
second they launched a coordinated campaign in pamphlets and newspapers to explain and justify the philadelphia constitution.
making war and republican governments 1776 1789 the antifederalists the opponents of the constitution called by default the antifederalists had diverse backgrounds and motives.
some like governor george clinton compare and of new york feared that state gov contrast ernments would lose power.
rural how did the constitudemocrats protested that the pro tion in its final form posed document unlike most differ from the plan that state constitutions lacked a decla james madison originally ration of individual rights they proposed.
also feared that the central government would be run by wealthy men.
lawyers and men of learning and monied men expect to be managers of this constitution worried a massachusetts farmer.
t hey will swallow up all of us little folks.
just as the whale swallowed up jonah giving political substance to these fears melancton smith of new york argued that the large electoral districts prescribed by the constitution would restrict office holding to wealthy men whereas the smaller districts used in state elections usually produced legislatures composed principally of respectable yeomanry john quincy adams agreed if only eight men would represent massachusetts they will infallibly be chosen from the aristocratic part of the community smith summed up the views of americans who held traditional republican values.
to keep government close to the people they wanted the states to remain small sovereign republics tied together only for trade and defense not the united states but the states united citing the french political philosopher montesquieu antifederalists argued that republican institutions were best suited to small polities.
no extensive empire can be governed on republican principles declared james winthrop of massachusetts.
patrick henry worried that the constitution would recreate british rule high taxes an oppressive bureaucracy a standing army and a great and mighty president.
supported in extravagant munificence as another antifederalist put it i had rather be a free citizen of the small republic of massachusetts than an oppressed subject of the great american empire federalists respond in new york where ratification was hotly contested james madison john jay and alexander hamilton defended the proposed constitution in a series of eighty five essays written in 1787 and 1788 collectively titled the federalist.
this work influenced political leaders throughout the country and subsequently won acclaim as an important treatise of practical republicanism.
its authors denied that a american voices the first national debate over slavery in this part of the text we trace the impact of republican ideology on american politics and society.
what happened when republicanism collided head on with the well established practice of slavery.
after the revolution the massachusetts courts abolished slavery but in 1787 slavery was legal in the rest of the union and was the bedrock of social order and agricultural production in the southern states.
a look at the debates on the issue of the african slave trade at the philadelphia convention and in a state ratifying convention shows that slavery was an extremely divisive issue at the birth of the nation a dark cloud threatening the bright future of the young republic.
the constitutional convention slavery was not a major topic of discussion at the philadelphia convention but it surfaced a number of times notably in the important debate over representation which produced the three fifths clause.
a discussion of the atlantic slave trade began when luther martin a delegate from maryland proposed a clause allowing congress to impose a tax on or prohibit the importation of slaves.
mr martin proposed to vary article 7 sect.
4 so as to allow a prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves.
he believed it was inconsistent with the principles of the revolution and dishonorable to the american character to have such a feature promoting the slave trade in the constitution.
mr john rutledge of south carolina declared that religion and humanity had nothing to do with this question.
interest alone is the governing principle with nations.
the true question at present is whether the southern states shall or shall not be parties to the union.
mr oliver ellsworth of connecticut was for leaving the clause as it stands.
let every state import what it pleases.
the morality or wisdom of slavery are considerations belonging to the states themselves.
the old confederation had not meddled with this point and he did not see any greater necessity for bringing it within the policy of the new one.
mr charles c pinckney said south carolina can never receive the plan for a new constitution if it prohibits the slave trade.
in every proposed extension of the powers of congress that state has expressly and watchfully excepted that of meddling with the importation of negroes.
mr roger sherman of connecticut was for leaving the clause as it stands.
he disapproved of the slave trade yet as the states were now possessed of the right to import slaves.
and as it was expedient to have as few objections as possible to the proposed scheme of government he thought it best to leave the matter as we find it.
col george mason of virginia stated that this infernal trade originated in the avarice of british merchants.
the british government constantly checked the attempts of virginia to put a stop to it.
the present question concerns not the importing states alone but the whole union.
maryland and virginia he said had already prohibited the importation of slaves expressly.
north carolina had done the same in substance.
all this would be in vain if south carolina and georgia be at liberty to import.
the western people are already calling out for slaves for their new lands and will fill that country with slaves if they can be got through south carolina and georgia.
slavery discourages arts and manufactures.
the poor despise labor when performed by slaves.
they prevent the immigration of whites who really enrich and strengthen a country.
every master of slaves is born a petty tyrant.
they bring the judgment of heaven on a country.
as nations cannot be rewarded or punished in the next world they must be in this.
by an inevitable chain of causes and effects providence punishes national sins by national calamities.
he held it essential in every point of view that the general government should have power to prevent the increase of slavery.
mr ellsworth as he had never owned a slave could not judge of the effects of slavery on character.
he said however that if it was to be considered in a moral light we ought to go further and free those already in the country.
let us not intermeddle.
as population increases poor laborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless.
slavery in time will not be a speck in our country.
gen charles c pinckney argued that south carolina and georgia cannot do without slaves.
as to virginia she will gain by stopping the importations.
her slaves will rise in value and she has more than she wants.
it would be unequal to require south carolina and georgia to confederate on such unequal terms.
he contended that the importation of slaves would be for the interest of the whole union.
the more slaves the more produce to employ the carrying trade the more consumption also and the more of this the more revenue for the common treasury.
he should consider a rejection of the present clause as an exclusion of south carolina from the union.

the massachusetts ratifying convention in philadelphia the delegates agreed on a compromise they gave congress the power to tax or prohibit slave imports as luther martin had proposed but withheld that power for twenty years.
in the massachusetts convention the delegates split on this issue and on many others.
they ratified the constitution by a narrow margin 187 to 168.
mr neal from kittery an antifederalist went over the ground of objection to.
the idea that slave trade was allowed to be continued for 20 years.
his profession he said obliged him to bear witness against any thing that should favor the making merchandize of the bodies of men and unless his objection was removed he could not put his hand to the constitution.
other gentlemen said in addition to this idea that there was not even a proposition that the negroes ever shall be free and gen thompson exclaimed mr.
president shall it be said that after we have established our own independence and freedom we make slaves of others.
washington.
he has immortalized himself.
but he holds those in slavery who have a good right to be free as he is.
on the other side gentlemen said that the step taken in this article towards the abolition of slavery was one of the beauties of the constitution.
they observed that in the confederation there was no provision whatever for its ever being abolished but this constitution provides that congress may after twenty years totally annihilate the slave trade.
mr heath federalist.
i apprehend that it is not in our power to do any thing for or against those who are in slavery in the southern states.
no gentleman within these walls detests every idea of slavery more than i do it is generally detested by the people of this commonwealth and i ardently hope that the time will soon come when our brethren in the southern states will view it as we do and put a stop to it but to this we have no right to compel them.
two questions naturally arise if we ratify the constitution shall we do any thing by our act to hold the blacks in slavery or shall we become the partakers of other mens sins.
i think neither of them each state is sovereign and independent to a certain degree and they have a right and will regulate their own internal affairs as to themselves appears proper.
we are not in this case partakers of other mens sins.
the federal convention went as far as they could the migration or immigration c is confined to the states now existing only new states cannot claim it.
congress by their ordnance for erecting new states some time since declared that there shall be no slavery in them.
but whether those in slavery in the southern states will be emancipated after the year 1808 i do not pretend to determine i rather doubt it.

each branch of government would check and balance the others and so preserve liberty.

10 madison challenged the view that republican governments only worked in small polities arguing that a large state would better protect republican liberty.
it was sown in the nature of man madison wrote for individuals to seek power and form factions.
indeed a landed interest a manufacturing interest a mercantile interest a moneyed interest with many lesser interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations a free society should welcome all factions but keep any one of them from becoming dominant something best achieved in a large republic.

in pennsylvania philadelphia merchants and artisans joined commercial farmers to ratify the constitution.

chapter review summary in this chapter we examined the unfolding of two related sets of events.
the first was the war between britain and its rebellious colonies that began in 1776 and ended in 1783.
the two great battles of saratoga 1777 and yorktown 1781 determined the outcome of that conflict.
surprisingly given the military might of the british empire both were american victories.
these triumphs testify to the determination of george washington the resilience of the continental army and support for the patriot cause from hundreds of local militias and tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens.
this popular support reflected the patriots second success building effective institutions of republican government.
these elected institutions of local and state governance evolved out of colonial era town meetings and representative assemblies.
they were defined in the state constitutions written between 1776 and 1781 and their principles informed the first national constitution the articles of confederation.
despite the challenges posed by conflicts over suffrage womens rights and fiscal policy these self governing political institutions carried the new republic successfully through the war torn era and laid the foundation for the constitution of 1787 the national charter that endures today.

part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 the political crisis of the 1790s the final decade of the eighteenth century brought fresh challenges for american politics.
the federalists split into two factions over financial policy and the french revolution and their leaders alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson offered contrasting visions of the future.
would the united states remain an agricultural nation governed by local officials as jefferson hoped.
or would hamiltons vision of a strong national government and an economy based on manufacturing become reality.
the federalists implement the constitution the constitution expanded the dimensions of political life by allowing voters to choose national leaders as well as local and state officials.
the federalists swept the election of 1788 winning forty four seats in the house of representatives only eight antifederalists won election.
as expected members of the electoral college chose george washington as president.
john adams received the second highest number of electoral votes and became vice president.
devising the new government once the military savior of his country washington now became its political father.
at age fifty seven the first president possessed great personal dignity and a cautious personality.
to maintain continuity he adopted many of the administrative practices of the confederation and asked congress to reestablish the existing executive departments foreign affairs state finance treasury and war.
to head the department of state washington chose thomas jefferson a fellow virginian and an experienced diplomat.
for secretary of the treasury he turned to alexander hamilton a lawyer and his former military aide.
the president designated jefferson hamilton and secretary of war henry knox as his cabinet or advisory body.
the constitution mandated a supreme court but the philadelphia convention gave congress the task of creating a national court system.
the federalists wanted strong national institutions and the judiciary act of 1789 reflected their vision.
the act established a federal district court in each state and three circuit courts to hear appeals from the districts with the supreme court having the final say.
the judiciary act also specified that cases arising in state courts that involved federal laws could be appealed to the supreme court.
this provision ensured that federal judges would have the final say on the meaning of the constitution.
the bill of rights the federalists kept their promise to add a declaration of rights to the constitution.
james madison now a member of the house of representatives submitted nineteen amendments to the first congress by 1791 ten had been approved by congress and ratified by the states.
these ten amendments known as the bill of rights safeguard fundamental personal rights including freedom of speech and religion and mandate legal procedures such as trial by jury.
by protecting individual citizens the amendments eased antifederalists fears of an oppressive national government and secured the legitimacy of the constitution.
they also addressed the issue of federalism the proper balance between the authority of the national and state governments.
but that question was constantly contested until the civil war and remains important today.
hamiltons financial program george washingtons most important decision was choosing alexander hamilton as secretary of the treasury.
an ambitious self made man of great intelligence hamilton married into the schuyler family influential hudson river valley landowners and was a prominent lawyer in new york city.
at the philadelphia convention he condemned the democratic spirit and called for an authoritarian government and a president with near monarchical powers.
as treasury secretary hamilton devised bold policies to enhance national authority and to assist financiers and merchants.
he outlined his plans in three pathbreaking reports to congress on public credit january 1790 on a national bank december 1790 and on manufactures december 1791.
these reports outlined a coherent program of national mercantilism government assisted economic development.
public credit redemption and assumption the financial and social implications of hamiltons report on the public credit made it instantly controversial.
hamilton asked congress to redeem at face value the 55 million in confederation securities held by foreign and domestic investors figure 7 1.
his reasons were simple as an underdeveloped nation the united states needed good credit to secure loans from dutch and.
chapter 5 the problem of empire 1763 1776 chapter 6 making war and republican governments 1776 1789 chapter 7 hammering out a federal republic 1787 1820 chapter 8 creating a republican culture 1790 1820 the american war is over philadelphia patriot benjamin rush declared in 1787 but this is far from being the case with the american revolution.
on the contrary nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed.
it remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government the changes that had already unfolded since 1763 were revolutionary in themselves britain had triumphed in the great war for empire only to see its american empire unravel and descend into war.
against all odds the thirteen rebelling colonies had pulled together and won their independence now they were forming a federal republic that would take its place among the nations of the world.
the republican revolution extended far beyond politics.
it challenged many of the values and institutions that had prevailed for centuries in europe and the atlantic world.
after 1776 americans reconsidered basic assumptions that structured their societies cultures families and communities.
here in summary are the three principal developments discussed in part 3 from british north america to the united states of america challenges to the social order after violently rejecting attempts to reform the british empire the patriots won independence and began constructing republican governments.
their experiments extended across an entire generation and it took still longer to decide how much power the federal republic should wield over the states.
the political culture spawned by the revolution was similarly unformed and slow to develop.
political parties for example were unanticipated by the founders and at first widely regarded as illegitimate.
however by 1820 they had become central to the adjudication of political conflict heightening some forms of competition while blunting others.
the united states also fought wars with native americans in the trans appalachian west to gain new territory and with great britain to ensure its independence.
across three generations american political culture was transformed national borders were secured and republican national and state governments commanded the allegiance of their citizens.
as patriots articulated values they associated with independence they aligned their movement with currents of reform eddying through the atlantic world antislavery womens rights religious liberty social equality.
each of these ideas was controversial and the american revolution endorsed none of them in an unqualified way.
but its idealism the sense that the revolution marked a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race as john adams put it made the era malleable and full of possibility.
legislatures abolished slavery in the north broadened religious liberty by allowing freedom of conscience and except in new england ended the system of legally established churches.
postwar evangelicalism gave enormous energy to a new wave of innovative religious developments.
however americans continued to argue over social equality in part because their republican creed placed family authority in the hands of men and political power in the hands of propertied individuals this arrangement denied power and status not only to slaves but also to free blacks women and middling and poor white men.
though the revolutions legacy was mixed its meaning would be debated for decades in american public life.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 conquest competition and consolidation thematic understanding one uncontested value of the revolutionary era was a commitment to economic opportunity.
to achieve this people migrated in large numbers and the united states dramatically expanded its boundaries first by conquest pushing west to the mississippi river then by purchase all the way to the pacific ocean.
northern merchants created a banking system and organized rural manufacturing.
state governments used charters and other privileges to assist businesses and to improve infrastructure.
southern planters used slaves to grow a new staple crop cotton.
many yeomen farm families moved west to farm and eastern laborers worked in burgeoning manufacturing enterprises.
by 1820 the young american republic was on the verge of achieving economic as well as political independence.
even as the borders of the united states expanded its diversity inhibited the effort to define an american culture and identity.
native americans still lived in their own clans and nations black americans were developing a distinct african american culture and white americans were enmeshed in vigorous regional ethnic communities.
over time political institutions began to unite americans of diverse backgrounds as did increasing participation in the market economy and in evangelical protestant churches.
by 1820 to be an american meant for many members of the dominant white population to be a republican a protestant and an enterprising individual.
this timeline arranges some of the important events of this period into themes.
consider the items listed under the theme ideas beliefs and culture how did the american revolution challenge existing social arrangements.
consider the role of religion in american life the status of women and the institution of slavery.
what tensions developed as a result of those challenges.

but on the same measures and more astute leaderday william tryon the colonys crownship.

local leaders orchesway to achieve it.
trated a delicate dance.
though the provincial congress was operating illegally in the eyes of the crown it did not wish to offend governor tryon.
it instructed the citys newly raised volunteer battalion to divide in two.
one company awaited washingtons arrival while another prepared to greet the governor.
the residue of the battalion was to be ready to receive either the general or governour tryon which ever shall first arrive washington arrived first.
he was met by nine companies of the volunteer battalion and a throng of well wishers who escorted him to his rooms in a local tavern.
many of this same crowd then crossed town to join the large group assembled to greet the governor whose ship was just landing.
the crowd met him with universal shouts of applause and accompanied him home.
this awkward moment in the history of one american city reflects a larger crisis of loyalty that plagued colonists throughout british north america in the years between 1763 and 1776.
the outcome of the great war for empire left great britain the undisputed master of eastern north america.
but that success pointed the way to catastrophe.
convinced of the need to reform the empire and tighten its administration british policymakers imposed a series of new administrative measures on the colonies.
accustomed as they were to governing their own affairs colonists could not accept these changes.
yet the bonds of loyalty were strong and the unraveling of british authority was tortuous and complex.
only gradually as militancy slowly mounted on both sides were the ties of empire broken and independence declared.
the great new york fire of 1776 in the wake of the declaration of independence general william howes first objective was to capture new york with its strategic location and excellent harbor.
patriot forces under george washingtons command attempted to defend the city but were forced into retreat and abandoned it to the british in september 1776.
early in the morning of september 21 a fire broke out near the southern tip of manhattan and burned northwestward driven by a strong wind.
as many as a quarter of the towns buildings were destroyed residents already distressed by the fighting fled into the streets with whatever possessions they could carry.
each side accused the other of arson but that charge was never proven.

part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 an empire transformed the great war for empire of 1756 1763 chapter 4 transformed the british empire in north america.
the british ministry could no longer let the colonies manage their own affairs while it contented itself with minimal oversight of the atlantic trade.
its interests and responsibilities now extended far into the continental interior a much more costly and complicated proposition than it had ever faced before.
and neither its american colonies nor their native american neighbors were inclined to cooperate in the transformation.
british administrators worried about their american colonists who according to former georgia governor henry ellis felt themselves entitled to a greater measure of liberty than is enjoyed by the people of england ireland had been closely ruled for decades and recently the east india company set up dominion over explain millions of non british peoples consequences map 5 1 and america compared what was the impact of p 153.
britains american posthe great war for empire on british policymakers sessions were likewise filled with and the colonies.
aliens and undesirables french dutch germans innumerable indians africans and a multitude of felons from this country as one member of parliament put it.
consequently declared lord halifax the people of england considered americans as foreigners contesting that status wealthy philadelphia lawyer john dickinson argued that his fellow colonists were not east indian sea poys nor marattas but british subjects who are born to liberty who know its worth and who prize it high thus was the stage set for a struggle between the conceptions of identity and empire held by british ministers on the one hand and many american colonists on the other.
the costs of empire the great war for empire imposed enormous costs on great britain.
the national debt soared from 75 million to 133 million and was an observer noted becoming the alarming object of every british subject by wars end interest on the debt alone consumed 60 percent of the nations budget and the ministry had to raise taxes.
during the eighteenth century taxes were shifting from land owned by the gentry and aristocracy to consumables and successive ministries became ever more ingenious in devising new ways to raise money.
excise or sales taxes were levied on all kinds of ordinary goods salt and beer bricks and candles paper in the form of a stamp tax that were consumed by middling and poor britons.
in the 1760s the per capita tax burden was 20 percent of income.
to collect the taxes the government doubled the size of the tax bureaucracy figure 5 1.
customs agents patrolled the coasts of southern britain seizing tons of contraband french wines dutch tea and flemish textiles.
convicted smugglers faced heavy penalties including death or forced transportation to america as indentured servants.
despite colonial protests nearly fifty thousand english criminals had already been shipped to america to be sold as indentured servants.
the price of empire abroad was thus larger government and higher taxes at home.
members of two british opposition parties the radical whigs and the country party complained that the huge war debt placed the nation at the mercy of the monied interests the banks and financiers who reaped millions of pounds interest from government bonds.
to reverse the growth of government and the threat to personal liberty and property rights british reformers demanded that parliament represent a broader spectrum of the property owning classes.
the radical whig john wilkes condemned rotten boroughs sparsely populated aristocratic controlled electoral districts and demanded greater representation for rapidly growing commercial and manufacturing cities.
the war thus transformed british politics.
the war also revealed how little power britain wielded in its american colonies.
in theory royal governors had extensive political powers including command of the provincial militia in reality they shared power with the colonial assemblies which outraged british officials.
the board of trade complained that in massachusetts almost every act of executive and legislative power is ordered and directed by votes and resolves of the general court to enforce the collection of trade duties which colonial merchants had evaded for decades by bribing customs officials parliament passed the revenue act of 1762.
the ministry also instructed the royal navy to seize american vessels carrying food crops from the mainland colonies to the french west indies.
it was absurd declared a british politician that french armies attempting to destroy one english province.
are actually supported by bread raised in another britains military victory brought another fundamental shift in policy a new peacetime deployment of 15 royal battalions some 7 500 troops in north america c o m pa r e d britains atlantic and asian empires the following table enumerates the economic benefits derived by great britain from its various colonies which sent a wide variety of goods to britain and also served as markets for british exports.

greenland revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 chapter 5 the problem of empire 1763 1776 figure 5 1 the cost of empire 1690 1790 it cost money to build and maintain an empire.
as britain built a great navy subsidized the armies of european allies and fought four wars against france and spain between 1702 and 1783 military expenditures soared.
tax revenues did not keep pace so the government created a large national debt by issuing bonds for millions of pounds.
this policy created a class of wealthy financiers led to political protests and eventually prompted attempts to tax the american colonists.
military spending civil spending net tax income sterling millions american war of independence 1775 1783 war of the spanish succession 1702 1713 seven years war 1756 1763 war of the austrian succession 1740 1748 now that they no longer faced a threat from french canada.
the cost of stationing these troops estimated at 225 000 per year compounded britains fiscal crisis and it seemed clear that the burden had to be shared by the colonies.
they had always managed their own finances but the kings ministers agreed that parliament could no longer let them off the hook for the costs of empire.
the greatest gains from the war had come in north america where the specter of french encirclement had finally been lifted and the greatest new postwar expenses were being incurred in north america as well.
george grenville and the reform impulse the challenge of raising revenue from the colonies fell first to george grenville.
widely regarded as one of the ablest men in great britain grenville understood the need for far reaching imperial reform.
he first passed the currency act of 1764 which banned the american colonies from using paper money as legal tender.
colonial shopkeepers planters and farmers had used local currency which was worth less than british pounds sterling to pay their debts to british merchants.
the currency act ensured that merchants would no longer be paid in money printed in the colonies boosting their profits and british wealth.
the sugar act grenville also won parliamentary approval of the sugar act of 1764 to replace the widely ignored molasses act of 1733 see chapter 3.
the earlier act had set a tax rate of 6 pence per gallon on french molasses a rate so high that it made the trade unprofitable.
rather than pay it colonial merchants bribed customs officials at the going rate of 1 5 pence per gallon.
grenville settled on a duty of 3 pence per gallon which merchants could pay and still turn a profit and then tightened customs enforcement so that it could actually be collected.
this carefully crafted policy garnered little support in america.
new england merchants among them john hancock of boston had made their fortunes smuggling french molasses.
in 1754 boston merchants paid customs duties on a mere 400 hogsheads of molasses yet they imported 40 000 hogsheads for use by 63 massachusetts rum distilleries.
publicly the merchants claimed that the sugar act would ruin the distilling industry privately they vowed to evade the duty by smuggling or by bribing officials.
the end of salutary neglect more important colonists raised constitutional objections to the sugar act.

to protect the empires new mainland territories british ministers dispatched troops to florida and quebec.
they also sent troops to uphold the terms of the proclamation of 1763 which prohibited anglo american settlement west of the appalachian mountains.
pleasure by others cannot possibly have any property and they who have no property can have no freedom the sugar act raised other constitutional issues as well.
merchants prosecuted under the act would be tried in vice admiralty courts tribunals governing the high seas and run by british appointed judges.
previously merchants accused of navigation acts violations were tried by local common law courts where friendly juries often acquitted them.
the sugar act closed this legal loophole by extending the jurisdiction of the viceadmiralty courts to all customs offenses.
the sugar act revived old american fears.
the influential virginia planter richard bland emphasized that the american colonists were not sent out to be the slaves but to be the equals of those that remained behind john adams the young massachusetts lawyer defending john hancock on a charge of smuggling to see a longer excerpt of the richard bland document along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
chapter 5 argued that the vice admiralty courts diminished this equality by degrad ing every american.
below the rank of an englishman in fact accused smugglers in britain were also tried in vice admiralty courts so there was no discrimination against americans.
the real issue was the growing power of the british state.
americans had lived for decades under an administrative policy of salutary neglect.
now they saw that the new imperial regime would deprive them of some of their most essential rights as british subjects as a committee of the massachusetts assembly put it.
in response royal governor francis bernard replied the rule that a british subject shall not be bound by laws or liable to taxes but what he has consented to by his representatives must be confined to the inhabitants of great britain only to bernard grenville and other imperial reformers americans were second class subjects of the king with rights limited by the navigation acts parliamentary laws and british interests.
an open challenge the stamp act another new tax the stamp act of 1765 sparked the first great imperial crisis.
the new levy was to cover part of the cost of keeping british troops in america which turned out to be 385 000 a year about 150 million today 70 percent more than the initial estimate.
grenville hoped the stamp act would raise 60 000 per year.
the act would require a tax stamp on all printed items from college diplomas court documents land titles and contracts to newspapers almanacs and playing cards.
it was ingeniously designed.
like its counterpart in england it bore more heavily on the rich since it charged only a penny a sheet for newspapers and other common items but up to 10 for a lawyers license.
it also required no new bureaucracy stamped paper would be delivered to colonial ports and sold to printers in lieu of unstamped stock.
benjamin franklin agent of the pennsylvania assembly proposed a different solution american representation in parliament.
if you chuse to tax us he wrote give us members in your legislature and let us be one people with the exception of william pitt british politicians rejected franklins idea as too radical.
they argued that the colonists already had virtual representation in parliament because some of its members were transatlantic merchants and west indian sugar planters.
colonial leaders were equally skeptical of franklins plan.
americans were situate at a great distance from their mother country the connecticut the problem of empire 1763 1776 assembly declared and therefore cannot participate in the general legislature of the nation asserting the right of parliament to lay an internal tax upon the colonies the house of commons ignored american opposition and passed the act by an overwhelm understand ing majority of 205 to 49.
at points of view the request of general thomas why did most british and gage the british military com colonial leaders reject mander in america parliament the idea that the colonies also passed the quartering act should be represented in parliament.
of 1765 which required colonial governments to provide barracks and food for british troops.
finally parliament approved grenvilles proposal that violations of the stamp act be tried in vice admiralty courts.
using the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy grenville had begun to fashion a centralized imperial system in america much like that already in place in ireland british officials would govern the colonies with little regard for the local assemblies.
consequently the prime ministers plan provoked a constitutional confrontation on the specific issues of taxation jury trials and military quartering as well as on the general question of representative self government.
the dynamics of rebellion 1765 1770 in the name of reform grenville had thrown down the gauntlet to the americans.
the colonists had often resisted unpopular laws and aggressive governors but they had faced an all out attack on their institutions only once before in 1686 when james ii had unilaterally imposed the dominion of new england.
now the danger to colonial autonomy was even greater because both the king and parliament backed reform.
but the patriots as the defenders of american rights came to be called met the challenge posed by grenville and his successor charles townshend.
they organized protests formal and informal violent as well as peaceful and fashioned a compelling ideology of resistance.
formal protests and the politics of the crowd virginias house of burgesses was the first formal body to complain.
in may 1765 hotheaded young patrick henry denounced grenvilles legislation and attacked part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 protesting the stamp act in portsmouth new hampshire throughout the colonies disciplined mobs protesting the stamp act forced stamp distributors to resign their offices.

george iii for supporting it.
he compared the king to charles i whose tyranny had led to his overthrow and execution in the 1640s.
these remarks which bordered on treason frightened the burgesses nonetheless they condemned the stamp acts manifest tendency to destroy american freedom in massachusetts james otis another republican minded firebrand persuaded the house of representatives to call a meeting of all the mainland colonies to implore relief from the act.
the stamp act congress nine assemblies sent delegates to the stamp act congress which met in new york city in october 1765.
the congress protested the loss of american rights and liberties especially the right to trial by jury.
and it challenged the constitutionality of both the stamp and sugar acts by declaring that only the colonists elected representatives could tax them.
still moderate minded delegates wanted compromise not confrontation.
they assured parliament that americans glory in being subjects of the best of kings and humbly petitioned for repeal of the stamp act.
other influential americans favored active but peaceful resistance they organized a boycott of british goods.
crowd actions popular opposition also took a violent form however.

two weeks later bostonians attacked the house of lieutenant governor thomas hutchinson olivers brother in law and a prominent defender of imperial authority breaking his furniture looting his wine cellar and setting fire to his library.
wealthy merchants and patriot lawyers such as john hancock and john adams encouraged the mobs which were usually led by middling artisans and minor merchants.
in new york city nearly three thousand shopkeepers artisans laborers and seamen marched through the streets breaking windows and crying liberty resistance to the stamp act spread far beyond the port cities in nearly every colony angry crowds the rabble their detractors called them intimidated royal officials.
near wethersfield connecticut five hundred farmers seized tax collector jared ingersoll and forced him to resign his office in the cause of the people the motives of the crowd such crowd actions were common in both britain and america and protesters had many motives.
roused by the great awakening evangelical protestants resented arrogant british military officers and corrupt royal bureaucrats.
in new england where rioters invoked the antimonarchy sentiments of their great grandparents an anonymous letter sent to a boston newspaper promising to save all the freeborn sons of america was signed oliver cromwell the english republican revolutionary of the 1650s.
in new york city sons of liberty leaders isaac sears and alexander mcdougall were minor merchants and radical whigs who feared chapter 5 that imperial reform would undermine political liberty.
the mobs also included apprentices day laborers and unemployed sailors young men with their own notions of liberty who especially if they had been drinking were quick to resort to violence.
nearly everywhere popular resistance nullified the stamp act.
fearing an assault on fort george new york lieutenant governor cadwallader colden called on general gage to use his small military force to protect the stamps.
gage refused.
fire from the fort might disperse the mob but it would not quell them he told colden and the result would be an insurrection the commencement of civil war the tax was collected in barbados and jamaica but frightened collectors resigned their offices in all thirteen colonies that would eventually join in the declaration of independence.
this popular insurrection gave a democratic cast to the emerging patriot movement.
nothing is wanting but your own resolution declared a new york rioter for great is the authority and power of the people the ideological roots of resistance some americans couched their resistance in constitutional terms.
many were lawyers or well educated merchants and planters.
composing pamphlets of remarkable political sophistication they gave the resistance movement its rationale its political agenda and its leaders.
patriot writers drew on three intellectual traditions.
the first was english common law the centuries old body of legal rules and procedures that protected the lives and property of the monarchs subjects.
in the famous writs of assistance case of 1761 boston lawyer james otis invoked english legal precedents to challenge open ended search warrants.
in demanding a jury trial for john hancock in the late 1760s john adams appealed to the magna carta 1215 the ancient document that said adams has for many centuries been esteemed by englishmen as one of the.
firmest bulwarks of their liberties other lawyers protested that new strictures violated specific liberties and privileges granted in colonial charters or embodied in britains ancient constitution enlightenment rationalism provided patriots with a second important intellectual resource.
virginia planter thomas jefferson and other patriots drew on the writings of john locke who had argued that all individuals possessed certain natural rights life liberty and property that governments must protect see chapter 4.
and they turned to the works of the problem of empire 1763 1776 french philosopher montesquieu who had maintained that a separation of powers among government departments prevented arbitrary rule.
the republican and whig strands of the english political tradition provided a third ideological source for american patriots.
puritan new england had long venerated the commonwealth era 1649 1660 when england had been a republic see chapter 2.
after the glorious revolution of 1688 1689 many colonists praised the english whigs for creating a constitutional monarchy that prevented the king from imposing taxes and other measures.
joseph warren a physician and a radical whig patriot suggested that the stamp act was part of a ministerial plot to force the colonies into rebellion and justify the use of military power to reduce them to servitude john dickinsons letters from a farmer in pennsylvania 1768 urged colonists to remember your ancestors and your posterity and oppose parliamentary taxes.
the letters circulated widely and served as an early call to resistance.
if parliament could tax the colonies without their consent he wrote our boasted liberty is but a sound and nothing else such arguments widely publicized in newspapers and pamphlets gave intellectual substance to the patriot movement and turned a series of impromptu riots tax protests and boycotts of british manufactures into a formidable political force.
another kind of freedom we are taxed without our own consent dickinson wrote in one of his letters.
we are therefore slaves as patriot writers argued that taxation without representation made colonists the slaves of parliament many including benjamin franklin in philadelphia and james otis in massachusetts also began to con compare and demn the institution of chattel contrast slavery itself as a violation of why were southerners slaves natural rights.
african more threatened by chalamericans made the connection lenges to the institution of as well.
in massachusetts slaves slavery than northerners.
submitted at least four petitions to the legislature asking that slavery be abolished.
as one petition noted slaves have in common with other men a natural right to be free and without molestation to enjoy such property as they may acquire by their industry in the southern colonies where slaves constituted half or more of the population and the economy depended on their servitude the quest for freedom part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 alarmed slaveholders.
in november 1773 a group of virginia slaves hoped to win their freedom by supporting british troops that they heard would soon arrive in the colony.
their plan was uncovered and as james madison wrote proper precautions were taken to prevent the infection from spreading.
he fully understood how important it was to defend the colonists liberties without allowing the idea of natural rights to undermine the institution of slavery.
it is prudent he wrote such things should be concealed as well as suppressed throughout the revolution the quest for african american rights and liberties would play out alongside that of the colonies but unlike national independence the liberation of african americans would not be fulfilled for many generations.
parliament and patriots square off again phillis wheatley born in west africa and enslaved as a child phillis wheatley was purchased by boston merchant and tailor john wheatley when she was eight.
tutored by wheatleys children phillis learned to read english greek and latin by the age of twelve.
this engraving which pictures her at a writing desk was the frontispiece for her poems on various subjects religious and moral 1773 which was praised by george washington and gained attention in both britain and the colonies.
freed upon the death of her master wheatley married john peters a free black man.
he was later imprisoned for debt forcing wheatley to take employment as a maid.
she died in 1784 at age thirty one none of her three children survived infancy.

disputes over domestic policy had led george iii to dismiss grenville as prime minister table 5 2.
however grenvilles allies demanded that imperial reform continue if necessary at gunpoint.
the british legislature declared chief justice sir james mansfield has authority to bind every part and every subject whether such subjects have a right to vote or not yet a majority in parliament was persuaded that the stamp act was cutting deeply into british exports and thus doing more harm than good.
the avenues of trade are all shut up a bristol merchant told parliament we have no remittances and are at our witts end for want of money to fulfill our engagements with our tradesmen grenvilles successor the earl of rockingham forged a compromise.
to mollify the colonists and help british merchants he repealed the stamp act and reduced the duty on molasses imposed by the sugar act to a penny a gallon.
then he pacified imperial reformers and hard liners with the declaratory act of 1766 which explicitly reaffirmed parliaments full power and authority to make laws and statutes.
to bind the colonies and people of america.
in all cases whatsoever by swiftly ending the stamp act crisis rockingham hoped it would be forgotten just as quickly.
charles townshend steps in often the course of history is changed by a small event an illness a personal grudge a chance remark.
that was the case in 1767 when george iii named william pitt to head a new government.
pitt chronically ill and often absent chapter 5 the problem of empire 1763 1776 celebrating repeal this british cartoon mocking supporters of the stamp act the repeal or the funeral procession of miss americ stamp was probably commissioned by merchants trading with america.

the granger collection new york.
from parliamentary debates left chancellor of the exchequer charles townshend in command.
pitt was sympathetic toward america townshend was not.
as a member of the board of trade townshend had sought restrictions on the colonial assemblies and strongly supported the stamp act.
in 1767 he promised to find a new source of revenue in america.
the new tax legislation the townshend act of 1767 had both fiscal and political goals.
it imposed duties on colonial imports of paper paint glass and tea that were expected to raise about 40 000 a year.
though townshend did allocate some of this revenue for american military expenses he earmarked most of it to pay the salaries of royal governors judges and other imperial officials who had always previously been paid by colonial assemblies.
now he hoped royal appointees could better enforce parliamentary laws and carry out the kings instructions.
townshend next devised the revenue act of 1767 which created a board of customs commissioners in boston and viceadmiralty courts in halifax boston philadelphia and charleston.
by using parliamentary taxes to finance imperial administration townshend intended to undermine american political institutions.
the townshend duties revived the constitutional debate over taxation.
during the stamp act crisis some americans including benjamin franklin distinguished between external and internal taxes.
they suggested that external duties on trade such as those long mandated by the navigation acts were acceptable to americans but that direct or internal taxes were not.
townshend thought this distinction was perfect nonsense but he indulged the americans and laid duties only on trade.
a second boycott and the daughters of liberty even so most colonial leaders rejected the legitimacy of townshends measures.
in february 1768 the massachusetts assembly condemned the townshend act and boston and new york merchants began a new boycott of british goods.
throughout puritan new england ministers and public officials discouraged the purchase of foreign superfluities and promoted the domestic manufacture of cloth and other necessities.
american women ordinarily excluded from public affairs became crucial to the nonimportation movement.
they reduced their households consumption of imported goods and produced large quantities of homespun cloth.
pious farmwives spun yarn at their ministers homes.
in berwick maine true daughters of liberty celebrated american products by drinking rye coffee and dining on bear venison other womens groups supported the boycott with charitable work spinning flax and wool for the needy.
just as patriot men followed tradition by joining crowd actions so womens protests reflected their customary concern for the well being of the community.
newspapers celebrated these exploits of the daughters of liberty.
one massachusetts town proudly claimed an annual output of 30 000 yards of cloth east hartford connecticut reported 17 000 yards.
this part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 surge in domestic production did not offset the loss of british imports which had averaged how did the nonimporabout 10 million yards of cloth tation movement bring annually but it brought thouwomen into the political sands of women into the public sphere.
the boycott mobilized many american men as well.
in the seaport cities the sons of liberty published the names of merchants who imported british goods and harassed their employees and customers.
by march 1769 the nonimportation movement had spread to philadelphia two months later the members of the virginia house of burgesses vowed not to buy dutied articles luxury goods or imported slaves.
reflecting colonial self confidence benjamin franklin called for a return to the pre 1763 mercantilist system repeal the laws renounce the right recall the troops refund the money and return to the old method of requisition explain consequences despite the enthusiasm of patriots nonimportation accompanied by pressure on merchants and consumers who resisted it opened fissures in colonial society.
not only royal officials but also merchants farmers and ordinary folk were subject to new forms of surveillance and coercion a pattern that would only become more pronounced as the imperial crisis unfolded.
troops to boston american resistance only increased british determination.
when the massachusetts assemblys letter opposing the townshend duties reached london lord hillsborough the secretary of state for american affairs branded it unjustifiable opposition to the constitutional authority of parliament to strengthen the hand of government in massachusetts hillsborough dispatched general thomas gage and 2 000 british troops to boston map 5 3.
once in massachusetts gage accused its leaders of treasonable and desperate resolves and edenton ladies tea party in october 1774 a group of fifty one women from edenton north carolina led by penelope barker created a local association to support a boycott of british goods.
patriots in the colonies praised the edenton tea party which was one of the first formal female political associations in north america but it was ridiculed in britain where this cartoon appeared in march 1775.
the women are given a mannish appearance and the themes of promiscuity and neglect to their female duties are suggested by the presence of a slave and an amorous man the neglected child and the urinating dog.

the proclamation line had drawn a boundary between the colonies and indian country.
the line was originally intended as a temporary barrier.
it prohibited settlement for the present and until our further pleasure be known the proclamation also created three new mainland colonies quebec east florida and west florida and thus opened new opportunities at the northern and southern extremities of british north america.
but many colonists looked west rather than north or south.
four groups in the colonies were especially interested in westward expansion.
first gentlemen who had invested in numerous land speculation companies were petitioning the crown for large land grants in the ohio country.
second officers who served in the seven years war were paid in land warrants up to 5 000 acres identify causes for field officers and some led what groups were most by george washington were interested in western exploring possible sites beyond lands and why did the appalachians.

the following documents illustrate some of the patterns that shaped life beyond the proclamation line between 1763 and 1776.
colonel john bradstreets thoughts on indian affairs 1764.
colonel john bradstreet led a force of british redcoats to fort niagara in response to pontiacs rebellion.
he drafted these remarks shortly afterward.
of all the savages upon the continent the most knowing the most intriguing the less useful and the greatest villains are those most conversant with the europeans and deserve most the attention of govern men t by way of correction and these are the six nations shawanese and delawares they are well acquainted with the defenceless state of the inhabitants who live on the frontiers and think they will ever have it in their power to distress and plunder them and never cease raising the jealousy of the upper nations against us by propagating amongst them such stories as make them believe the english have nothing so much at heart as the extirpation of all savages.
the apparent design of the six nations is to keep us at war with all savages but themselves that they may be employed as mediators between us and them.
william johnson to the british lords of trade 1763.
william johnson a new yorker with extensive experience in indian relations was the crowns superintendent for indian affairs in the northern colonies.
t he colonies had all along neglected to cultivate a proper understanding with the indians and from a mistaken notion have greatly dispised them without considering that it is in their power at pleasure to lay waste and destroy the frontiers.
without any exageration i look upon the northern indians to be the most formidable of any uncivilized body of people in the world.
hunting and war are their sole occupations and the one qualifies them for the other they have few wants and those are easily supplied their properties of little value consequently expeditions against them however successful cannot distress them and they have courage sufficient for their manner of fighting the nature and situation of their countrys require not more.

great numbers more of your people have come over the great mountains and settled throughout this country and we are sorry to tell you that several quarrels have happened between your people and ours in which people have been killed on both sides and that we now see the nations round us and your people ready to embroil in a quarrel which gives our nations great concerns as we on our parts want to live in friendship with you.
as you have always told us you have laws to govern your people by but we do not see that you have therefore brethren unless you can fall upon some method of governing your people who live between the great mountains and the ohio river and who are now very numerous it will be out of the indians power to govern their young men for we assure you the black clouds begin to gather fast in this country.
we find your people are very fond of our rich land.
we see them quarrelling every day about land and burning one anothers houses so that we do not know how soon they may come over the river ohio and drive us from our villages nor do we see you brothers take any care to stop them.

there they formed the scioto confederacy which pledged to oppose any further expansion into the ohio country.
meanwhile in london the idea that the proclamation line was only temporary gave way to the view that it should be permanent.
hillsborough who became colonial secretary in 1768 adamantly opposed westward expansion believing it would antagonize the indians without benefitting the empire.
moreover he owned vast irish estates and he was alarmed by the number of tenants who were leaving ireland for america.
to preserve britains laboring class as well as control costs hillsborough wanted to make the proclamation line permanent.
for colonists who were already moving west to settle in large numbers this shift in policy caused confusion and frustration.
eventually like the patriots along the seaboard they would take matters into their own hands.
parliament wavers in britain the colonies nonimportation agreement was taking its toll.
in 1768 the colonies had cut imports of british manufactures in half by 1769 the mainland colonies had a trade surplus with britain of 816 000.
hard hit by these developments british merchants and manufacturers petitioned parliament to repeal the townshend duties.
early in 1770 lord north became prime minister.
a witty man and a skillful politician north designed a new compromise.
arguing that it was foolish to tax british exports to america thereby raising their price and decreasing consumption he persuaded parliament to repeal most of the townshend duties.
however north retained the tax on tea as a symbol of parliaments supremacy figure 5 2.
the boston massacre even as parliament was debating norths repeal events in boston guaranteed that reconciliation between patriots and parliament would be hard to achieve.
between 1 200 and 2 000 troops had been stationed in boston for a year and a half.
soldiers were also stationed in new york philadelphia several towns in new jersey and various frontier outposts in these years with a minimum of conflict or violence.
but in boston a small port town on a tiny peninsula the troops numbered 10 percent of the local population and their presence wore on the locals.
on the night of march 5 1770 a group of nine british redcoats fired into a crowd and killed five townspeople.
a subsequent trial exonerated the soldiers but bostons radical whigs convinced of a ministerial conspiracy against liberty labeled the incident a massacre and used it to rally sentiment against imperial power.
sovereignty debated when news of norths compromise arrived in the colonies in the wake of the boston massacre the reaction was mixed.
most of britains colonists remained loyal to the empire but five years of conflict had taken their toll.
in 1765 american leaders had accepted parliaments authority the stamp act resolves had opposed only certain unconstitutional legislation.
by 1770 the most outspoken patriots benjamin franklin in pennsylvania patrick henry in virginia and samuel adams in massachusetts repudiated parliamentary supremacy and claimed equality for the american assemblies within the empire.
franklin suggested that the colonies figure 5 2 imports from britain boycott periods credit crisis 4 5 repeal of townshend act 4 0 3 5 3 0 2 5 trade as a political weapon 1763 1776 exports to britain millions tea act townshend act colonial trade deficit stamp act 2 0 1 5 1 0 0 5 political upheaval did not affect the mainland colonies exports to britain which rose slightly over the period but imports fluctuated greatly.
the american boycott of 1765 1766 prompted a dip in imports but the second boycott of 1768 1770 led to a sharp drop in imports of british textiles metal goods and ceramics.
imports of manufactures soared after the repeal of the townshend duties only to plummet when the first continental congress proclaimed a third boycott in 1774.

were now distinct and separate states with the same head or sovereign the king franklins suggestion outraged thomas hutchinson the american born royal governor of massachusetts.
hutchinson emphatically rejected the idea of two independent legislatures in one and the same state he told the massachusetts assembly i know of no line that can be drawn between the supreme authority of parliament and the total independence of the colonies there the matter rested.
the british had twice imposed revenue acts on the colonies and american patriots had twice forced a retreat.
if parliament insisted on a policy of constitutional absolutism by imposing taxes a third time some americans were prepared to pursue violent resistance.
nor did they flinch when reminded that george iii condemned their agitation.
as the massachusetts house replied to hutchinson there is more reason to dread the consequences trace change of absolute uncontrolled supreme over time power whether of a nation or a what was benjamin monarch than those of total inde franklins position on colonial representation pendence fearful of civil war in 1765 and why had his lord norths ministry hesitated to view changed by 1770.
force the issue.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 the road to independence 1771 1776 repeal of the townshend duties in 1770 restored harmony to the british empire but strong feelings and mutual distrust lay just below the surface.
in 1773 those emotions erupted destroying any hope of compromise.
within two years the americans and the british clashed in armed conflict.
despite widespread resistance among loyal colonists patriot legislators created provisional governments and military forces the two essentials for independence.
a compromise repudiated once aroused political passions are not easily quieted.
in boston samuel adams and other radical patriots continued to warn americans of imperial domination and late in 1772 persuaded the town meeting to set up a committee of correspondence to state the rights of the colonists of this province soon eighty massachusetts towns had similar committees.
when british officials threatened to seize the americans responsible for the burning of the customs vessel gaspe and prosecute them in britain the virginia house of burgesses and several other assemblies set up their own committees of correspondence.
these standing committees allowed patriots to communicate with leaders in other colonies when new threats to liberty occurred.
by 1774 among the colonies that would later declare independence only pennsylvania was without one.
the east india company and the tea act these committees sprang into action when parliament passed the tea act of may 1773.
the act provided financial relief for the east india company a royally chartered private corporation that served as the instrument of british imperialism.
the company was deeply in debt it also had a huge surplus of tea as a result of high import duties which led britons and colonists alike to drink smuggled understand dutch tea instead.
the tea act points of view gave the company a government why did colonists react so loan and to boost its revenue strongly against the tea act which imposed a small canceled the import duties on tea tax and actually lowered the company exported to ireland the price of tea.
and the american colonies.
now even with the townshend duty of 3 pence a pound on tea high quality east india company tea would cost less than the dutch tea smuggled into the colonies by american merchants.
radical patriots accused the british ministry of bribing americans with the cheaper east india companys tea so they would give up their principled opposition to the tea tax.
as an anonymous woman wrote to the massachusetts spy the use of british tea is considered not as a private but as a public evil.
a handle to introduce a variety of.
oppressions amongst us merchants joined the protest because the east india company planned to distribute its tea directly to shopkeepers excluding american wholesalers from the trades profits.
the fear of an introduction of a monopoly in this country british general frederick haldimand reported from new york has induced the mercantile part of the inhabitants to be very industrious in opposing this step and added strength to a spirit of independence already too prevalent the tea party and the coercive acts the sons of liberty prevented east india company ships from delivering their cargoes in new york philadelphia and charleston.
in massachusetts royal governor hutchinson was determined to land the tea and collect the tax.
to foil the governors plan artisans and laborers disguised as indians boarded three ships the dartmouth the eleanor and the beaver on december 16 1773 broke open 342 chests of tea valued at about 10 000 or about 900 000 today and threw them into the harbor.
this destruction of the tea.
must have so important consequences john adams wrote in his diary that i cannot but consider it as an epoch in history the king was outraged.
concessions have made matters worse george iii declared.
the time has come for compulsion early in 1774 parliament passed four coercive acts to force massachusetts to pay for the tea and to submit to imperial authority.
the boston port bill closed boston harbor to shipping the massachusetts government act annulled the colonys charter and prohibited most town meetings a new quartering act mandated new barracks for british troops and the justice act allowed trials for capital crimes to be transferred to other colonies or to britain.
patriot leaders throughout the colonies branded the measures intolerable and rallied support for massachusetts.
in georgia a patriot warned the freemen of the province that every privilege you at present claim as a birthright may be wrested from you by the same authority that blockades the town of boston the cause of boston george washington declared in virginia now is and ever will be considered as the cause of america the committees of correspondence had created a firm sense of patriot unity.
chapter 5 the problem of empire 1763 1776 the boston tea party led by radical patriots disguised as mohawk indians bostonians dumped the east india companys taxed tea into the harbor.
the rioters made clear their pure political motives by punishing those who sought personal gain one son of liberty who stole some of the tea was stripped of his booty and his clothes together and sent home naked library of congress.
in 1774 parliament also passed the quebec act which allowed the practice of roman catholicism in quebec.
this concession to quebecs predominantly catholic population reignited religious passions in new england where protestants associated catholicism with arbitrary royal government.
because the act extended quebecs boundaries into the ohio river valley it likewise angered influential land speculators in virginia and pennsylvania and ordinary settlers by the thousands map 5 4.
although the ministry did not intend the quebec act as a coercive measure many colonists saw it as further proof of parliaments intention to control american affairs.
the continental congress responds in response to the coercive acts patriot leaders convened a new continent wide body the continental congress.
twelve mainland colonies sent representatives.

the assemblies of barbados jamaica and the other sugar islands although wary of british domination were even more fearful of revolts by their predominantly african populations and therefore declined to attend.
the delegates who met in philadelphia in september 1774 had different agendas.
southern representatives fearing a british plot to overturn the constitution and introduce a system of arbitrary government advocated a new economic boycott.
independence minded representatives from new england demanded political union and defensive military preparations.
many delegates from the middle atlantic colonies favored compromise.
led by joseph galloway of pennsylvania these men of loyal principles proposed a new political system similar to benjamin franklins proposal at the albany congress of 1754 each colony would retain its assembly to legislate on local matters and a new continent wide body would handle general american affairs.
the king would appoint a president general to preside over a legislative council selected by the colonial assemblies.
galloways plan failed by a single vote a bare majority thought it was too conciliatory american voices p 172.

the quebec act of 1774 designated most western lands as indian reserves and vastly enlarged the boundaries of quebec dashing speculators hopes and eliminating the old sea to sea land claims of many seaboard colonies.
the act especially angered new england protestants who condemned it for allowing french residents to practice catholicism and colonial political leaders who protested its failure to provide quebec with a representative assembly.

and the british west indies.
ten years of constitutional conflict had culminated in a threat of all out commercial warfare.
a few british leaders still hoped for compromise.
in january 1775 william pitt now sitting in the house of lords as the earl of chatham asked parliament to renounce its power to tax the colonies and to recognize the continental congress as a lawful body.
in return he suggested the congress should acknowledge parliamentary supremacy and provide a permanent source of revenue to help defray the national debt.
the british ministry rejected pitts plan.
twice it had backed down in the face of colonial resistance a third retreat was impossible.
branding the continental congress an illegal assembly the ministry rejected 70w lord dartmouths proposal to send commissioners to negotiate a settlement.
instead lord north set stringent terms americans must pay for their own defense and administration and acknowledge parliaments authority to tax them.
to put teeth in these demands north imposed a naval blockade on american trade with foreign nations and ordered general gage to suppress dissent in massachusetts.
now the case seemed desperate the prime minister told thomas hutchinson whom the patriots had forced into exile in london.
parliament would not could not concede.
for aught he could see it must come to violence the rising of the countryside the fate of the urban led patriot movement would depend on the colonies large rural population.
most farmers had little interest in imperial affairs.
their lives were deeply rooted in the soil and their prime allegiance was to family and community.
but imperial policies had increasingly intruded into the lives of farm families by sending their sons to war and raising their taxes.
in 1754 farmers on long island new york had paid an average tax of 10 shillings by 1756 thanks to chapter 5 the great war for empire their taxes had jumped to 30 shillings.
the continental association the boycotts of 1765 and 1768 raised the political consciousness of rural americans.
when the first continental congress established the continental association in 1774 to enforce a third boycott of british goods it quickly set up a rural network of committees to do its work.
in concord massachusetts 80 percent of the male heads of families and a number of single women signed a solemn league and covenant supporting nonimportation.
in other farm towns men blacked their faces disguised themselves in blankets like indians and threatened violence against shopkeepers who traded in rum molasses sugar c in violation of the boycott.
patriots likewise warned that british measures threatened the yeoman tradition of landownership.
in petersham massachusetts the town meeting worried that new british taxes would drain this people of the fruits of their toil arable land was now scarce and expensive in older communities and in new settlements merchants were seizing farmsteads for delinquent the problem of empire 1763 1776 debts.
by the 1770s many northern yeomen felt personally threatened by british policies which a patriot pamphlet warned were paving the way for reducing the country to lordships table 5 3.
southern planters fear dependency despite their higher standard of living southern slave owners had similar fears.
many chesapeake planters were deeply in debt to british merchants.
accustomed to being absolute masters on their slave labor plantations and seeing themselves as guardians of english liberties planters resented their financial dependence on british creditors and dreaded the prospect of political subservience to british officials.
that danger now seemed real.
if parliament used the coercive acts to subdue massachusetts then it might turn next to virginia dissolving its representative assembly and assisting british merchants to seize debt burdened properties.
consequently the virginia gentry supported demands by indebted yeomen farmers to close the law courts so that they could bargain with merchants over debts without the threat of legal action.

the reason was simple franklin said a right to lay internal taxes was never supposed to be in parliament as we are not represented there franklin recognized that representation was central to the imperial debate.
as the following selections show the failure to solve the problem of representation and the closely related issue of parliamentary sovereignty led to the american rebellion.
jared ingersoll report on the debates in parliament 1765 connecticut lawyer jared ingersoll 1722 1781 served as his colonys agent or lobbyist in britain.
in this 1765 letter to the governor of connecticut ingersoll summarizes the debate then under way in parliament over the stamp act.
when the act passed he returned home to become the stamp distributor in connecticut.
a mob forced him to resign that post.
ingersoll later served as a vice admiralty judge in philadelphia and during the revolution remained loyal to britain.
the principal attention has been to the stamp bill that has been preparing to lay before parliament for taxing america.
the point of the authority of parliament to impose such tax i found on my arrival here was so fully and universally yielded accepted that there was not the least hopes of making any impressions that way.
i beg leave to give you a summary of the arguments which are made use of in favour of such authority.
the house of commons say they is a branch of the supreme legislature of the nation and which in its nature is supposed to represent or rather to stand in the place of the commons that is of the great body of the people.
that this house of commons therefore is now.
a part of the supreme unlimited power of the nation as in every state there must be some unlimited power and authority.
they say a power to tax is a necessary part of every supreme legislative authority and that if they have not that power over america they have none and then america is at once a kingdom of itself.
on the other hand those who oppose the bill say it is true the parliament have a supreme unlimited authority over every part and branch of the kings dominions and as well over ireland as any other place.
yet they say we believe a british parliament will never think it prudent to tax ireland or america.
tis true they say that the commons of england and of the british empire are all represented in and by the house of commons but this representation is confessedly on all hands by construction and virtual because most british subjects.
have no hand in choosing the representatives.
they say further that the effects of this implied representation here and in america must be infinitely different in the article of taxation.
by any mistake an act of parliament is made that prove injurious and hard the member of parliament here in britain sees with his own eyes and is moreover very accessible to the people.
also the taxes are laid equally by one rule and fall as well on the member himself as on the people.
but as to america from the great distance in point of situation they are not represented in the same way.
finally the opponents of the act say we already by the regulations upon their trade draw from the americans all that they can spare.
this step of taxation should not take place until or unless the americans are allowed to send members to parliament.
thus i have given you i think the substance of the arguments on both sides of that great and important question of the right and also of the expediency of taxing america by authority of parliament.
but upon a division of the house upon the question there was about 250 to about 50 in favour of the bill.

joseph galloway plan of union 1775 speaker of the pennsylvania assembly joseph galloway was a delegate to the first continental congress where he proposed a plan that addressed the issue of representation.
the colonies would remain british but operate under a continental government with the power to veto parliamentary laws that affected america.
radical patriots in the congress who favored independence prevented a vote on galloways plan and suppressed mention of it in the records.
galloway remained loyal to the crown fought on the british side in the war for independence and moved to england in 1778.
if we sincerely mean to accommodate the difference between the two countries.
we must take into consideration a number of facts which led the parliament to pass the acts complained of.
you will recall the dangerous situation of the colonies from the intrigues of france and the incursions of the canadians and their indian allies at the commencement of the last war.
great britain sent over her fleets and armies for their protection.
in this state of the colonies it was not unreasonable to expect that parliament would have levied a tax on them proportionate to their wealth.
parliament was naturally led to exercise the power which had been by its predecessors so often exercised over the colonies and to pass the stamp act.
against this act the colonies petitioned parliament and denied its authority.
declaring that the colonies could not be represented in that body.
this justly alarmed the british senate.
it was thought and called by the ablest men in britain a clear and explicit declaration of the american independence and compelled the parliament to pass the declaratory act in order to save its ancient and incontrovertible right of supremacy over all the parts of the empire.
having thus briefly stated the arguments in favour of parliamentary authority.
i am free to confess that the exercise of that authority is not perfectly constitutional in respect to the colonies.
we know that the whole landed interest of britain is represented in that body while neither the land nor the people of america hold the least participation in the legislative authority of the state.
representation or a participation in the supreme councils of the state is the great principle upon which the freedom of the british government is established and secured.
i wish to see.
the right to participate in the supreme councils of the state extended in some form.
to america.
and therefore have prepared the draught of a plan for uniting america more intimately in constitutional policy with great britain.
i am certain when dispassionately considered it will be found to be the most perfect union in power and liberty with the parent state next to a representation in parliament and i trust it will be approved of by both countries.
the plan that the several colonial assemblies shall form an american union and choose members for the grand council.
that the grand council.
shall hold and exercise all the like rights liberties and privileges as are held and exercised by and in the house of commons of great britain.
that the president general shall hold his office during the pleasure of the king and his assent shall be requisite to all acts of the grand council and it shall be his office and duty to cause them to be carried into execution.
that the president general by and with the advice and consent of the grand council hold and exercise all the legislative rights powers and authorities necessary for regulating and administering all the general police and affairs of the colonies.
that the said president general and the grand council be an inferior and distinct branch of the british legislature united and incorporated with it.
and that the assent of both parliament and the grand council shall be requisite to the validity of all such general acts or statutes that affect the colonies.

questions for analysis 1.
according to ingersoll what were the main arguments of those in parliament who opposed the stamp act.
did those opposing the stamp act agree with the acts supporters that parliament had the right to tax the colonies.
how did galloways plan solve the problem of colonial representation in parliament.
how would the british ministers who advocated parliamentary supremacy have reacted to the plan.
the framers of the u s constitution addressed the problem of dividing authority between state governments and the national government by allowing the states to retain legal authority over most matters and delegating limited powers to the national government.
could such a solution have been implemented in the british empire.
why or why not.
part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 fanned by the gentlemen of influence will i make no doubt burst out again into a flame loyalists and neutrals yet in many places the patriot movement was a hard sell.
in virginia patriot leaders were nearly all wealthy planters and many of their poorer neighbors regarded the movement with suspicion.
in regions where great landowners became patriots the hudson river valley of new york for example many tenant farmers supported the king because they hated their landlords.
similar social conflicts prompted some regulators in the north carolina backcountry and many farmers in eastern maryland to oppose the patriots there.
there were many reasons to resist the patriot movement.
skeptics believed that patriot leaders were subverting british rule only to advance their own selfish interests.
peter oliver wrote of samuel adams for example he was so thorough a machiavilian that he divested himself of every worthy principle would stick at no crime to accomplish his ends some gentlemen of influence worried that resistance to britain would undermine all political institutions and introduce anarchy and disorder and render life and property here precarious their fears increased when the sons of liberty used intimidation and violence to uphold the boycotts.
one well to do new yorker complained no man can be in a more abject state of bondage than he whose reputation property and life are exposed to the discretionary violence.
of the community as the crisis deepened such men became loyalists so called because they remained loyal to the british crown.
many other colonists simply hoped to stay out of the fray.
some did so on principle in new jersey and pennsylvania thousands of pacifist quakers and germans resisted conscription and violence out of religious conviction.
others were ambivalent or confused about the political crisis unfolding around them.
the delegate elected to new yorks provincial congress from queens county on long island chose not to attend since the people he represented seemed to be much inclined to remain peaceable and quiet more than three fourths of queens county voters in fact opposed sending any delegate at all.
many loyal or neutral colonists hoped above all to preserve their families property and independence whatever the outcome of the imperial crisis.
historians estimate that some 15 to 20 percent of the white population perhaps as many as 400 000 colonists were loyal to the crown.
some managed to avoid persecution but many were pressured by their neighbors to join the boycotts and subjected to violence and humiliation if they refused.
as patriots took over the reins of local government throughout the colonies loyalists were driven out of their homes or forced into silence.
at this crucial juncture patriots commanded the allegiance or at least the acquiescence of the majority of white americans.
violence east and west by 1774 british authority was wavering.
at the headwaters of the ohio the abandonment of fort pitt left a power vacuum that was filled by opportunistic men led by a royally appointed governor acting in defiance of his commission.
in massachusetts the attempt to isolate and punish boston and the surrounding countryside backfired as patriots resisted military coercion.
violence resulted in both places and with it the collapse of imperial control.
lord dunmores war in the years since the end of pontiacs rebellion at least 10 000 people had traveled along braddocks and forbess roads to the headwaters of the ohio river where fort pitt had replaced fort duquesne during the great war for empire and staked claims to land around pittsburgh map 5 5.
they relied for protection on fort pitt which remained one of britains most important frontier outposts.
but the revenue crisis forced general gage to cut expenses and in october 1772 the army pulled down the forts log walls and left the site to the local population.
settler relations with the neighboring ohio indians were tenuous and illdefined and the forts abandonment left them exposed and vulnerable.
in the ensuing power vacuum pennsylvania and virginia both claimed the region.
pennsylvania had the better claim on paper.
it had organized county governments established courts and collected taxes there.
but in keeping with its pacifist quaker roots it did not organize a militia.
in this decision virginias royal governor the earl of dunmore recognized an opportunity.
appointed to his post in 1771 dunmore was an irascible and unscrupulous man who clashed repeatedly with the house of burgesses.
but when it suited him he was just as willing to defy the crown.
in 1773 he traveled to pittsburgh where he later wrote the people flocked about me and beseeched me.

in the summer of 1774 dunmore took the next step.
in defiance of both his royal instructions and the house of burgesses he called out virginias militia and led a force of 2 400 men against the ohio shawnees who had a long standing claim to kentucky as a hunting ground.
they fought a single battle at point pleasant the shawnees were defeated and dunmore and his militia forces claimed kentucky as their own.
a participant justified his actions shortly afterward when without a king he wrote one doeth according to the freedom of his own will years of neglect left many colonists in the backcountry feeling abandoned by the crown.

as the congress opened 3 000 british troops attacked american fortifications on breeds hill and bunker hill overlooking boston.
after three assaults and 1 000 casualties they finally dislodged the patriot militia.
inspired by his countrymens valor john adams exhorted the congress to rise to the defense of american liberty by creating a continental army.
he nominated george washington to lead it.
after bitter debate the congress approved the proposals but adams lamented only by bare majorities congress versus king george despite the bloodshed in massachusetts a majority in the congress still hoped for reconciliation.
led by john dickinson of pennsylvania these moderates won approval of a petition expressing loyalty to george iii and asking for repeal of oppressive parliamentary legislation.
but samuel adams patrick henry and other zealous patriots drummed up support for a declaration of the causes and necessities of taking up arms.
americans dreaded the calamities of civil war the declaration asserted but were resolved to die freemen rather than to live as slaves george iii failed to exploit the divisions among the patriots instead in august 1775 he issued a proclamation for suppressing rebellion and sedition.

they had fought and bled for the land in dunmores war and now wanted to fight against the crown and its indian allies in the ohio country.
virginia agreed in 1776 it organized six new frontier counties and sent arms and ammunition to kentucky.

the shawnees and other ohio indians opposed the settlers and colonists built their tiny towns in the form of stations to protect themselves groups of cabins connected by palisades to form small forts.
these western settlers had confused political loyalties.
many had marched under dunmore and hoped to receive recognition for their claims from the crown.
but as the rebellion unfolded most recognized that the patriots emphasis on liberty and equality squared with their view of the world.
they soon petitioned virginias rebel government asking it to create a new county that as military conflicts escalated americans were divided in their opinions of king george iii.
many blamed him for supporting oppressive legislation and ordering armed retaliation but other influential colonists held out the hope that he might mediate their conflict with parliament.
john dickinson whose letters did so much to arouse patriot resistance in 1768 nevertheless believed that war with great britain would be folly.
in july 1775 he persuaded congress to send george iii the olive branch petition which pleaded with the king to negotiate.
john adams a staunch supporter of independence was infuriated by dickinsons waffling.
but dickinson had many supporters both inside and outside of congress.
for example many of philadelphias quaker and anglican merchants were neutrals or loyalists.
in response to their passivity patriot artisans in the city organized a mechanics association to protect americas just rights and privileges daniel boone escorting settlers through the cumberland gap in 1775 daniel boone led a group of prospective settlers into kentucky on behalf of richard henderson a north carolina judge and self appointed proprietor of a land speculation venture called the transylvania colony.
hendersons venture soon collapsed but boonesborough was one of perhaps a dozen towns founded in kentucky in violation of crown policy that summer.
boone became a folk hero and in the mid nineteenth century george caleb bingham painted this memorable scene.

thomas paines common sense part 3 revolution and republican culture 1763 1820 with popular sentiment in flux a single brief pamphlet helped tip the balance.
in january 1776 thomas paine published common sense a rousing call for independence and a republican form of government.
paine had served as a minor customs official in england until he was fired for joining a protest against low wages.
in 1774 paine migrated to philadelphia where he met benjamin rush and other patriots who shared his republican sentiments.
in common sense paine assaulted the traditional monarchical order in stirring language.
monarchy and hereditary succession have laid the world in blood and ashes paine proclaimed leveling a personal attack at george iii the hard hearted sullen pharaoh of england mixing insults with biblical quotations paine blasted the british system of mixed government that balanced power among the three estates of king lords and commoners.
paine granted that the system was noble for the dark and slavish times of the past but now it yielded only monarchical tyranny in the person of the king and aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the peers paine argued for american independence by turning the traditional metaphor of patriarchal authority on its head is it the interest of a man to be a boy all his life he asked.
within six months common sense had gone through twenty five editions and reached hundreds of thousands of people.
there is great talk of independence a worried new york loyalist noted the unthinking multitude are mad for it.

in june 1776 richard henry lee presented virginias resolution to the continental congress that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states faced with certain defeat staunch loyalists and anti independence moderates withdrew from the congress leaving committed patriots to take the fateful step.
on july 4 1776 the congress approved the declaration of independence see documents p d 1.
the declarations main author thomas jefferson of virginia had mobilized resistance to the coercive acts with the pamphlet a summary view of the rights of british america 1774.
now in the declaration he justified independence and republicanism to americans and the world by vilifying george iii he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burned our towns and destroyed the lives of our people such a prince was a tyrant jefferson concluded and is unfit to be the ruler of a free people employing the ideas of the european enlightenment jefferson proclaimed a series of self evident truths that all men are created equal that they possess the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit independence declared in this painting by john trumbull thomas jefferson and the other drafters of the declaration john adams of massachusetts roger sherman of connecticut robert livingston of new york and benjamin franklin of pennsylvania present the document to john hancock the president of the second continental congress.
one patriot observer reported that when the declaration was read at a public meeting in new york city on july 10 a massive statue of george iii was pulled down by the populace and its 4 000 pounds of lead melted down to make musquet balls for use against the british troops massed on staten island.

for jefferson as for paine the pen proved mightier than the sword.
the declaration won wide support in france and germany at home it sparked celebrations in rural hamlets and seaport cities as crowds burned effigies and toppled statues of the king.
on july 8 1776 in easton pennsylvania a great number of spectators heard a reading of the declaration gave their hearty assent with three loud huzzahs and cried out may god long preserve and unite the free and independent states of america summary chapters 4 and 5 have focused on a short span of time a mere two decades and outlined the plot of a political drama.
act i of that drama the great war chapter review for empire discussed in chapter 4 prompted british political leaders to implement a program of imperial reform and taxation.
act ii discussed in this chapter is full of dramatic action as colonial mobs riot colonists chafe against restrictions on western lands patriot pamphleteers articulate ideologies of resistance and british ministers search for compromise between claims of parliamentary sovereignty and assertions of colonial autonomy.
act iii takes the form of tragedy the once proud british empire dissolves into civil war an imminent nightmare of death and destruction.
why did this happen.
