the revolutionary era 109 3 1 the french and indian war surprise attacks in the forests braddock s men moved slowly and noisily through the forests.
although warned of danger by washington and by indian scouts braddock pushed ahead.
as the british neared fort duquesne the french and their indian allies launched a surprise attack.
sharpshooters hid in the forest and picked off british soldiers whose bright red uniforms made easy targets.
braddock himself had five horses shot out from under him before he fell fatally wounded.
almost half the british were killed or wounded.
washington too was nearly killed.
british setbacks at lake ontario and lake george during the next two years the war continued to go badly for the british.
british attacks against several french forts failed.
meanwhile the french won important victories capturing fort oswego on lake ontario and fort william henry on lake george.
both forts occupied land that is now part of new york state.
all these defeats put a serious strain on the alliances with the iroquois who had been counting on the british to protect them from the french.
the iroquois faced the french and their indian allies had the advantage of familiarity with the forests of north america.
general braddocks forces were ambushed in the forests on their way to fort duquesne in 1755 increasing danger from enemy tribes who fought them for prisoners and goods.
m infntlfy supporting details why were french attacks in the forests successful.
1 quebec and new france fall in 1757 william pitt became prime minister meaning he was the new head of the british government.
pitt made it his first job to win the war in north america.
once that goal was achieved he argued the british would be free to focus on victory in other parts of the world.
so pitt sent britain s best generals to north america.
to encourage the colonists to support the war he promised large payments for military services and supplies.
under pitts leadership the tide of battle turned.
in 1758 major general jeffrey amherst captured louisbourg the most important fort in french canada.
that year the british also seized fort duquesne which they renamed fort pitt after the british leader.
the city of pittsburgh later grew up on the site of fort pitt.
the war turns in favor of the british the british enjoyed even greater success in 1759.
by summer they had pushed the french from fort niagara crown point and fort ticonderoga ty kahn duh roh guh.
next pitt sent general james wolfe to take quebec capital of new france.
climbing cliffs to attack quebec quebec was vital to the defense of new france.
without quebec the french could not supply their forts farther up the st lawrence river.
quebec was well defended though.
the city sat on the edge of the plains of abraham on top of a steep cliff high above the st lawrence.
an able french general the marquis de montcalm was prepared to fight off any british attack.
general wolfe devised a bold plan to capture quebec.
he knew that montcalm had only a few soldiers guarding the cliff because the french thought that it was too steep to climb.
late at night wolfe ordered british troops to row quietly in small boats to the foot of the cliff.
in the dark the soldiers swarmed ashore climbed up the cliff and assembled at the top.
the next morning montcalm awakened to a surprise.
a force of 4 000 british troops was drawn up and ready for battle on the plains of abraham.
quickly montcalm marched his own troops out to join in battle.
by the time the fierce fighting was over both montcalm and wolfe lay dead.

wolfe is said to have whispered now god be praised i will die in peace on september 18 1759 quebec surrendered to the british.
british make huge gains the fall of quebec sealed the fate of new france though fighting dragged on in europe for several more years.
finally in 1763 britain and france signed the treaty of paris bringing the long conflict to an end.
the treaty of paris marked the end of french power in north america.
by its terms britain gained canada and all french lands east of the mississippi river except new orleans.
france was allowed to keep only two islands in the gulf of st lawrence and its prosperous sugar growing islands in the west indies.
spain which had entered the war on the french side in 1762 gave up florida to britain.
in return spain received all french land west of the mississippi.
in addition spain gained the vital port city of new orleans.
spain retained control of its vast empire in central america and south america.
after years of fighting peace returned to north america.

summarize what the british gained in north america by defeating the french and signing the treaty of paris.
the revolutionary era the revolutionary era 113 3 1 the french and indian war by 1760 the british and their indian allies had driven france from the ohio valley.
their troubles in the region were not over however.
for many years fur traders had sent back glowing reports of the land beyond the appalachian mountains.
the dense forests of the ohio valley offered new resources that were in short supply in the east and with the french gone british colonists wanted to head west to claim the lands for themselves.
the british secure the frontier later that year pontiac led an attack on british troops at fort detroit.
a number of other indian nations joined him.
in a few short months they captured most british forts in the ohio country.
british and colonial troops then struck back and regained much of what they had lost.
pontiacs war as it came to be called did not last long.
in october 1763 the french told pontiac that they had signed the treaty of paris.
because the treaty marked the end of french power in north america the indians could no longer hope for french aid against the british.

they included the senecas delawares shawnees ottawas miamis and hurons.
as british settlers moved into the valley they often clashed with these native americans.
in 1760 the british made lord jeffrey amherst military commander and governor general of its north american colonies.
the british sent amherst to the frontier to keep order.
french traders had always treated native americans as friends holding feasts for them and giving them presents.
amherst refused to do this.
instead he raised the price of goods traded to indians.
also unlike the french amherst allowed settlers to build farms and forts on indian lands.
angry native americans found a leader in pontiac an ottawa chief who had fought on the french side during the french and indian war.
l an english trader remarked that pontiac commands more respect amongst these nations than any indian i ever saw in april 1763 pontiac spoke out against the british calling them dogs dressed in red who have come to rob us of our hunting grounds and drive away the game pontiac led violent raids against british forts.
hundreds of british were tortured and killed leading some officials to fear for the safety of colonists near native american land.
causes of the american revolution the proclamation of 1763 pontiacs violent raids against british troops convinced officials that they should prevent british subjects from settling beyond the western frontier for their own safety.
to do this the government issued the proclamation of 1763.
the proclamation drew an imaginary line along the crest of the appalachian mountains.
colonists were forbidden to settle west of the line.
all settlers already west of the line were to remove themselves at once.
the purposes of the proclamation the proclamation was meant to protect indians in the western lands.
to enforce it britain sent 10 000 troops to the colonies.
few troops went to the frontier however.
most stayed in cities along the atlantic coast.
the proclamation also created four new places where colonists could settle.
french canada became part of the province of quebec.
florida once a spanish colony was divided into east and west florida.
british territories in the caribbean became the province of granada.
colonists disagree with the proclamation the proclamation angered many colonists.
they thought it was unnecessary and unjust.
they did not think the british government had the power to restrict state settlements.
nor were they concerned with the rights of native americans.
after winning the french and recess your digital lesson.
indian war many colonists felt they had rights to the land.
also colonists now had to pay for the additional british troops that had been sent to enforce the proclamation.
in the end many settlers simply ignored the proclamation and moved west anyway.
the proclamation remained most controversial in the west where colonists clashed with native americans.
some colonies including new york pennsylvania and virginia claimed lands in the west.
the proclamation would continue to cause problems up to the american revolution from the tension it caused between the colonists and britain.
one colonist who defied the proclamation of 1763 was daniel boone.
in 1767 boone visited kentucky west of the appalachians.
in 1769 he began what became a two year journey of exploration through kentucky.
he traveled as far as the falls of the ohio the site of the present day city of louisville.
later he led settlers through the cumberland gap along an old indian path.
during his travels boone fought a number of battles against the indians and was taken captive for a short period.
check understanding what was the reasoning behind the proclamation of 1763.
in april 1763 chief pontiac of the ottawa addressed a gathering of native americans to rally them against the british.
soon after pontiac led an attack on british troops at fort detroit.
interactive chart 114 the revolutionary era 115 3 2 tensions with britain causes of the american revolution mercantilism and taxation the seven years war which included the french and indian war plunged britain deeply into debt.
as a result the taxes paid by citizens in britain rose sharply.
the british prime minister george grenville decided that colonists in north america should help share the burden.
in a mercantilist system colonies were expected to serve the colonial power.
grenville reasoned that the colonists would not oppose small tax increases.
the colonists however strongly resented these taxes.
they argued that mercantilism was unfair because it limited trade and made goods more expensive.
many colonists also objected that the power to raise these new taxes was not granted by the english constitution.
grenvilles policy led to the political and economic conflicts that would divide the colonies and england.
the sugar act taxes the colonies in 1764 grenville asked parliament to approve the sugar act which put a new tax on molasses.
the sugar act replaced an earlier tax which had been so high that any merchant who paid it would have been driven out of business.
as a british prime minister george grenville wanted colonists to help share the burden of debt that britain had incurred from the seven years war.
result most colonial merchants simply avoided the tax by smuggling molasses into the colonies.
often they bribed tax collectors to look the other way.
the sugar act of 1764 lowered the tax.
at the same time the law made it easier for british officials to bring colonial smugglers to trial.
grenville made it clear that he expected the new tax to be paid.
b identify what arguments did the colonists have against more british taxes.
causes of the american revolution the stamp act grenville also persuaded parliament to pass the stamp act of 1765.
the act placed new duties taxes on legal documents such as wills diplomas and marriage papers.
it also taxed newspapers almanacs playing cards and even dice.
all items named in the law had to carry a stamp showing that the tax had been paid.
stamp taxes were used in britain and other countries to raise money.
however britain had never required american colonists to pay such a tax.
resistance to the stamp act when british officials tried to enforce the stamp act they met with stormy protests from colonists.
lieutenant governor hutchinsons house in massachusetts was looted by a mob.
he was not the only official to feel the mobs anger.
some colonists threw rocks at agents trying to collect the unpopular tax.
in addition to riots in boston other disturbances broke out in new york city newport and charleston.
in new york city rioters destroyed the home of a british official who had said he would cram the stamps down american throats at the point of his sword.
the fury of the colonists shocked the british.
after all britain had spent a great deal of money to protect the colonies against the french.
the british at home were paying much higher taxes than the colonists.
why british officials asked were colonists so angry about the stamp act.
as one english letter writer commented our colonies must be the biggest beggars in the world if such small duties appear to be intolerable burdens in their eyes.
pacificus maryland gazette march 20 1766 3 2 tensions with britain the revolutionary era h6 lack of representation in parliament colonists replied that the stamp act taxes were unjust and unnecessary.
no taxation without representation they cried.
that principle was rooted in english traditions dating back to the magna carta.
colonists insisted that only they or their elected representatives had the right to pass taxes.
since the colonists did not elect representatives to parliament parliament had no right to tax them.
the colonists were willing to pay taxes but only if the taxes were passed by their own colonial legislatures.
they also felt that mercantilist policies like the navigation acts were unfair because they restricted their trade which negatively affected colonists income.
peaceful protests lead toward revolution the stamp act crisis united colonists from new hampshire to georgia.
critics of the law called for delegates from every colony to meet in new york city.
there a congress would form to consider actions against the hated stamp act.
in october 1765 nine colonies sent delegates to what became known as the stamp act congress.
the delegates drew up petitions to king george iii and to parliament.
a petition is a formal written request to someone in authority signed by a group of people.
in these petitions the delegates rejected the stamp act and asserted that parliament had no right to tax the colonies.
parliament paid little attention.
the colonists took other steps to change the law.
they joined together to boycott british goods.
to boycott means to refuse to buy certain goods and services.
the boycott of british goods took its toll.
trade fell off by 14 percent.
british merchants complained that they were facing ruin.
so too did british workers who made goods for the colonies.
the colonists wanted the government to have less of a say over businesses and trade.
they wanted a free enterprise system in which the market rather than the government determines what goods and services cost.
british taxes the colonists argued unfairly restricted economic growth.
finally in 1766 parliament repealed or canceled the stamp act.
at the same time however it passed a law asserting that parliament had the right to raise taxes in all cases whatsoever btrace what events led to the repeal of the stamp act in 1766.
though tarring and feathering was practiced in britain as a form of punishment tax collectors escaped this fate in the colonies.
however colonists imagined punishing tax collectors in this way as a protest of the stamp act.
rioters in boston protest against the stamp act.
infer what does the sign being carried through the street imply about the impact the stamp act might have on the colonies relationship with britain.
the revolutionary era 117 3 2 tensions with britain causes of the american revolution townshend acts in may 1767 parliament reopened the debate over taxing the colonies.
in a fierce exchange george grenville now a member of parliament clashed with charles townshend the official in charge of the british treasury.
you are cowards you are afraid of the americans you dare not tax america grenville shouted.
cowards townshend snapped back.
i dare tax america the next month parliament passed the townshend acts which taxed goods such as glass paper paint lead and tea.
the taxes were low but colonists still objected.
the principle was the same parliament did not have the right to tax them without their consent.
searches without reason cause unrest the townshend acts also set up new ways to collect taxes.
customs officials were sent to american ports with orders to stop smuggling.
using legal documents known as writs of assistance the officers would the townshend acts are named after charles townshend the british statesman who passed measures through parliament to tax colonists for goods jjch as glass paper paint and tea.
be allowed to inspect a ships cargo without giving a reason.
colonists protested that the writs of assistance violated their rights as british citizens.
under british law a government official could not search a persons property without a good reason for suspecting that the person had committed a crime.
yet the writs of assistance allowed persons and their property to be searched and even seized without reason in the colonies.
colonists angrily cited the words of james otis of massachusetts.
arguing against a british attempt to impose writs of assistance six years earlier he had said now one of the most essential branches of english liberty is the freedom of ones house.
a mans house is his castle and while he is quiet he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle.
this writ if it should be declared legal would totally destroy this privilege.
customhouse officers may enter our houses when they please.
break locks bars and everything in their way.
james otis febiuaiy 24 1761 colonists rebel against british economic policies colonists responded swiftly and strongly to the townshend acts.
from north to south colonial merchants and planters signed agreements promising to stop importing goods taxed by the townshend acts.
the colonists hoped that the new boycott would win repeal of the townshend acts.
to protest british policies some angry colonists formed the sons of liberty.
from boston to charleston sons of liberty staged mock hangings of cloth or straw effigies or likenesses dressed as british officials.
the hangings were meant to show tax collectors what might happen to them if they tried to collect the unpopular taxes.
some women joined the daughters of liberty.
they paraded signed petitions and organized a boycott of fine british cloth.
they urged colonial women to raise more sheep prepare more wool and spin and weave their own cloth.
a slogan of the daughters of liberty declared it is better to wear a homespun coat than to lose our liberty some sons and daughters of liberty also used other methods to support their cause.
they visited merchants and urged them to boycott british imports.
a few even threatened people who continued to buy british goods.
b describe how did many colonists respond to the townshend acts.
significant individuals provide colonial leadership as the struggle over taxes continued new leaders emerged in all the colonies.
men and women in new england and virginia were especially active in the colonial cause.
massachusetts citizens fight for their beliefs samuel adams of boston stood firmly against britain.
sam adams seemed an unlikely leader.
he was a failure in business and a poor public speaker.
often he wore a red suit and a cheap gray wig for which people poked fun at him.
still adams loved politics.
he always attended boston town meetings and sons of liberty rallies.
adamss real talent was organizing people.
he worked behind the scenes arranging protests and stirrrng public support.
sam s cousin john was another important massachusetts leader.
john adams had been a schoolteacher before becoming a skilled lawyer.
adams longed for fame and could often be difficult.
still he was more cautious than his cousin sam.
he weighed evidence carefully before taking any actions.
his knowledge of british law earned him much respect.
mercy otis warren also aided the colonial cause.
warren wrote plays that made fun of british officials.
the plays were published in newspapers and widely read in the colonies.
warren formed a close friendship with abigail adams the wife of john adams.
the two women used their pens to spur the colonists to action.
they also called for greater rights for women in the colonies.
virginians join the cause virginia contributed many leaders to the struggle against taxes.
in the house of burgesses george washington joined other virginians to protest the townshend acts.
a young lawyer patrick henry became well known as a vocal critic of british policies.
his speeches in the house of burgesses moved listeners to both tears and anger.
once henry attacked britain with such fury that some listeners cried out treason henry boldly replied if this be treason make the most of it.
henry s mercy otis warrens popular plays making fun of british officials motivated colonists to take action against britain.
interactive gallery words moved a young listener thomas jefferson.
at the time jefferson was a 22 year old law student.
identify how did some colonists show leadership.
the boston massacre port cities such as boston and new york were centers of protest.
in new york a dispute arose over the quartering act.
under that law colonists had to provide housing candles bedding and beverages to soldiers stationed in the colonies.
the colonists did not want to house the soldiers.
many including sam adams did not think the soldiers should be stationed in the colonies at all during peacetime.
when the new york assembly refused to obey the quartering act britain dismissed the assembly in 1767.
britain also sent two regiments to boston to protect customs officers from local citizens.
to many bostonians the soldiers were a daily reminder that britain was trying to bully them into paying unjust taxes.
when british soldiers walked along the streets of boston they risked insults or even beatings.
a serious clash was not long in coming.
i the revolutionary era 118 3 2 tensions with britain the revolutionary era 119 3 2 tensions with britain a crowd challenges british soldiers on the night of march 5 1770 a crowd gathered outside the boston customs house.
colonists shouted insults at the lobsterbacks as they called the red coated british who guarded the building.
then the boston crowd began to throw snowballs oyster shells and chunks of ice at the soldiers.
the crowd grew larger and rowdier.
suddenly the soldiers panicked.
they fired into the crowd.
when the smoke from the musket volley cleared five people lay dead or dying.
among the first to die were samuel maverick a 17 year old white youth and crispus attucks a free black sailor.
colonists were quick to protest the incident which they called the boston massacre.
a boston silversmith named paul revere fanned anti british feeling with an engraving that showed british soldiers firing on unarmed colonists.
sam adams wrote letters to other colonists to build outrage about the shooting.
the soldiers were arrested and tried in court.
john adams agreed to defend them saying that they deserved a fair trial.
he wanted to show the world that the colonists believed in justice even if the british government did not.
at the trial adams argued that the crowd had provoked the soldiers.
his arguments convinced the jury.
in the end the heaviest punishment any soldier received was a branding on the hand.
samuel adams later expanded on the idea of a letter writing campaign by forming a committee of correspondence.
members of the committee regularly wrote letters and pamphlets reporting to other colonies on events in massachusetts.
within three months there were 80 committees organized in massachusetts.
before long committees of correspondence became a major tool of protest in every colony.
the king repeals most colonial taxes by chance on the very day of the boston massacre a bill was introduced into parliament to repeal most of the townshend acts.
british merchants harmed by the american boycott of british goods had again pressured parliament to end the taxes.
the quartering act was repealed and most of the taxes that had angered the americans were ended.
however king george iii asked parliament to retain the tax on tea.
there must always be one tax to keep up the right to tax he argued.
parliament agreed.
news of the repeal delighted the colonists.
most people dismissed the remaining tax on tea as unimportant and ended their boycott of british goods.
for a few years calm returned.

parliament protected this by mandating that tea sold to the colonies had to be shipped to england first so taxes could be paid.
then the tea was shipped to colonial tea merchants for sale in the american colonies.
this system met resistance due to the taxation of tea in the american colonies.
remember to maintain its authority over the colonies parliament had kept a tax on tea when repealing the townshend acts.
the tax was a small one but colonists resented it.
as a result many colonists refused to buy british tea.
also the colonists were able to get cheaper tea directly from dutch and french traders who smuggled it to american merchants.
in the 1770s the british east india company found itself in deep financial trouble due in part to dwindling tea sales in the american colonies.
as a result more than 15 million pounds of tea sat unsold in british warehouses.
parliament tried to help the british east india company by passing the tea act of 1773.
the act let the company bypass colonial tea merchants and sell directly to colonists.
the tea act also gave the british e ast india company a rebate on tea taxes.
although colonists would still have to pay the tea tax they would not have to pay the higher price charged by colonial tea merchants.
as a result the tea itself would cost less than ever before.
parliament hoped this would encourage americans to buy more british tea.
to the surprise of parliament colonists protested the tea act.
many colonists were opposed to british mercantilist policies that were supposed to generate wealth for england by taxing the colonies.
however american tea merchants were especially angry because they had been cut out of the tea trade.
they believed that allowing the government sponsored british east india company to sell tea to americans violated their right to conduct free enterprise.
even tea drinkers who would have benefited from the law scorned the tea act.
they believed that it was a british trick to make them accept parliaments right to tax the colonies.
a boycott against tea once again colonists responded to the new law with a boycott.
a philadelphia poet hannah griffitts urged american women to stand firmly resolved and bid grenville to see that rather than freedom we part with our tea and well as we love the dear drink when a dry as american patriots our taste we deny.
hannah griffitts in milcah martha moores daughters of liberty and women like griffitts led the boycott.
they served coffee or made liberty tea from raspberry leaves.
at some ports sons of liberty enforced the boycott by keeping the british east india company from unloading cargoes of tea.
an act of civil disobedience three ships loaded with tea reached boston harbor in late november 1773.
the colonial governor of massachusetts thomas hutchinson insisted that they unload their cargo as usual.
sam adams and the sons of liberty had other plans.
on the night of december 16 they met in old south meeting house.
they sent a message to the governor demanding that the ships leave the harbor.
when the governor rejected the demand adams stood up and declared this meeting can do nothing further to save the country pearson 1 realize access your digital lesson.
adamss words seemed to be a signal.

others joined them along the way.
under a nearly full moon the men boarded the ships split open the tea chests and dumped the tea into the harbor.
by 10 p m the boston tea party as it was later called was over.
the contents of 342 chests of tea floated in boston harbor.
the next day john adams wrote about the event in his diary.
this destruction of the tea is so bold so daring so firm it must have such important and lasting results that i cant help considering it a turning point in history.

king george iii strikes back at boston colonists had mixed reactions to the boston tea party.
some cheered it as a firm protest against unfair british laws.
others worried that it would encourage lawlessness in the colonies.
even those who condemned the boston tea party though were shocked at britains harsh response to it.
the unrest in boston and the british reaction to the tea party would be yet another cause of the revolution.
the intolerable acts anger massachusetts the british were outraged by what they saw as bostons following the boston tea party british warships closed the port of boston.
parliament demanded that colonists repay the damages from the loss of tea before they would reopen the port.
lawless behavior.
in 1774 parliament encouraged by king george iii acted to punish massachusetts.
colonists called the four laws they passed the intolerable acts because they were so harsh.
these acts pushed the colonists closer to revolution.
first parliament shut down the port of boston.
no ship could enter or leave the harbor not even a small boat.

at the battle of wyoming in 1778 loyalists and native americans allied to the british killed 360 colonial settlers in the wyoming valley of pennsylvania.
the revolutionary era hampshire schoolmaster cheswell was an educated and free black man who was regularly elected to local and town positions.
like paul revere he rode all night from boston to warn his community that the british were on the march.
he later enlisted in the army to help fight at saratoga.
enslaved african americans faced more difficult choices.
if they joined the american army or continued to work on patriot plantations the british might capture and sell them.
if they tried to flee to the british army to gain freedom they risked being hanged by angry patriots.
belief in freedom yet many slaves did flee their masters especially those who lived near the coast where the british navy patrolled.
one british captain reported that near 500 runaway slaves offered their services to him.
toward the end of the war several thousand slaves sought freedom by following british troops through the carolinas.
black patriots hoped that the revolution would bring an end to slavery.
after all the declaration of independence proclaimed that all men are created equal some white leaders also hoped the war would end slavery.
james otis wrote that the colonists are by the law of nature free born as indeed all men are white or black quakers in particular spoke out strongly against slavery.
by the 1770s slavery was declining in the north where a number of free african americans lived.
during the american revolution several states moved to make slavery illegal including massachusetts new hampshire and pennsylvania.
other states also began to debate the slavery issue.
fei identify main ideas what difficult consequences did many slaves face when choosing sides in the american revolution.
native americans and the spanish choose sides as the war spread to indian lands in the west the americans and british both tried to win the support of indian tribes.
in the end the british were more successful.
they convinced many native americans that a patriot victory would mean more white settlers crossing the appalachians and taking indian lands.
loyalist allies in the south the british gained the j support of the cherokees creeks choctaws and 140.
the war in the west 0 100 km lambert azimuthal equal area projection analyze maps the text calls the attack at fort vincennes a surprise what do you see on the map that supports the conclusion that the attack surprised the british.
z key american forces british forces american victories n forts chickasaws.
the british encouraged the cherokees to attack dozens of settlements on the southern frontier.
only after hard fighting were patriot militia able to drive the cherokees back into the mountains.
fighting was equally fierce on the northern frontier.
in 1778 iroquois forces led by the mohawk leader joseph brant joined with loyalists in raiding settlements in pennsylvania and new york.
the next year patriots struck back by destroying dozens of iroquois villages.
other tribes choose to help the patriots farther west in 1778 george rogers clark led virginia frontier fighters against the british in the ohio valley.
with help from miami indians clark captured the british forts at kaskaskia and cahokia near the mississippi river.
clark then plotted a surprise attack on the british fort at vincennes.
when clarks small force reached the fort they spread out through the woods to make their numbers appear greater than they really were.
the british commander thought it was useless to fight so many americans.
he surrendered vincennes in february 1779.
spanish assistance on the southwestern frontier americans received help from new spain.
in the early years of the war spain was neutral.
however bernardo de galvez bayr nardo day goll vess governor of spanish louisiana favored the patriots.
he secretly supplied medicine cloth muskets and gunpowder to the americans.
when spain entered the war against britain in 1779 galvez took a more active role.
he seized british forts along the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico.
he also drove the british out of west florida.
the city of galveston in texas is named after this courageous leader.
recall why were the british generally more successful at becoming allies with different indian tribes.
fighting for independence in the southern colonies and at sea at sea the americans could do little against the powerful british navy.
british ships blockaded american ports which were oftentimes important supply routes for patriot troops and towns.
from time to time however a bold american captain captured a british ship.
the greatest american sea victory took place in september 1779 in britains backyard on the north 3 5 winning independence l the revolutionary era 141 3 5 winning independence ja captain john paul jones shouts orders to his crew during battle aboard his ship bonhomme bichard.
jones and his crew captured the british warship serapis.
after a hard fought battle captain john paul jones captured the powerful british warship serapis.
jones was one of many important military leaders who contributed to the american cause during the war.
raids on the high seas and along the frontiers kept many americans on the alert.
however the war between the americans and great britain would be settled by battles in the south.
battles in the south the south became the main battleground of the war in 1778.
sir henry clinton the new british commander in chief knew that many loyalists lived in the southern backcountry.
he hoped that if british troops marched through the south loyalists would join them.
at first clintons plan seemed to work.
in short order beginning in december 1778 the british seized savannah in georgia and charleston and camden in south carolina.
i have almost ceased to hope wrote washington when he learned of the defeats.
analyze political cartoons in this political cartoon titled the horse america what do the horse and rider symbolize.
this cartoon was published in 1779.
what was the cartoonist trying to convey about the revolution.
patriots and loyalists clash in the carolina backcountry patriots and loyalists launched violent raids against one another.
both sides burned farms killed civilians and sometimes even tortured prisoners.
after 1780 attacks by british troops and loyalist militia became especially cruel.
as a result more settlers began to side with the patriots.
as one loyalist admitted great britain has now a hundred enemies where it had one before momentum shifts toward the patriots after the victory at kings mountain two able american generals helped turn the tide against the main british army led by general charles cornwallis.
they were nathanael greene of rhode island and daniel morgan of virginia.
general greenes ability as a military leader was perhaps second only to washingtons.
in 1780 greene took command of the continental army in the south.
using his knowledge of local geography greene engaged the british only on ground that put them at a disadvantage.
general cornwallis wore out his soldiers trying to catch greenes army.
in january 1781 general morgan won an important victory at cowpens south carolina.
morgan used a clever tactic to defeat the british.
he divided his soldiers into a front line and a rear line.
he ordered the front line to retreat after firing just two volleys.
the british thinking the americans were retreating charged forward straight into the fire of morgans second rank.
in this way the americans won the battle of cowpens.
greene and morgan combined their armies when they fought cornwallis at guilford courthouse near present day greensboro north carolina.
the battle was one of the bloodiest of the war.
although the americans retreated the british sustained great losses.
adapting tactics to geography known as the swamp fox francis marion of south carolina added to british frustrations.
he led a small band of militia who often slept by day and traveled by night.
his soldiers used guerrilla or hit and run tactics to harass the british.
marions band took advantage of the regions environment appearing suddenly out of the swamps attacking quickly and retreating swiftly back into the swamps.
b describe what did a superior navy allow the british to do.
a decisive win brings the war to a close cornwallis abandoned his plan to take the carolinas.
in the spring of 1781 he moved his troops north into virginia.
he planned to conquer virginia and cut off the americans supply routes to the south.
benedict arnolds betrayal the british had achieved some success in virginia even before the arrival of cornwallis.
benedict arnold formerly one of the americans best generals was now leading british troops.
arnold captured and burned the capital city of richmond.
his forces also raided and burned other towns.
arnold had turned traitor to the american cause in september 1780 while commanding west point a key fort in new york.
the ambitious general was angry because he felt that he had not received enough credit for his victories.
he also needed money.
arnold secretly agreed to turn over west point to the british.
the plot was uncovered by a patriot patrol but arnold escaped to join the british arnolds treason and his raids on towns in connecticut and virginia enraged the patriots.
thomas jefferson governor of virginia offered a sizable reward for his capture.
washington ordered arnold to be hanged.
however he was never captured.
the british are trapped at yorktown cornwallis hoped to meet with the same kind of success in virginia that arnold had achieved.
at first things went well.
cornwallis sent loyalist troops to attack charlottesville where the virginia legislature was 4 1 v v s.
benedict arnolds treason left the continental army without one of its most able generals.
it also provided the british with someone familiar with the terrain and plans of the continental army.
governor thomas jefferson and other officials had to flee.
american troops under lafayette fought back by staging raids against the british.
lafayette did not have enough troops to fight a major battle.
still his strategy kept cornwallis at bay.
then cornwallis made a mistake.
he disregarded an order from sir henry clinton to send part of his army to new york.
instead he retreated to yorktown peninsula a strip of land jutting into the chesapeake bay.
he felt confident that british ships could supply his army from the sea.
washington saw an opportunity to trap cornwallis on the yorktown peninsula.
he marched his continental troops south from new york.
with the americans were french soldiers under the comte de rochambeau roh shahm boh.
the combined army rushed to join lafayette in virginia.
meanwhile a french fleet under admiral de grasse was also heading toward virginia.
once in chesapeake bay de grasses fleet closed the trap.
cornwallis was cut off.
he could not get supplies.
he could not escape by land or by sea.
the revolutionary era 143 3 5 winning independence the war is won by the end of september more than 16 000 american and french troops laid siege to cornwalliss army of fewer than 8 000.
a siege occurs when an army surrounds and blockades an enemy position in an attempt to capture it.
day after day american and french artillery pounded the british.
for several weeks cornwallis held out.
finally with casualties mounting and his supplies running low the general decided that the situation was hopeless.
the british had lost the battle of yorktown.
on october 19 1781 the british surrendered their weapons.
the french and the americans lined up in two facing columns.
as the defeated redcoats marched between the victorious troops a british army band played the tune the world turned upside down the talks began in paris in 1782.
congress sent benjamin franklin and john adams along with john jay of new york and henry laurens of south carolina to work out a treaty.
because britain was eager to end the war the americans got most of what they wanted.
under the treaty of paris the british recognized the united states as an independent nation.
it extended from the atlantic ocean to the mississippi river.
the northern border of the united states stopped at the great lakes.
the southern border stopped at florida which was returned to spain.
american soldiers hoist the 13 star flag a proud symbol of everything they fought for during the war for independence.
for their part the americans agreed to ask the state legislatures to pay loyalists for property they had lost in the war.
in the end however most states ignored loyalist claims.
on april 15 1783 congress ratified or approved the treaty of paris.
it was almost eight years to the day since the battles of lexington and concord.
b identify supporting details what were the results of the treaty of paris.
explaining the american victory geography played an important role in the american victory.
the british had to send soldiers and supplies to a war that was several thousand miles from home.
they also had to fight an enemy that was spread over a wide area.
for their part the americans were familiar with the local geography.
they chose geographic features like hilltops that would provide an advantage in battle.
assistance from allies help from other nations was crucial to the american cause.
spanish forces attacked the british along the gulf of mexico and in the mississippi valley.
french money helped pay for supplies and french military aid provided vital support to american troops.
without french soldiers and warships for example the americans might not have won the battle of yorktown.
a growing national identity and patriotism throughout their struggles with britain the colonists benefited from their ability to unify for a shared american cause.
the american revolution inspired people of many different racial and minority groups as well as social classes to fight for the same american ideals of freedom and rights.
debates about equality would continue long after independence was earned but the ideals from the revolution would further define a developing american identity.
patriotism was another important factor in the american victory.
soldiers were fighting for their homes and their beliefs.
despite early setbacks the patriots continued to fight for their cause.
gradually washingtons inexperienced troops learned how to drill how to march and how to fight the british.
perhaps most important was washington himself.
by the end of the war the generals leadership and military skills were respected by americans and british alike.
the revolutionary era 144 3 5 winning independence washington leaves the army in december 1783 general washington before resigning bid farewell to his officers at fraunces tavern in new york city.
colonel benjamin tallmadge recalled the event such a scene of sorrow and weeping i had never before witnessed.
we were then about to part from the man who had conducted us through a long and bloody war and under whose conduct the glory and independence of our country had been achieved.
benjamin tallmadge memoir all along washingtons route home to virginia crowds cheered for their hero.

however thomas jefferson and other leading virginians recognized the great need to form a central government.
they persuaded state lawmakers to give up virginias claims in the west.
the new state governments were somewhat similar to the colonial governments in structure.
the states divided power between an executive and a legislature.
the legislature was elected by the voters to pass laws.
every state but pennsylvania had a governor to execute or carry out the laws.

to vote a citizen had to be white male and over age 21.

the articles of confederation as citizens formed state governments the continental congress was drafting a plan for the nation as a whole.
delegates believed that the colonies needed to be united by a national government in order to win independence.
it was hard to write a constitution that all states would approve.
they were reluctant to give up power to a central government.
few americans saw themselves as citizens of one nation.
instead they felt loyal to their own states.
also people feared replacing the tyranny of british rule with another strong government.
after much debate the continental congress approved the first american constitution in 1777.
the articles of confederation created a very loose alliance of 13 independent states.
strengths and weaknesses under the articles of confederation the united states became a union of states with a weak central government.
in a sense the articles simply put into law the existing reality of government in the colonies a congress with delegates acting on behalf of states that retained most of the power.
the new nation was still at war its revolution not yet won.
it was not the time to discuss the political relationship between the states and congress.
the articles of confederation represented an effective compromise during a difficult time.
as apian of government the articles of confederation had strengths.
it left states free to make decisions for themselves.
it prevented the federal government from gaming too much power.
under the articles each state sent one delegate to congress.
thus each state no matter its size or population had one vote.
congress did have the power to declare war.
it could appoint military officers coin money and operate post offices.
it was also responsible for foreign affairs and could sign treaties.

however the continental dollar had little value because it was not backed by gold or silver.

an orderly expansion despite its troubles congress did pass important laws about how to govern the northwest territory.
this was the u s territory west of pennsylvania north of the ohio river south of the great lakes and east of the mississippi.
the laws established how territories would be governed and how they could become states.
the land ordinance of 1785 set up a system for settling the northwest territory.
the law called for the territory to be surveyed and divided into townships.

jbbsbseeeh each township would then be further divided into 36 sections of one square mile each 640 acres.
congress planned to sell sections to settlers for a minimum of 640 apiece.
one section in every township was set aside to support public schools.
selling the land provided income for the government which was significant because congress did not have the power to tax under the articles of confederation yet the nation was in debt.
in 1787 congress passed the northwest ordinance.
it set up a government for the northwest territory guaranteed basic rights to settlers and outlawed slavery there.
it also provided for the vast region to be divided into separate territories in the future.
the northwest ordinance established the principle that new territories should not become part of existing states but should be admitted as new states.
it provided a procedure or process to admit new states to the nation.
once a territory had a population of 60 000 free settlers it could ask congress to be admitted as a new state.
each new state would be on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever.
in time the states of ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin were created from the northwest territory.
despite the drawbacks of the articles of confederation the laws congress created relating to the northwest territory proved to be a major success.
these laws established principles defining the basic rights of settlers and served as a model for the rights citizens would expect to be protected.
trial by jury freedom of religion free use of waterways fair treatment in the courts and other rights were guaranteed.
by providing that money from each townships land sales be used for schools these laws also established federal support for education.
fed recall what was the purpose of the northwest ordinance.
economic problems lead to change the northwest ordinance was the finest achievement of the national government under the articles.
still the government was unable to solve its economic problems.
after the revolution the nation suffered an economic depression.
a depression is a period when business activity slows prices and wages fall and unemployment rises.
farmers demand fair treatment the depression hit farmers hard.
the war had created a high demand a constitution for the united states a weak confederation for farm products.
farmers borrowed money for land seed animals and tools.
however when the revolution ended demand for farm goods went down.
as prices fell many farmers could not repay their loans.
in massachusetts matters worsened when the state raised taxes.
the courts seized the farms of those who could not pay their taxes or loans.
angry farmers felt they were being treated unfairly.
daniel shays a massachusetts farmer who had fought at bunker hill and saratoga organized an uprising in 1786.
more than 1 000 farmers took part in shays rebellion.
they attacked courthouses and prevented the state from seizing farms when farmers could not pay their debts.
finally the massachusetts legislature sent the militia to drive them off.

today madison is often called the father of the constitution secret conversations when the convention began the delegates decided to keep their talks secret.
they wanted to speak their minds freely and be able to explore issues without pressures from outside.

disagreements over a new government soon after the meeting began the delegates realized they would have to do more than simply revise the articles of confederation.
they chose instead to write an entirely new constitution for the nation.
they disagreed however about what form the new national government should take.
virginia proposes a plan edmund randolph and james madison both from virginia proposed a plan for the new government.
this virginia plan called for a strong national government with three branches.
the legislative branch would pass the laws.
the executive branch would carry out the laws.
the judicial branch or system of courts would decide whether laws or the constitution were violated.
according to the virginia plan the legislature would consist of two houses.
seats would be awarded on the basis of population.
thus in both houses larger states would have more representatives than smaller ones.
under the articles of confederation each state regardless of population only had one vote in congress.
new jersey disagrees small states opposed the virginia plan.
they feared that the large states could easily outvote them in congress.
supporters of the virginia plan replied that it was only fair for a state with more people to have more representatives.
after two weeks of debate william paterson of new jersey presented a plan that had the support of the small states.

each state no matter what its size would have two senators.
this part of shermans compromise appealed to the smaller states.
on july 16 the delegates narrowly approved sherman s plan.
it became known as the great compromise.
each side in an admirable show of civic virtue gave up some demands to achieve unity.
with a margin of just one vote the delegates had found a peaceful resolution to a problem that had threatened to bring the convention to a halt.
identify supporting details how did the great compromise address the concerns of small and large states.
the three fifths compromise just as there were disagreements between large states and small states there were also disagreements between northern states and southern states.
the most serious disagreements concerned the issue of slavery.
would enslaved people be counted as part of a states population.
would the slave trade continue to bring enslaved africans into the united states.
the states reach an agreement southerners wanted to include enslaved african americans in the population count even though they would not let those people vote.
if enslaved african americans were counted southern states would have more representatives in the house of representatives.
northerners objected.
they argued that since enslaved african americans could not vote they should not be counted when assigning representatives.
once again the delegates compromised.
they agreed that three fifths of the enslaved people in any state would be counted.
in other words if a state had 5 000 enslaved residents 3 000 of them would be included in the states population count.
this agreement became known as the three fifths compromise.
the fraction in the three fifths compromise had come from a rule in the articles of confederation.
that a constitution for the united states 165 4 2 drafting a constitution rule tied taxes to population and counted only three fifths of enslaved residents when a state was being taxed.
the new compromise balanced the concerns of northerners and southerners by using the three fifths rule which had already been agreed upon as an acceptable way to assign both representatives and taxes to each state.
further disagreement over slavery there was another disagreement over slavery.
by 1787 some northern states had banned the slave trade within their borders.
delegates from these states urged that the slave trade be banned in the entire nation.
southerners argued that such a ban would ruin their economy.
in the end northern and southern states compromised once more.
northerners agreed that congress could not outlaw the slave trade for at least 20 years.
after that congress could regulate the slave trade if it wished.
northerners also agreed that no state could stop a person fleeing slavery from being returned to an owner.
b identify central ideas why did many of the northern states object to including enslaved people in population counts.
despite the fact some delegates from northern states urged that slavery be banned throughout the nation the constitutional convention did not succeed in ending the slave trade.
the convention comes to a conclusion as the long hot summer drew to a close the weary delegates struggled with one difficult question after another.
how many years should the president head of the executive branch serve.
how should the system of federal courts be organized.
would members of congress be paid.
finally on september 17 1787 the constitution was ready to be signed.

the delegates to the constitutional convention followed this advice.
they wanted to create a republic a government in which citizens rule themselves through elected representatives.
few republics in the history of the world survived very long.
in order to create one that would last american leaders looked first to the ancient examples of greece and especially rome.
168 the virtues of a republic americans greatly admired the roman republic.
general charles lee one of george washingtons commanders commented i used to regret not being thrown into the world in the glorious era of the romans independence and public service were virtues that the founding fathers saw in the citizens of rome.
roman citizens were willing to serve in public office not for money but because they were devoted to their republic.
the founders wrote the constitution with these same civic virtues in mind and hoped americans would live by the same principles.
many american colonists admired rome so much that when they debated politics in the newspapers they often signed their opinions with roman names such as cincinnatus or cicero.
a belief in independent citizens at the same time the founding fathers saw the collapse of romes republic as a warning to the united states.
no republic could survive unless its citizens remained independent and devoted to public service without the desire for personal or financial gains.
under the ruler caesar augustus rome eventually became a dictatorship a government in which one person or a small group holds complete authority.
the leaders of the american revolution believed that romans stumbled once they allowed corruption to take over.
historians today admit that the founding fathers somewhat exaggerated the virtues of romes republic.
yet the lessons they learned still have force.
republics do not always die because they are invaded from outside.
without educated and dedicated citizens who put the nations needs above their own republics can decay from within due to corruption.

the magna carta king john of england signed the magna carta in 1215.
the magna carta contained two basic ideas that helped to shape both british and american government.
first it made it clear that english monarchs themselves had to obey the law.
king john agreed not to raise taxes without first consulting the great council of nobles and church the founders including thomas jefferson shown here looked to the roman republic for inspiration as they drafted the constitution.

eventually the great council grew into the british parliament.
just as important the magna carta stated that english nobles had certain rights rights that were later extended to other classes of people as well.
these included rights to trial by jury and the right to private property.
the idea of private property rights strongly influenced the beliefs of early americans which partly explains the development of a free enterprise system throughout the nation.
the english bill of rights in 1689 the english bill of rights went further in protecting the rights of citizens.
the document said that parliamentary elections should be held regularly.
it upheld the right to a trial by jury and allowed citizens to bear arms.

america draws on its own traditions americans enjoyed a long tradition of representative government.
the virginia colonists set up the house of burgesses.
eventually each colony elected its own legislature.
self government americans were also used to relying on written documents that clearly identified the powers and limits of government.
the mayflower compact written in 1620 was the first document of self government in north america.
each of the 13 colonies had a written charter granted by the monarch or by parliament.
answerable to the people the framers of the constitution also drew on their own experiences.
the founding fathers bitterly remembered their grievances against the english king.
in writing the constitution they sought to prevent such abuses.
for example the declaration of independence accused the king of placing military power above civilian authority.
the constitution made the elected president commander in chief of the army and navy.
and of the militia of the several states the declaration protested that the king had made judges dependent on his will alone the constitution set up a court system independent of the president and legislature.
the framers were very familiar with the workings of the second continental congress the articles of confederation and their own state governments.
much that went into the constitution came either from the articles or from the state constitutions.
the influence of the enlightenment the constitution was also based on the ideas of the european enlightenment.
enlightenment thinkers believed that people could improve society through the use of reason.
many of the constitution s framers had read the works of enlightenment thinkers.
john locke the english writer john locke published wo treatises of government in 1690.
in it he stated two important ideas.
first locke declared that all people had natural rights to life liberty and property.
second he suggested that government is an agreement between the ruler and the ruled.
the ruler a constitution for the united states 170 4 3 ideas that influenced the constitution must enforce the laws and protect the people.
if a ruler violates the peoples natural rights the people have a right to rebel.
lockes ideas were popular among americans.
the framers of the constitution wanted to protect peoples natural rights and limit the power of government.
they saw the constitution as a contract between the people and their government.
lockes principle of a natural right to property was established in the constitution.
certain guarantees in the constitution protect the rights of people to own private property enforce contracts and engage freely in business activities.
these freedoms are essential to free enterprise.
article i of the constitution also gave congress the power to regulate commerce and encourage the free flow of goods between states creating an environment in which business could thrive.
baron de montesquieu the french enlightenment thinker baron de montesquieu mahn tus kyoo influenced american ideas of how a government should be constructed.
in his 1748 book the spirit of the laws montesquieu stressed the importance of the rule of law.
the powers of government he said should be clearly defined and divided up.
he suggested that three separate branches be created the legislative executive and judicial.
this idea known as the separation of powers was designed to keep any person or group from gaining too much power.
a new tradition emerges from others the founding fathers drew on many traditions.
in the end though the new system of government was not quite like anything that came before it.

besides they said the constitution protected citizens well enough as it was.
antifederalists responded that a bill of rights was needed to protect such basic liberties as freedom of speech and religion.
unless these rights were spelled out they could be too easily ignored or denied by the government.
americans after all had just fought a revolution to protect their freedoms against a too powerful government.
violations of those freedoms were the main grievances cited in the declaration of independence.
antifederalists argued that a bill of rights was needed to address those grievances.
under the new constitution the president would have veto power over congress the peoples representatives.
surely placing so much power in one mans hands the antifederalists argued likewise demanded the protection of a bill of rights.
one of the strongest supporters of a bill of rights was george mason of virginia.
in 1776 mason had written the bill of rights for virginias constitution.
after the constitutional convention refused to include a bill of rights mason joined the antifederalists.
mason wrote a pamphlet opposing the ratification of the constitution.
the pamphlet was titled simply objections to this federalists antifederalists and the bill of rights the federalists and the antifederalists the framers had set up a process for the states to approve or ratify j the new government.
the constitution would go into effect when at least 9 of the 13 states had ratified it.
in 1787 and 1788 voters in each state elected delegates to special state conventions.
these delegates would decide whether or not to ratify the constitution.
for ratification the arguments of the federalists in every state heated debates took place.
supporters of the constitution called themselves federalists because they favored a strong federal or national government.
they called people who opposed the constitution antifederalists.
federalists argued that the articles of confederation left too much power with the individual states.
this imbalance produced a dangerously weak central government.
disputes among the states federalists said made it too difficult for the government to function.
federalists believed that the constitution gave the national government the authority it needed to function effectively.
at the same time they said the constitution still protected the rights and powers of the individual states.
federalists james madison alexander hamilton and john jay wrote a series of essays known today as the federalist papers.
their purpose was to explain and defend the constitution.
they used pen names but most people knew who they were.
today the federalist fapersremain among the best discussions of the political theory behind the american system of government.
courts still refer to the federalist papers in making decisions about the principles and role of government.
in this way they have had a lasting influence on the u s system of government.
against ratification the arguments of the antifederalists antifederalists felt that the constitution made the national government too strong and left the states too weak.
they also thought that the constitution gave the president too much power.

delaware led the way ratifying on december 7 1787.

the debate in new england massachusetts was the first key battleground.
there the old patriots sam adams and john hancock held back their support.

as expected george washington was elected president while john adams was chosen as vice president.
the first congress met in new york city which was chosen as the nation s first capital.
congress quickly turned its attention to adding a bill of rights to the constitution.
several states had agreed to ratify the constitution only on the condition that a bill of rights be added.
amending the constitution the framers had establisheda way to amend or change the constitution to modify the rules for the national government.
they did not want people to make changes lightly however.
thus they made the process of amending the constitution fairly difficult.
in 1789 the first congress proposed a set of 12 amendments written by james madison.
as required by the constitution the amendments then went for ratification by the states three fourths of which had to ratify an amendment for it to take effect.
by december 1791 three fourths of the states had ratified 10 of the 12 amendments.
these 10 amendments became known as the bill of rights.
the bill of rights james madison insisted that the bill of rights does not give americans any rights.
the rights listed he said are natural rights that belong to all human beings.
the bill of rights simply prevents the government from taking these rights away.
some of the first 10 amendments were intended to prevent the kind of abuse americans had suffered under english rule.
for example the declaration of independence had condemned the king for forcing colonists to quarter troops in their homes and for suspending trial by jury.
the third amendment forbids the government to quarter troops in citizens homes without their consent.
the sixth and seventh amendments guarantee the right to trial by jury.
other amendments protected individual rights as uiany states had already done.
in 1786 the virginia george washington was inaugurated as the first president of the united states on april 30 1789.
statute of religious freedom stated that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship or otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief religious freedom became the very first right listed in the first amendment.
the first amendment also emphasized a key element of the republic freedom of speech or the ability to express different points of view.
at first individual state governments were not considered subject to the bill of rights.
it was only after the ratification of the fourteenth amendment in 1868 and subsequent supreme court decisions that the bill of rights was applied to the states.
still with the bill of rights in place the new framework of government was complete.
over time the constitution would grow and change along with the nation.

it is no surprise that the framers made.

elps seven basic principles the constitution reflects seven basic principles.
they are popular sovereignty limited government separation of powers checks and balances federalism republicanism and individual rights.
popular sovereignty the framers of the constitution lived at a time when monarchs claimed that their power came from god.
the preamble with its phrase we the people reflects a revolutionary new idea that a government gets its authority from the people.
this principle known as popular sovereignty states that the people have the right to alter or abolish their government.
limited government the colonists had lived under a british government with nearly unlimited powers.
to avoid giving too much power to their new government the framers made limited government a principle of the constitution.
in a limited government the government has only the powers that the constitution gives it.
just as important everyone from you to the president must obey the law.
separation of powers to further limit government power the framers provided for separation of powers.
the constitution separates the government into three branches.
congress or the legislative branch makes the laws.
the executive branch headed by the president carries out the laws.
the judicial branch composed of the courts judges whether actions violate laws and whether laws violate the constitution.
checks and balances a system of checks and balances safeguards against abuse of power.
each branch of government has the power to check or limit the actions of the other two.
the separation of powers allows for this system of checks and balances.

among the powers the constitution gives the federal government are the power to coin money declare war and regulate trade between the states.
states regulate trade within their own borders make rules for state elections and establish schools.
some powers are shared between the federal government and the states.
powers not clearly given to the federal government belong to the states.
republicanism the constitution provides for a republican form of government.

the legislative branch congress the first and longest article of the constitution deals with the legislative or lawmaking branch.
article i sets up the congress to make the nations laws.
congress is made up of two bodies the house of representatives and the senate.
the house of representatives the larger of the two bodies is the house of representatives which currently has 435 members.
representation in the house is based on population with larger states having more representatives than smaller states.
every state has at least one representative.
representatives are elected by the people of their district for two year terms.
as a result the entire house is up for election every other year.
representatives may run for reelection as many times as they want.
the constitution the leader of the house is called the speaker.
the speaker of the house is one of the most powerful people in the federal government.
the speaker regulates debates and controls the agenda.
if the president dies or leaves office the speaker of the house is next in line after the vice president to become president.
the senate unlike the house the senate is based on equal representation of the states with two senators for each state.
senators are elected to six year terms.
their terms overlap however so that one third of the members come up for election every two years.
this way there is always a majority of experienced senators.
not all of the founders trusted the judgment of the common people.
as a result they called for senators to be chosen by state legislatures.
over the years the nation slowly became more democratic.
the seventeenth amendment ratified in 1913 provided that senators be directly elected by the people of each state like members of the house.
the vice president of the united states is president of the senate.
the vice president presides over the senate and casts a vote when there is a tie.
the vice president cannot however take part in senate debates.
when the vice president is absent the senates president pro tempore or temporary president presides.
powers of congress the most important power of congress is the power to make the nations laws.
all laws start as proposals called bills.
a new bill may be introduced in either the house or the senate.
however an appropriations bill which is a bill that sets aside money for government programs or operations must be introduced in the house.
after a bill is introduced it is debated.
if both houses vote to approve the bill it is then sent to the president.
if the president signs the bill it becomes a law.
the constitution gives congress many other powers besides lawmaking.
article i section 8 lists most of the powers of congress.
they include the power to levy or require people to pay taxes and to borrow money.
congress also has the power to coin money to establish post offices to fix standard weights and measures and to declare war.
the elastic clause not all the powers of congress are specifically listed.
article i section 8 clause 18 states that congress can make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying out its specific duties.
this clause is known as the elastic clause because it enables congress to stretch its powers to deal with the changing needs of the nation.
united states senators sit for a formal portrait in the senate chamber of the capitol.
americans have long debated the true meaning of the elastic clause.
what did the framers mean by the words necessaryand proper for example early leaders debated whether the elastic clause gave congress the right to set up a national bank even though the constitution does not specifically give congress that power.
today political parties still have different points of view on how the elastic clause should be used.
some americans continue to worry that congress might use the elastic clause to abuse its powers.
sometimes the terms strict constructionists and loose constructionists are used to refer to people with different views of the clause.
strict constructionists think that congress and the courts that interpret laws should strictly construe or narrowly interpret the elastic clause.
they believe the elastic clause should be used to stretch the powers of government rarely and only to a small degree.
partly because many members of the republican party today are strict constructionists that party particularly believes in reducing or eliminating some government programs.
in contrast loose constructionists think that congress and the courts that interpret laws should loosely construe or broadly interpret the elastic clause.
they think the elastic clause should be used to stretch a constitution for the united states 181 4 5 understanding the constitution the powers of government as often as needed and to a greater degree.
many members of the democratic party today are loose constructionists.
because they believe that the role of the federal government can and should expand as needed they may support government programs opposed by members of the republican party.
the committee system the first congress meeting from 1789 to 1791 considered a total of 31 new bills.
today more than 10 000 bills are introduced in congress each year.
clearly it would be impossible for every member of congress to give each new bill careful study.
to deal with this problem congress relies on committees.
both the house and the senate have permanent or standing committees.
each committee deals with a specific topic such as agriculture banking business defense education science or transportation.
members who have served in congress the longest are usually appointed to the most important committees.
congress may sometimes create joint committees made up of both senate and house members.
one of the most important kinds of joint committees is the one presidential duty is to honor american soldiers.
here president barack obama awards a medal of honor to a member of the u s armed forces in the white house.
conference committee.
its task is to settle differences between house and senate versions of the same bill.
q identify supporting details how does a bill become a law.
the executive branch the president article ii of the constitution sets up an executive branch to carry out the laws and run the affairs of the national government.
the president is the head of the executive branch.
other members include the vice president and the executive departments.
the heads of the executive departments who advise the president are called the cabinet.
the many roles of the president you are probably more familiar with the president than with any other government leader.
you see him on television climbing in and out of airplanes greeting foreign leaders or making speeches.
yet many americans do not know exactly what the president does.
the framers thought that congress would be the most important branch of government.
thus while the constitution is very specific about the role of the legislature it offers fewer details about the powers of the president.
beginning with george washington presidents have often taken those actions they thought necessary to carry out the job.
in this way they have shaped the job of president to meet the nations changing needs.
s the president is our highest elected official and along with the vice president the only one who represents all americans.
as head of the executive branch the president has the duty to carry out the nations laws.
the president directs foreign policy and has the power to make treaties with other nations and to appoint ambassadors.
the president is commander in chief of the armed forces.
only congress however has the power to declare war.
as the nations chief legislator the president suggests new laws and works for their passage.
the president can grant pardons and call special sessions of congress.
the president is also the living symbol of the nation.
presidents welcome foreign leaders make speeches to commemorate national holidays and give medals to national heroes.

the framers set up a complex system for electing the president known as the electoral college.
when americans vote for president they do not vote directly for the candidate of their choice.
rather they vote for a group of electors who are pledged to the candidate.
the number of a states electors equals the number of its senators and representatives.
no state has fewer than three electors.
a few weeks after election day the electors meet in each state to cast their votes for president.
in most states the candidate with the majority of the popular vote in that state receives all that state s electoral votes.
the candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes nationwide becomes president.
because of the winner take ah nature of the electoral college a candidate can lose the popular vote nationwide but still be elected president.
this has happened four times.
today some people favor replacing the electoral college with a system that directly elects the president by popular vote.
others oppose any change pointing out that the electoral college has served the nation well for more than 200 years.
recall how many terms is the president allowed to serve.
the judicial branch the supreme court article iii of the constitution establishes a supreme court and authorizes congress to establish any other courts that are needed.
under the judiciary act of 1789 congress set up the system of federal courts that is still in place today.
lower courts most federal cases begin in district courts.
evidence is presented during trials and a jury or a judge decides the facts of the case.
a party that disagrees with the decision of the judge or jury may appeal it that is ask that the decision be reviewed by a higher court.
the next level of courts is the appellate courts or courts of appeal.
appellate court judges review decisions of district courts to decide whether the lower court judges interpreted and applied the law correctly.
a constitution for the united states 183 4 5 understanding the constitution supreme court at the top of the american judicial system is the supreme court.
the court is made up of a chief justice and eight associate justices.
the president appoints the justices but congress must approve the appointments.
justices serve for life.
the main job of the supreme court is to serve as the nation s final court of appeals.
it hears cases that have been tried and appealed in lower courts.
because its decisions are final the supreme court is called the court of last resort the supreme court hears and decides fewer than 100 cases each year.
most of the cases are appeals from lower courts that involve federal laws.
after hearing oral arguments the justices vote.
decisions require a majority vote of at least five justices.
early on the court asserted the right to declare whether acts of the president or laws passed by congress are unconstitutional that is not allowed under the constitution.
this power is called judicial review.
the need for judicial review was first discussed in the federalist papers and the supreme court has argued that the power is implicit in the constitution but it was not established until the 1803 case marbury v madison which gave the supreme court the power of judicial review.
although powerful the supreme court is limited by the system of checks and balances.
one check on its power is that congress can in certain circumstances remove supreme court justices from office.
also the supreme court does not have the power to pass or enforce laws it can only provide judicial review of laws.
h check understanding what was the significant about the supreme court decision in the case marbury v madison 1803.
preventing abuse of power the framers hoped that the separation of powers among three branches would prevent the rise of an all powerful leader who would rob the people of their liberty.
but how could the framers prevent one of the branches from abusing its power.
to answer this problem they set up a system of checks and balances.
the system of checks and balances allows each of the three branches of government to check or limit the power of the other two.
the president for example can check the actions of congress by vetoing or rejecting bills that congress has passed.
congress can check the president by overriding or overruling the veto with a two thirds vote in both houses.
congress must also approve presidential appointments and ratify treaties made by the president.
the supreme court can check both the president and congress by declaring laws unconstitutional through its power of judicial review.
congress s most extreme check on the president is its power to remove the president from office.
to do this the house of representatives must impeach or bring reviews more than 7 000 petitions a year and selects 100 150 cases based on national importance of the case need to eliminate conflicting court opinions related to a case opportunity to set a precedent agreement among 4 of 9 justices to accept a case disputes between states or between a state and citizens of another state actions involving ambassadors or vice consuls of foreign nations actions between the u s and a state state supreme court appeals of appellate court cases appellate court appeals of trial court cases trial court civil and criminal cases juries render verdicts judges enforce procedures court of appeals appeals of cases originating in u s district courts reviews decisions by federal agencies district court civil and criminal cases juries render verdicts judges ensure fair trial a case can reach the supreme court through several paths.
draw conclusions why do you think so few cases reach the supreme court.
a constitution for the united states 184 4 5 understanding the constitution charges of serious wrongdoing against the president.
the senate then conducts a trial.
if two thirds of the senators vote to convict the president must leave office.
throughout our history only two presidents andrew johnson and bill clinton have been impeached by the house.
neither was convicted by the senate.
the principle of checks and balances is based on the principle of separation of powers.
because the powers of government are separated into three branches each branch can check the power of the other two.
like many principles in the constitution separation of powers and the system of checks and balances came from european philosophers of the enlightenment.
one of these philosophers was baron de montesquieu who wrote the spirit of laws.
montesquieu argued that the powers of government should be split among three equal branches legislative executive and judicial.
this would prevent any branch of government from becoming too powerful and protect individuals rights.
we can see many of montesquieus ideas reflected in the constitution today.
b identify supporting details what checks does congress have over the president.
the members of both houses of the texas state legislature as well as the governor carry out their duties at the state capitol building in austin.
state government one principle of the constitution is federalism or the division of powers between the federal and state governments.
the federal government deals with national issues.
the states have the power to meet more local needs.
there are also some powers that are shared.
but state governments provide many basic services that americans use each day.
the question of states rights many americans originally opposed the constitution because they thought it gave too much power to the federal government at the expense of the state governments.
the tenth amendment was written to help ensure that the states keep powers not granted the federal government the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.
tenth amendment to the constitution some americans point to the tenth amendment as support for what is often called states rights or the idea that the federal government should not infringe if a constitution for the united states 1 on states powers.
a similar idea is that of state sovereignty or the idea that within a state the state government is supreme.
the federal government has used the elastic clause to assume powers that some believe belong to the states.
thus the debate over how power should be shared between the federal and state governments has been a matter of controversy through most of american history.
state constitutions each of the 50 states has a constitution that sets forth the principles and framework of its government.
although constitutions vary from state to state they must all conform to the constitution of the united states.
if a conflict arises the national constitution the supreme law of the land prevails.
most state constitutions resemble the national constitution in form.
they start with a preamble stating their goals and include a bill of rights guaranteeing individual liberties.
state constitutions tend to be longer and more detailed than the national constitution.
many include provisions on finance education and other matters.
state constitutions set up a government with three branches.
the powers of the legislative executive and judicial branches on the state level are similar to those of the national government.
i 4 5 understanding the constitution the california state government established the golden gate state park in the 1870s and ordered the construction of the golden gate bridge which opened to the public in 1937.
locally supported public education is important not only to the states but also to the nation.
institution for the united states changing state constitutions state constitutions can be changed in several ways.
in the most common method amendments are proposed by the state legislature and approved by the people in an election.
in almost one half of the states citizens can act directly to change the constitution.
in a process known as the constitutional initiative sponsors of an amendment gather signatures on a petition.
when the required number of signatures is attained the petition goes to the legislature or to the voters for approval.
finally a state can rewrite its constitution.
with the approval of the legislature or the people the state may call a constitutional convention.
the new constitution is then submitted to the people for official approval.
the states obligations to citizens state governments provide a wide range of services.
they maintain law and order enforce criminal law protect property and regulate business.
they also supervise public education provide public health and welfare programs build and maintain highways operate state parks and forests and regulate use of state owned land.
the states not the federal government have the main responsibility for public education in the united states.
most students attend schools paid for and overseen by the state.
the state sets general standards for schools and establishes a recommended course of study.
it also sets requirements for promotion and graduation.
each state must build and maintain its own infrastructure or system of transit lines roads bridges and tunnels.
state departments or agencies manage more than 6 000 state parks and recreation areas.
to help maintain high standards state governments license the professionals who serve you such as doctors lawyers and teachers.
when you are old enough to drive the state will test you and if you pass give you a license.
state police keep highways safe and protect us against criminal acts.
m identify what are some examples of services that states provide to their citizens.
the responsibilities of local government the constitution defines the powers of the federal and state governments.
but it does not mention local government that is government on the county parish city town village or district level.
local governments are created entirely by the states and 186 4 5 understanding the constitution have only those powers and functions that states give them.
local governments have perhaps the greatest impact on our daily lives.
at the same time it is on the local level that citizens have the greatest opportunity to influence government.
public education the service that local governments spend the most money on is education.
while state governments set standards for schools it is the cities towns or school districts that actually run them.
local school boards build schools and hire teachers and staff.
they also have a strong say in which courses will be taught.
however school officials must make all decisions within the guidelines set by state law.
education is one area of local government where citizens exert a great deal of control.
local residents may give up part of their time to serve on local school boards.
in most communities voters have the right to approve or turn down the annual school budget.
many other services local governments provide a variety of other services.
they hire or support firefighters police and garbage collectors.
local governments provide sewers and water maintain local roads and hospitals and conduct safety inspections of buildings and restaurants.
in many cases water and sewage treatment plants are owned and run by local governments.
other communities hire private companies to supply local needs.
over the years americans have looked to local government for more than basic services.
today most local governments provide libraries and parks and other cultural and recreational facilities.
in larger cities citizens expect their local governments to support airports sports arenas and civic centers.
public funding for such facilities is often the subject of debate in major cities.

key terms citizen naturalize immigrant resident alien civic virtue patriotism jury duty access your digital lesson.
citizens rights and responsibilities american citizenship to be a citizen of the united states you must have fulfilled one of three requirements you were born in the united states or at least one parent is a citizen of the united states.
you were naturalized that is you have completed the official legal process for becoming a citizen if you were born outside the united states.
you were 18 or younger when your parents were naturalized.
becoming a citizen throughout american history many millions of immigrants have become naturalized citizens.
an immigrant is a person who enters another country in order to settle there.
to illustrate the naturalization process we will look at one immigrants story.
at age 15 carla rojas came to the united states from argentina.
her mother returned home two years later but rojas decided to remain.
after submitting numerous documents and photographs and attending several interviews she received permission to remain in the country as a resident alien or noncitizen living in the country.
192 after a required five year waiting period carla submitted an application for citizenship.
she had to take a test to show that she was comfortable with the english language and that she was familiar with american history and government.
she also had to show that she was of good moral character then a naturalization examiner interviewed her about her reasons for becoming a citizen.
at last rojas stood before a judge and took the oath that confirmed her as an american citizen i hereby declare on oath that.
i will support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states against all enemies.
that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same so help me god.
oath of allegiance to the united states a naturalized citizen enjoys every right of a natural born citizen except one.
only natural born citizens may serve as president or vice president.
the rights and responsibilities of citizens all american citizens have equal rights under the law.
americans have the right to speak freely to worship as they choose to vote and to serve on juries.
these rights are not based on inherited wealth or family connections.
they are the rights of american citizens.
still nothing is free.
as you will see if we want to enjoy the rights of citizenship we must also accept its responsibilities.
these rights and responsibilities reflect americas national identity the common set of values that unites americans.
for example citizens have both the right and the responsibility to vote.
this reflects the principles of independence liberty and self governance upheld in the constitution and valued by the american people.
0 define what is a citizen.
the importance of civic virtue the founding fathers admired civic virtue that is the willingness to work for the good of the nation or community even at great sacrifice.
they looked to toman models such as cincinnatus who it was said gave up a peaceful life on his farm when called upon to load rome.
again and again leaders such as george l washington thomas jefferson and john adams put the common good ahead of their own wishes.
these three presidents maintained that democracy requires virtuous behavior by citizens.
citizens must put the greater good ahead of their own desires when they follow the law serve on juries and make informed decisions about voting.
the leaders feared that without this responsible behavior american liberty would be at risk.
how can a democracy run if individuals do not think about what is best for society and not just for themselves.
you do not have to go to great lengths to be a good citizen.
at home at school and in the community you can work to develop the values that are the foundation of our democratic system.
among these basic values are honesty and compassion.
others include patriotism respect responsibility and courage.
a key democratic value is patriotism or a feeling of love and devotion toward ones country.
a sense of patriotism inspires americans to serve their nation.
it also encourages us to fulfill the ideals set forth in the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights.
as citizens we must respect ourselves our families our neighbors and the other members of our community.
respect may also involve objects or ideas.
participating in community projects such as this clean up activity strengthens the ties between community members and helps to ensure that public spaces remain usable.
interactive chart a constitution for the united states 193 4 7 citizens rights and responsibilities for example a good citizen respects the property of others and the laws of the nation.
responsibility may be both personal and public.
we must accept responsibility for ourselves and the consequences of our actions and behaviors.
in a democracy individuals are expected to look out for themselves and for one another.
for example parents have a duty to support their families and teach their children.
this is important because children depend on parents and families depend on one another.
as a student you have a responsibility to learn.
courage may be either physical or moral.
soldiers police or firefighters display physical courage when they risk their lives for the good of others.
moral courage enables us to do the right thing even when it is unpopular difficult or dangerous.
americans such as george washington abraham lincoln susan b anthony and martin luther king jr faced risks in order to defend democratic values.

responsible citizens vote as citizens of a republic we have the right to select the people who will represent us in government.
but if that right is to have any meaning then we must fulfill our responsibility to vote.
a good citizen studies the candidates and the issues in order to make responsible choices.
responsible citizens obey laws and rules in the constitution we the people give the government the power to make laws for us.
thus we have a duty to obey the nations laws.
we have thousands of laws that keep us from hurting one another regulate contracts and protect citizens rights.
no one can know them all but you must know and obey the laws that affect your life and actions.
you also have a responsibility to obey rules.
you already have rules at home and rules at school even rules to games you play.
these rules are not enforced by the government as laws are.
like laws however they keep us safe help us live together and teach us to be accountable for our behavior.
by learning to obey rules such as not to hit or cheat when we are young we learn about responsible citizenship.

responsible citizens participate in their communities many americans use their time and skills to improve their communities or to help others.
as you read david levitt was in middle school when he started a program to help the needy in his florida community.
many young people participate in walk a thons or bike a thons for charity.
others volunteer in hospitals or fire departments.
when serious natural disasters damage cities and regions millions of citizens aid in rescue efforts donate blood or contribute money and supplies.
responsible citizens stay informed on public issues thomas jefferson observed if a nation expects to be ignorant and free it expects what never was and never will be you cannot protect your rights as a citizen unless you know what they are.
