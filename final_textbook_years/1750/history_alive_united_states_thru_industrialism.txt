chapter 7 the american revolution how was the continental army able to win the war for independence from great britain.
7 1 introduction when the american war for independence from great britain began in 1775 15 year old joseph martin was too young to join the continental army.
but when recruiters returned to his connecticut village a year later he was ready to go.
the recruiters were looking for volunteers to go to new york where the british were rumored to have 15 000 troops.
i did not care if there had been fifteen times fifteen thousand martin said later.
i never spent a thought about numbers.
the americans were invincible in my opinion just two days after the declaration of independence was signed martin traded his plow for a musket an early type of rifle.
a week later he arrived in new york city where he hoped to snuff sniff a little gunpowder as he recalled i was now what i had long wished to be a soldier i had obtained my hearts desire it was now my business to prove myself equal to my profession if martin had known what lay ahead he might not have been so pleased about his new profession.
the army in new york was ill trained ill equipped and just plain ill almost the whole regiment are sick reported a massachusetts officer of his unit.
the british army in contrast was well trained well equipped and well supported by the british navy.
rather than the 15 000 troops martin had heard of the british had assembled a force of 25 000 men in new york.
more than 400 british ships floated in the harbor.
this was the biggest army and the largest fleet the british had ever sent overseas.
in the face of such overwhelming force the americans should have been easily defeated.
but they were not.
in this chapter you will read how soldiers like joseph martin stood up to mighty great britain in a successful revolution that created a new nation.
this painting shows british troops in battle during the american revolution.
compare this painting to the one on the opposite page.
what differences do you see between the soldiers in these two armies.
this painting shows american soldiers at the battle of brandywine in 1777 during the war for independence from great britain.
the american revolution 119 7 2.
american strengths and weaknesses the patriots were in a weak position when the american revolution began.
they had a hastily organized untrained army and a small navy.
their weaknesses were far more obvious than their strengths.
american weaknesses the continental army was always short of men.
general george washington never had more than 20 000 troops at one time and place.
many soldiers enlisted for six months or a year.
just when they were learning how to fight they would pick up their muskets and go home to take care of their farms and families.
few americans were trained for battle.
some were hunters and could shoot well enough from behind a tree.
but when facing a mass of well disciplined redcoats they were likely to turn and run.
the army was plagued by shortages.
guns and gunpowder were so scarce that benjamin franklin suggested arming the troops with bows and arrows.
food shortages forced soldiers to beg for handouts.
uniforms were scarce as well.
in winter one could track shoeless soldiers by their bloody footprints in the snow.
such shortages outraged washington.
but when he complained to the second continental congress nothing changed.
congress the new nations only government lacked the power to raise money for supplies by taxing the colonies now the new nations states.
in desperation congress printed paper money to pay for the war.
but the value of this money dropped so low that merchants demanded to be paid in gold instead.
like everything else gold was scarce.
atthe beginning of the war american soldiers were poorly trained and poorly equipped.
they lacked gunpowder rifles food and clothing.
some men had only spears or axes for weapons.
american revolution the struggle of the colonies in north america to gain their independence from great britain continental army the american army during the american revolution american strengths still the americans did have strengths.
one was the patriotism of people like joseph martin who willingly gave their lives to defend the ideal of a country based on liberty and democracy.
without them the war would have been quickly lost.
the americans also received help from overseas.
motivated by their old hatred of the english the french secretly aided the americans.
during the first two years of the war 90 percent of the americans gunpowder came from europe mostly from france.
in addition a polish jew named haym salomon who immigrated to new york in 1775 helped to finance the war effort.
the americans other great strength was their commander.
general washington was more than an experienced military leader.
he was also a man who inspired courage and confidence.
in the dark days to come it was washington who would keep the ragtag continental army together.
ip chapter 7 7 3 british strengths and weaknesses in contrast to the american colonies great britain entered the war from a position of strength.
yet despite both their real and their perceived advantages the british forces encountered many problems.
british strengths with a professional army of about 42 000 troops at the beginning of the war british forces greatly outnumbered the continental army.
in addition george iii hired 30 000 mercenaries from germany.
these hired soldiers were known as hessians heh shenz because they came from a part of germany called hesse cassel.
the british were also able to recruit many loyalists african americans and american indians to fight on their side.
british and hessian troops were well trained in european military tactics.
they excelled in large battles fought by a mass of troops on open ground.
they also had far more experience firing artillery than americans had.
the british forces were well supplied as well.
unlike the pitifully equipped continental army they seldom lacked for food uniforms weapons or ammunition.
british weaknesses even so the war presented great britain with huge problems.
one was the distance between great britain and america.
sending troops and supplies across the atlantic was slow and costly.
news of battles arrived in england long after they had occurred making it difficult for british leaders to plan a course of action.
a second problem was that king george and his ministers were never able to convince the british people that defeating the rebels was vital to the future of great britain.
the longer the war dragged on the less happy the british taxpayers became about paying its heavy costs.
a third problem was poor leadership.
lord george germain the man chosen to direct the british troops had no real sense of how to defeat the rebels.
how could he.
he had never set foot in north america.
nor did it occur to him to go see for himself what his army was up against.
if he had germain might have realized that this was not a war that could be won by conquering a city or two.
to end the revolution germains forces would have to crush the patriots will to fight state by state.
instead germain kept changing plans and generals hoping that some combination of the two would bring him an easy victory.
british soldiers were trained professionals.
they were well equipped with plenty of ammunition good muskets adequate food and uniforms.
the american revolution 121 1a great britain almost wins the war after the british abandoned boston in the spring of 1776 germain came up with his first plan for winning the war.
british forces in america led by general william howe were ordered to capture new york city.
from that base british troops would then move north to destroy the rebellion at its heart massachusetts.
to block the british invasion washington hurried with his army from boston to new york.
it was there that he heard the good news by signing the declaration of independence congress had finally declared the colonies to be free and independent states.
washington had the declaration of independence read aloud to his troops.
the time had come he said to show our enemies and the whole world that free men contending for their own land are superior to any mercenaries on earth ihe declaration made it clear that the troops had the support of all the colonies who agreed that independence was a prize worth fighting for.
african americans faced a difficult decision during the revolution.
which country was more likely to give them freedom atthe end of the war america or great britain.
many blacks chose to fight with the americans.
with their help the continental army defeated the british atthe battle of cowpens in south carolina pictured below.
african americans and the war for african americans however the declaration of independence raised both hopes and questions.
did jeffersons words all men are created equal apply to them.
would independence bring an end to slavery.
should they join the revolution.
even before independence was declared a number of african americans had joined the patriot cause.
black militiamen both free and slave fought at lexington concord and bunker hill.
early in the war however blacks were banned from the continental army.
washington did not want the army to become a haven for runaway slaves.
in contrast the british promised freedom to all slaves who took up arms for the king.
as a result thousands of runaways became loyalists and fought for great britain.
a shortage of volunteers soon forced washington to change his mind.
by 1779 about 15 percent of the soldiers in the continental army were african americans.
large numbers of black sailors also served in the continental navy.
as black americans joined the war effort some whites began to question their own beliefs.
how could they accept slavery if they truly believed that all people are created equal with the same rights to life liberty and happiness.
by the wars end vermont connecticut massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and pennsylvania had all taken steps to end slavery.
122 chapter 7 defeat in new york on august 27 1776 the american and british armies met in brooklyn new york for what promised to be a decisive battle.
ihe americans began their defense of the city in high spirits.
but the inexperienced americans were no match for the british with their greater numbers and superior training.
in two days of fighting the british lost only 377 men while the americans lost 1 407.
satisfied that the war was nearly won howe ordered a halt to the british attack.
washington he assumed would do what any self respecting european general would do in a hopeless situation.
he would surrender honorably.
and so howe waited.
washington had no intention of giving up.
but for his army to survive he would have to retreat.
even though washington knew this he could not bring himself to utter the word retreat.
an officer named thomas mifflin rescued him from his pride.
what is your strength mifflin asked.
nine thousand washington replied.
it is not sufficient said mifflin bluntly.
we must retreat fading hopes ihe battle for new york city was the first of many defeats for the americans.
in the weeks that followed british forces chased the americans out of new york through new jersey and finally across the delaware river into pennsylvania.
for joseph martin and his comrades this was a trying time.
there was little food to eat and the soldiers grew weak from hunger.
as the weather turned cold muddy roads and icy streams added to their misery.
with their terms of enlistment nearly up many soldiers headed for home.
along the way they spread the word that anyone who volunteered to risk his life in the continental army had to be crazy.
by the time washington reached pennsylvania only a few thousand men were still under his command.
many of his remaining troops he reported were entirely naked and most so thinly clad clothed as to be unfit for service more troops had to be found and found quickly he wrote his brother.
otherwise i think the game will be pretty well up while chasing the retreating conti.
nental army british soldiers looted the.
homes of americans both patriots and loyalists.
such actions turned many former supporters into enemies.
j i the american revolution 123 7 5 a pep talk and surprise victories by the end of 1776 the british also thought the war was just about over.
general howe offered to pardon all rebels who signed a statement promising to remain in peaceful obedience to the king.
thousands took him up on his offer.
with morale low and his soldiers threatening to return home george washington planned a daring attack on the hessians at trenton.
crossing the ice choked delaware river at night he surprised the enemy overwhelming them completely.
the crisis washington knew he had to do something quickly.
gathering his last troops together he read to them from thomas paines new pamphlet the crisis.
these are the times that try mens souls.
the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
next washington outlined a daring plan to attack hessian troops who were camped for the winter in trenton new jersey.
heartened by thomas paines words his men did not shrink from the service of their country victory in trenton late on december 25 1776 washingtons army crossed the ice choked delaware river in small boats.
on the new jersey shore washington gave his men the password for the long nighttime march ahead victory or death as the american troops made their way toward trenton a driving snow chilled them to the bone.
ice and rocks cut through their worn out shoes.
one officer reported to washington that the troops guns were too wet to fire.
use the bayonets the general replied.
the town must be taken when the americans reached trenton they found the hessians happily sleeping off their christmas feasts.
caught completely by surprise the mercenaries surrendered.
washington took 868 prisoners without losing even a single man.
a week later the americans captured another 300 british troops at princeton new jersey.
these defeats convinced howe that it would take more than capturing new york city and issuing pardons to win the war.
news of washingtons victories electrified patriots.
a few days ago they had given up their cause for lost wrote an unhappy loyalist.
their late successes have turned the scale and they are all liberty mad again the game was not yet up.
4 chapter 7 7 6 the tide begins to turn when the american revolution began both sides adopted the same military strategy or overall plan for winning the war.
that strategy was to defeat the enemy in one big battle.
after barely escaping from his loss in new york washington revised his strategy.
in the future he wrote congress he would avoid large battles that might put his army at risk.
instead the war would be defensive rather than defeating the british washington hoped to tire them out.
a new british strategy germain revised the british strategy as well.
his new plan was to divide the rebels by taking control of new yorks hudson river valley.
control of this waterway would allow the british to cut new england off from the rest of the states.
without men and supplies from the new england states the continental army would surely collapse.
to carry out this plan general john burgoyne ber goin left canada in june 1777 with about 8 000 british soldiers and american indian warriors.
he planned to move this army south to albany new york.
there he would meet up with general howe who was supposed to march his army north from new york city.
catherine schulyer was the wife of philip schulyer a major general in the continental army and a member of the continental congress.
they lived near albany in the path of british forces advancing toward saratoga.
to leave nothing useful for the british catherine burned the family wheatfields.
problems with burgoyne s plan there were two big problems with burgoynes plan.
the first was that what looked like an easy invasion route on a map was anything but easy.
the route burgoyne chose from canada to albany took his army through more than 20 miles of tangled wilderness.
his army had to build bridges chop down countless trees and lay out miles of log roads through swamps as it crept toward albany.
to make matters worse burgoyne didnt travel light.
his army was slowed by more than 600 wagons 30 of them filled with his personal baggage.
even in the wilderness gentleman johnny burgoyne sipped champagne with his supper.
the second problem with burgoynes plan was that general howe had his own ideas about how to win the war.
instead of marching to albany howe headed for philadelphia the rebels capital.
there he hoped to lure washington into another major battle.
howe hoped it would be the last one.
washington however refused to risk his army in another big battle.
he would not fight for philadelphia.
instead he played hide and seek with howe attacking here and there and then disappearing into the countryside.
strategy an overall plan such as for winning a war the american revolution 125 ally a nation that joins another nation in some common effort such as fighting a war a turning point by the time the slow moving burgoyne finally reached saratoga springs on the hudson river the area was swarming with militia.
although the rebels outnumbered his army burgoyne ordered an attack.
again and again the rebels beat back burgoyne s troops.
on october 17 1777 burgoyne accepted defeat.
burgoynes surrender marked a turning point in the war.
before the victory at saratoga most of the world believed that the american cause was hopeless.
now the americans had shown they could stand up to a british army and win.
not long after this victory france came into the war as an ally of the united states.
the french government sent money weapons troops and warships to the americans.
spain also entered the war against great britain.
the american cause no longer looked quite so hopeless.
george washington is shown at right with the marquis de lafayette at valley forge.
lafayette a frenchman who aided the americans described the american soldiers there as in want of everything they had neither coats nor hats nor shirts nor shoes their feet and their legs froze until they grew black.
winter at valley forge saratoga was a stunning victory but the war was far from over.
while general washingtons army roamed the countryside howes forces still occupied philadelphia.
late in 1777 congress declared a day of thanksgiving for the armys successes.
by this time washington and his army were on their way to valley forge pennsylvania to make camp for the winter.
joseph martin described the armys celebration we had nothing to eat for two or three days previous.
but we must now have what congress said a sumptuous lavish thanksgiving.
it gave each and every man a gill a few ounces of rice and a tablespoon of vinegar.
the army was now not only starved but naked.
the greatest part were not only shirtless and barefoot but destitute of without all other clothing especially blankets.
washingtons troops were hungry because many farmers preferred to sell food to the british.
the british paid them in gold whereas congress paid them in paper money.
as for uniforms and blankets merchants had raised the prices for these items sky high.
this desire for profits at the armys expense outraged washington.
no punishment he fumed is too great for the man who can build his greatness upon his countrys ruin to help lift his men from their misery washington put 126 chapter 7 baron friedrich von steuben free drik von stu bin in charge of training.
a military officer from prussia in modern day germany von steuben arrived in december 1777 and set to work turning the continental army into an organized fighting force.
the prussian s method wrote martin was continual drill it worked wonders.
the army grows stronger every day wrote one officer.
there is a spirit of discipline among the troops that is better than numbers another foreign volunteer the marquis de lafayette mar kee duh la fey et also helped raise the troops spirits.
although he was one of the richest men in france lafayette chose to share the hardships of valley forge.
he even used his own money to buy the men warm clothing.
the patient fortitude courage of the officers and soldiers lafayette wrote was a continual miracle when at last spring arrived washington received news that the british were about to abandon philadelphia.
the time had come to put his newly trained army to the test.
the battle of monmouth by this time sir henry clinton had replaced general howe as commander of the british forces in north america.
in clintons view taking over philadelphia had gained the british nothing.
he ordered his army to retreat to new york city where the royal navy could keep it supplied by sea.
now it was washingtons turn to chase an army across new jersey.
on june 28 1778 he caught up with the retreating british near monmouth new jersey.
in the battle that followed washington seemed to be everywhere constantly rallying his men to stand and fight.
cheering them by his voice and example wrote lafayette never had i beheld seen so superb a man late that night the british slipped across the hudson river to safety in new york city.
washington camped with his army nearby.
it was pleasing he wrote that after two years maneuvering both armies are brought back to the very point they set out from.
neither army knew it yet but the war in the north was over.
at the battle of monmouth in new jersey george washington led his troops in an attack on retreating british forces although the americans won the british were able to slip away during the night and sail safely to new york.
the american revolution 127 this engraving shows francis marion crossing the pee dee river in south carolina.
marion known as the swamp fox because of his tactic of ambushing the british from the marshes of the south never led a force of more than 70 men.
7 7 the war moves south after failing to conquer any state in the north the british changed strategies yet again.
their new plan was to move the war to the south.
there they believed thousands of loyalists were just waiting to join the kings cause.
clinton began his southern campaign with a successful attack on savannah georgia.
from georgia he moved north to take control of north and south carolina.
at that point clinton returned to new york city leaving lord charles cornwallis to control the war in the south.
saving the south cornwallis soon learned that he did not really control the carolinas after all.
guerrillas soldiers who are not part of a regular army kept the american cause alive.
one of them was francis marion who was also known as the swamp fox marions band of rebels harassed the british with hit and run raids.
they attacked and then faded into the swamps and forests like foxes.
late in 1780 washington sent general nathanael greene to slow the british advance through the south.
greenes army was too small to meet cornwallis in a major battle.
instead greene led cornwalliss troops on an exhausting chase through the southern backcountry.
he wrote of his strategy we fight get beat rise and fight again greenes strategy worked wonderfully.
in april 1781 cornwallis wrote that he was quite tired of marching about the country he moved his army to yorktown a sleepy tobacco port on chesapeake bay in virginia for a good rest.
er7 a trap at yorktown by the time cornwallis was settling into yorktown france had sent nearly 5 000 troops to join washingtons army in new york.
in august washington learned that another 3 000 troops were scheduled to arrive soon in 29 french warships.
washington used this information to set a trap for cornwallis.
secretly he moved his army south to virginia.
when they arrived they joined the french and surrounded yorktown on land with more than 16 000 troops.
meanwhile the french warships showed up just in time to seal off the entrance to chesapeake bay.
their appearance was crucial to the american victory.
now cornwallis was cut off from the british navy and any hope of rescue by sea.
the trap was sprung on october 6 1781.
joseph martin watched as a flag was raised to signal that american and french gunners should open fire on yorktown.
i confess i felt a secret pride swell in my heart he wrote when i saw the star spangled banner waving majestically the shelling went on for days until most of the guns in the enemys works were silenced three groups the british the americans and the french were involved in the battle of yorktown.
the americans with the aid of the french were able to surround the british by using forces on both land and sea.
battle of yorktown the american revolution 129 this painting by john trumbull shows the british surrender at yorktown.
at the center is general benjamin lincoln leading the british.
general washington is on the right in front of the american flag.
on the left are french polish and prussian soldiers.
cornwallis surrenders at first cornwallis clung to the hope that the british navy would come to his rescue even as yorktown was exploding around him.
when no ships arrived he finally agreed to surrender.
on october 19 1781 american and french troops formed two long lines that stretched for more than a mile along the road to yorktown the french on one side and the americans on the other.
the two lines could not have looked more different.
the french were dressed in elegant uniforms that gleamed with gold and silver braid in the afternoon sun.
the americans uniforms and not everyone even had uniforms were patched and faded.
behind the lines stood civilians who had traveled for miles to witness the surrender.
after hours of waiting the crowd watched as 8 000 british troops left yorktown to lay down their arms.
the defeated troops moved with slow and solemn step they were accompanied by a slow tune known as the world turned upside down this same sad tune had been played at saratoga after the british surrender.
cornwallis did not take part in this ceremony saying that he was ill.
in reality the british commander could not bear to surrender publicly to an army that he looked down on as a contemptible and undisciplined rabble mob while cornwallis sulked in his tent his men surrendered their arms.
many of them wept bitter tears.
to the watching americans there was nothing sad about that day.
it was a noble sight to us wrote martin and the more so as it seemed to promise a speedy conclusion to the contest 0 chapter 7 key battles of the american revolution this map shows key battles of the american revolution.
in the early part of the war major battles took place mostly in the new england colonies and the middle colonies in the north.
as the war continued battles moved southward.
in which colony and region did the battle of princeton take place.
in which colony and region did the battle of yorktown take place.
the american revolution 131 the ideals of the american revolution inspired calls for liberty equality and fraternity in france.
france s support forthe war deepened its national debt and caused suffering among its people.
in 1789 france s monarchy was overthrown.
this painting shows a violent clash between french commoners and king louis xvi s troops during the french revolution.
7 8 the war ends the conclusion of the war did not come as quickly as martin had hoped.
when lord north the british prime minister heard about cornwalliss defeat at yorktown he paced up and down the room repeating oh god.
it is all over when the british people heard about the defeat most of them accepted it.
the loss at yorktown drained any remaining support for the war.
still months dragged by before king george was finally forced to accept that the british had been defeated.
for most americans the end of the war was a time for joy and celebration.
they had gained the freedom to govern themselves and create their own future.
but liberty came at a high price.
at least 6 200 americans had been killed in combat.
an estimated 10 000 died in camp of diseases and another 8 500 died while in captivity as british prisoners.
as a proportion of the total population more americans died fighting in the american revolution than in any other conflict except the civil war in which americans fought one another.
the treaty of paris early in 1783 representatives of the united states and great britain signed a peace treaty in paris.
the treaty of paris had three important parts.
first great britain agreed to recognize the united states as an independent nation.
second great britain gave up its claims to all lands between the atlantic coast and the mississippi river from the border of canada south to florida.
third the united states agreed to return all rights and property taken from loyalists during the war.
many loyalists did not trust the treatys promise of fair treatment and for good reason.
during the war loyalists had been treated badly by patriots.
more than 80 000 loyalists both black and white left the united states to settle in british canada.
132 chapter 7 the impact of the american revolution the american revolution had a major impact in other parts of the world.
in europe it thrilled liberals who dreamed of creating their own democracies.
the american example was especially influential in france which soon had its own revolution.
as one frenchman wrote they americans are the hope of the human race they may well become its model indeed in the 1800s that model would help inspire revolts against european rule in south america.
j chapter summary in this chapter you read how the american colonies won their independence from great britain.

sending troops and supplies to the colonies was slow and costly.

after the loss of new york city only washingtons leadership kept the colonists going.
a pep talk and surprising victories thomas paines the crisis encouraged americans to keep fighting.
colonial victories at trenton and princeton gave new hope for their cause.
the tide begins to turn the colonists victory in the battle of saratoga in 1777 marked a turning point in the war.
shortly afterward france and spain joined the colonies as allies.

under the terms of the treaty great britain recognized the united states as an independent country.
the war officially ended with the signing of the treaty of paris in 1783.
british troops agreed to leave american soil with all convenient speed.
the american revolution 133 reading further george washington hated to leave his wife martha but he believed in the cause of freedom.
so he agreed to lead the colonial war effort.
george washington a warrior spirit and a caring heart everyone knows stories about george washington.
from chopping down the cherry tree to helping the nation win independence the stories make washington sound larger than life.
washington s writings reveal a more complex person.
behind his strong public presence was a man of many sentiments.
he balanced a deep love of his family with a commitment to fighting for his country.
he coupled bravery with concern caution and compassion.
in 1775 the continental congress asked george washington to lead the colonial army.
washington was living on his estate at mount vernon virginia at the time.
he had proven his military skills in the french and indian war.
and he had the added benefit of coming from the south.
if he were to command the army congress thought he might tie the southern colonies more firmly to the cause.
washington believed deeply in that cause.
still he had his doubts about taking on the important job congress offered.
young soldiers like joseph plumb martin a connecticut farm boy looked forward to going to war.
but washington was 43 years old and had fought in wars before.
he knew it would be hard to leave his home and family.
in a letter to his wife martha he said i should enjoy more real happiness in one month with you at home than i have the most distant prospect of finding abroad away from home if my stay were to be seven times seven years eventually washington did lead the colonists to victory but in 1775 he was not sure he would be able to do so.
he worried he would not be clever enough to ensure that the colonists would win the war.
he thanked congress for the honor of being asked to lead.
he told them about his concerns but said he would do everything he could to help the colonists reach their goal.
in a speech to congress he said i feel great distress from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extensive and important trust.
however as the congress desire it i will enter upon the momentous duty and exert every power i possess in their service and for the support of the glorious cause.
the man s compassion washington was a general but he understood the hardships his soldiers faced.
at the top of the list was low pay.
he felt bad that his men had to do so much hard work for so little money.
he also knew that low pay kept some men from enlisting.
a soldier cannot ruin himself and family to serve his country he told congress.
34 chapt er 7 washington witnessed the terrible shortages his soldiers lived with.
joseph plumb martin felt the sting of the shortages.
he went for days without food and made simple moccasins to keep his feet off the ice.
years later martin wrote in his a narrative of a revolutionary soldier 1830 that it was ironic that soldiers for a noble cause were so poorly equipped.
he described the soldiers marching through princeton new jersey.
the young ladies of the town had collected and were sitting in the stoops and at the windows to see the noble exhibition of a thousand half starved and three quarters naked soldiers pass in review before them.
the soldiers suffering upset washington.
he repeatedly asked for more supplies.
during the harsh winter at valley forge he wrote to congress.
in a letter dated december 23 1777 he accused the congressmen of not understanding what his soldiers went through.
1 can assure those gentlemen that it is a much easier and less distressing thing to draw remonstrances listen to protests in a comfortable room by a good fireside than to occupy a cold bleak hill and sleep under frost and snow without clothes or blankets.
however although they seem to have little feeling for the naked and distressed soldiers i feel superabundantly for them and from my soul i pity those miseries which it is neither in my power to relieve or prevent.
george washington cared about his soldiers suffering.
here he is shown visiting wounded men at valley forge during the winter of 1777 78.
the american revolution 135 washington expected his soldiers to fight well.
but early in the war he had to lead their retreat from a battle at long island new york.
the general s concerns george washington balanced sympathy for his soldiers with his responsibility as their leader.
for example he knew that soldiers did not want to leave home any more than he did.
but his sympathy only went so far.
when it came down to it washington worried that homesick men made poor soldiers.
they threatened his mission.
they threatened the colonists success.
men just dragged from the tender scenes of domestic life he wrote were easily scared by the hard life of a soldier.
such soldiers might desert the army and encourage others to desert too.
the compassionate washington wanted his soldiers to get paid more.
but he still expected them to fight and fight hard.
he scorned their lack of discipline.
he was horrified by what happened at the battle of new york in 1776.
i found the troops.
retreating las fast as possible and those ordered to support them flying in every direction and in the greatest confusion.
i used every means in my power to rally and get them into some order but my attempts were ineffectual on the appearance of a small party of the enemy their disorder increased and they ran away in the greatest confusion without firing a single shot.
the general knew that such chaos would never win the war.
he did everything he could to see to it that soldiers who neglected their duties were punished.
similarly while washington sympathized with his soldiers being hungry as general he prohibited them from stealing food.
his reason was practical as much as it was moral.
too often people killed soldiers who tried to steal from them.
he wrote to one of his colonels every attempt of the men to plunder houses orchards gardens etc should be discouraged not only for the preservation of property and sake of good order but for the prevention of those fatal consequences which usually follow such diabolical practices.
of course the generals rules were not always obeyed.
during the winter at valley forge an officer ordered joseph plumb martin to steal to help keep the soldiers from starving.
the work was not altogether unpleasant martin wrote in a narrative of a revolutionary soldier but it was definitely stealing.
he described it this way.
i had to travel far and near.
and at all times to run the risk of abuse if not injury from the inhabitants when plundering them of their property for i could not while in the very act of taking their cattle hay corn and grain from them against their wills consider it a whit better than plundering sheer privateering stealing under the authority of a government.
worry and praise courage and kindness george washington worried about his reputation.
he wanted people to respect him.
but if the colonies lost the war washington knew that people would think less of him.
that worry gave even the great general cause for concern.
he once wrote to his cousin that i never was in such an unhappy divided state since i was born to a confidant he wrote that his army service was one continued round of annoyance and fatigue nonetheless washington kept fighting for the cause of freedom.
as the war dragged on he praised his soldiers for putting up such a good fight against the british the most powerful army in the world.
in a letter he wrote without arrogance it may be said that no history can furnish an instance of an army s suffering such uncommon hardships as ours have done and bearing them with the same patience and fortitude.
when the war was over washington did everything he could to see that the soldiers received fair pay from the new government.
when he said goodbye to his officers george washington again balanced courage and kindness.
the commander in chief one general reported was suffused in tears he could not speak because he had such strong feelings for his men.
in the final goodbye washington revealed both his warrior spirit and his caring heart.
george washington bid an emotional farewell to his officers at fraunces tavern in new york in 1783.
the tavern owner samuel fraunces was a free black man of french and african descent.
he would become chief steward at president washington s house in philadelphia.

most of the southern states were larger than most of the northern states.
however as the map on the opposite page shows a state s population often had little relation to its size.
for example the populations of tiny rhode island and the much larger georgia were close to the same.
for the colonists differences between the states geographic features raised basic questions about what form the nation s government should take.
should a large state like georgia have the same voice in government as a small state like connecticut which had a greater population.
should connecticut have as much power as new york which was larger and had more people too.
at first the answer to both questions was yes.
under the nation s first constitution called the articles of confederation each state had one vote in congress.
in time however some people began to question the fairness of this system.
yet basing a state s political power on its population raised other questions.
for example should a state with both slaves and free people have as much power as a state with no slaves and the same total population.
the populations of the southern states contained a high percentage of slaves as the maps on this page show.
the maps also show that counting only free people would drop most of these states in the population rankings compared to the northern states.
such geographic concerns arose in 1787 when representatives of 12 states met to write a new constitution for the united states.
in this unit you will learn how the delegates handled population related disputes and other issues in framing the form of government we have today.

106 chapter 6 chapter 6 the declaration of independence what principles of government are expressed in the declaration of independence.
6 1 introduction the battles of lexington and concord marked the start of the fighting that would lead to independence from great britain.
the day after the clashes horseback riders galloped through the colonies with news of the barbarous murders of innocent militiamen.
most americans were deeply shocked.
more urgently than ever they debated what the colonies should do about the trouble with great britain.
the choices were clear enough.
the colonies could declare their independence.
or they could continue with protests and petitions or formal requests.
this second choice would keep the colonies at peace but at what cost to the colonists freedom.
no one was more outspoken in his support for independence than patrick henry of virginia.
after the passage of the intolerable acts henry delivered to the virginia house of burgesses one of the most famous speeches in american history.
there is no longer any room for hope he began.
if we wish to be free we must fight.
our chains are forged.
their clanking may be heard on the plains of boston.
the war is inevitable and let it come then henry spoke to those who treasured peace above freedom gentlemen may cry.
peace peace but there is no peace.
the war is actually begun.
the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
what is it that gentlemen wish.
is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.
forbid it almighty god.
i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death.
despite the passionate words of patriots like henry most colonists remained unsure about separating from great britain.
as you will read only after the fighting started did they decide to declare independence.
patrick henry of virginia gave a speech in may 1775 that helped lead the colonies closerto independence.
the declaration of independence was adopted on july 4 1776.
this painting shows the committee that drafted the declaration.
the declaration of independence 107 orderly rows of british soldiers marched up breed s hill and eventually defeated the american forces when the colonists ran out of gunpowder.
the fierce fighting proved the british would not easily defeat the colonists.
6 2 the colonists organize an army on may 10 1775 the second continental congress met in philadelphia.
by then new england militia had amassed around boston.
the first question facing congress was who should command this new england army the obvious answer was a new englander.
george washington and the continental army john adams of massachusetts had another idea.
he proposed that congress create a continental army made up of troops from all the colonies.
to lead this army adams nominated a gentleman whose skill and experience as an officer whose great talents and excellent universal character would unite the colonies better than any other person alive.
that man was george washington of virginia who had distinguished himself in the french and indian war.
the delegates agreed.
they unanimously elected washington to be commander in chief of the new continental army.
the battle of bunker hill meanwhile militiamen near boston made plans to fortify two hills that overlooked the city bunker hill and breed s hill.
on the night of june 16 1775 israel putnam led a few hundred men up breed s hill.
in four hours of furious digging they erected a crude fort on the top of the hill.
the fort worried british general william howe who had just arrived from england with fresh troops.
howe ordered an immediate attack.
under a hot june sun some 2 000 british troops formed two long lines at the base of breeds hill.
at howes order the redcoats marched up the slope.
as the lines moved ever closer putnam ordered his men dont fire until you see the whites of their eyes only when the british were almost on top of them did the militiamen pull their triggers.
the red lines broke and fell back in confusion.
the british regrouped and attacked again.
once more the americans stopped their advance.
on their third attack the redcoats finally 8 chapter 6 took the hill but only because the americans had used up all their gunpowder and pulled back.
this clash which became known as the battle of bunker hill was short but very bloody.
more than 1 000 british troops and nearly half that many americans were killed or wounded.
h george washington turned an undisciplined army composed of troops from all the colonies into an effective fighting force.
general washington takes command george washington took command of his new army shortly after the battle of bunker hill.
he found a mixed multitude of people.
under very little discipline order or government washington worked hard to impose order.
one man wrote everyone is made to know his place and keep in it.
it is surprising how much work has been done a month later however a dismayed washington learned that the army had only 36 barrels of gunpowder enough for each soldier to fire just nine shots.
to deceive the british washington started a rumor in boston that he had 1 800 barrels of gun powder more than he knew what to do with.
luckily the british believed the rumor.
meanwhile washington sent desperate letters to the colonies begging for gunpowder.
washington got his powder.
but he still did not dare attack the british forces in boston.
to do that he needed artillery heavy guns such as cannons to bombard their defenses.
in desperation washington sent a boston bookseller named henry knox to fort ticonderoga to round up some big guns.
ticonderoga was an old british fort located at the southern end of lake champlain in new york.
a few months earlier militiamen led by ethan allen and benedict arnold had seized the fort.
the americans had little use for the run down fort but its guns would prove priceless.
as winter set in knox loaded 59 cannons onto huge sleds and dragged them 300 miles to boston.
knoxs 42 sleds also carried 2 300 pounds of lead for making bullets.
boston was about to be under siege.
the british abandon boston on march 4 1776 the british soldiers in boston awoke to a frightening sight.
the night before the ridges of nearby dorchester heights had been bare.
now they bristled with cannons all aimed at the city.
rather than risk another battle general howe abandoned the city.
within days more than a hundred ships left boston harbor for canada.
the ships carried 9 000 british troops as well as 1 100 loyalists who preferred to leave their homes behind rather than live with rebels.
some americans hoped the war was over.
washington however knew it was only the beginning.
the declaration of independence 109 independence freedom from control by another government or country petition a formal written request made to an official person or organization common sense a pamphlet published in 1776 by thomas paine that persuaded many american colonists to support independence declaration of independence the document written to declare the american colonies as an independent nation free from british rule common sense addtcmcd to th inhabitants o f america on the following intert ng s u b j b c t s l of the origin and defign of government in general with concife remarks on the enghfli conoituuoa.

thomas paine published the pamphlet common senseto persuade colonists to support independence from great britain.
6 3 on the eve of independence nearly a year passed between the skirmishes at lexington and concord and the british retreat from boston.
during that time there was little talk of independence.
most colonists still considered themselves loyal british subjects.
their quarrel was not with great britain itself but with its policies toward the colonies.
the olive branch petition many americans pinned their hopes for peace on king george.
in july 1775 the second continental congress sent a petition to george iii asking him to end the quarrel.
john adams called the petition an olive branch olive tree branches are an ancient symbol of peace.
by the time the petition reached london however the king had declared the colonies to be in open and avowed rebellion he ordered his ministers to bring the traitors to justice being called a traitor was enough to change the mind of one of washingtons generals.
the general confessed that he had long looked with some degree of horror on the scheme of separation now he agreed with patrick henry that colonists must be independent or slaves common sense many colonists however still looked with horror at the idea of independence.
then early in 1776 a patriot named thomas paine published a fiery pamphlet entitled common sense.
paine scoffed at the idea that americans owed any loyalty to king george.
of more worth is one honest man to society he wrote than all the crowned ruffians who ever lived paine also attacked the argument that the colonies ties to great britain had benefited americans.
just the opposite was true he said.
american trade had suffered under british control.
americans had also been hurt by being dragged into great britains european wars.
paine ended with a vision of an independent america as a homeland of liberty.
ye that love mankind he urged.
ye that dare oppose not only the tyranny but the tyrant stand forth.
the sun never shined on a cause of greater worth within a few months more than 120 000 copies of common sense were printed in the colonies.
paines arguments helped persuade thousands of colonists that independence was not only sensible but that it was the key to a brighter future.
6 4 thomas jefferson drafts a declaration a few weeks after the british left boston the second continental congress appointed a committee to write a declaration or formal statement of independence.
the task of drafting the declaration of independence went to the committees youngest member 33 year old thomas jefferson of virginia.
a shy man jefferson said little in ongress but he stated his ideas brilliantly in writing.
110 chapter 6 jeffersons job was to explain to the world why the colonies were choosing to separate from britain.
when in the course of human events he began if one group of people finds it necessary to break its ties with another a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they explain their actions.
principles on which to base a new government jeffersons explanation was simple but revolutionary.
loyalists had argued that colonists had a duty to obey the king whose authority came from god.
jefferson reasoned quite differently.
he based his arguments on the principle of natural rights.
all people are born equal in gods sight he reasoned and all are entitled to the same basic rights.
in jeffersons eloquent words we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
governments are formed jefferson said to secure these rights their power to rule comes from the consent of the governed if a government fails to protect peoples fundamental rights it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it the people can then create a new government that will protect their safety and happiness.
after thomas jefferson wrote the first draft of the declaration of independence benjamin franklin and john adams suggested changes.
the king s crimes king george jefferson continued had shown no concern for the rights of colonists.
instead the king s policies had been aimed at establishing an absolute tyranny over these states the colonies.
as proof jefferson included a long list of the king s abuses.
in all these actions jefferson claimed george iii had shown he was unfit to be the ruler of a free people the time had come jefferson concluded for the colonies ties to great britain to be broken.
these united colonies are he declared and of right ought to be free and independent states.
natural rights rights common to everyone as opposed to those given by law the declaration of independence 111 6 5 the final break on july 1 1776 the second continental congress met in philadelphias state house to debate independence.
by noon the temperature outside had soared into the nineties and a thunderstorm was gathering.
inside the state house emotions were equally hot and stormy.
by the end of the day the issue was still undecided.
the next day was cooler and calmer.
on july 2 all but one of the 13 colonies voted for independence.
new york cast no vote.
no delegate was more excited about the colonies decision than john adams.
he wrote to his wife abigail the second day of july will be celebrated by succeeding generations with pomp and parade with shews shows games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more any mention of slavery was removed from the declaration of independence because the slave trade was important to the economy of many colonies.
in the triangular trade shown here rum and iron were shipped from new england to africa.
in africa these products were exchanged for slaves.
the slaves were taken to the west indies where many were traded for molasses and sugar.
finally molasses sugar and remaining slaves were broughtto new england.
debate over slavery adams was wrong about the date that would be celebrated as americas birthday but only because congress decided to revise jeffersons declaration.
the delegates liked most of what they read except for a passage on slavery.
jefferson had charged king george with violating the sacred rights of life and liberty of a distant people by carrying them into slavery almost no one liked this passage.
southerners feared that it might lead to demands to free the slaves.
enslaved african americans provided much of the labor used on southern farms.
northerners worried that new england merchants who benefited from the slave trade might be offended.
even delegates who opposed slavery felt it was unfair to blame the king for enslaving africans.
the passage was removed.
triangular trade and the enslavement of africans 112 chapter 6 this poster shows the delegates leaving independence hall in philadelphia to announce the signing of the declaration of independence.
independence day on july 4 the delegates approved a final version of the declaration of independence.
when they signed the document they pledged to support independence with our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor this was a serious pledge.
every signer understood that he was committing an act of treason against great britain.
if the new nation failed to win its freedom each of them could very well end up swinging from a hangman s rope.
knowing this benjamin franklin told the delegates we must all hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately chapter summary in this chapter you read how the american colonies took the dramatic step of declaring their independence.
the colonists organize an army george washington took command of the continental army after the battle of bunker hill.
the continental army used cannons brought from fort ticonderoga in new york to force the british to abandon boston in march 1776.
on the eve of independence the failure of the olive branch petition and the success of thomas paines pamphlet common sense moved the colonies closer to the decision to declare independence from great britain.
thomas jefferson drafts a declaration thomas jefferson a delegate to the second continental congress was selected to write the declaration of independence.
the final break on july 4 1776 the delegates approved the declaration of independence.
for the first time in history a government was being established on the principle of peoples natural rights and the duty of government to honor those rights.
the declaration of independence 113 reading further little in thomas paine s early life gave a hint of his future importance.
yet his pamphlet common sense would help stirthe fires of american independence.
the power of common sense in january 1776 the pamphlet common sense was published in philadelphia.
the document caused an immediate sensation.
in powerful language the writer thomas paine made a compelling case for separation from great britain.
paine had not been in the colonies for long.
but his call for an end to british rule would help pave the way for american independence.
on november 30 1774 the ship london packet arrived in the port of philadelphia.
on board was a 37 year old englishman named thomas paine.
paine was not even aware that he had landed in america.
he was burning up with fever and was barely conscious.
he had caught the deadly disease typhus which had already killed several people on board.
at the time disease was just one of the perils of travel across the atlantic.
violent storms collisions with icebergs and pirate attacks were other hazards.
one ship took so long to cross the ocean that the food ran out and many of the passengers starved to death.
paine was lucky to be alive but he was still very ill.
unable to walk he was carried ashore in a blanket.
a local doctor agreed to nurse him back to health.
it was not a promising start to life in america.
but then not very much in paines life had gone well.
he had held and lost a number of different jobs.
he had been a craftsman a teacher a tax collector and a shopkeeper.
in the end though he had little to show for his efforts.
he had no money and few prospects.
but he did have one important asset for his new life letters of introduction from benjamin franklin.
paine had met franklin in london and had impressed him with his sharp mind and his interest in science and politics.
franklin encouraged paine to move to pennsylvania and gave him letters of reference calling him an ingenious worthy young man these letters would help paine start a new life.
paine finds his calling paine had arrived in the largest and most prosperous city in colonial america.
philadelphia was a bustling place of around 30 000 people and the third largest port in the british empire.
set along the banks of the delaware river philadelphia was the financial and cultural capital of the colonies.
it was also a center of political activity.
in fact the continental congress had held its first meeting there not long before paines arrival.
the city was buzzing with talk of politics.
chapter 6 with the help of franklins introduction paine soon landed a job as the editor of a new magazine.
he had already done some writing in england.
but it was here that he discovered his true calling as a writer.
paine soon made his publication pennsylvania magazine the most widely read magazine in the colonies.
magazines were fairly new at the time.
but along with pamphlets they were becoming increasingly popular.
they were quicker and cheaper to publish than books and that kept their price low.
they also offered the space to cover issues in greater detail than newspapers could.
this made them appealing to a public that had a growing appetite for information.
at first paine wrote articles mainly about cultural and scientific subjects.
but he soon moved on to political topics.
paines years as a tax collector had left him with no love for the british government.
his articles criticized british officials and colonial rule.
these stories did not please the loyalist citizens of philadelphia who favored strong ties to great britain.
on the other hand they did appeal to readers with patriot sympathies.
one of these readers was benjamin rush a doctor who would later play a key role in the independence struggle.
rush encouraged paine to write a pamphlet on independence though he cautioned him not to use that word.
the idea of independence made many colonists uneasy.
they might complain about british rule but the prospect of separating from great britain scared them.
it did not scare paine though.
in october 1775 he began working on the essay he would call common sense.
philadelphia in the 1770s was a beautiful city with brick streets and fine buildings.
chestnut street shown here was atthe center of the city.
an appeal to common sense by december paine had finished his essay.
but he had trouble getting it published.
the subject of independence was just too hot for many publishers to handle.
as paine noted at the time colonists were so attached to great britain that it was a kind of treason to speak against it.
eventually however paine found a publisher who agreed to print a thousand copies as a pamphlet.
it was 46 pages long.
the pamphlet did not have paines name on the cover but simply said written by an englishman on january 10 1776 common sense appeared in bookstores.
what happened next was astonishing.
the first edition sold out in days.
paine had more copies printed and those sold out too.
within a few months readers had bought more than 120 000 copies of common sense.
by the end of the year 25 editions had been printed.
hundreds of thousands of copies were in circulation throughout the colonies.
it is estimated that as many as half of all colonial citizens had either read the pamphlet or had it read to them.
common sense was a runaway success.
and thomas paine was americas first bestselling author.
what explains this stunning result.
evidently paine had touched a nerve.
the public was not as resistant to the idea of independence as he and others had feared.
paines success lay in his ability to present separation as logical and reasonable as a matter of common sense.
he used language that was direct clear and powerful.
drawing on the shared experience of colonists he built a persuasive case for independence.
the sun never shined on a cause of greater worth he wrote.
tis not the affair of a city a country a province or a kingdom but of a continent tis not the concern of a day a year or an age now is the seed time of continental union faith and honor.
one reader in connecticut wrote you have declared the sentiments of millions we were blind but on reading these enlightening words the scales have fallen from our eyes printers like robert bell who first published common sense helped spread the message of independence.
bell and paine made money on the best seller.
but paine donated all of his profits to the continental army.
j6 chapter 6 paine recognized that the main obstacle to independence among colonists was their continued loyalty to the king and crown.
so he set out to demolish that loyalty.
as one paine biographer wrote common sense could be considered the first american self help book the help being for those who could never imagine life without a monarch paine began by ridiculing the notion that kings had some special god given right to rule over their subjects.
he called the king the royal brute of england and said even brutes do not devour their young nor savages make war upon their families he linked the problems of life in the colonies to the evils of british rule and argued that americans would be much better off on their own.
everything that is right or natural pleads for separation he declared.
the blood of the slain the weeping voice of nature cries tis time to part paine argued that the colonists should unite around a common goal to create a self governing nation based on principles of liberty.
we have it in our power to begin the world over again he wrote.
the birthday of a new world is at hand and in one stirring passage he called on america to make itself the refuge of freedom every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression.
freedom hath been hunted round the globe.
asia and africa have long expelled her.
europe regards her like a stranger and england hath given her warning to depart.
receive the fugitive and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.
the impact of common sense although paines words were powerful his ideas were not new.
many other colonial leaders such as benjamin franklin thomas jefferson and john adams had expressed similar thoughts.
but paine was able to put those ideas together in a single compelling argument that spoke to a mass audience.
as benjamin rush noted the ideas that paine put forth in common sense had previously lain like stones in a field useless til collected and arranged in a building.
common sense did not start the movement for independence.
that movement had been building for some time.
nor did it cause colonial leaders to declare independence.
another six months would pass before the declaration of independence was issued.
but paine s work opened up the debate on separation from great britain.
it helped many colonists see independence as a real possibility.
paines ideas on rights and liberty also had an influence on other countries particularly france.
in fact paine later moved to france to play a role in the french revolution.
he also wrote several books including the rights of man.
but none of his other works would have quite the impact as common sense the pamphlet that helped pave the way for american independence.
paine believed that his most important message was the attack on king george iii.
this painting from 1767 depicts the king in all his royal glory.
it shows a formality that had become foreign to his subjects in america.
the declaration of independence 117.
chapter 5 toward independence when is it necessary for citizens to rebel against their government.
5 1 introduction an almost full moon cast a pale light over boston on april 18 1775.
but the night was anything but quiet.
mounted on brown beauty one of the fastest horses in massachusetts paul revere woke up the countryside with alarming news.
british troops stationed in boston were on the move.
they had orders to march to the nearby town of concord and seize weapons the colonists had stored there.
this was news patriots had been waiting for.
patriots also called whigs were americans who believed the colonies had the right to govern themselves.
on hearing reveres warning patriots around concord grabbed their muskets and prepared to meet the british troops.
the same news filled loyalists also called tories with dread.
loyalists were colonists who felt a deep loyalty to great britain.
they saw themselves as faithful subjects of the king.
they were horrified by the idea of taking up arms against british troops.
how did colonists come to be so divided in their feelings about the british.
most americans were content with british rule in the early 1700s.
in this chapter you will learn what happened to change the relationship between great britain and the colonies.
the story begins in the 1750s when great britain and the colonies fought a war against the french and their indian allies.
the french and indian war left great britain with huge debts and a vast new empire to protect.
to solve its problems the british government passed new laws that tightened its control of the colonies.
some of these laws also placed new taxes on the colonists.
colonists were stunned.
for the most part they had been able to make their own laws and determine their own taxes.
suddenly great britain was changing the rules.
it wasnt right the colonists protested.
in this chapter you will see how these feelings led many colonists to consider rebelling against their government.
why would some colonists have celebrated the dismantling of a statue of the british king.
bythe 1770s the colonists had become deeply divided in their loyalty to great britain.
here some colonists tear down a statue of king george.
toward independence 87 hl i.
before 1763 great britain had relatively little to do with the day to day lives of most colonists.
5 2 before 1763 by 1750 the american colonies were bursting with growth.
in just a century the population of the colonies had grown from 50 000 to more than a million people.
what brought about this rapid growth.
cheap land.
religious tolerance.
economic opportunity.
all of these were important in attracting people to the colonies.
but there was another reason.
for more than a century the british government had for the most part left the colonies alone to solve their own problems.
during this time americans had learned to govern themselves.
each colony elected its own assembly.
like the british parliament the assemblies had the power to pass laws and to create and collect taxes.
each assembly also decided how the colonys tax money should be spent.
americans had more freedom to run their own affairs than ordinary people in any country in europe.
self government also made the colonies attractive to settlers.
militia a small army made up of ordinary citizens who are trained to fight in an emergency conflict in the ohio valley as the colonies grew settlers began to dream of moving across the appalachian mountains and into the ohio valley the region between the ohio and mississippi rivers.
both great britain and france claimed this area.
in 1754 the french made good on their claim by building a fort where the city of pittsburgh stands today.
they called it fort duquesne du kane.
news of the fort alarmed the governor of virginia.
he ordered a small force of virginia militia to drive the french out of the ohio valley.
militias are small armies of citizens who are trained to fight in an emergency.
to head the militia the governor chose a 22 year old volunteer named george washington.
today americans remember george washington as a great patriot a military hero and the first president of the united states.
in 1754 however he was just an ambitious young man with no land or money.
washington believed that his best chance of getting ahead was to become an officer in the british army.
there was only one prob lem with his plan.
most british officers believed that colonists made terrible soldiers.
the expedition into the ohio valley gave washington a chance to prove them wrong.
near fort duquesne he came across a french scouting party that was camped in the woods.
washington ordered hi men to open fire.
it was an easy victory.
i heard the bullets whistle he wrote afterward.
and believe me there is something charming the sound 88 chapter 5 the french and indian war washingtons whistling bullets were the first shots in a conflict known as the french and indian war.
this war was part of a long struggle between france and great britain for territory and power.
because many american indians fought with france in this latest conflict the colonists called it the french and indian war.
in 1755 great britain sent 1 400 british soldiers to virginia to finish the job that washington had begun.
they were led by a general named edward braddock.
the soldiers job was to clear the french out of the ohio valley.
washington joined the army as a volunteer hoping to make a good impression on general braddock.
braddocks march into the ohio valley was a disaster.
the troops bright red uniforms made them perfect targets for french sharpshooters and their indian allies.
two thirds of the soldiers were killed.
washington himself narrowly escaped death.
i had four bullets through my coat and two horses shot under me he wrote in a letter.
showing great courage washington led the survivors back to virginia.
there he was greeted as a hero.
the french and indian war raged for seven long years.
the turning point came in 1759 when british troops captured canada.
in 1763 great britain and france signed a peace treaty or agreement ending the war.
in this treaty france ceded or gave canada to great britain.
americans were thrilled with this victory.
great britain now controlled a vastly expanded american empire.
never before had the colonists felt so proud of being british.
and never before had the future of the colonies looked so bright.
is here george washington tips his hat to the british flag at fort duquesne.
the british captured the fort from the french in 1758 during the french and indian war.
it was rebuilt and called fort pitt.
the city of pittsburgh was later built here.
new york toward independence 89 tyranny the unjust use of government power.
a ruler who uses power in this way is called a tyrant.
5 3 early british actions in the colonies changes that were taking place in great britain soon clouded the colonists bright future.
a new king george iii had been crowned in 1760.
he was not regarded as a bright man.
one historian wrote that he was very stupid really stupid he was also known for being proud and stubborn.
he was determined to be a take charge kind of ruler especially in the colonies.
ihe people george iii chose to help him knew very little about conditions in north america.
before long they were taking actions that enraged the colonists.
the proclamation of 1763 the british government faced a number of problems after the french and indian war.
one was how to keep colonists and american indians from killing each other as settlers pushed westward.
simply draw a line down the crest of the appalachian mountains said george iii.
tell settlers to stay east of that line and indians to stay west of it.
this was what the king ordered in his proclamation of 1763.
to americans the kings order suggested tyranny or the unjust use of government power.
they argued that the lands east of the appalachians were already mostly settled.
the only place that farmers could the proclamation of 1763 prohibited available land was west of the mountains.
besides the proda settlers from moving west of the mation was too late.
settlers were already crossing the mountains.
appalachians.
king george ill hoped the british government ignored these arguments.
to keep peace this would prevent conflict between on the frontier it decided to expand the british army in america to colonists and american indians.

a a t i oceax idies s i h h c u r s vv the stamp act the british government had other problems besides keeping colonists and american indians from fighting each other.
one problem was how to pay off the large debt from the french and indian war.
the solution seemed obvious to prime minister george grenville the leader of the british government.
people in great britain were already paying taxes on everything from windows to salt.
in contrast americans were probably the most lightly taxed people in the british empire.
it was time said grenville for the colonists to pay their fair share of the cost of protecting them from indians.
in 1765 grenville proposed a new act or law called the stamp act.
this law required colonists to buy a stamp for every piece of paper they used.
newspapers had to be printed on stamped paper.
wills licenses and even playing cards had to have stamps.
once again the colonists sensed tyranny.
one newspaper the pennsylvania journal said that as soon as this shocking act was known it filled all british america from one end to the other with astonishment and grief it wasnt just the idea of higher taxes that upset the colonists.
they were willing to pay taxes passed by their own assemblies where their representatives could vote on them.
but the colonists had no representatives in parliament.
for this reason they argued parliament had no right to tax them.
they saw the stamp act as a violation of their rights as british subjects.
no taxation without representation they declared.
some colonists protested the stamp act by sending messages to parliament.
loyalists simply refused to buy stamps.
patriots however took more violent action.
mobs calling themselves sons of liberty attacked tax collectors homes.
protesters in connecticut even started to bury one tax collector alive.
only when he heard dirt being shoveled onto his coffin did the terrified tax collector agree to resign from his post.
after months of protest parliament repealed or canceled the stamp act.
americans greeted the news with great celebration.
church bells rang bands played and everyone hoped the troubles with great britain were over.
the stamp act required colonists to buy stamps like this one for all paper products.
the colonists reacted angrily to the act.
this illustration shows them hanging effigies or dummies of british officials.
the colonists protests forced parliamentto repeal the act.
repeal to take back or to cancel a law toward independence 91 boycott to refuse to buy one or more goods from a certain source.
an organized refusal by many people is also called a boycott.
the quartering act as anger over the stamp act began to fade americans noticed another law passed by parliament in 1765.
called the quartering act this law ordered colonial assemblies to provide british troops with quarters or housing.
the colonists were also told to furnish the soldiers with candles firing bedding cooking utensils salt vinegar and beer or cider of course providing for the soldiers cost money.
new jersey protested that the new law was as much an act for laying taxes on the colonists as the stamp act.
new yorkers asked why they should pay to keep troops in their colony.
after all they said the soldiers just took up space and did nothing.
in 1767 the new york assembly decided not to approve any funds for salt vinegar and liquor for the troops.
the british government reacted by refusing to let the assembly meet until it agreed to obey the quartering act.
once again tempers began to rise on both sides of the atlantic.
5 4 the townshend acts the next british leader to face the challenge of taxing the colonies was charles townshend.
he was known as champagne charlie because of his habit of making speeches in parliament after drinking champagne.
townshend believed that the colonists bad behavior made it even more important to retain an army in the british colonies.
once he was asked in parliament whether he would dare to make the colonists pay for that army.
stamping his foot townshend shouted i will i will townshend kept his promise.
in 1767 he persuaded parliament to pass the townshend acts.
the new laws placed a duty or tax on certain goods the colonies imported from great britain.
these goods included such popular items as glass paint paper and tea.
a boycott of british goods to many colonists the townshend duties were unacceptable.
once again colonists were determined not to pay taxes that their assemblies had not voted on.
a boston patriot named samuel adams led the opposition to the townshend acts.
adams was not an attractive man and he was a failure at business.
but he was gifted at stirring up protests through his speeches and writing.
the governor of massachusetts once complained every dip of his pen stung like a horned snake adams wrote a letter protesting the townshend acts that was sent to every colony.
the letter argued that the new duties violated the colonists rights as british citizens.
to protect those rights the colonies decided to boycott british goods.
this was a peaceful form of protest that even loyalists could support.
one by one all of the colonies agreed to support the boycott.
women were very important in making the boycott work since t ey did most of the shopping.
the virginia gazette wrote that one woman could do more for the good of her country than five hundred ter 5 i noisy sons of liberty with all their mobs and riots women found many ways to avoid buying british imports.
they sewed dresses out of homespun cloth brewed tea from pine needles and bought only american made goods.
in 1768 the british government sent soldiers to boston to enforce the townshend acts.
this engraving made by paul revere shows the troops landing.
repeal of the townshend acts meanwhile a new leader named lord north became head of the british government.
described by townshend as a great heavy booby looking man lord north embarrassed his supporters by taking naps in parliament.
but he was good with numbers and he could see that the townshend duties were a big money loser.
the duties didnt begin to make up for all the money british merchants were losing because of the boycott.
early in 1770 north persuaded parliament to repeal all of the townshend duties except for one the tax on tea.
some members of parliament argued that keeping the duty on tea was asking for more trouble.
but king george wasnt ready to give up on the idea of taxing americans.
i am clear that there must always be one tax to keep up the right the king said.
and as such i approve the tea duty 5 5 the boston massacre on the same day that parliament repealed most of the townshend duties a fight broke out between soldiers and colonists in boston.
when the dust cleared five bostonians were dead and ten were injured.
patriots called this incident the boston massacre.
a massacre is the killing of defenseless people.
what really happened was a small riot.
toward independence 93 trouble had been brewing in boston for months before the riot.
to the british boston patriots were the worst troublemakers in the colonies.
in 1768 the british government had sent four regiments of troops to keep order in boston.
bostonians resented the british soldiers.
they made fun of their red uniforms by calling them lobsterbacks samuel adams even taught his dog to nip at soldiers heels.
despite such insults the troops were forbidden to fire on citizens.
knowing this only made bostonians bolder in their attacks.
general thomas gage the commander of the british army in america wrote that the people were as lawless after the troops arrived as they were before paul revere s famous engraving of the boston massacre stirred up deep colonial resentment against great britain.
mob violence breaks out on march 5 1770 a noisy mob began throwing rocks and ice balls at troops guarding the boston customs house.
come on you rascals you bloody backs they shouted.
fire if you dare some patriot leaders tried to persuade the crowd to go home.
so did captain thomas preston the commander of the soldiers.
but their pleas had no effect.
as the mob pressed forward someone knocked a soldier to the ground.
the troops panicked and opened fire.
two bullets struck crispus attucks a black man at the front of the crowd.
he was the first to die but not the last.
the enraged crowd went home only after receiving a promise that the troops would be tried for murder.
massacre or self defense.
samuel adams saw this event as a perfect opportunity to whip up anti british feeling.
he called the riot a horrid massacre and had paul revere a local silversmith engrave a picture of it.
reveres engraving shows soldiers firing at peaceful unarmed citizens.
prints of reveres engraving were distributed throughout the colonies.
patriots saw the boston massacre as proof that the british should remove all of their troops chapter 5 from the colonies.
loyalists saw the tragedy as proof that troops were needed more than ever if only to control patriot hotheads.
one hero came out of this sad event.
he was a boston lawyer named john adams.
like his cousin samuel john adams was a patriot.
but he also believed that every person even the british soldiers had the right to a fair trial.
adams agreed to defend the soldiers even though he knew that his action would cost him friends and clients.
at the murder trial adams argued that the troops had acted in self defense.
the jury found six of the soldiers not guilty.
two of them were found guilty only of manslaughter or causing death without meaning to.
throughout his long life john adams remained proud of his defense of the british soldiers.
he said that upholding the law in this case was one of the best pieces of service i ever rendered to my country paul revere s engraving of five coffins showing the victims of the boston massacre appeared on flyers to remind colonists of british brutality.
5 6 the boston tea party despite the hopes of patriots like sam adams the boston massacre did not spark new protests against british rule.
instead the repeal of the townshend duties led to a period of calm.
true there was still a small duty on tea.
but the tax didnt seem to bother loyalists very much.
patriots knew they could always drink dutch tea that had been smuggled into the colonies without paying duties.
things did not stay peaceful however.
in 1773 a new law called the tea act prompted more protests.
one of them was the incident that became known as the boston tea party.
the tea act the tea act was lord norths attempt to rescue the british east india company.
this large trading company controlled all the trade between great britain and asia.
for years it had been a moneymaker for great britain.
but the american boycott of british tea hurt the company badly.
by 1773 the tea company was in danger of going broke unless it could sell off the 17 million pounds of tea that were sitting in its london warehouses.
the tea act lowered the cost of tea that was sold by the british east india company in the colonies.
as a result even taxed british tea became cheaper than smuggled dutch tea.
the tea act also gave the british east india company a monopoly or complete control over tea sales in the colonies.
from now on the only merchants who could sell the bargain priced tea were those chosen by the company.
lord north may have thought he could persuade americans to buy taxed tea by making it so cheap but colonists weren t fooled.
they saw the tea act as still another attempt to tax them without their consent.
toward independence 95 in addition many merchants were alarmed by the east india companys monopoly over the tea trade.
they wondered what the british government might try to control next.
would there be a monopoly on cloth.
nervous merchants wondered what would happen to their businesses if other goods were also restricted.
tea ships arrive when the british east india companys tea ships sailed into american ports angry protesters kept them from unloading their cargoes.
more than one ship turned back for england still filled with tea.
in boston however the royal governor ordered the british navy to block the exit from boston harbor.
he insisted that three tea ships would not leave until all their tea was unloaded.
on december 16 1773 the sons of liberty decided to unload the tea but not in the way the governor had in mind.
rlhat night about 50 men dressed as mohawk indians boarded the three ships.
one of them george hewes described what happened to protest the tax on tea patriots disguised as american indians threw 342 chests of tea overboard from three british ships.
colonists later called this the boston tea party.
we then were ordered by our commander to open the hatches and take out all the chests of tea and throw them overboard and we immediately proceeded to execute his orders first cutting and splitting the chests with our tomahawks.
in about three hours from the time we went on board we had thus broken and thrown overboard every tea chest to be found on the ship we were surrounded by british armed ships but no attempt was made to resist us.
6 chapter 5 about 90 000 pounds of tea were dumped into the sea that night.
nothing else on the ships was touched.
news of the boston tea party excited patriots throughout the colonies.
this is the most magnificent moment of all wrote john adams in his journal the next day.
this destruction of the tea is so bold so daring so firm it must have important consequences he was right.
5 7 the intolerable acts lord north was stunned by news of the boston tea party.
as he saw it he had tried to help the colonists by sending them cheap tea.
and what did they do.
they threw it in the sea.
this time they had gone too far.
king george agreed.
to him the issue was no longer about taxes.
it was about great britains control over the colonies.
we must master them totally he declared or leave them to themselves the king wasnt about to leave the colonies to themselves however.
great britains anger led parliament to pass a new series of laws in 1774.
these laws were so harsh that many colonists called them intolerable or unacceptable.
throughout the colonies they became known as the intolerable acts.
parliament punishes massachusetts the intolerable acts were designed to punish massachusetts for the boston tea party.
the first law closed boston harbor to all shipping until the ruined tea was paid for.
the second law placed the government of massachusetts firmly under british control.
colonists in massachusetts could not even hold a town meeting without the colonial governors permission.
the third law said that british soldiers who were accused of murder would be tried in england not in the colonies.
finally more troops were sent to boston to enforce the new laws.
a few british leaders worried that the intolerable acts might push the colonies into rebellion.
but george iii was sure they would force the colonists to give in to british authority.
the first of the intolerable acts punished massachusetts for the boston tea party.
it closed boston harbor to all shipping until the destroyed tea was paid for.
as a result sailors and dockworkers lost their jobs and stores closed for lack of goods to sell.
the colonies begin to unite in fact the intolerable acts did not force the colonists to give in.
boston patriots declared they would abandon their city to flames before paying a penny for the lost tea.
merchants in other cities showed their support by closing their shops.
many colonies sent food and money to boston so that its citizens would not starve.
toward independence 97 in virginia lawmakers drafted a resolution in support of massachusetts.
the virginians said that everyone s rights were at stake.
an attack made on one of our sister colonies they declared is an attack made on all british america.
the virginians also called for a congress or meeting of delegates from all the colonies.
the purpose of the congress would be to find a peaceful solution to the conflicts with great britain.
not all americans agreed with this plan.
in every colony there were loyalists who thought that bostonians had gone too far and should pay for the tea.
if they were forced to choose they would side with the king against sam adams and his sons of liberty.
in their view it was the misguided patriots who were causing all the trouble.
delegates from the colonies met in philadelphia atthe first continental congress in 1774.
patrick henry of virginia urged the colonists to unite as americans not as citizens of separate colonies.
the granger collection newyork the first continental congress in september 1774 some 50 leaders from 12 colonies met in philadelphia.
the meeting brought together delegates from most of the british colonies on the north american continent so it was called the first continental congress.
the delegates were used to thinking of themselves as citizens of their own colonies.
patrick henry a leader from virginia urged them to come together as one people.
i am not a virginian he declared but an american but only strong patriots like sam and john adams were ready to think of themselves this way.
many delegates were strong loyalists who still thought of themselves as british.
still others like george washington were somewhere in between.
only one thing united the delegates their love of liberty and hatred of tyranny.
in spite of their differences the delegates agreed to send a respectful message to king george.
the message urged the king to consider their complaints and to recognize their rights.
the delegates also called for a new boycott of british goods until parliament repealed the intolerable acts.
finally they agreed to meet again the following may if the boycott didnt work.
the colonies form militias in towns and cities throughout the colonies patriots appointed committees to enforce the boycott.
in case the boycott didnt work they also organized local militias.
in new england the volunteers called themselves minutemen because they could be ready to fight in 60 seconds.
across the colonies militias marched and drilled.
in new hampshire unknown persons stole 100 barrels of gunpowder and 16 cannons from a british fort.
similar thefts occurred in other colonies.
rather than forcing the colonies to give in the intolerable acts had brought the two sides to the brink of war.
chapter 5 5 8 lexington and concord king george had made many mistakes in his decisions about the colonies.
the first continental congress listed all these mistakes in its message to the king.
now he made another one.
rather than consider the colonists complaints king george refused even to answer their message.
the new england governments are in a state of rebellion he said.
blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent in boston general gage the kings commander of british troops in america got ready to deliver those blows.
this hand colored engraving by connecticut engraver amos doolittle shows the british firing upon the minutemen who are gathered at lexington this was the first battle in the war for independence from great britain.
the first blow at lexington in april 1775 a spy told general gage that the colonists were hiding a large supply of gunpowder and weapons in the nearby village of concord.
general gage decided to strike at once.
the general ordered 700 of his best troops to march to concord and seize the weapons.
to keep the colonists from moving the weapons the attack had to be a surprise.
so gage had his troops march the 20 miles to concord at night.
the colonists had their own spies.
when gages troops slipped out of boston on april 18 1775 patriots were watching their every move.
soon paul revere and others were galloping through the countryside warning colonists that the british soldiers were coming.
the news reached lexington a town on the road to concord in the early hours of april 19.
led by captain john parker a small band of minutemen gathered nervously in the chilly night air.
toward independence 99 at the north bridge in concord the minutemen fired upon british troops who had occupied the town.
surprised by the fury of the colonial attack the british fled in panic.
the amos doolittle engraving above shows the bridge at the time of the battle.
the photograph shows the bridge today.
at dawn the british troops reached the town green.
stand your ground ordered parker.
dont fire unless fired upon but if they mean to have a war let it begin here as the minuteman faced the british troops a shot rang out from where no one knew for certain.
without orders the soldiers rushed forward shooting wildly.
a few minutemen managed to return fire.
when the firing stopped eight colonists lay dead or dying.
another ten were limping to safety with painful wounds.
the british troops gave three cheers for victory and marched on to concord.
the second blow at concord by breakfast time the british were in concord searching for gunpowder and weapons.
but the colonists had hidden them.
in frustration the soldiers piled up a few wooden tools tents and gun carriages and set them on fire.
on a ridge outside the city militiamen from the surrounding countryside watched the smoke rise.
will you let them burn the town down shouted one man.
captain isaac davis replied i havent a man thats afraid to go davis marched his volunteers down the hill.
as they approached concords north bridge the british troops opened fire.
davis fell dead a bullet through his heart.
the british expected the americans to break and run.
to their surprise the minutemen stood their ground and fired back.
two minutes later it was the redcoats who were running away in panic.
the retreat back to boston was a nightmare for the british.
more than 4 000 armed and angry minutemen lined their route shooting at every redcoat they saw.
by the end of the day 74 british soldiers were dead and another 200 were wounded or missing.
the colonists counted their own losses as 49 dead and 41 wounded.
a british officer chapter 5.
described what it was like to face the colonists fury that day.
whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob the officer said will find himself much mistaken indeed since the french and indian war the british had been mistaken about the colonists again and again.
their biggest mistake was in thinking that ordinary people farmers merchants workers and housewives would not fight for the rights that they held dear.
at lexington and concord americans proved they were not only willing to fight for their rights.
they were even willing to die for them.
chapter summary in this chapter you read about tensions between the colonies and great britain in the mid 1700s.
before 1763 during the french and indian war 1754 1763 great britain and france fought for territory and power.
when the war ended france gave up canada to great britain.
great britain now had a much larger american empire to control.
early british actions in the colonies the war left great britain with huge debts.
to raise money parliament passed the stamp act in 1765.
colonists protested the stamp act because it was passed without colonial representation.
colonists also protested the quartering act which required them to house british troops at the colonies expense.
the townshend acts and the boston massacre the townshend acts imposed more taxes on the colonies which divided many colonists into opposing camps.
loyalists urged obedience to great britain but patriots resisted taxation without representation through protests boycotts and riots.
tensions in boston erupted into violence in 1770 when british troops fired into a crowd of colonists in what become known as the boston massacre.
the boston tea party and the intolerable acts when patriots protested a new tax on tea by throwing tea into boston harbor in 1773 great britain responded by passing the intolerable acts to force the colonies to give in to british authority.
patriots responded by forming the first continental congress and organizing colonial militias.
lexington and concord fighting between patriots and british troops at lexington and concord in 1775 showed that colonists would not only fight for their rights but were willing to die for them.
this stone marks the line where minutemen faced british troops at the battle of lexington.
the stone is inscribed with the words of john parker captain of the lexington minutemen.
toward independence 101 reading further poet henry wadsworth longfellow i love the story of paul revere whether he rode or not so said president warren g harding in 1923.
like most americans at that time harding probably learned about revere as a schoolboy when he read a poem by henry wadsworth longfellow.
later when a skeptic claimed the story of revere s ride never happened harding sprang to the poet s defense.
but was revere the hero longfellow made him out to be.
in 1860 the young nation whose fight for freedom began at lexington and concord was in danger of falling apart.
war clouds gathered as americans debated the issues of slavery and states rights.
the south which had grown prosperous with slave labor vigorously defended its way of life.
the north which had grown even more prosperous without slave labor condemned slavery as morally wrong.
americans had never been so divided or so close to civil war.
henry wadsworth longfellow was then the nations most popular poet.
he was also a northerner who opposed slavery.
as he watched the nation move toward war longfellow began thinking about a new poem.
he wanted it to be a call to arms for all who loved liberty in such a time of peril.
one day in april 1860 longfellow took a walk with a friend in boston.
his companion told him a story that took place on another april day some 85 years earlier.
it was the tale of a midnight ride made by a silversmith named paul revere to alert the countryside to coming danger.
longfellow was inspired.
like paul revere s ride the poem he planned would be a cry of alarm to awaken a sleeping nation.
longfellow set to work at once.
his finished work titled paul revere s ride was published in 1861.
over the next century generations of schoolchildren would read and memorize its stirring lines.
as you read the excerpt that follows can you see why the poem captured americans imaginations.
paul revere s ride tells the story of revere s mission to warn the minutemen.
this minuteman statue stands atthe site of the battle in concord massachusetts.
an excerpt from listen my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of paul revere on the eighteenth of april in seventy five hardly a man is now alive who remembers that famous day and year.
he said to his friend if the british march by land or sea from the town to night hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light one if by land and two if by sea and i on the opposite shore will be ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm for the country folk to be up and to arm then he said good night and with muffled oar silently rowed to the charlestown shore and lo.
as he looks on the belfrys height a glimmer and then a gleam of light.
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns but lingers and gazes till full on his sight a second lamp in the belfry burns.
a hurry of hoofs in a village street a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet that was all.
and yet through the gloom and the light the fate of a nation was riding that night and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight kindled the land into flame with its heat.
it was one by the village clock when he galloped into lexington.
he saw the gilded weathercock swim in the moonlight as he passed and the meeting house windows blank and bare gaze at him with a spectral glare as if they already stood aghast at the bloody work they would look upon.
this sheet music for a song inspired by longfellow s poem was written in the early 1900s.
it was two by the village clock when he came to the bridge in concord town.
he heard the bleating of the flock and one was safe and asleep in his bed who at the bridge would be first to fall who that day would be lying dead pierced by a british musket ball.
you know the rest.
in the books you have read how the british regulars fired and fled how the farmers gave them ball for ball from behind each fence and farm yard wall chasing the red coats down the lane.
so through the night rode paul revere and so through the night went his cry of alarm to every middlesex village and farm a cry of defiance and not of fear a voice in the darkness a knock at the door and a word that shall echo forevermore.
for borne on the night wind of the past through all our history to the last in the hour of darkness and peril and need the people will waken and listen to hear the hurrying hoof beats of that steed and the midnight message of paul revere.
toward independence 103 over the years american artists were drawn to the legend of paul revere.
most works like this 19th century painting show revere as a lone rider.
longfellow creates a legend the lone hero longfellow had set out to create a dramatic tale that would make patriotic hearts beat faster.
in the process he transformed paul revere from a local folk hero into a national legend.
even today millions of americans know the opening lines of longfellows poem.
listen my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of paul revere when we think of the events that launched the american revolution we can picture them clearly.
revere asks a friend to send a signal from bostons old north church when the british troops quartered there begin to move out.
one if by land and two if by sea and i on the opposite shore will be the signal comes and revere gallops into the night waking the countryside with the news that the british are coming.
so through the night rode paul revere and so through the night went his cry of alarm to every middlesex village and farm a cry of defiance and not of fear a voice in the darkness a knock at the door and a word that shall echo forevermore.
alerted by our lone hero the colonists homes and liberties.
rise up to defend their you know the rest.
in the books you have read how the british regulars fired and fled how the farmers gave them ball for ball from behind each fence and farm yard wall.
the rest as they say is history.
104 chapter 5 skeptics raise doubts did revere really ride.
historians were quick to point out many inaccuracies in longfellows telling.
for example the poet omitted the fact that during his ride revere was captured by british troops.
longfellow also left out the names of other messengers who rode that night such as william dawes and samuel prescott.
as doubts about the poem multiplied skeptics began to question the entire story.
some said reveres ride didnt happen at all.
or if it did revere was captured before he could warn many patriots.
such talk annoyed president harding.
somebody made the ride and stirred the minutemen in the colonies to fight the battle of lexington he said.
i love the story of paul revere whether he rode or not as time passed some doubters threw cold water on the idea that revere was a hero.
one skeptic said that revere set out with two other guys for money when the three were arrested he turned stool pigeon and betrayed his two companions is this true.
was revere a traitor to his cause.
the granger collection newyork historians weigh in the real meaning of revere s ride modern historians find no evidence that revere was paid to ride or that he became an informer when he was captured.
but they also remind us that revere was not the only hero of that momentous night within hours of his ride 122 colonists had lost their lives and many more lay wounded.
as one historian writes reveres ride was not the major event that day nor was reveres warning so critical in triggering the bloodbath.
patriotic farmers had been preparing to oppose the british for the better part of a year his ride to lexington took on meaning only because numerous other political activists had like revere dedicated themselves to the cause.
ray raphael founding myths stories that hide our patriotic past 2004 paul revere was well known as a silversmith and a patriot.
when revere satforthis painting by john singleton copley he chose to hold one of the teapots he had designed.
just five years later he was one of the sons of liberty atthe boston tea party.
the real meaning of reveres ride is what it tells us about these unsung heroes.
on hearing that the british soldiers were coming those patriotic farmers had a choice.
they could remain safe in their beds or rise up to defend their rights.
looking at their response historian david hackett fischer writes the history of a free people is the history of hard choices.
in that respect when paul revere alarmed the massachusetts countryside he was carrying a message for us toward independence 105.
chapter 8 creating the constitution what compromises emerged from the constitutional convention.
8 1 introduction when the american war for independence ended no one was happier than a serious virginia patriot named james madison.
and no one was more worried about the future of the united states.
while serving in congress during the war madison had tried and failed to get the states to work easily together.
he doubted that things would improve now that the war was over.
after declaring independence in 1776 congress had tried to unite the states under one national government.
this proved to be a difficult task.
most members of congress were nervous about creating a strong central government.
they feared that such a government would trample the very rights they were fighting to preserve.
their solution was a plan of government known as the articles of confederation.
the articles created a firm league of friendship in which each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence this league of friendship was a loose union in which the 13 states cooperated for common purposes.
it was run by congress in which each state had one vote.
on paper the articles of confederation gave congress several important powers.
it could declare war raise an army and a navy print money and set up a postal system.
in reality however these powers were limited by the inability of congress to impose taxes.
instead congress had to ask the states for funds to do anything.
all too often the states ignored congresss humble requests the result said madison was that the articles were no more effective at binding the states into a nation than a rope of sand.
in this chapter you will read about the new nation s shaky start under the articles of confederation.
you will also learn how madison and other leaders met in 1787 to revise the articles and ended up compromising to form a more perfect union.
the granger collection newyork because of his important role in the creation of the document that would give the new nation a plan for government james madison is known as the father of the constitution.
the constitution was signed in philadelphia on september 17 1787.
creating the constitution 145 articles of confederation the first written plan of government for the united states.
a confederation is an association of states that cooperate for a common purpose.
northwest territory a region of the united states bounded by the ohio and mississippi rivers and the great lakes.
the region was given to the united states by the treaty of paris in 1783.
northwest ordinance a law passed by congress in 1787 that specified how western lands would be governed the land ordinance of 1785 organized the northwest territory into townships the northwest ordinance of 1787 set rules for how western lands would be governed.
within a half century of its passage enough people had settled in the northwest territory to create five new states.
8 2 early quarrels and accomplishments even before the american revolution was over the states began quarreling among themselves.
many of their quarrels were about taxes on goods that crossed state borders.
new york for example taxed firewood from connecticut and cabbages from new jersey.
the states also disagreed over boundaries.
the inability of congress to end such disagreements was one of the key weaknesses of the articles of confederation.
developing western lands congress did get the states to agree on one important issue how to develop the western lands acquired in the treaty of paris.
at that time there was no orderly way to divide up and sell these lands.
settlers walked into the wilderness and claimed the land they liked.
disputes over who owned what clogged the courts.
to end this confusion congress passed the land ordinance of 1785.
under this law western lands were divided into six mile squares called townships.
each township was then divided into 36 sections of 640 acres each.
one section of each township was set aside to support the townships public schools.
the other sections were to be sold to settlers.
surveyors proceeded to lay out townships in the ohio valley then known as the northwest territory.
by 1787 the government was ready to sell sections to settlers.
this raised the question of how these areas should be governed.
were they to be u s colonies or new states.
the northwest ordinance congress answered this question in the northwest ordinance of 1787.
this law divided the northwest territory into smaller territories each governed by a territorial governor.
as soon as a territory had 5 000 free adult males it could elect its own legislature or lawmaking body.
when the population reached 60 000 a territory could apply to congress to become a state.
the northwest territory and the land ordinance survey system 1785 each township is 6 miles by 6 miles and contains 36 sections.

a xi ociai 0 200 400 kilometers albers equal area projection j 46 chapter 8 the northwest ordinance included a list of rights that gave settlers the same privileges as other citizens except for one.
slavery was banned in the northwest territory.
this system of settlement served the nation well.
over time the united states would continue to establish territories as it spread to the shores of the pacific ocean and beyond.
8 3 shays s rebellion and the need for change under the articles of confederation the new nation had serious money problems.
the paper money printed by congress during the war was worthless.
congress had the power to make coins that would not lose their value.
but it lacked gold or silver to mint into coins.
the states reacted to the money shortage by printing their own paper currency.
before long bills of different sizes and colors were distributed from state to state.
no one knew what any of these currencies was worth but most agreed they were not worth much.
massachusetts farmers rebel the money shortage was particularly hard on farmers who could not earn enough to pay their debts and taxes.
in massachusetts judges ordered farmers to sell their land and livestock to pay off their debts.
led by daniel shays a hero of the battle of bunker hill massachusetts farmers rebelled.
in 1786 shays and his followers closed down courthouses to keep judges from taking their farms.
then they marched on the national arsenal at springfield to seize the weapons stored there.
having disbanded the continental army congress was unable to stop them.
the massachusetts government ended shayss rebellion in early 1787 by sending militia troops to springfield to restore order.
to many americans however the uprising was a disturbing sign that the nation they had fought so hard to create was falling apart.
no respect is paid to the federal national authority james madison wrote to a friend.
it is not possible that a government can last long under these circumstances daniel shays atthe top right and his followers closed down courthouses in massachusetts to prevent judges from seizing farmers land when the farmers could not pay their debts.
a call for a convention shayss rebellion shocked congress into calling for a convention to consider the situation of the united states each state was invited to send delegates to philadelphia in may 1787 for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation madison was ready.
for the past year he had devoted himself to the study of governments both ancient and modern.
the lesson of the past was always the same.
a nation that was made up of many groups needed a strong central government or it would soon be torn apart by quarrels.
the question was would americans heed this lesson.
creating the constitution 147 constitutional convention a meeting held in philadelphia in 1787 at which delegates from the states wrote the u s constitution the delegates to the constitutional convention met on may 25 1787 in the same hall where the declaration of independence was signed.
today the building is called independence hall.
8 4 opening the constitutional convention philadelphia was already hot and humid when delegates began drifting into the city.
on may 25 1787 the constitutional convention met for the first time in the east room of the pennsylvania state house now known as independence hall.
the declaration of independence had been debated in this very room just 11 years earlier.
the delegates would meet in the east room all summer.
on some days temperatures rose well into the nineties.
the delegates first action was to elect george washington president of the convention.
no man was more admired and respected than the former commander in chief of the continental army.
when the war ended washington could have used his power and popularity to make himself a king.
instead he went home to virginia to resume his life as an ordinary citizen.
but despite his reluctance to return to public life washington would play a key role by presiding over the convention and lending it his prestige.
the delegates fifty five delegates from 12 states attended the constitutional convention.
rhode island which prided itself as the home of the otherwise minded and feared a strong national government boycotted the meeting.
some leaders of the revolution were missing.
john adams and thomas jefferson were representing the united states in great britain and france respectively.
others who did not attend included sam adams john hancock and patrick henry.
they feared that a strong national government would endanger the rights of states.
as a group the delegates were in the words of a modern historian the well bred the well fed the well read and the well wed their average age was 42.
at 81 benjamin franklin of pennsylvania was the oldest.
he arrived at the convention each day in a sedan chair carried by four good natured prisoners from a nearby jail.
most of the delegates brought extensive political experience to the meeting.
more than two thirds were lawyers.
most had served in their state legislatures or held a state office.
thomas jefferson was so impressed by the ability and experience of these men that he called the convention an assembly of demi gods the father of the constitution the best prepared of the delegates was james madison of virginia.
one delegate wrote of madison in the management of every great question he evidently took the lead in the convention indeed madisons influence was so great that later he would be called the father of the constitution madison addressed the convention numerous times.
when he was not speaking he took notes.
sitting near the front of the room so that he could hear everything that was said madison wrote down nearly every word.
all together his notes covered more than 600 printed pages.
from this remarkable record we know what went on inside the convention day by day.
benjamin franklin the oldest delegate to the constitutional convention had doubts about the drafting of the constitution.
however he said the older i grow the more apt i am to doubt my own judgment and pay more respectto the judgment of others.
the rule of secrecy at the time however no one outside the convention knew what was happening.
after choosing a president the delegates voted on rules for the convention.
the most important of these was the rule of secrecy.
the delegates wanted to feel free to speak their minds without causing alarm or opposition among the general public.
they agreed to keep secret whatever was said in the meeting room until their work was done.
one day washington was handed some notes that had been dropped in the hall outside the east room.
washington pocketed the paper until the end of debate the next day.
then in his sternest voice he lectured the delegates on the importance of secrecy.
i know not whose paper it is washington said as he flung the notes on his desk.
but there it is let him who owns it take it the notes were never claimed.
instead they lay on washingtons desk for days.
like washington the delegates took the rule of secrecy seriously.
during that long summer not a single word about the convention debates appeared in any newspaper.
shared beliefs and clashing views once the convention was organized the delegates got down to business.
as a group the delegates had much in common.
but they also had very different views on many issues facing the new nation.
creating the constitution 149 enlightenment the age of reason in 17th and 18th century europe.
enlightenment thinkers emphasized using rational thought to discover truths about nature and society.
republic a country governed by elected representatives constitution a written plan that provides the basic framework of a government enlightenment the age of reason in 17th and 18th century europe.
enlightenment thinkers emphasized using rational thought to discover truths about nature and society.
republic a country governed by elected representatives constitution a written plan that provides the basic framework of a government to be sure all the delegates were committed to the ideals of the declaration of independence.
the basic purpose of government they believed was to protect the rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and they agreed in the words of the declaration that the just powers of governments came from the consent of the governed in part these beliefs reflected the ideas of enlightenment thinkers like englands john locke.
human institutions these liberal thinkers had argued should be based on laws of nature.
among these laws were the rights to liberty and equality.
the best way to protect these rights the delegates agreed was through some form of republic.
from new englands town meetings to lawmaking bodies like the virginia house of burgesses americans had a long tradition of participating in their own government.
after the american revolution all the states had adopted constitutions that embraced republican ideals.
despite many differences in details every state had some form of representative government.
states had also expanded the rights to vote and to hold office.
the state constitutions helped to shape the delegates thinking.
despite the delegates broad agreement on a government of the people many questions were left unanswered.
for example who exactly should have a say in a truly representative government.
even in liberal pennsylvania only free white males could vote.
some states allowed only wealthier citizens to vote or hold office.
women could not vote in any state except new jersey.
new jersey women would lose the right to vote in 1807.
perhaps the most troubling question of all was how powerful the national government should be.
many delegates wanted to keep government close to the people by preserving the rights of the states.
they feared that a strong national government would threaten individual liberty.
others including madison argued just the opposite.
look at what has happened under the articles of confederation they said referring to events like shayss rebellion.
if the central government is too weak it cannot do its job of protecting liberty and property.
as they met behind closed doors the delegates wrestled with these and other issues.
tempers often flared.
several times it seemed the convention might collapse in failure.
but in the end the delegates found ways to save the convention and the nation.
50 chapt er 8 delegates with opposing views were pennsylvania s james wilson left and new jersey s william paterson right.
wilson one of the most vocal delegates at the convention argued for a strong national government.
paterson tried to protect the rights of the states.
many delegates of small states shared his fear of being swallowed up by the larger states.
delegates with opposing views were pennsylvania s james wilson left and new jersey s william paterson right.
wilson one of the most vocal delegates atthe convention argued for a strong national government.
paterson tried to protectthe rights of the states.
many delegates of small states shared his fear of being swallowed up by the larger states.
8 5 issue how should states be represented in the new government.
when the convention began most delegates believed that their task was to revise the articles of confederation.
to their surprise the virginia delegation presented them with a completely new plan of government.
after a lengthy debate the delegates made a bold move.
they agreed to throw out the articles of confederation and write a new constitution.
while the delegates later known as the framers agreed to design a new framework of government they were divided on a key issue.
where should the governments power to rule come from.
from the states.
or from the people.
under the articles of confederation the answer was the states.
james madisons answer was that the governments power should come directly from the people.
populations of u s states 1790 population the virginia plan drafted by james madison and proposed by edmund randolph the virginia plan called for a strong national government with three branches or parts.
a legislative branch would make laws.
an executive branch would carry out or execute the laws.
a judicial branch or system of courts would apply and inter pret the laws.
under the virginia plan congress was to be made up of two houses the house of representatives and the senate.
the number of lawmakers that a state could send to congress depended on the states population.
states with large populations would have more representatives than smaller states would have.
delegates from virginia pennsylvania and other large states liked the virginia plan.
having the new government represent people not states would give them more representatives and more power in both houses of congress.
source u s census bureau the new jersey plan not surprisingly delegates from the small states disliked the virginia plan.
just as the convention was about to vote on it william paterson of new jersey introduced a rival proposal.
like the virginia plan the new jersey plan called for a government with three branches.
however the legislative branch would have just one house not two.
each state would have an equal vote in congress no matter how big or small.
this plan paterson argued would keep the small states from being swallowed up by their more populous neighbors.
a major issue confronting the constitutional convention was whether to give each state the same number of representatives or to base representation on population.
based on this graph which states do you think would want equal representation for each state.
creating the constitution 151 great compromise the plan of government adopted at the constitutional convention that established a two house congress.
in the house of representatives representation from each state is based on state population.
in the senate each state is represented by two senators.
8 6 resolution the great compromise the new jersey plan was warmly received by delegates from small states.
the majority of delegates however saw william patersons plan as offering little improvement over the articles of confederation and rejected it.
but they could not agree on what should replace it.
tempers rise the debate over representation in congress continued into july with tempers rising day by day.
to most delegates from large states representation based on population seemed both logical and fair.
can we forget for whom we are forming a government asked james wilson of pennsylvania.
is it for men or for the imagi nary beings called states to wilson the answer was obvious.
but his logic could not overcome the fears of small state delegates.
one hot saturday afternoon gunning bedford of delaware tore into the delegates from large states.
they insist he said they will never hurt or injure the lesser states his reply to his own concern was straightforward.
i do not gentlemen trust you if the large states continued in their efforts to crush the smaller states bedford warned the small ones will find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith who will take them by the hand and do them justice rufus king of massachusetts was shocked at this reference to foreign powers.
he said that he was grieved that such a thought had entered his heart still every delegate knew that great britain france and spain were just waiting for the united states to fall apart so they could pick up the pieces.
a compromise is reached finally a com promise was proposed based on a plan put forward earlier by roger sherman of connecticut.
the compromise plan kept a two house congress.
the first house the house of representatives would represent the people.
in this house the number of representatives from each state would be based on the state s population.
the second house the senate would represent the states.
each state would have two senators to be elected by their state legislatures.
the vote was very close but the compromise plan was approved.
this plan saved the convention and became known as the great compromise.
2 chapter 8 roger sherman a signer of the declaration of independence helped construct the great compromise that called for a congress with two houses.
total populations of southern states 1790 georgia maryland north carolina south carolina virginia 0 100 000 200 000 300 000 400 000 500 000 600 000 700 000 800 000 population how do you think delegates from each of the states shown in this graph would want slaves to be counted.
would they want the slave population to be considered when determining representation in congress or would they want slaves to be counted as property that could be taxed.
source u s census bureau 8 7 issue how should slaves be counted.
the great compromise kept the framers working together.
but having agreed to base representation in one house of congress on state population they faced a new and difficult question.
as gouverneur morris of pennsylvania put it upon what principle shall slaves be computed in the representation people or property.
by the time of the convention nine tenths of the slaves in the united states lived in the south.
like everyone else southerners wanted as many representatives in the house as possible.
they argued that slaves should be counted the same as any other people in determining representation.
delegates from the north challenged this idea.
were slaves to be considered people with a right to be represented in congress.
or were they property.
blacks are property and are used to the southward as horses and cattle to the northward argued elbridge gerry of massachusetts.
most northern delegates agreed.
slaves should be counted only as property that could be taxed like any other property.
if slaves were to be counted as people in determining representation in congress said morris then make them citizens and let them vote new thinking on slavery this argument signaled a growing division among white americans.
the declaration of independence and the american revolution forced many whites to reexamine their views on slavery.
some became active in trying to end what they now saw as a great evil.
benjamin franklin for example became president of an antislavery society in 1787.
in the north this new thinking led one state after another to pass laws ending slavery.
although many southerners were uneasy about slavery they were not yet ready to abolish it.
the souths economy was still very dependent on the labor of enslaved african americans.
but some southern states did pass laws making it easier for owners to free their slaves.
creating the constitution 153 three fifths compromise an agreement made at the constitutional convention stating that enslaved persons would be counted as three fifths of a person when determining a states population for representation in the house of representatives this sketch shows a slave auction in virginia in the 1850s.
southern delegates to the convention were afraid that if congress outlawed the slave trade the south would suffer economically.
8 8 resolution the three fifths compromise after a bitter debate madison proposed a compromise.
count each slave as three fifths of a person he suggested when determining a states population for representation in the house of representatives.
the delegates approved this idea which became known as the three fifths compromise because it seemed the only way to keep the convention moving forward.
another slavery issue a dispute over trade raised another issue about slavery.
to help business in the north northern delegates favored giving congress broad power to control trade between the states and other countries.
this proposal made southern delegates nervous.
they worried that congress might try to tax southern export crops such as rice and tobacco.
southerners also worried that congress would use its power over trade to outlaw the slave trade the importing of slaves from africa.
southerners had reason to be fearful.
by 1787 several states had outlawed the slave trade within their boundaries.
a majority of the conventions delegates favored ending the slave trade completely.
south carolina and georgia however objected that their economies would collapse without a constant supply of new slaves.
neither state would agree to any constitution that threatened to end the slave trade.
more compromises on slavery again the delegates settled on a compromise.
congress would have the power to control trade but with two limitations.
first congress could not place any tax on exports to other countries.
second congress could not interfere with the slave trade for 20 years or until 1808.
to satisfy southerners the delegates also agreed to a provision known as the fugitive slave clause.
this clause said that escaped slaves had to be returned to their owners even if they were caught in a free state.
without such compromises the states might never have come together in a single union.
still the compromises only postponed the day when americans would have to resolve the terrible contradiction between slavery and the ideals of liberty and equality.
meanwhile generations of african americans would spend their lives in bondage.
l54 chapt er 8 8 9 issue how should the chief executive be elected.
another major question facing the delegates concerned who would head the new government s executive branch.
early in the convention charles pinckney urged the creation of a vigorous executive james wilson followed with a proposal that a single person serve as the chief executive.
a sudden silence fell over the convention.
a single executive.
the very idea brought to mind unhappy memories of king george iii.
wilson broke the silence by explaining that good government depends on clear timely and responsible leadership.
such leadership he said is most likely to be found in a single person.
one executive or three.
edmund randolph of virginia disliked this proposal.
he preferred a three member executive drawn from different parts of the country.
three people he argued could lead the country better than one.
benjamin franklin opposed a single executive for different reasons.
the first man put at the helm will be a good one said franklin thinking of george washington.
nobody knows what sort may come afterwards the next chief executive he warned might be overly ambitious or too fond of war in spite of these objections the framers agreed to a single executive to be called the president.
to keep this leader from becoming too king like they limited the presidents term to four years.
a vice president was also to be elected to fill that term if the president died in office.
choosing the chief executive equally troubling was the issue of how to choose the chief executive.
some delegates wanted congress to appoint the president.
gouverneur morris objected.
the president must not be made the flunky of the congress he argued.
it must not be able to say to him you owe your appointment to us several delegates thought that the people should elect the president.
madison however argued that voters would naturally vote for someone from their own state.
as a result this method would not be fair to candidates from small states.
still others suggested that the president be elected by a specially chosen group of electors from each state.
such a group they felt would be able to look beyond state interests to make a wise choice for the entire country.
many delegates felt that ordinary citizens such as those pictured here were not suited to electthe president.
roger sherman stated the people should have as little to do as may be about the government.
they want information and are constantly liable to be misled.
creating the constitution 155 electoral college the group established by the constitution to elect the president and vice president.
voters in each state choose their electors.
this is a copy of the electoral college vote forthe election of 1789.
atthat time which states had the most electoral votes.
8 10 resolution the electoral college after some 60 votes on the issue of how to elect the president the framers reached another compromise.
neither congress nor the people they decided should choose the president and vice president.
instead a special body called the electoral college would elect the governments leaders.
the electoral college system the electoral college is made up of electors who cast votes to elect the president and vice president every four years.
each state has as many electors in the electoral college as the number of senators and representatives it sends to congress.
the votes cast by electors are called electoral votes.
the delegates left the method of choosing electors up to each state.
before 1820 state legislatures chose electors in most states.
today the people choose their states electors when they vote in presidential elections.
the electors then cast their ballots for president and vice president on a date chosen by congress.
originally the electors voted for two candidates without saying which one they preferred for president or vice president.
the candidate receiving the most votes became president.
the runner up became vice president.
this system caused great confusion in the election of 1800 and was later changed.
p t r ff i.
v 4zr zz political parties and elections the electoral college system seems very odd to most americans today.
in our age of instant communication it is hard to appreciate the framers concern that voters would not know enough about candidates outside their own state to choose a president wisely.
the delegates could not have predicted how quickly communications would improve in the united states.
nor could they foresee the rise of national political parties.
within a few years of the convention political parties were nominating candidates for president and educating voters in every state about those candidates.
the electoral college system still affects presidential elections today.
in most states the candidate who gets the most votes even if less than a majority wins all of that states electoral votes.
as a result a candidate can win a majority in the electoral college without necessarily winning a majority of the votes cast across the country.
in the presidential election of 2000 george w bush won the presidency over a1 gore by getting the most electoral college votes even though gore received more votes than bush in the popular election.
56 chapt er 8 only 39 of the original 55 delegates signed the constitution on september 17 1787.
thirteen delegates had returned home before the conclusion of the convention and three others refused to sign.
8 11 the convention ends by the end of summer the hard work of designing the constitution was finished.
but the new plan still had to be approved by the states.
approving the constitution the first question before the framers was how many states would have to ratify or approve the constitution before it could go into effect.
should ratification require approval by all 13 states.
by a majority of 7 states.
the framers compromised on 9 states.
the second question was who should ratify the constitution the people or the state legislatures.
ratification by state legislatures would be faster and easier.
james madison however argued strongly that the people were the fountain of all power and should decide.
the majority of delegates agreed.
after the delegates signed the constitution the document was later ratified at special conventions by delegates elected by the people in each state.
however ratification did not come without difficulty.
signing the constitution on september 17 1787 the delegates declared the constitution complete.
as this last meeting began franklin shared his final thoughts which would be printed in more than 50 newspapers.
i confess that i do not entirely approve of this constitution franklin began.
then he pointed out that no convention could produce a perfect plan.
it therefore astonishes me franklin continued to find this system approaching so near to perfection and i think it will astonish our enemies franklin added that he approved the final plan because i expect no better and because i am not sure that it is not the best he urged every member of the convention to put his name to this instrument not everyone was won over by franklin s words.
thirteen delegates left the convention before it ended and so did not sign the constitution.
ratify to formally approve a plan or an agreement.
the process of approval is called ratification.
creating the constitution 157 the federalist papers a series of essays written by james madison alexander hamilton and john jay in support of the ratification of the constitution by the states three other delegates edmund randolph and george mason both of virginia and elbridge gerry of massachusetts also did not sign.
mason believed it gave too much power to the national government.
gerry refused to sign because he believed the new plan did not protect the rights of the people.
when the signing was over franklin confessed that he had often looked at the sun carved on the back of george washingtons chair and wondered whether it was about to rise or set.
but now he said i have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun a new day was dawning for the united states.
8 12 the constitution goes to the states newspapers in every state printed the constitution as soon as they could get it.
what readers found was a plan that would create a federal system of government in which a strong national government shared power with the states.
before long the entire country was debating the same issues that had kept the convention in session for four long months.
the constitution had to be approved by nine states.

liic stsparetn god j the federalists supporters of the constitution called themselves federalists.
the federalists argued that the constitution would create a national government that was strong enough to unite the quarreling states into a single republic.
james madison alexander hamilton and john jay led the federalist campaign for ratification.
in a series of newspaper essays they recalled the weaknesses of the government under the articles of confederation.
they showed how the constitution would remedy those weaknesses by creating a stronger more effective union of the states.
the federalist leaders also addressed the fears of many americans that a strong government would threaten their freedom or take away their rights.
the powers given to the government they pointed out were strictly limited.
in addition those powers were divided among three branches so that no one branch could become too powerful.
the influential articles written by madison hamilton and jay were later collected and published as the federalist papers.
the anti federalists opponents of the constitution were known as anti federalists.
they found much to dislike about the new plan.
congress they feared would burden the country with taxes.
they claimed the president had power enough to rule like a king.
the judicial branch they said would overpower state courts.
the anti federalists also complained about what was missing from the plan.
their main complaint was that the plan listed the powers of the government but not the rights of the people.
most of all the anti federalists feared change.
the idea of giving up any state power to form a stronger union made them uneasy.
after listening to the arguments madison wrote that the question facing the nation was whether the union shall or shall not be continued.
there is in my opinion no middle ground to be taken in this chapter you read about the constitutional convention the historic meeting that replaced the articles of confederation with a new plan of government.
early quarrels and accomplishments under the articles of confederation congress did not have the power to solve disagreements among states over such issues as taxes.
congress passed laws on how to settle the northwest territory.
shayss rebellion shayss rebellion showed that under the articles of confederation the government was too weak to keep order.
the great compromise in 1787 delegates met at the constitutional convention and agreed to revise the articles.
the great compromise established how states were to be represented in the legislative branch of government.
the three fifths compromise the three fifths compromise settled the question of how slaves were to be counted in determining a states population.
the electoral college a third compromise created a single chief executive to be chosen by the electoral college.
the constitution delegates signed the constitution in september 1787.
they agreed that 9 of the 13 states had to ratify the constitution before it could go into effect.
during the convention benjamin franklin wondered whetherthe sun decorating george washington s chair was rising or setting.
atthe conclusion of the convention franklin optimistically concluded it was a rising sun.
58 chapter 8 creating the constitution 159 reading further the scholarly james madison finished college in two years and then studied law.
by the time he arrived atthe constitutional convention he was experienced in state and national politics.
james madison and the long hot summer of 1787 james madison is often called the father of the constitution.
although many people had a hand in shaping the constitution most scholars agree that madison was the main driving force behind the document s creation.
it was a process that took more than 100 days of complex negotiation and compromise.
even so it did not turn out quite as madison had wanted.
in the first week of may 1787 james madison stood alone in the east room of the pennsylvania state house.
within a few weeks many of the nations political leaders would gather there.
although few of them knew it at the time their task would be to create a new plan of government for the united states.
madison knew it though and he wanted to be ready.
madison had thought long and hard about the great challenges facing the nation.
under the articles of confederation the united states was floundering.
madison believed that a stronger national government was needed to keep the country on course.
other leaders also agreed on the need for reform.
however many of them had fears of a strong central government.
madison would have to work hard to change those ideas.
madison had arrived early in philadelphia to prepare for the convention.
he had checked in to one of the citys finest boarding houses run by mrs mary house.
soon most of his fellow delegates from virginia would be there also.
that would give them a chance to make plans before the convention began.
unfortunately it was not a fine time to be in philadelphia.
it had been a wet and rainy spring.
now as summer neared it was becoming increasingly hot and humid.
to make matters worse the city was plagued with dense clouds of black flies.
residents had to sleep with their windows closed or be tormented by swarms of buzzing biting insects.
shutting their windows however meant they had to spend their nights sweltering in the heat.
madison had bigger concerns though.
as he looked around the east room of the state house he imagined the events that would soon unfold there.
the room was large with a 20 foot high ceiling and tall windows.
but it would be crowded once all the delegates were seated.
madison decided to sit up front where he could get a clear view of the proceedings.
he planned to take notes and wanted to be able to see and hear everything that took place at the convention.
er 8 madison leads the way madison was 36 years old at the time of the convention.
he was a small man just five and a half feet tall with pale skin and thinning hair.
he typically dressed in black.
he was shy and spoke in a soft voice that was often hard to hear.
nevertheless he had great energy.
he walked with a bounce in his step and could get by on just a few hours of sleep a night.
although he rarely showed personal warmth or charm he was a brilliant conversationalist who knew how to win others to his side.
madison was well prepared to play a leading role at the convention.
he had spent several years as a member of congress.
he had studied the writings of great political thinkers and understood how political systems worked.
he had also helped write the virginia constitution of 1776.
this document established a state government with separation of powers and a two house legislature.
it was an important model of democratic government.
madison would bring all this past experience to bear at the convention.
over the next two weeks the other delegates began to arrive.
they were all wealthy educated white men.
most were lawyers or large land owners.
there were no workers or tradesmen.
there were also no women african americans or american indians.
the delegates took rooms at various boarding houses and inns.
one of these inns the indian queen was the largest in the city.
soon it would be filled with leaders from around the nation.
here they would gather to eat drink and swap stories.
it was a center of social activity during the convention.
by mid may most of the virginia delegation had arrived.
this group included three major political figures george washington george mason and edmund randolph.
these men met with madison late into the night.
together they came up with a plan for a new government a set of 15 proposals now known as the virginia plan.
this plan embodied madisons ideas on the kind of government the nation needed.
with a population of more than 40 000 in 1787 philadelphia was the nation s largest city.
it was filled with inns and taverns like the city tavern the unofficial meeting place forthe convention.
now called independence hall this philadelphia building is the birthplace of our nation s independence.
the declaration of independence was signed here in 1776.
the articles of confederation were adopted here in 1781.
and the u s constitution was created here in 1787.
the convention begins on may 14 the convention was due to begin but many delegates had still not arrived.
travel was difficult in those days.
the roads were bad and coaches often got stuck in the mud or broke an axle.
a trip that normally took a week might take much longer because of problems on the road.
finally on may 25 the convention got underway.
for the next four months the delegates would gather in the east room to debate the issues.
to maintain secrecy they agreed to bolt the doors and shut the windows.
as the summer wore on the heat increased.
many of the men wore wigs and wool suits and with the doors and windows closed the room was stifling.
in this hothouse atmosphere arguments were often intense.
through it all madison sat at his table near the front scribbling away at his notes.
in the evening he took these notes back to his room and laboriously copied them out word for word.
it was an ordeal that almost killed him he said.
but he was determined to keep a complete and accurate record of the convention.
debating the virginia plan from the start the convention focused much of its attention on the virginia plan.
on may 29 edmund randolph presented the various points of the plan.
the next day he summed up its main idea in a bold proposal that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme legislative executive judiciary amazingly randolph s proposal was approved with little debate.
madison had j 62 chapter 8 achieved his first major goal without a struggle.
the convention had agreed to form a new government.
but winning support for the plans details would prove much more difficult.
the toughest issues involved the national legislature.
the delegates all agreed that congress was a key part of government.
but they disagreed on how the people and the states should be represented in congress.
convention leaders like madison knew that this dispute could derail the convention.
so they focused on what they thought would be a simpler issue the executive branch.
but this turned out to be a tough issue too.
should there be one executive or three.
how long should the executive serve.
should the executive be elected or appointed.
for a week the debate circled around and around these questions.
delegates would vote on a question discuss it some more and vote again.
crafting a final document frustrated by this seemingly endless debate on june 9 the delegates decided to tackle the thorny problem of representation in the legislature.
the month long debate was so fierce that at times it looked like the convention would fall apart.
but the delegates always pulled back from the brink.
finally on july 16 they approved the great compromise which set different forms of representation for the two houses of congress.
depressed madison realized that he had lost his battle for a legislature based solely on representing the people rather than the states.
but with the greatest battle behind them the framers could work toward a final plan for the new government.
by late august the delegates formed the committee on postponed matters to take up the few issues that remained to be resolved.
a few days later the committee reported back with its findings.
more debate followed.
but by early september a committee on style consisting of madison and four others was formed to prepare a final draft to present to the full convention.
ever mindful of the importance of this plan for the nation the delegates made a few more changes.
finally gouverneur morris of new jersey handwrote the final document 4 300 words in all.
on the question to agree to the constitution as amended madison recorded in his notes all the states ay yes and so at last on september 17 1787 most of the delegates signed the constitution.
it was ready to go to the states for ratification.
the exhausted delegates had finally completed their monumental task.
the constitution was not everything james madison had hoped for.
in his view it left too much power in the hands of the states.
but he had done what he could and was prepared to live with the outcome.
now he would turn to the fight for ratification and the task of creating a new government.
visitors to the national constitution center in philadelphia can make a choice the framers once made to sign or not to sign a copy of the constitution.

chapter 9 the constitution a more perfect union how has the constitution created a more perfect union.
9 1 introduction when the delegates left independence hall in september 1787 they each carried a copy of the constitution.
their task now was to convince their states to approve the document they had worked so hard to write.
writing the constitution involved many compromises.
most of all the framers wanted to create a central government that would be strong and lasting but not so strong that it endangered citizens freedoms.
in this chapter you will see how the constitution met these goals.
the delegates wanted ordinary citizens to understand and support the constitution.
for this reason they organized its contents very clearly.
after a short introduction they divided the constitution into parts called articles.
then they split each article into numbered sections that present topics in a careful order.
this structure can help you find information in the constitution.
for instance the first section in the article on the president describes how the president is chosen.
the second section lists the presidents powers.
the third section lists presidential duties and the fourth explains how the president can be removed from office.
one of the marvels of the constitution is the way it combines flexibility with a strong framework for the government.
in general the delegates allowed congress the president and the courts to add details to the basic framework.
they also included procedures for changing the constitution.
this combination of strength and flexibility makes the constitution an enduring document.
the constitution keeps its basic nature yet the framers created it so it could also change with the times.
in this chapter you will learn more about the enduring quality of this ingenious document.
more than 200 years after the constitution was created for a new nation a vastly different united states is still governed by this document.
life size bronze statues atthe national constitution center commemorate the drafting of the constitution.
the constitution a more perfect union 165 popular sovereignty the idea that the governments authority comes from the people 9 2 the preamble tells the goals of government the delegates who crafted the constitution chose each word carefully some of their best known words are in the introduction which is called the preamble.
the preamble explains the reasons for the new government.
the constitution begins with the memorable phrase we the people with these words the delegates announced that the constitution based its authority on the people themselves.
the power to form the government did not come from the states or the existing government.
it did not come from a sovereign ruler appointed by god.
instead the power came from ordinary americans.
this concept is known as popular sovereignty.
the preamble then lists the goals of the new government.
first the delegates wanted to form a more perfect union what did the delegates mean by this.
they wanted the states to cooperate with each other.
they also wanted to create a strong relationship between the states and the national government.
the constitution also aims to establish justice americans wanted to be ruled by laws not by the might of soldiers or the decisions of kings.
the same laws would apply to all people.
the delegates hoped that the new government would insure domestic tranquility by domestic they meant within the country.
by tranquility they meant peace and order.
it was the governments job to keep peace and maintain order within the country.
the new government would provide for the common defence in other words the national government would be responsible for protecting the nation against foreign enemies.
this would allow for stronger protection than would be possible if each state had its own army and navy.
the delegates wanted the new government to promote the general welfare this meant that the government could support an economy and a society in which people could prosper.
finally the delegates hoped to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity by posterity the delegates meant the generations that would come after them.
they wanted the government to protect the freedoms gained in the american revolution and preserve them for americans to enjoy in the future.
the delegates knew that these goals required a national government.
however based on their experience with a king many people were suspicious of a strong central government.
for this reason the delegates tried to create a balanced framework that people could trust.
visitors can viewthe constitution at the national archives in washington d c where it is permanently on display.
16 chapter 9 9 3 the legislative branch makes laws for the framers of the constitution the first step in building a trusted government was to create a fair way to make laws.
article i of the constitution gives the power to make laws to the legislative branch of government.
the structure of congress the constitution creates a bicameral or two part national legislature called congress.
the two parts or houses of congress are the house of representatives and the senate.
members of the senate serve six year terms so that they can enjoy some independence from the day to day opinions of voters.
in contrast members of the house serve two year terms.
as a result they have to face the voters much more often.
in this way the framers tried to balance the independence and thoughtfulness of the senate with the house s responsiveness to the changing wishes of the voters.
the framers also designed congress to balance the rights of large and small states.
thus while every state gets two senators representation in the house is based on population.
states with more people have more representatives in the house.
to determine the number of representatives for each state the constitution calls for a census a count of the population to be conducted every ten years.
in time the number of representatives in the house was set at 435 divided among the states based on their population.
the framers considered the senate to be the upper house of the legislature.
its members are supposed to be wiser and more experienced than members of the lower house senators must be at least 30 years old while house members must be 25.
senators must have been citizens for nine years house members for just seven years.
senators and members of congress listen to a speech given by president barack obama in the chambers of the house of representatives.
the president must get congressional approval for his ideas before they become law.

6 er 9 9 3 the legislative branch makes laws for the framers of the constitution the first step in building a trusted government was to create a fair way to make laws.
article i of the constitution gives the power to make laws to the legislative branch of government.
the structure of congress the constitution creates a bicameral or two part national legislature called congress.
the two parts or houses of congress are the house of representatives and the senate.
members of the senate serve six year terms so that they can enjoy some independence from the day to day opinions of voters.
in contrast members of the house serve two year terms.
as a result they have to face the voters much more often.

the president must get congressional approval for his ideas before they become law.
legislative branch the lawmaking part of government called the legislature.
to legislate is to make a law.
the constitution a more perfect union 167 originally the constitution allowed state legislatures to choose the two senators to represent their state.
today however senators are elected by popular vote direct vote by the people.
how congress makes laws the primary job of congress is to make laws.
any member of the house or senate can submit a proposal for a new law called a bill.
however only the house can propose new taxes.
if a majority in one house votes in favor of the bill it is sent to the other house for debate.
if both houses approve the bill it goes to the president.
the bill becomes a law if the president signs it.
the president can veto any proposed law.
congress can override the president s veto which means passing the bill over the presidents objections.
but to do so requires a two thirds majority in both houses.
the constitution establishes a government of three branches with separate powers for each branch.
by dividing power the framers hoped to ensure that no single branch would become too powerful.
the powers of congress article i spells out other powers of congress.
for example only congress can decide how to spend the money raised through taxes.
other congressional powers include the power to raise an army and navy to declare war to pay government debts and to grant citizenship.
in addition congress may make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry out its other powers.
this power known as the elastic clause gives congress the flexibility needed to do its job.
over the years the elastic clause has been stretched to allow congress to do many things that were never listed among its powers in the constitution.
powers of the three branches of government legislative branch makes the laws appropriates funds for laws and programs approves treaties and executive appointments establishes federal courts executive branch enforces the laws acts as commander in chief of military negotiates treaties appoints federal judges and other top officials judicial branch interprets the laws reviews lower court decisions judges whether laws and exec utive actions are constitutional rules on cases between states j 68 chapter 9 9 4 the executive branch carries out the laws a government needs people to carry out or execute the laws passed by the legislature.
for instance when congress approves a tax someone must collect the money.
when congress appropriates or sets aside money for low cost housing someone must build and manage the housing.
article ii of the constitution describes the branch of government that fills this role the executive branch.
the head of the executive branch is the president.
the president is often called the chief executive.
electing the president delegates at the constitutional congress were not prepared to let the people elect the president directly.
instead they decided that the president would be selected by a group of electors.
each state would have the same number of electors as it had representatives and senators in congress.
to win the presidency a candidate needs a majority of the electoral vote.
the president serves a four year term.
under the twenty second amendment a president may be reelected only once.
a new president makes a solemn promise called the oath of office.
the constitution gives the exact words of the oath.
the oath calls for the president to defend the constitution these words reinforce the importance of the constitution as the basic law of the land.
a president must be a natural born american citizen and at least 35 years old.
the constitution always refers to the president as he.
the delegates to the constitutional convention probably assumed that only men would ever vote or hold office.
but nothing in the constitution prevents a woman from being elected president.
presidents are atthe center of the american political stage.
here we see president obama meeting with his cabinet and other close advisers.
executive branch the part of government that carries out or executes the laws the constitution a more perfect union 169 the powers of the president in addition to carrying out laws passed by congress the president is commander in chief of the nations military forces.
he or she can with the consent of the senate make treaties or formal agreements with other nations.
the president nominates or recommends ambassadors official representatives to other countries and supreme court justices judges.
finally the president can grant pardons to people convicted of violating federal or national laws.
hie framers expected that the executive branch would need organizations called departments to carry out its duties.
for example the state department handles relations with other nations.
the justice department is involved in law enforcement as well as court actions.
the heads of executive departments are members of the president s cabinet a formal group of advisers.
today the executive branch has over a dozen executive departments.
each executive department contains smaller specialized agencies.
for instance the department of health and human services contains the food and drug administration.
this agency works to ensure that foods and medicines meet safety standards that have been set by congress.
removing the president the constitution gives con gress the power to remove a president or other officials from office if they commit certain crimes related to their duties.
the house of representatives can vote to impeach the president.
to impeach means to formally accuse the president of the crimes specified in the constitution.
these include bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors if the house votes to impeach the senate puts the president on trial with the senators serving as the jury.
if found guilty the president is removed from office.
article ii of the constitution gives the president the responsibility of commanding the nation s armed forces.
here president obama speaks to u s troops in iraq.
judicial branch the part of government consisting of the supreme court and lower federal courts that interprets the laws 9 5 the judicial branch interprets the law the framers intended for the constitution to be the supreme law of the land.
that means no other laws or actions by the government or by any state can conflict with the constitution.
protecting the constitution is one of the principal responsibilities of the third branch of government the judicial branch.
the judicial branch consists of the system of federal courts and judges.
article iii of the constitution gives the basic framework of the judicial branch.
it establishes the countrys highest court the supreme court.
it also gives congress the power to create inferior lower courts to meet the nations needs.
federal courts also have the power to resolve disputes that involve national laws the federal government or the states.
people accused of breaking national laws can be tried in federal courts.
federal court system congress has authorized two main sets of inferior federal courts.
these lower courts are called district courts and appellate courts.
most cases involving federal laws are first heard in district court.
the united states is divided into large geographic districts.
each district covers several states.
citizens can appeal decisions given in district court which means asking a higher court to review the case.
courts that review cases are called courts of appeal or appellate courts.
an appellate court only considers whether the original trial was fair and legal.
a decision by an appellate court can be appealed to the supreme court.
judicial review the power of the supreme court to decide whether laws and acts made by the legislative and executive branches are unconstitutional the powers of the supreme court the supreme court is the last stop in the judicial system.
its decisions are final and they are binding on all lower courts.
the constitution does not specify the size of the supreme court.
congress has set the size at nine members who are called justices.
the constitution says that all federal judges including supreme court justices serve for good behaviour once they are appointed justices usually serve on the court for life.
a dispute goes directly to the supreme court only if it involves a state or an ambassador from another country.
any other case comes to the supreme court after a trial and an appeal in lower courts.
participants in either national or state courts may eventually appeal cases to the supreme court.
every year lawyers ask the supreme court to review thousands of cases but the court agrees to consider only about a hundred.
the supreme court usually reviews a case only if the justices think the decision made by a lower court might conflict with the constitution or a federal law.
after hearing statements from both sides the justices debate among themselves and vote.
supreme court decisions are announced and explained in writing.
these decisions then guide later decisions in lower courts.
early in its history the supreme court defined the power of judicial review.
this is the power to decide whether laws and acts made by the legislative and executive branches conflict with the constitution.
courts all over the country rely on the supreme court for guidance about what is constitutional.
judicial review gives the supreme court great power in its role of protecting the supreme law of the land the nine members of the supreme court hold important positions in u s government.
their legal opinions on such issues as gun control the death penalty abortion rights and prayer in schools are enforced in every state.
in 2009 sonia sotomayor second from right became the first hispanic justice on the court.
0 chapter 9 the constitution a more perfect union 171 checks and balances the system that allows each branch of government to limit the powers of the other two branches 9 6 checks and balances between the branches the framers of the constitution were very concerned about achieving a balance between a strong national government and protection for individual freedoms.
they hoped that dividing the federal government into three branches was one way to limit the governments power.
but what would keep one branch from dominating the others.
as one delegate to the constitutional convention pointed out from the nature of man we may be sure that those who have power in their hands will always when they can increase it because of this concern the framers developed a system that would enable each branch of the government to limit the power of the other two branches.
this system is called checks and balances.
checks and balances one of the most significant features of the constitution prevent one branch of government from gaining too much power.
constitutional checks and balances judicial executive checking the power of other branches checks allow one branch to block the actions of another branch.
for instance congress has the power to pass laws.
but the president can check this power by vetoing a bill before it becomes law.
in turn congress can check the presidents power by overriding the veto by a two thirds majority vote in each house.
similarly the judicial branch can check the actions of the other two branches.
through its power of judicial review the supreme court can declare that a law a treaty or an executive action is unconstitutional.
balancing the power of other branches balances allow each branch of the government to have some role in the actions and power of the other branches.
for instance judges ambassadors and cabinet members are appointed only if the president nominates them and the senate approves the nomination.
similarly the president has the power to sign treaties but they take effect only if the senate approves them.
the powers of the judicial branch are also balanced against the powers of the other two branches.
even though the supreme court can declare laws unconstitutional it is the president who chooses federal judges and the senate must approve these appointments.
in addition congress can impeach federal judges.
in these ways the legislative and executive branches have some role in the actions of the judicial branch.
these checks and balances keep any one branch of the federal government from being too strong.
this balance of powers is one of the most important features of the u s system of government.
er 9 9 7 the amendment process the framers knew that the constitution would need to be changed over time.
as thomas jefferson said the earth belongs to the living and not to the dead.
at the same time they wanted the constitution to provide a lasting and stable framework for the government.
to maintain that stability the framers made changing the constitution possible but difficult.
changing the constitution article v describes how changes called amendments can be made to the constitution.
an amendment may be proposed in one of two ways.
congress may propose an amendment by a vote of at least two thirds of each house of congress.
or a national convention called by congress at the request of at least two thirds of the state legis latures may propose an amendment.
thus either congress or the states can start the process of amending the constitution.
proposing an amendment is only the first step.
before an amendment can become part of the constitution it must be ratified.
the constitution gives two ways of ratifying an amendment.
an amendment may be approved by the legislatures in at least three fourths of the states or it may be ratified amending the constitution by special conventions in at least three fourths of the states.
once an amendment is approved it becomes part of the constitution.
amendments so far over the years people have suggested more than 10 000 amendments to the constitution.
only 27 have been approved.
the first 10 amendments were added almost immediately after the constitution was ratified.
these amendments were demanded by many americans in exchange for their support of the constitution.
called the bill of rights these 10 amendments primarily guarantee specific rights to citizens.
the other 17 amendments became part of the constitution one at a time.
some of them changed the way certain public officials are elected.
others guaranteed the rights of certain groups of americans.
the thirteenth amendment made slavery illegal.
the nineteenth amendment guaranteed women the right to vote.
the twenty sixth this chart shows the four ways that amendments to the constitution can be proposed and approved or ratified.
amendments are proposed in congress on a regular basis.
the vast majority of the proposals fail.
amendment gave the right to vote to all citizens over the age the constitution a more perfect union 173 interstate commerce trade and other business dealings between two or more states article i of the constitution gives the national government sole authority to print and coin money.
9 8 the federal system connects the nation and the states the framers of the constitution wanted a strong national government but they also wanted the states to keep significant powers.
they accomplished both goals by creating a federal system of government in which power is shared between the national and state governments.
powers belonging to the national government theconsti tution gives some powers only to the national government.
in general these are powers best exercised by one central authority such as declaring war and making treaties.
the constitution also says that only the national government can print and coin money.
the framers had learned from experience that separate state currencies made no sense.
similarly article i gives congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes known as the commerce clause this provision gives the national government the power to regulate interstate commerce.
for example a state cannot try to protect its own businesses and industries by taxing goods imported from other states.
under the articles of confederation many states had done just that.
as a result interstate trade threatened to grind to a halt.
in effect the commerce clause made the entire united states a common market or free trade zone.
there were several advantages to giving states a common market.
first goods and resources could flow more easily across the country.
this is important because different regions do different things well.
new englanders might be very good at making cloth but their region is not good for growing cotton.
southerners might have lots of cotton but few factories for turning it into cloth.
making interstate trade easier for cloth makers and cotton growers helps both businesses thrive.
second the common market made it easier to create large businesses that crossed state lines.
this was very important to companies like those that built the nations railroads in the 19th century.
third the common market helped to create a single national economy.
under the articles of confederation it was almost as if the country had 13 small economies.
these could never have grown as diverse or powerful as the u s economy did.
notice that the commerce clause also gives the national government the right to regulate trade with indian tribes.
in effect the constitution treats native tribes as foreign governments.
relations with these nations within a nation are the responsibility of congress not the states.
powers belonging to the states the constitution does not spell out specific powers of the states.
instead it says that the states retain or keep any powers that are not given to the national government.
or instance the constitution says nothing about schools marriage sta is ing local governments owning property licensing doctors and lawyers or most crimes.
the states make the laws in these areas of life.
chapter 9 the federal system powers of the powers of national government shared powers state governments coin money set up a guarantee civil rights and liberties conduct elections establish local postal system levy and collect taxes governments maintain military i provide for public safety establish schools forces protect public health regulate marriage declare war establish courts divorce and adoption regulate interstate and foreign commerce punish lawbreakers regulate intrastate commerce regulate immigration j borrow money provide fire and negotiate treaties with foreign countries construct and maintain roads police protection enact license requirements the constitution does however outline the responsibilities of states to each other.
article iv says that each state must give full faith and credit to the laws and court decisions of other states.
this means accepting other states laws and court decisions as legal.
for example a drivers license issued in one state is legal in every state.
similarly states must obey legal contracts that people have made in other states.
like the commerce clause the full faith and credit provision brings stability to business dealings.
states are also required to help each other track down fleeing criminals.
criminals cannot escape justice by fleeing to another state.
finally the constitution does not allow one state to discriminate unreasonably against a citizen of another state.
a state may not for example refuse to let a child who was born in another state attend its public schools.
shared powers federal and state governments also share some powers.
for example both levels of government can collect taxes build roads borrow money and regulate education.
if you think federalism or the sharing of power sounds complicated you are right.
consider presidential elections.
congress sets the date for national elections while the states register voters and run the elections.
states count the ballots while the national government organizes the electoral college vote which determines who will be president.
federalism is also complicated because the constitution provides only a general framework for the sharing of powers.
there was no way for the framers to spell out rules for every possible situation.
the federal system continues to evolve through new laws court decisions and constitutional amendments.
the constitution divides power between the federal and state governments.
the idea behind the separation of powers is to create a unified nation while balancing power between the national and the state governments.
the law of the land americans may disagree about how to interpret the constitution but they may not ignore it.
article vi states that the constitution and the laws flowing from it are the supreme law of the land this means that a states constitution laws and judicial decisions must agree with the constitution.
they also must not conflict with any other federal laws or treaties.
in addition everyone who holds a state or federal office must promise to support the constitution.
federalism the constitutional system that shares power between the national and state governments the constitution a more perfect union 175 majority rule a basic principle of democracy that says laws are passed by majority vote and elections are decided by a majority of the voters interest group an organization that actively promotes the view of some part of the public on specific issues in order to influence government policy political parties are not mentioned in the constitution but they have become a central part of the u s political system.
9 9 popular participation in government ihe framers of the constitution designed a government based on the will of the people.
they expected people to take part in their own government and to hold leaders responsible for their actions.
for government to reflect the popular will it makes sense for its decisions to be based on what most people want.
the constitution therefore establishes the principle of majority rule.
laws are passed in congress by majority vote.
elections are decided by a majority of voters.
it is through elections that most people have a say in what the government does.
leaders must listen to the voters or they will not be elected or reelected.
elections serve the vital function of expressing the will of the people.
but who exactly are the people.
the framers did not specify who would have the right to vote.
over the years states established various requirements for voting.
it took many years of struggle to establish the principle that all citizens should have the right to vote.
women for example were not guaranteed this right until the nineteenth amend ment was ratified in 1920.
popular participation in government has evolved in other ways that are not part of the constitution.
for example the constitution makes no mention of political parties.
today parties select most candidates for political office.
becoming active in party affairs is another way that voters can help choose their leaders and influence the positions they take on issues.
people also take part in government indirectly through interest groups.
there are interest groups for almost any issue that people might care about.
some interest groups represent businesses industries and workers.
some represent groups of people such as churchgoers women or minorities.
some are organized around issues such as the environment or health care.
6 er 9 interest groups influence government in several ways.
they rally public opinion work to elect candidates who promise to listen to them and try to persuade lawmakers and government officials to take actions they favor.
if the framers were alive today they might be surprised to see the changes in the system they created.
yet the remarkable thing is how successful they were in building the basic framework of american democracy.
as one historian has said the constitution would become the rule of life for a country larger than any of the founders imagined and would last longer than most of them dared hope chapter summary in this chapter you learned how the constitution met the delegates goal of creating a more perfect union the preamble as the first words of the preamble tell us the constitutions authority comes directly from the people not the states.
this concept is known as popular sovereignty.
the preamble goes on to list the goals of the new government.
the legislative branch article i of the constitution creates a bicameral congress with a house of representatives and a senate.
every state is represented by two senators.
representation in the house is based on a states population.
congresss primary job is to make laws.
the executive branch article ii creates the executive branch.
the head of the executive branch is the president.
the president serves a four year term and may be reelected once.
the president carries out laws passed by congress.
other powers of the president include making treaties and appointing supreme court justices.
the judicial branch article iii establishes the supreme court and gives congress the power to create lower courts.
supreme court decisions are binding on all lower courts.
the power of judicial review allows the supreme court to decide whether laws and actions by the legislative and executive branches are unconstitutional.
checks and balances the framers developed a system of checks and balances that enables each branch of government to limit or check the power of the other two branches.
the constitution provides checks and balances in the powers of each branch.
the amendment process article v outlines the process by which amendments can be made to the constitution.
twenty seven amendments have been added.
the first ten amendments form the bill of rights.
the federal system the constitution creates a federal system of government in which power is shared between the national government and the states.
popular participation in government elections serve the vital function of expressing the will of the people.
people also participate in government by joining political parties and taking part in interest groups.
the constitution a more perfect union 177 reading further mum bettwas a slave who went to courtto gain herfreedom.
in 1781 a massachusetts court ruled that she was in fact free.
but when the u s constitution was written a few years later it excluded both women and african americans.
who are we the people.
i the constitution begins with the words ne the people.
but just who were these people who wanted to secure the blessings of liberty.
in 1787 we the people excluded more than half the population including african americans and women.
what were the framers thinking.
mum bett had had enough.
born into slavery she had served in the home of john ashley of sheffield massachusetts for more than 30 years.
when mrs ashley hit her with a hot kitchen shovel one day in 1781 mum bett fled and refused to return.
instead mum bett asked a lawyer theodore sedgwick to represent her in court.
mum bett wanted to be free and she believed the courts would recognize that she had the right to freedom.
sedgwick took her case.
mum bett who later changed her name to elizabeth freeman knew about the massachusetts state constitution.
it had been ratified in 1780.
mum bett had heard that it said that all people were born free and equal she believed that all people included her and that she had a legal right to her freedom.
the court agreed and mum bett became a free woman.
john ashley her former master had to pay her 30 shillings in damages.
though the court ruled in favor of mum bett the problem of just who would be included in we the people did not go away.
it surfaced again just a few years later.
in 1787 the leaders of the united states met in philadelphia.
they wrote a constitution for their new country.
but they did not pay attention to the massachusetts court s decision that mum bett was free.
initially the u s constitution excluded women and african americans from enjoying the full benefits of liberty.
the colonies had fought the revolution to gain their freedom.
they created a democracy but many people were disallowed from participating in it.
neither african americans nor women could vote or hold office.
these groups had to fight for many years to gain the right to take part in these democratic processes.
but the question arises why were they excluded in the first place.
the responsibilities of freedom the 55 white men who wrote the u s constitution were a privileged group.
more than half of them had been to college 34 had studied law almost half had been in congress and at least 20 owned slaves.
the delegates were hardly typical of the larger american population at the time.
but in many ways they reflected the general beliefs of 18th century american society.
hapter 9 the framers of the constitution believed that only certain people could handle the responsibilities of freedom.
the way they viewed it only people who controlled their own lives should have a say in the government.
dependent people those who didnt own property or who worked for someone else could not exercise their own free will the framers reasoned.
if they voted they would cast their ballots as they were told to.
the framers believed that the votes of such people would damage the entire country.
to the framers as to many americans in those days only a property owner could be an independent thinker.
that excluded more than half of the population.
we the people were white male and propertied.
some of the excluded could eventually join fully in civic life.
for example indentured servants completed their service after a number of years.
they might eventually own property.
some women might inherit property from their husbands.
but few women were likely ever to enjoy all the rights the constitution promised.
and many people were completely locked out of economic opportunity.
slaves could never own property.
they could never be independent and free.
the american system made it impossible for them to share as citizens in the new united states.
neither women nor african americans simply accepted their exclusion however.
for many years until they were successful both women and african americans would argue that they should be able to participate fully in american democracy.
the framers of the constitution had specific ideas about who we the people were.
in their view only people who owned property could manage the responsibilities of freedom.
in a mural at antioch college in ohio artist gilbert wilson painted a different view of american society.
in this panel titled order a diverse group of women and men come together around a common table.
179 abigail adams was an independent thinker who had strong ideas about women s rights.
in 1787 she was in great britain where john adams was serving as the representative of the new united states.
the rights of women perhaps the most famous woman to speak out for womens rights at the time was abigail adams.
her husband john adams would become the second president of the united states.
in the spring of 1776 when john was a delegate to the continental congress abigail wrote to him saying in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands.
remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
abigail adams knew that in the 18th century women had legal status only through their husbands.
a married woman was called a feme covert a legal term that comes from the french words for covered woman women were covered invisible as far as the law was concerned by their husbands.
abigail warned her husband that women would not follow any laws that did not guarantee their rights.
they would not be bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation john adams however feared that expanding freedom would lead to chaos.
he told abigail that women had more power over their husbands than they realized.
that being true he believed that men would be better off excluding women from the new countrys laws.
depend upon it he wrote we know better than to repeal our masculine systems nonetheless some women did vote during the republics early years.
a new jersey law passed in 1790 identified voters as he or she historians disagree about why.
some point out that new jersey was home to many quakers who believed in equality.
others call attention to the fact that only some counties granted women the vote and say it was more about political power.
thiese counties they say hoped 0 chapter 9 margaret brent requested voting rights declared independence.
in 1648 she asked the maryland assembly to grant her two votes one for owning land and one for being lord baltimore s legal representative.
the governor refused her request.
women s votes would affect election outcomes in their favor.
whatever the reasons women voted in new jersey until the law was repealed in 1807.
it would take more than 100 years and a hard fight to pass an amendment to the constitution that granted women the right to vote.
the rights of african americans when the war ended many african americans left the united states.
they feared that the new democracy would not include them.
some went to england.
others went to canada or the west indies.
most of those who left were fugitive slaves.
by some accounts 30 000 african americans left virginia.
another 25 000 left south carolina.
the majority of the african americans who stayed were slaves.
but some were not.
the 1790 census reported that there were about 59 000 free blacks living in the united states.
among them was benjamin banneker.
banneker was a maryland tobacco farmer a scientist and a surveyor.
he wrote a well known almanac.
he also wrote a letter to thomas jefferson.
in it he explained why african americans should have the same rights as whites.
banneker wrote the letter in 1791 the year in which he surveyed the land for the new national capital.
at the time jefferson was secretary of state.
banneker explained that both blacks and whites were created by god.
however variable we may be in society or religion he wrote however diversified in situation or color we are all of the same family he went on to quote the declaration of independence to the man who wrote it.
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights and that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness banneker explained that african americans deserved those rights just as whites did.
he even went so far as to accuse jefferson of using fraud and violence to keep blacks enslaved.
although a slaveholder himself jefferson wrote back that no body wishes more than i do to see such proofs as you exhibit that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men but slavery continued in the south until the civil war.
the freedoms guaranteed by the constitution would not be extended to african americans for many years.
african american men gained the right to vote in 1870.
it would take another 50 years before all women including african americans were granted voting rights.
and not until the 1960s were laws passed giving all african americans the legal protection to exercise their right to vote.
the words we the people still begin our constitution.
more than 200 years later their meaning has changed in ways that mum bett abigail adams and benjamin banneker would approve.
benjamin bannakers pennsylvania delaware mao land and virginia almanac for the year of onr lord 1 95 i besig the third after leap year printed for willusf bbons cherry a benjamin banneker published six almanacs between 1792 and 1797.
a self educated scientist he included information on tides astronomy and eclipses that he calculated himself.
the constitution a more perfect union 181.
