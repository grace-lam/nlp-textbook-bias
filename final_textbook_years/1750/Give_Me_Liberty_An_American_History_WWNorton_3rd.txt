what were the achievements and problems of the confederation government.
the articles made energetic national government impossible.
but congress in the 1780s did not lack for accomplishments.
the most important was establishing national control over land to the west of the thirteen states and devising rules for its settlement.
disputes over access to western land almost prevented ratification of the articles in the first place.
citing their original royal charters which granted territory running all the way to the south sea the pacific ocean states like virginia the carolinas and connecticut claimed immense tracts of western land.
land speculators politicians and prospective settlers from states with clearly defined boundaries insisted that such land must belong to the nation at large.
only after the land rich states in the interest of national unity ceded their western claims to the central government did the articles win ratification.
congress and the west establishing rules for the settlement of this national domain the area controlled by the federal government stretching from the western boundaries of existing states to the mississippi river was by no means easy.
although some americans spoke of it as if it were empty some 100 000 indians in fact inhabited the region.
in the immediate aftermath of independence congress took the position that by aiding the british indians had forfeited the right to their lands.
little distinction was made among tribes that had sided with the enemy those that had aided the patriots and those in the interior that had played no part in the war at all.
at peace conferences at fort stanwix new york in 1784 and fort mcintosh near pittsburgh the following year american representatives demanded and received large surrenders of indian land north of the ohio river.
similar treaties soon followed with the cherokee choctaw and chickasaw tribes in the south although here congress guaranteed the permanency of the indians remaining much reduced holdings.
the treaties secured national control of a large part of the countrys western territory.
when it came to disposing of western land and regulating its settlement the confederation government faced conflicting pressures.
many leaders believed that the economic health of the new republic required that farmers have access to land in the west.
but they also saw land sales as a potential source of revenue and worried that unregulated settlement would produce endless conflicts with the indians.
land companies which lobbied congress vigorously hoped to profit by purchasing real estate and reselling it to settlers.
the government they insisted should step aside and allow private groups to take control of the wests economic development.
settlers and the west the arrival of peace meanwhile triggered a large population movement from settled parts of the original states into frontier areas like upstate new york and across the appalachian mountains into kentucky and tennessee.
to settlers the right to take possession of western lands and use them as they saw fit was an essential element of american freedom.
when a group of ohioans petitioned congress in 1785 assailing landlords and speculators c h.

who monopolized available acreage and asking that preference in land ownership be given to actual settlements their motto was grant us liberty indeed settlers paid no heed to indian land titles and urged the government to set a low price on public land or give it away.
they frequently occupied land to which they had no legal title.
by the 1790s kentucky courts were filled with lawsuits over land claims and many settlers lost land they thought they owned.
eventually disputes over land forced many early settlers including the parents of abraham lincoln to leave kentucky for opportunities in other states.
at the same time however like british colonial officials before them many leaders of the new nation feared that an unregulated flow of population across the appalachian mountains would provoke constant warfare with indians.
moreover they viewed frontier settlers as disorderly and lacking in proper respect for authority our debtors loose english people our german servants and slaves benjamin franklin had once called them.
establishing law and order in the west and strict rules for the occupation of land there seemed essential to attracting a better class of settlers to the west and avoiding discord between the settled and frontier parts of the new nation.
the land ordinances a series of measures approved by congress during the 1780s defined the terms by which western land would be marketed and settled.
drafted by thomas jefferson the ordinance of 1784 established stages of self government for the west.
the region would be divided into districts initially governed by congress and eventually admitted to the union as member states.
by a single vote congress rejected a clause that would have prohibited slavery what were the achievements and problems of the confederation government.

7 founding a nation 1783 1789 america under the confederation throughout the west.
a second ordinance in 1785 regulated land sales in the region north of the ohio river which came to be known as the old northwest.
land would be surveyed by the government and then sold in sections of a square mile 640 acres at 1 per acre.
in each township one section would be set aside to provide funds for public education.
the system promised to control and concentrate settlement and raise money for congress.
but settlers violated the rules by pressing westward before the surveys had been completed.
like the british before them american officials found it difficult to regulate the thirst for new land.
the minimum purchase price of 640 however put public land out of the financial reach of most settlers.
they generally ended up buying smaller parcels from speculators and land companies.
in 1787 congress decided to sell off large tracts to private groups including 1 5 million acres to the ohio company organized by new england land speculators and army officers.
this was a different organization from the ohio company of the 1750s mentioned in chapter 4.
for many years national land policy benefited private land companies and large buyers more than individual settlers.
and for many decades actual and prospective settlers pressed for a reduction in the price of government owned land a movement that did not end until the homestead act of 1862 offered free land on the public domain.
a final measure the northwest ordinance of 1787 called for the eventual establishment of from three to five states north of the ohio river and east of the mississippi.
thus was enacted the basic principle of what jefferson called the empire of liberty rather than ruling over the west as a colonial power the united states would admit the areas population as equal members of the political system.
territorial expansion and selfgovernment would grow together.
the northwest ordinance pledged that the utmost good faith would be observed toward local indians and that their land would not be taken without consent.
this was the first official recognition that indians continued to own their land.
congress realized that allowing settlers and state government simply to seize indian lands would produce endless expensive military conflicts on the frontier.
it will cost much less one congressman noted to conciliate the good opinion of the indians than to pay men for destroying them but national land policy assumed that whether through purchase treaties or voluntary removal the indian presence would soon disappear.
the ordinance also prohibited slavery in the old northwest a provision that would have far reaching consequences when the sectional conflict between north and south developed.
but for years owners brought slaves into the area claiming that they had voluntarily signed long term labor contracts.
the confederations weaknesses whatever the achievements of the confederation government in the eyes of many influential americans they were outweighed by its failings.
both the national government and the country at large faced worsening economic problems.
to finance the war of independence congress had borrowed large sums of money by selling interest bearing bonds and paying soldiers and suppliers in notes to be redeemed in the what were the achievements and problems of the confederation government.
lacking a secure source of revenue it found itself unable to pay either interest or the debts themselves.
with the united states now outside the british empire american ships were barred from trading with the west indies.
imported goods however flooded the market undercutting the business of many craftsmen driving down wages and draining money out of the country.
with congress unable to act the states adopted their own economic policies.
several imposed tariff duties on goods imported from abroad.
indebted farmers threatened with the loss of land because of failure to meet tax or mortgage payments pressed state governments for relief as did urban craftsmen who owed money to local merchants.
in order to increase the amount of currency in circulation and make it easier for individuals to pay their debts several states printed large sums of paper money.
others enacted laws postponing debt collection.
creditors considered such measures attacks on their property rights.
in a number of states legislative elections produced boisterous campaigns in which candidates for office denounced creditors for oppressing the poor and importers of luxury goods for undermining republican virtue.
shayss rebellion in late 1786 and early 1787 crowds of debt ridden farmers closed the courts in western massachusetts to prevent the seizure of their land for failure to pay taxes.
they called themselves regulators a term already used by protesters in the carolina backcountry in the 1760s.
the uprising came to be known as shayss rebellion a name affixed to it by its opponents after daniel shays one of the leaders and a veteran of the war for independence.
massachusetts had firmly resisted pressure to issue paper money or in other ways assist needy debtors.
the participants in shayss rebellion believed they were acting in the spirit of the revolution.
they modeled their tactics on the crowd activities of the 1760s and 1770s and employed liberty trees and liberty poles as symbols of their cause.
they received no sympathy from governor james bowdoin who dispatched an army headed by former revolutionary war general benjamin lincoln.
the rebels were dispersed in january 1787 and more than 1 000 were arrested.
without adherence to the rule of law bowdoin declared americans would descend into a state of anarchy confusion and slavery observing shayss rebellion from paris where he was serving as ambassador thomas jefferson refused to be alarmed.
a little rebellion now and then is a good thing he wrote to a friend.
the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants but the uprising was the culmination of a series of events in the 1780s that persuaded an influential group of americans that the national government must be strengthened so that it could develop uniform economic policies and protect property owners from infringements on their rights by local majorities.
the actions of state legislatures most of them elected annually by an expanded voting population followed by shayss rebellion produced fears that the revolutions democratic impulse had gotten out of hand.
our government samuel adams wrote in 1785 at present has liberty for its object but among proponents of stronger national authority liberty had lost some of its luster.
the danger to individual rights they came to a bankruptcy scene.
creditors repossess the belongings of a family unable to pay its debts while a woman weeps in the background.
popular fears of bankruptcy led several states during the 1780s to pass laws postponing the collection of debts.
7 founding a nation 1783 1789 america under the confederation believe now arose not from a tyrannical central government but from the people themselves.
liberty declared james madison may be endangered by the abuses of liberty as well as the abuses of power to put it another way private liberty especially the secure enjoyment of property rights could be endangered by public liberty unchecked power in the hands of the people.
nationalists james madison father of the constitution in a miniature portrait painted by charles willson peale in 1783.
madison was only thirty six years old when the constitutional convention met.
alexander hamilton another youthful leader of the nationalists of the 1780s was born in the west indies in 1755.
this portrait was painted by charles willson peale in the early 1790s.
of the 1780s madison a diminutive colorless virginian and the lifelong disciple and ally of thomas jefferson thought deeply and creatively about the nature of political freedom.
he was among the group of talented and well organized men who spearheaded the movement for a stronger national government.
another was alexander hamilton who had come to north america as a youth from the west indies served at the precocious age of twenty as an army officer during the war of independence and married into a prominent new york family.
hamilton was perhaps the most vigorous proponent of an energetic government that would enable the new nation to become a powerful commercial and diplomatic presence in world affairs.
genuine liberty he insisted required a proper degree of authority to make and exercise the laws men like madison and hamilton were nation builders.
they came to believe during the 1780s that americans were squandering the fruits of independence and that the countrys future greatness depended on enhancing national authority.
the concerns voiced by critics of the articles found a sympathetic hearing among men who had developed a national consciousness during the revolution.
nationalists included army officers members of congress accustomed to working with individuals from different states and diplomats who represented the country abroad.
in the army john marshall later a chief justice of the supreme court developed the habit of considering america as my country and congress as my government influential economic interests also desired a stronger national government.
among these were bondholders who despaired of being paid so long as congress lacked a source of revenue urban artisans seeking tariff protection from foreign imports merchants desiring access to british markets and all those who feared that the states were seriously interfering with property rights.
while these groups did not agree on many issues they all believed in the need for a stronger national government.
in september 1786 delegates from six states met at annapolis maryland to consider ways for better regulating interstate and international commerce.
the delegates proposed another gathering in philadelphia to amend the articles of confederation.
shayss rebellion greatly strengthened the nationalists cause.
the late turbulent scenes in massachusetts wrote madison underscored the need for a new constitution.
no respect he complained is paid to the federal authority without a change in the structure of government either anarchy or monarchy was the likely outcome bringing to an end the experiment in republican government.
every state except rhode island which had gone the farthest in developing its own debtor relief and trade policies decided to send delegates to the philadelphia convention.
when they assembled in what were the achievements and problems of the confederation government.
may 1787 they decided to scrap the articles of confederation entirely and draft a new constitution for the united states.
a new constitution the fifty five men who gathered for the constitutional convention included some of the most prominent americans.
thomas jefferson and john adams serving as diplomats in europe did not take part.
but among the delegates were george washington whose willingness to lend his prestige to the gathering and to serve as presiding officer was an enormous asset george mason author of virginias declaration of rights of 1776 and benjamin franklin who had returned to philadelphia after helping to negotiate the treaty of paris of 1783 and was now eighty one years old.
john adams described the convention as a gathering of men of ability weight and experience he might have added and wealth few men of ordinary means attended.
although a few like alexander hamilton had risen from humble origins most had been born into propertied families.
they earned their livings as lawyers merchants planters and large farmers.
nearly all were quite prosperous by the standards of the day.
at a time when fewer than one tenth of 1 percent of americans attended college more than half the delegates had college educations.
a majority had participated in interstate meetings of the 1760s and 1770s and twentytwo had served in the army during the revolution.
their shared social status and political experiences bolstered their common belief in the need to strengthen national authority and curb what one called the excesses of democracy to ensure free and candid debate the deliberations took place in private.
madison who believed the outcome would have great consequences for the cause of liberty throughout the world took careful notes.
they were not published however until 1840 four years after he became the last delegate to pass away.
the structure of government it quickly became apparent that the delegates agreed on many points.
the new constitution would create a legislature an executive and a national judiciary.
congress would have the power to raise money without relying on the states.
states would be prohibited from infringing on the rights of property.
and the government would represent the people.
hamiltons proposal for a president and senate serving life terms like the king and house of lords of england received virtually no support.
the rich and well born hamilton told the convention must rule for the masses seldom judge or determine right most delegates however hoped to find a middle ground between the despotism of monarchy and aristocracy and what they considered the excesses of popular self government.
we had been a fifty dollar note issued by the continental congress during the war of independence.
congresss inability to raise funds to repay such paper money in gold or silver was a major reason why nationalists desired a stronger federal government.
7 founding a nation 1783 1789 the philadelphia state house now called independence hall where the declaration of independence was signed in 1776 and the constitutional convention took place in 1787.
a new constitution too democratic observed george mason but he warned against the danger of going to the opposite extreme the key to stable effective republican government was finding a way to balance the competing claims of liberty and power.
differences quickly emerged over the proper balance between the federal and state governments and between the interests of large and small states.
early in the proceedings madison presented what came to be called the virginia plan.
it proposed the creation of a two house legislature with a states population determining its representation in each.
smaller states fearing that populous virginia massachusetts and pennsylvania would dominate the new government rallied behind the new jersey plan.
this called for a single house congress in which each state cast one vote as under the articles of confederation.
in the end a compromise was reached a two house congress consisting of a senate in which each state had two members and a house of representatives apportioned according to population.
senators would be chosen by state legislatures for six year terms.
they were thus insulated from sudden shifts in public opinion.
representatives were to be elected every two years directly by the people.
the limits of democracy under the articles of confederation no national official had been chosen by popular vote.
thus the mode of choosing the house of representatives represented an expansion of democracy.
popular election of at least one part of the political regime madison declared was essential to every plan of free government the constitution moreover imposed neither property nor religious qualifications for voting leaving it to the states to set voting rules.
what major disagreements and compromises molded the final content of the constitution.
overall however the new structure of government was less than democratic.
the delegates sought to shield the national government from the popular enthusiasms that had alarmed them during the 1780s and to ensure that the right kind of men held office.
the people would remain sovereign but they would choose among the elite to staff the new government.
the delegates assumed that the senate would be composed of each states most distinguished citizens.
they made the house of representatives quite small initially 65 members at a time when the massachusetts assembly had 200 on the assumption that only prominent individuals could win election in large districts.
nor did the delegates provide for direct election of either federal judges or the president.
members of the supreme court would be appointed by the president for life terms.
the president would be chosen either by members of an electoral college or by the house of representatives.
the number of electors for each state was determined by adding together its allocation of senators and representatives.
a states electors would be chosen either by its legislature or by popular vote.
in either case the delegates assumed electors would be prominent well educated individuals better qualified than ordinary voters to choose the head of state.
the actual system of election seemed a recipe for confusion.
each elector was to cast votes for two candidates for president with the second place finisher becoming vice president.
if no candidate received a majority of the electoral ballots as the delegates seem to have assumed would normally be the case the president would be chosen from among the top three finishers by the house of representatives with each state casting one vote.
the senate would then elect the vice president.
the delegates devised this extremely cumbersome system of indirect election because they did not trust ordinary voters to choose the president and vice president directly.
the division and separation of powers hammered out in four months of discussion and compromise the constitution is a spare document of only 4 000 words that provides only the briefest outline of the new structure of government.
see the appendix for the full text.
it embodies two basic political principles federalism sometimes called the division of powers and the system of checks and balances between the different branches of the national government also known as the separation of powers federalism refers to the relationship between the national government and the states.
compared to the articles of confederation the constitution significantly strengthened national authority.
it charged the president with enforcing the law and commanding the military.
it empowered congress to levy taxes borrow money regulate commerce declare war deal with foreign nations and indians and promote the general welfare madison proposed to allow congress to veto state laws but this proved too far reaching for most delegates.
the constitution did however declare national legislation the supreme law of the land and it included strong provisions to prevent the states from infringing on property rights.
they were barred from issuing paper money impairing contracts interfering with interstate commerce and levying their own import or export duties.
on the other hand most day to day affairs of government from education c h.
7 founding a nation 1783 1789 a new constitution to law enforcement remained in the hands of the states.
this principle of divided sovereignty was a recipe for debate which continues to this day over the balance of power between the national government and the states.
the separation of powers or the system of checks and balances refers to the way the constitution seeks to prevent any branch of the national government from dominating the other two.
to prevent an accumulation of power dangerous to liberty authority within the government is diffused and balanced against itself.
congress enacts laws but the president can veto them and a two thirds majority is required to pass legislation over his objection.
federal judges are nominated by the president and approved by congress but to ensure their independence the judges then serve for life.
the president can be impeached by the house and removed from office by the senate for high crimes and misdemeanors the this advertisement for the sale of 100 slaves from virginia to states farther south appeared in a richmond newspaper only a few months after the signing of the constitution.
slavery was a major subject of debate at the constitutional convention.
debate over slavery the structure of government was not the only source of debate at the constitutional convention.
as madison recorded the institution of slavery and its implications divided the delegates at many sessions.
those who gathered in philadelphia included numerous slaveholders as well as some dedicated advocates of abolition.
madison like jefferson a virginia slaveholder who detested slavery told the convention that the distinction of color had become the basis for the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by man over man yet he later assured the virginia ratifying convention that the constitution offered slavery better security than any that now exists the words slave and slavery did not appear in the constitution a concession to the sensibilities of delegates who feared they would contaminate the glorious fabric of american liberty as luther martin of maryland wrote his fellow delegates anxiously sought to avoid the admission of expressions which might be odious to the ears of americans but he continued they were willing to admit into their system those things which the expressions signified the document prohibited congress from abolishing the african slave trade for twenty years.
it required states to return to their owners fugitives from bondage.
and it provided that threefifths of the slave population would be counted in determining each states representation in the house of representatives and its electoral votes for president.
south carolinas delegates had come to philadelphia determined to defend slavery and they had a powerful impact on the final document.
they originated the fugitive slave clause the three fifths clause and the electoral college.
they insisted on strict limits on the power of congress to levy taxes within the states fearing future efforts to raise revenue by taxing slave property.
they threatened disunion if the atlantic slave trade were prohibited immediately as the new england states and virginia with its abundance of native born slaves demanded.
their threats swayed many delegates.
gouverneur morris one of pennsylvanias delegates declared that he was being forced to decide between offending the southern states or doing injustice to human nature for the sake of national unity he said he would choose the latter.
what major disagreements and compromises molded the final content of the constitution.
slavery in the constitution the constitutions slavery clauses were compromises efforts to find a middle ground between the institutions critics and defenders.
taken together however they embedded slavery more deeply than ever in american life and politics.
the slave trade clause allowed a commerce condemned by civilized society one that had been suspended during the war of independence to continue until 1808.
on january 1 1808 the first day that congress was allowed under the constitution it prohibited the further importation of slaves.
but in the interim partly to replace slaves who had escaped to the british and partly to provide labor for the expansion of slavery to fertile land away from the coast some 170 000 africans were brought to the new nation as slaves.
south carolina and georgia imported 100 000.
this number represented more than one quarter of all the slaves brought to mainland north america after 1700.
the fugitive slave clause accorded slave laws extraterritoriality that is the condition of bondage remained attached to a person even if he or she escaped to a state where slavery had been abolished.
john jay while serving in spain on a diplomatic mission once wrote of how he missed the free air of america.
jay was probably unaware of the phrases full implications.
in the famous somerset case of 1772 the lawyer for a west indian slave brought to britain had obtained his clients freedom by invoking the memorable words the air of england is too pure for a slave to breathe that is the moment any person sets foot on british soil he or she becomes free.
yet the new federal constitution required all the states north and south to recognize and help police the institution of slavery.
for slaves there was no free air in america.
the constitution gave the national government no power to interfere with slavery in the states.
and the three fifths clause allowed the white south to exercise far greater power in national affairs than the size of its the signing of the constitution by mid nineteenth century american artist thomas pritchard rossiter depicts the conclusion of the constitutional convention of 1787.
among the founding fathers depicted are james wilson signing the document at the table in the center and george washington presiding from the dais with an image of the sun behind him.
7 founding a nation 1783 1789 the preamble to the constitution as printed in a pennsylvania newspaper two days after the constitutional convention adjourned.
a new constitution free population warranted.
the clause greatly enhanced the number of southern votes in the house of representatives and therefore in the electoral college where as noted above the number of electors for each state was determined by adding together its number of senators and representatives.
of the first sixteen presidential elections between 1788 and 1848 all but four placed a southern slaveholder in the white house.
even the initial failure to include a bill of rights resulted in part from the presence of slavery.
as south carolina delegate charles c pinckney explained such bills generally begin with declaring that all men are by nature born free a declaration that would come with a very bad grace when a large part of our property consists in men who are actually born slaves but some slaveholders detected a potential threat buried in the constitution.
patrick henry who condemned slavery but feared abolition warned that in time of war the new government might take steps to arm and liberate the slaves.
may congress not say he asked that every black man must fight.
did we not see a little of this in the last war what henry could not anticipate was that the war that eventually destroyed slavery would be launched by the south itself to protect the institution.
the final document gouverneur morris put the finishing touches on the final draft of the new constitution trying to make it he explained as clear as our language would permit for the original preamble which began we the people of the states of new hampshire massachusetts etc he substituted the far more powerful we the people of the united states he added a statement of the constitutions purposes including to establish justice promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty things the articles of confederation in the eyes of most of the delegates had failed to accomplish.

7 founding a nation 1783 1789 the ratification debate and the origin of the bill of rights held an election for delegates to a special ratifying convention.
a fierce public battle ensued producing hundreds of pamphlets and newspaper articles and spirited campaigns to elect delegates.
to generate support hamilton madison and jay composed a series of eighty five essays that appeared in newspapers under the pen name publius and were gathered as a book the federalist in 1788.
hamilton wrote fifty madison thirty and jay the remainder.
today the essays are regarded as among the most important american contributions to political thought.
at the time however they represented only one part of a much larger national debate over ratification reflected in innumerable pamphlets newspaper articles and public meetings.
again and again hamilton and madison repeated that rather than posing a danger to americans liberties the constitution in fact protected them.
hamiltons essays sought to disabuse americans of their fear of political power.
government he insisted was an expression of freedom not its enemy.
any government could become oppressive but with its checks and balances and division of power the constitution made political tyranny almost impossible.
hamilton insisted that he was as zealous an advocate for liberty as any man whatever but want of power had been the fatal flaw of the articles.
at the new york ratifying convention hamilton assured the delegates that the constitution had created the perfect balance between liberty and power extend the sphere madison too emphasized how the constitution was structured to prevent abuses of authority.
but in several essays especially federalist nos.
10 and 51 he moved beyond such assurances to develop a strikingly new vision of the relationship between government and society in the united states.
madison identified the essential dilemma as he saw it of the new republic government must be based on the will of the people yet the people had shown themselves susceptible to dangerous enthusiasms.
most worrisome they had threatened property rights whose protection was the first object of government the problem of balancing democracy and respect for property would only grow in the years ahead because he warned economic development would inevitably increase the numbers of poor.
what was to prevent them from using their political power to secure a more equal distribution of wealth.
the answer madison explained lay not simply in the way power balanced power in the structure of government but in the nations size and diversity.
previous republics had existed only in small territories the dutch republic or italian city states of the renaissance.
but argued madison the very size of the united states was a source of stability not as many feared weakness.
extend the sphere he wrote.
the multiplicity of religious denominations he argued offered the best security for religious liberty.
likewise in a nation as large as the united states so many distinct interests economic regional and political would arise that no single one would ever be able to take over the government and oppress the rest.
every majority would be a coalition of minorities and thus the rights of individuals would be secure.

in arguing that the size of the republic helped to secure americans rights they reinforced the tradition that saw continuous westward expansion as essential to freedom.
and in basing the preservation of freedom on the structure of government and size of the republic not the character of the people his essays represented a major shift away from the republican emphasis on a virtuous citizenry devoted to the common good as the foundation of proper government.
madison helped to popularize the liberal idea that men are generally motivated by self interest and that the good of society arises from the clash of these private interests.
the anti federalists opponents of ratification called anti federalists insisted that the constitution shifted the balance between liberty and power too far in the direction of the latter.
anti federalists lacked the coherent leadership of the constitutions defenders.
they included state politicians fearful of seeing their influence diminish among them such revolutionary heroes as samuel adams john hancock and patrick henry.
small farmers many of whom supported the state debtor relief measures of the 1780s that the constitutions supporters deplored also saw no need for a stronger central government.
some opponents of the constitution denounced the documents protections for slavery others warned that the powers of congress were so broad that it might enact a law for abolition.

no anti federalists also pointed to the constitutions lack of a bill of rights which left unprotected rights such as trial by jury and freedom of speech and the press.
the absence of a bill of rights declared patrick henry was the most absurd thing to mankind that ever the world saw state constitutions had bills of rights yet the states henry claimed were now being in new york citys grand federal procession of 1788 celebrating the ratification of the constitution members of each trade and occupation marched together.

voices of freedom f r o m dav i d r a m s ay the history of the american re v o l u t i o n 1 7 8 9 a member of the continental congress from south carolina david ramsay published his history of the revolution the year after the constitution was ratified.
in this excerpt of legislature are miniature pictures of the community and from their mode of election are government and the right of future amendment likely to be influenced by the same interests and feelings with the people whom they represent.
in no age before and in no other country did man embodied in the state constitutions and adopted ever possess an election of the kind of government he lauds the principles of representative in the national one as unique american political principles and the best ways of securing liberty.
the world has not hitherto exhibited so fair an opportunity for promoting social happiness.
it is hoped for the honor of human nature that the result will prove the fallacy of those theories that mankind are incapable of self government.
the ancients not knowing the doctrine of representation were apt in their public meetings to run into confusion but in america this mode of taking the sense of the people is so well understood and so completely reduced to system that its most populous states are often peaceably convened in an assembly of deputies not too large for orderly deliberation and yet representing the whole in equal proportion.
these popular branches under which he would choose to live.
the constituent parts of the ancient free governments were thrown together by accident.
the freedom of modern european governments was for the most part obtained by concessions or liberality of monarchs or military leaders.
in america alone reason and liberty concurred in the formation of constitutions.
in one thing they were all perfect.
they left the people in the power of altering and amending them whenever they pleased.
in this happy peculiarity they placed the science of politics on a footing with the other sciences by opening it to improvements from experience and the discoveries of future ages.
by means of this power of amending american constitutions the friends of mankind have fondly hoped that oppression will one day be no more.
from james winthrop a n t i fe d e r a l i s t e s s a y s i g n e d a g r i p p a 1 7 8 7 a local official in middlesex massachusetts james winthrop published sixteen public letters between november 1787 and february 1788 opposing ratification of the constitution.
it is the opinion of the ablest writers on the subject that no extensive empire can be governed upon republican principles and that such a government will degenerate into a despotism unless it be made up of a confederacy of smaller states each having the full powers of internal regulation.
this is precisely the principle which has hitherto preserved our freedom.
no instance can be found of any free government of considerable extent which has been supported upon any other plan.
large and consolidated empires may indeed dazzle the eyes of a distant spectator with their splendor but if examined more nearly are always found to be full of misery.
it is under such tyranny that the spanish provinces languish and such would be our misfortune and degradation if we should submit to have the concerns of the whole empire managed by one empire.
to promote the happiness of the people it is necessary that there should be local laws and it is necessary that those laws should be made by the representatives of those who are immediately subject to them.
it is impossible for one code of laws to suit georgia and massachusetts.
they must therefore legislate for themselves.
yet there is i believe not one point of legislation that is not surrendered in the proposed plan.
questions of every kind respecting property are determinable in a continental court and so are all kinds of criminal causes.
the continental legislature has therefore a right to make rules in all cases.
no rights are reserved to the citizens.
this new system is therefore a consolidation of all the states into one large mass however diverse the parts may be of which it is composed.
a bill of rights.
serves to secure the minority against the usurpation and tyranny of the majority.
the experience of all mankind has proved the prevalence of a disposition to use power wantonly.
it is therefore as necessary to defend an individual against the majority in a republic as against the king in a monarchy.
questions 1.
why does ramsay feel that the power to amend the constitution is so important a political innovation.
why does winthrop believe that a bill of rights is essential in the constitution.
how do ramsay and winthrop differ concerning how the principle of representation operates in the united states.
7 founding a nation 1783 1789 the ratification debate and the origin of the bill of rights asked to surrender most of their powers to the federal government with no requirement that it respect americans basic liberties.
in general pro constitution sentiment flourished in the nations cities and in rural areas closely tied to the commercial marketplace.
the constitutions most energetic supporters were men of substantial property.
but what george bryan of pennsylvania a supporter of ratification called the golden phantom of prosperity also swung urban artisans laborers and sailors behind the movement for a government that would use its energy and power to revive the depressed economy.
anti federalism drew its support from small farmers in more isolated rural areas such as the hudson valley of new york western massachusetts and the southern backcountry.
in the end the supporters energy and organization coupled with their domination of the colonial press carried the day.
ninety two newspapers and magazines existed in the united states in 1787.
of these only twelve published a significant number of anti federalist pieces.
madison also won support for the new constitution by promising that the first congress would enact a bill of rights.
by mid 1788 the required nine states had ratified.
although there was strong dissent in massachusetts new york and virginia only rhode island and north carolina voted against ratification and they subsequently had little choice but to join the new government.
anti federalism died.
but as with other movements in american history that did not immediately achieve their goals for example the populists of the late nineteenth century some of the anti federalists ideas eventually entered the political mainstream.
to this day their belief that a too powerful central government is a threat to liberty continues to influence american political culture.
the bill of rights ironically the parts of the constitution americans most value today the freedoms of speech the press and religion protection against unjust criminal procedures equality before the law were not in the original document.
all of these but the last which was enshrined in the fourteenth amendment after the civil war were contained in the first ten amendments known as the bill of rights.
madison was so convinced that the balances of the constitution would protect liberty that he believed a bill of rights redundant or pointless amendments restraining federal power he believed would have no effect on the danger to liberty posed by unchecked majorities in the states and no list of rights could ever anticipate the numerous ways that congress might operate in the future.
parchment barriers to the abuse of authority he observed would prove least effective when most needed.
madisons prediction would be amply borne out at future times of popular hysteria such as during the red scare following world war i and the mccarthy era of the 1950s when all branches of government joined in trampling on freedom of expression and during world war ii when hatred of a foreign enemy led to the internment of more than 100 000 japanese americans most of them citizens of the united states.
nevertheless every new state constitution contained some kind of declaration of citizens rights and large numbers of americans federalist visions of freedom banner of the society of pewterers.

how does the banner reflect the pewterers pride in their craft.

7 founding a nation 1783 1789 an engraving and poem published in 1788 in an american newspaper after new york became the eleventh state to ratify the new constitution.
north carolina would ratify in 1789 and rhode island in 1790.
the ratification debate and the origin of the bill of rights and anti federalist alike believed the new national constitution should also have one.
in order to conciliate the minds of the people as madison put it he presented to congress a series of amendments that became the basis of the bill of rights which was ratified by the states in 1791.
the first amendment prohibited congress from legislating with regard to religion or infringing on freedom of speech freedom of the press or the right of assembly.
the second upheld the peoples right to keep and bear arms in conjunction with a well regulated militia others prohibited abuses such as arrests without warrants and forcing a person accused of a crime to testify against himself and reaffirmed the right to trial by jury.
in a sense the bill of rights offered a definition of the unalienable rights jefferson had mentioned in the declaration of independence rights inherent in the human condition.
not having been granted by government in the first place they could not be rescinded by government.
in case any had been accidentally omitted the ninth amendment declared that rights not specifically mentioned in the constitution were retained by the people its suggestion that the constitution was not meant to be complete opened the door to future legal recognition of rights not grounded in the actual text such as the right to privacy.
the tenth amendment meant to answer fears that the federal government would ride roughshod over the states affirmed that powers not delegated to the national government or prohibited to the states continued to reside with the states.
the roots and even the specific language of some parts of the bill of rights lay far back in english history.
the eighth amendment prohibiting excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishments incorporates language that originated in a declaration by the house of lords in 1316 and was repeated centuries later in the english bill of rights and the constitutions of a number of american states.
other provisions reflected the changes in american life brought about by the revolution.
the most remarkable of these was constitutional recognition of religious freedom.
unlike the declaration of independence which invokes the blessing of divine providence the constitution is a purely secular document that contains no reference to god and bars religious tests for federal officeholders.
the first amendment prohibits the federal government from legislating on the subject of religion a complete departure from british and colonial precedent.
under the constitution it was and remains possible as one critic complained for a papist a mohomatan a deist yea an atheist to become president of the united states.
madison was so adamant about separating church and state that he even opposed the appointment of chaplains to serve congress and the military.

7 founding a nation 1783 1789 the people turn to the bill of rights and especially the first amendment with its guarantees of freedom of speech the press and religion.
yet the bill of rights aroused little enthusiasm on ratification and for decades was all but ignored.
not until the twentieth century would it come to be revered as an indispensable expression of american freedom.
nonetheless the bill of rights subtly affected the language of liberty.
applying only to the federal government not the states it reinforced the idea that concentrated national power posed the greatest threat to freedom.
and it contributed to the long process whereby freedom came to be discussed in the vocabulary of rights.
among the most important rights were freedom of speech and the press vital building blocks of a democratic public sphere.
once an entitlement of members of parliament and colonial assemblies free speech came to be seen as a basic right of citizenship.
although the legal implementation remained to be worked out and serious infringements would occur at many points in american history the bill of rights did much to establish freedom of expression as a cornerstone of the popular understanding of american freedom.

the agricultural scene in the background was intended to suggest that indians should take up farming.
identity the colonial population had been divided by ethnicity religion class and status and united largely by virtue of their allegiance to britain.
the revolution created not only a new nation but also a new collective body the american people whose members were to enjoy freedom as citizens in a new political community.
since government in the united states rested on the will of the people it was all the more important to identify who the people were.
the constitution opens with the words we the people describing those who among other things are to possess the blessings of liberty as a birthright and pass them on to posterity abraham lincoln would later cite these words to argue that since the nation had been created by the people not the states the states could not dissolve it.
although one might assume that the people of the united states included all those living within the nations borders the text made clear that this was not the case.
the constitution identifies three populations inhabiting the united states indians treated as members of independent tribes and not part of the american body politic other persons that is slaves and the people only the third were entitled to american freedom.
every nation confronts the task of defining its identity.
historians have traditionally distinguished between civic nationalism which envisions the nation as a community open to all those devoted to its political institutions and social values and ethnic nationalism which defines the nation as a community of descent based on a shared ethnic heritage language and culture.
at first glance the united states appears to conform to the civic model.
it lacked a clear ethnic identity or long established national boundaries the political principles of the revolution held americans together.
to be an american all one had to do was commit oneself to an ideology of liberty equality and democracy.
from the outset however how did the definition of citizenship in the new republic exclude na t i v e a m e r i c a n s a n d a f r i c a n a m e r i c a n s.
american nationality combined both civic and ethnic definitions.
for most of our history american citizenship has been defined by blood as well as by political allegiance.
indians in the new nation the early republics policies toward indians and african americans illustrate the conflicting principles that shaped american nationality.
american leaders agreed that the west should not be left in indian hands but they disagreed about the indians ultimate fate.
the government hoped to encourage the westward expansion of white settlement which implied one of three things the removal of the indian population to lands even farther west their total disappearance or their incorporation into white civilization with the expectation that they might one day become part of american society.
many white americans probably most deemed indians savages unfit for citizenship.
indian tribes had no representation in the new government and the constitution excluded indians not taxed from being counted in determining each states number of congressmen.
the treaty system gave them a unique status within the american political system.
but despite this recognition of their sovereignty treaties were essentially ways of transferring land from indians to the federal government or the states.
often a the signing of the treaty of greenville of 1795 painted by an unknown member of general anthony waynes staff.
in the treaty a group of tribes ceded most of the area of the current state of ohio along with the site that became the city of chicago to the united states.

treaty was agreed to by only a small portion of a tribe but the whole tribe was then forced to accept its legitimacy.
during washingtons administration secretary of war henry knox hoped to deal with indians with a minimum of warfare and without undermining the new nations honor.
he recognized he said in 1794 that american treatment of the continents native inhabitants had been even more destructive to the indian than spains conduct in mexico and peru.
his conciliatory policy had mixed results.
congress forbade the transfer of indian land without federal approval.
but several states ignored this directive and continued to negotiate their own agreements.
open warfare continued in the ohio valley.
in 1791 little turtle leader of the miami confederacy inflicted a humiliating defeat on american forces led by arthur st clair the american governor of the northwest territory.
with 630 dead this was the costliest loss ever suffered by the united states army at the hands of indians.
in 1794 3 000 american troops under anthony wayne defeated little turtles forces at the battle of fallen timbers.
this led directly to the treaty of greenville of 1795 in which twelve indian tribes ceded most of ohio and indiana to the federal government.
the treaty also established the annuity system yearly grants of federal money to indian tribes that institutionalized continuing government influence in tribal affairs and gave outsiders considerable control over indian life.
many prominent figures however rejected the idea that indians were innately inferior to white americans.
thomas jefferson believed that indians merely lived at a less advanced stage of civilization.
indians could become full fledged members of the republic by abandoning communal landholding and hunting in favor of small scale farming.
once they possessed property jefferson told one indian group they could join us in our government and indeed mix your blood with ours to pursue the goal of assimilation congress in the 1790s authorized president washington to distribute agricultural tools and livestock to indian men and spinning wheels and looms to indian women.
to whites the adoption of american gender norms with men working the land and women tending to their homes would be a crucial sign that the indians were becoming civilized but the american notion of civilization required so great a transformation of indian life that most tribes rejected it.
one missionary was told if we want to work we know how to do it according to our own way and as it pleases us to indians freedom meant retaining tribal autonomy and identity including the ability to travel widely in search of game.
since our acquaintance with our brother white people declared a mohawk speaker at a 1796 treaty council that which we call freedom and liberty becomes an entire stranger to us there was no room for indians who desired to retain their traditional way of life in the american empire of liberty.
blacks and the republic by 1790 the number of african americans far exceeded the indian population within the united states.
the status of free blacks was somewhat indeterminate.
nowhere does the original constitution define who in fact are c h.

the people citizens of the united states.
the individual states were left free to determine the boundaries of liberty.
the norths gradual emancipation acts assumed that former slaves would remain in the country not be colonized abroad.
northern statesmen like hamilton jay and franklin worked for abolition and some helped to establish schools for black children.
during the era of the revolution free blacks enjoyed at least some of the legal rights accorded to whites including in most states the right to vote.
some cast ballots in the election of delegates to conventions that ratified the constitution.
the large majority of blacks of course were slaves and slavery rendered them all but invisible to those imagining the american community.
slaves as edmund randolph the nations first attorney general put it were not.
constituent members of our society and the language of liberty did not apply to them.
one of the eras most widely read books letters from an american farmer published in france in 1782 by hector st john de crvecoeur strikingly illustrated this process of exclusion.
born in france crvecoeur had taken part in the unsuccessful defense of quebec during the seven years war.
instead of returning home he came to new york city in 1759.
as a trader and explorer he visited most of the british mainland colonies as well as the ohio and mississippi valleys.
crvecoeur eventually married the daughter of a prominent new york landowner and lived with his own family on a farm in orange county.
seeking to remain neutral during the war of independence he suffered persecution by both patriots and the british and eventually returned to france.
in letters from an american farmer crvecoeur popularized the idea which would become so common in the twentieth century of the united states as a melting pot.
here he wrote individuals of all nations are melted into a new one the american left behind all his ancient prejudices and manners and received new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced crvecoeur was well aware of what he called the horrors of slavery but when he posed the famous question what then is the american this new man he answered a mixture of english scotch irish french dutch germans and swedes.
he is either a european or the descendant of a european this at a time when fully one fifth of the population the highest proportion in u s history consisted of africans and their descendants.
like crvecoeur many white americans excluded blacks from their conception of the american people.
the constitution empowered congress to create a uniform system by which immigrants became citizens and the naturalization act of 1790 offered the first legislative definition of american nationality.
with no debate congress restricted the process of becoming a citizen from abroad to free white persons the law initiated a policy that some historians with only partial accuracy call open immigration for europeans the process was indeed open.
only in the last quarter of the nineteenth century were groups of whites beginning with prostitutes convicted felons lunatics and persons likely to become a public charge barred from entering the country.
for the first century of the republic virtually the only white persons in the entire world ineligible to claim american citizenship were those unwilling to renounce hereditary titles of nobility as required in an act of how did the definition of citizenship in the new republic exclude na t i v e a m e r i c a n s a n d a f r i c a n a m e r i c a n s.
and yet the word white in the naturalization act excluded a large majority of the worlds population from emigrating to the asylum for mankind and partaking in the blessings of american freedom.
for eighty years no non white immigrant could become a naturalized citizen.
africans were allowed to do so in 1870 but not until the 1940s did persons of asian origin become eligible.
native americans were granted american citizenship in 1924.
jefferson s l a v e r y and race mans liberty john locke had written flowed from his having reason to deny liberty to those who were not considered rational beings did not seem to be a contradiction.
white americans increasingly viewed blacks as permanently deficient in the qualities that made freedom possible the capacity for self control reason and devotion to the larger community.
these were the characteristics that jefferson in a famous comparison of the races in his book notes on the state of virginia published in 1785 claimed blacks lacked partly due to natural incapacity and partly because the bitter experience of slavery had quite understandably he felt rendered them disloyal to the nation.
jefferson was reluctant to degrade a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings which their creator may perhaps have given them he therefore voiced the idea as a suspicion only that blacks are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind yet this unfortunate circumstance he went on is a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these people jefferson was obsessed with the connection between heredity and environment race and intelligence.
his belief that individuals abilities and achievements are shaped by social conditions inclined him to hope that no group was fixed permanently in a status of inferiority.
he applied this principle as has been noted to indians whom he believed naturally the equal of whites in intelligence.
in the case of blacks however he could not avoid the suspicion that nature had permanently deprived them of the qualities that made republican citizenship possible.
benjamin banneker a free african american from maryland who had taught himself the principles of mathematics sent jefferson a copy of an astronomical almanac he had published along with a plea for the abolition of slavery.
jefferson replied nobody wishes more than i do to see such proofs as you exhibit that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to the other colors of men to his friend joel barlow however jefferson suggested that a white person must have helped banneker with his calculations.
nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate wrote jefferson than that these people are to be free yet he felt that america should have a homogeneous citizenry with common experiences values and inborn abilities.
americans essential sameness would underpin the ideal of equal rights for all making it possible to realize the idea of the public good.
black americans jefferson affirmed should eventually enjoy the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence but in africa or the caribbean not in the united states.
he foresaw indians merging with whites into a single people but he was horrified by the idea of miscegenation between blacks and whites.
unlike indians blacks he believed were unfit the artist john singleton copley best known for his portraits of prominent americans and britons painted this young african american in the late 1770s.
the subject probably worked on a new england fishing boat.
this is one of the eras very few portraits of a black person.
7 founding a nation 1783 1789 the people for economic independence and political self government.
freeing the slaves without removing them from the country would endanger the nations freedom.
in his will tadeusz kosciuszko a polish aristocrat who fought for american independence left funds for jefferson to purchase and free slaves giving them liberty in my name but when his friend died in 1817 jefferson transferred the money to an official of the american colonization society an organization dedicated to sending freed slaves to africa.
eventually the funds were divided among kosciuszkos heirs in europe.
jefferson reflected the divided mind of his generation.
some prominent virginians assumed that blacks could become part of the american nation.
edward coles an early governor of illinois brought his slaves from virginia freed them and settled them on farms.
washington who died in 1799 provided in his will that his 277 slaves would become free after the death of his wife martha.
feeling uncomfortable living among men and women who looked forward to her death she emancipated them the following year.
jefferson thought of himself as a humane owner.
the slave cabins at his estate monticello one visitor wrote are all much better than i have seen on any other plantation although he could not help adding that their cabins form a most unpleasant contrast with the palace that rises so near them believing the slave trade immoral jefferson tried to avoid selling slaves to pay off his mounting debts.
but his will provided for the freedom of only five all relatives of his slave sally hemings with whom he appears to have had fathered one or more children.
when he died in 1826 jefferson owed so much money that his property including the majority of his more than 200 slaves was sold at auction thus destroying the slave community he had tried to keep intact.
principles of freedom even as the decline of apprenticeship and indentured servitude narrowed the gradations of freedom among the white population the revolution widened the divide between free americans and those who remained in slavery.
race one among many kinds of legal and social inequality in colonial america now emerged as a convenient justification for the existence of slavery in a land that claimed to be committed to freedom.
blacks natural faculties alexander hamilton noted in 1779 were probably as good as ours but the existence of slavery he added makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason or experience we the people increasingly meant only white americans.
principles of freedom which embrace only half mankind are only half systems declared the anonymous author of a fourth of july speech in hartford connecticut in 1800.
declaration of independence he wondered where art thou now the answer came from a richmond newspaper tell us not of principles.
those principles have been annihilated by the existence of slavery among us suggested reading suggested reading books amar akhil reed.

an early american coin bearing an image of liberty and the word itself as directed by congress in a 1792 law.
l o n april 30 1789 in new york city the nations temporary capital george washington became the first president under the new constitution.
all sixty nine electors had awarded him their votes.
dressed in a plain suit of superfine american broad cloth rather than european finery washington took the oath of office on the balcony of federal hall before a large crowd that reacted with loud and repeated shouts of approval.
he then retreated inside to deliver his inaugural address before members of congress and other dignitaries.
washingtons speech expressed the revolutionary generations conviction that it had embarked on an experiment of enormous historical importance whose outcome was by no means certain.
the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government washington proclaimed depended on the success of the american experiment in self government.
most americans seemed to agree that freedom was the special genius of american institutions.
in a resolution congratulating washington on his inauguration the house of representatives observed that he had been chosen by the freest people on the face of the earth when the time came to issue the nations first coins congress directed that they bear the image not of the head of state as would be the case in a monarchy but an impression emblematic of liberty with the word itself prominently displayed.
american leaders believed that the success of the new government depended above all on maintaining political harmony.
they were especially anxious to avoid the emergence of organized political parties which had already appeared in several states.
parties were considered divisive and disloyal.
they serve to organize faction washington would later declare and to substitute the aims of a small but artful minority for the will of the nation the constitution makes no mention of political parties and the original method of electing the president assumes that candidates will run as individuals not on a party ticket otherwise the second place finisher would not have become vice president.
nonetheless national political parties quickly arose.
originating in congress they soon spread to the general populace.
instead of harmony the 1790s became in the words of one historian an age of passion with each party questioning the loyalty of the other and lambasting its opponent in the most extreme terms.
political rhetoric became inflamed because the stakes seemed so high nothing less than the legacy of the revolution the new nations future and the survival of american freedom.
what issues made the politics of the 1790s so divisive.
p o l i t i c s i n a n a g e o f pa s s i o n president washington provided a much needed symbol of national unity.
having retired to private life after the war of independence despite some army officers suggestion that he set himself up as a dictator he was a model of self sacrificing republican virtue.
his vice president john adams was widely respected as one of the main leaders in the drive for independence.
washington brought into his cabinet some of the new nations most prominent political leaders including thomas jefferson as secretary of state and alexander hamilton to head the treasury department.
he also appointed a supreme court of six members headed by john jay of new york.
but harmonious government proved short lived.
h a m i lt o n s program political divisions first surfaced over the financial plan developed by secretary of the treasury hamilton in 1790 and 1791.
hamiltons immediate aims were to establish the nations financial stability bring to the governments support the countrys most powerful financial interests and encourage economic development.
his long term goal was to make the united states a major commercial and military power.
hamiltons model was great britain.
the goal of national greatness he believed could never be realized if the government suffered from the same weaknesses as under the articles of confederation.
hamiltons program had five parts.
the first step was to establish the new nations credit worthiness that is to create conditions under which persons would loan money to the government by purchasing its bonds confident that they would be repaid.
hamilton proposed that the federal government assume responsibility for paying off at its full face value the national debt inherited from the war of independence as well as outstanding debts of the states.
second he called for the creation of a new national debt.
the old debts would be replaced by new interest bearing bonds issued to the governments creditors.
this would give men of economic substance a stake in promoting the new nations stability since the stronger and more economically secure the federal government the more likely it would be to pay its debts.
the third part of hamiltons program called for the creation of a bank of the united states modeled on the bank of england to serve as the nations main financial agent.
a private corporation rather than a branch of the government it would hold public funds issue bank notes that would serve as currency and make loans to the government when necessary all the while returning a tidy profit to its stockholders.
fourth to raise revenue hamilton proposed a tax on producers of whiskey.
finally in a report on manufactures delivered to congress in december 1791 hamilton called for the imposition of a tariff a tax on imported foreign goods and government subsidies to encourage the development of factories that could manufacture products currently purchased from abroad.
privately hamilton promoted an unsuccessful effort to build an industrial city at present day paterson new jersey.
he also proposed the creation of a national army to deal with uprisings like shayss rebellion.

washington had died in 1799 and was now immortalized as a symbol of freedom independence and national pride.
6 the revolution within americans have frequently defined the idea of freedom in relation to its opposite which in the eighteenth century meant the highly unequal societies of the old world.
this engraving the coronation of louis xvi of france reveals the splendor of the royal court but also illustrates the world of fixed unequal classes and social privilege repudiated by american revolutionaries.
democratizing freedom expanding the political nation with liberty and equality as their rallying cries previously marginalized groups advanced their demands.
long accepted relations of dependency and restrictions on freedom suddenly appeared illegitimate a process not intended by most of the leading patriots.
in political social and religious life americans challenged the previous domination by a privileged few.
in the end the revolution did not undo the obedience to which male heads of household were entitled from their wives and children and at least in the southern states their slaves.
for free men however the democratization of freedom was dramatic.
nowhere was this more evident than in challenges to the traditional limitation of political participation to those who owned property.
in the political thought of the eighteenth century democracy had several meanings.
one derived from the writings of aristotle defined democracy as a system in which the entire people governed directly.
however this was thought to mean mob rule.
another definition viewed democracy as the condition of primitive societies which was not appropriate for the complex modern world.
british thinkers sometimes used the word when referring to the house of commons the democratic branch of a mixed government.
yet another understanding revolved less around the structure of government than the fact that a government served the interests of the people rather than an elite.
in the wake of the american revolution the term came into wider use to express the popular aspirations for greater equality inspired by the struggle for independence.
how did equality become a stronger component of american freedom after the revolution.
we are all from the cobbler up to the senator become politicians declared a boston letter writer in 1774.
throughout the colonies election campaigns became freewheeling debates on the fundamentals of government.
universal male suffrage religious toleration and even the abolition of slavery were discussed not only by the educated elite but by artisans small farmers and laborers now emerging as a self conscious element in politics.
in many colonies turned states the militia composed largely of members of the lower orders became a school of political democracy its members demanded the right to elect all their officers and to vote for public officials whether or not they met age and property qualifications.
they thereby established the tradition that service in the army enabled excluded groups to stake a claim to full citizenship.
the revolution in p e n n s y lva n i a the revolutions radical potential was more evident in pennsylvania than in any other state.
elsewhere the established leadership either embraced independence by the spring of 1776 or split into pro british and pro independence factions in new york for example the livingstons and their supporters ended up as patriots the de lanceys as loyalists.
but in pennsylvania nearly the entire prewar elite opposed independence fearing that severing the tie with britain would lead to rule by the rabble and to attacks on property.
the vacuum of political leadership opened the door for the rise of a new pro independence grouping based on the artisan and lower class communities of philadelphia and organized in extralegal committees and the local militia.
their leaders included thomas paine the author of common sense benjamin rush a local physician timothy matlack the son of a local brewer and thomas young who had already been involved in the sons of liberty in albany and boston.
as a group these were men of modest wealth who stood outside the merchant elite had little political influence before 1776 and believed strongly in democratic reform.
paine and young had only recently arrived in philadelphia.
they formed a temporary alliance with supporters of independence in the second continental congress then meeting in philadelphia who disapproved of their strong belief in equality but hoped to move pennsylvania toward a break with britain.
as the public sphere expanded far beyond its previous boundaries equality became the rallying cry of pennsylvanias radicals.
they particularly attacked property qualifications for voting.
god gave mankind freedom by nature declared the anonymous author of the pamphlet the people the best governors and made every man equal to his neighbors the people therefore were the best guardians of their own liberties and every free man should be eligible to vote and hold office.
in june 1776 a broadside a printed sheet posted in public places warned citizens to distrust great and over grown rich men who were inclined to be framing distinctions in society three months after independence pennsylvania adopted a new state constitution that sought to institutionalize democracy by concentrating power in a one house legislature elected annually by all men over age twenty one who paid taxes.
it abolished the office of governor dispensed with property qualifications for officeholding and provided that c h.
6 the revolution within democratizing freedom schools with low fees be established in every county.
it also included clauses guaranteeing freedom of speech and of writing and religious liberty.
the john dickinsons copy of the pennsylvania constitution of 1776 with handwritten proposals for changes.
dickinson one of the more conservative advocates of independence felt the new state constitution was far too democratic.
he crossed out a provision that all free men should be eligible to hold office and another declaring the people not bound by laws that did not promote the common good new constitutions like pennsylvania every state adopted a new constitution in the aftermath of independence.
nearly all americans now agreed that their governments must be republics meaning that their authority rested on the consent of the governed and that there would be no king or hereditary aristocracy.
the essence of a republic paine wrote was not the particular form of government but its object the public good but as to how a republican government should be structured so as to promote the public good there was much disagreement.
pennsylvanias new constitution reflected the belief that since the people had a single set of interests a single legislative house was sufficient to represent it.
in part to counteract what he saw as pennsylvanias excessive radicalism john adams in 1776 published thoughts on government which insisted that the new constitutions should create balanced governments whose structure would reflect the division of society between the wealthy represented in the upper house and ordinary men who would control the lower.
a powerful governor and judiciary would ensure that neither class infringed on the liberty of the other.
adamss call for two house legislatures was followed by every state except pennsylvania georgia and vermont.
but only his own state massachusetts gave the governor an effective veto over laws passed by the legislature.
americans had come to believe that excessive royal authority had undermined british liberty.
they had long resented efforts by appointed governors to challenge the power of colonial assemblies.
they preferred power to rest with the legislature.
the right to vote the issue of requirements for voting and officeholding proved far more contentious.
conservative patriots struggled valiantly to reassert the rationale for the old voting restrictions.
it was ridiculous wrote one pamphleteer to think that every silly clown and illiterate mechanic artisan deserved a voice in government.
to john adams as conservative on the internal affairs of america as he had been radical on independence freedom and equality were opposites.
men without property he believed had no judgment of their own and the removal of property qualifications therefore would confound and destroy all distinctions and prostrate all ranks to one common level eliminating traditional social ranks however was precisely the aim of the eras radical democrats including the most influential promoter of independence thomas paine.
the provisions of the new state constitutions reflected the balance of power between advocates of internal change and those who feared excessive democracy.
the least democratization occurred in the southern states whose highly deferential political traditions enabled the landed gentry to retain their control of political affairs.
in virginia and south carolina the new constitutions retained property qualifications for voting and authorized the gentry dominated legislature to choose the governor.
how did equality become a stronger component of american freedom after the revolution.
maryland combined a low property qualification for voting with high requirements for officeholding including 5 000 a veritable fortune for the governor.
the most democratic new constitutions moved much of the way toward the idea of voting as an entitlement rather than a privilege but they generally stopped short of universal suffrage even for free men.
vermonts constitution of 1777 was the only one to sever voting completely from financial considerations eliminating not only property qualifications but the requirement that voters pay taxes.
pennsylvanias constitution no longer required ownership of property but it retained the taxpaying qualification.
as a result it enfranchised nearly all of the states free male population but left a small number mainly paupers and domestic servants still barred from voting.
nonetheless even with the taxpaying requirement it represented a dramatic departure from the colonial practice of restricting the suffrage to those who could claim to be economically independent.
it elevated personal liberty in the words of one essayist to a position more important than property ownership in defining the boundaries of the political nation.
democratizing government overall the revolution led to a great expansion of the right to vote.
by the 1780s with the exceptions of virginia maryland and new york a large majority of the adult white male population could meet voting requirements.
new jerseys new state constitution of 1776 granted the suffrage to all inhabitants who met a property qualification.
until the state added the word male along with white in 1807 property owning women mostly widows did cast ballots.
the new constitutions also expanded the number of legislative seats with the result that numerous men of lesser property assumed political office.
the debate over the suffrage would of course continue for many decades.
for white men the process of democratization did not run its course until the age of jackson for women and nonwhites it would take much longer.
even during the revolution however in the popular language of politics if not in law freedom and an individuals right to vote had become interchangeable.
the suffrage declared a 1776 petition of disenfranchised north carolinians was a right essential to and inseparable from freedom without it americans could not enjoy equal liberty a proposed new constitution for massachusetts was rejected by a majority of the towns in 1778 partly because it contained a property qualification for voting.
all men were born equally free and independent declared the town of lenox.
how could they defend their life and liberty and property without a voice in electing public officials.
a new draft which retained a substantial requirement for voting in state elections but allowed virtually all men to vote for town officers was approved in 1780.
and every state except south carolina provided for annual legislative elections to ensure that representatives remained closely accountable to the people.
henceforth political freedom would mean not only as in the past a peoples right to be ruled by their chosen representatives but also an individuals right to political participation.
6 the revolution within toward religious toleration t o wa r d r e l i g i o u s t o l e r at i o n a 1771 image of new york city lists some of the numerous churches visible from the new jersey shore illustrating the diversity of religions practiced in the city.
as remarkable as the expansion of political freedom was the revolutions impact on american religion.
religious toleration declared one virginia patriot was part of the common cause of freedom in britain dissenters protestants who belonged to other denominations than the anglican church had long invoked the language of liberty in seeking repeal of the laws that imposed various disabilities on non anglicans.
few however included catholics in their ringing calls for religious freedom.
we have already seen that some colonies like rhode island and pennsylvania had long made a practice of toleration.
but freedom of worship before the revolution arose more from the reality of religious pluralism than from a well developed theory of religious liberty.
apart from rhode island new england had little homegrown experience of religious pluralism.
indeed authorities in england had occasionally pressed the regions rulers to become more tolerant.
before the revolution most colonies supported religious institutions with public funds and discriminated in voting and officeholding against catholics jews and even dissenting protestants.
on the very eve of independence baptists who refused to pay taxes to support local congregational ministers were still being jailed in massachusetts.
while our country are pleading so high for liberty the victims complained yet they are denying of it to their neighbors catholic americans the war of independence weakened the deep tradition of american anticatholicism.
the first continental congress denounced the quebec act of 1774 which as noted in the previous chapter allowed canadian catholics to worship freely as part of a plot to establish popery in north america.
but a year later when the second continental congress decided on an ill fated invasion of canada it invited the inhabitants of quebec to join in the struggle against britain assuring them that protestants and catholics could readily cooperate.
however predominantly catholic quebec preferred being ruled from distant london rather than from boston or philadelphia.
in 1778 the united states formed an alliance with france a catholic nation.
benedict arnold justified his treason in part by saying that an alliance with the enemy of the protestant faith was too much for him to bear.
but the indispensable assistance provided by france to american victory strengthened the idea that catholics had a role to play in the newly independent nation.
in fact this represented a marked departure from the traditional notion that the full rights of englishmen only applied to protestants.
when americas first roman catholic bishop james carroll of maryland visited boston in 1791 he received a cordial welcome.
how did the expansion of religious liberty after the revolution reflect the new american ideal of freedom.
the founders and religion the end of british rule immediately threw into question the privileged position enjoyed by the anglican church in many colonies.
in virginia for example backcountry scotch irish presbyterian farmers demanded relief from taxes supporting the official anglican church.
the free exercise of our rights of conscience one patriotic meeting resolved formed an essential part of our liberties many of the leaders of the revolution considered it essential for the new nation to shield itself from the unruly passions and violent conflicts that religious differences had inspired during the past three centuries.
men like thomas jefferson john adams james madison and alexander hamilton believed religion necessary as a foundation of public morality.
but they viewed religious doctrines through the enlightenment lens of rationalism and skepticism.
they believed in a benevolent creator but not in supernatural interventions into the affairs of men.
jefferson wrote a version of the bible and a life of jesus that insisted that while jesus had lived a deeply moral life he was not divine and performed no miracles.
in discussing the natural history of the blue ridge mountains in his book notes on the state of virginia he rejected the biblical account of creation in favor of a prolonged process of geological change.
separating church and state the drive to separate church and state brought together deists like jefferson who hoped to erect a wall of separation that would free politics and the exercise of the intellect from religious control with members of evangelical sects who sought to protect religion from the corrupting embrace of government.
religious leaders continued to adhere to the traditional definition of christian liberty submitting to gods will and leading a moral life but increasingly felt this could be achieved without the support of government.
christs kingdom as isaac backus the baptist leader put it was not of this world the movement toward religious freedom received a major impetus during the revolutionary era.
throughout the new nation states disestablished their established churches that is deprived them of public funding and special legal privileges although in some cases they appropriated money for the general support of protestant denominations.
the seven state constitutions that began with declarations of rights all declared a commitment to the free exercise of religion to be sure every state but new york whose constitution of 1777 established complete religious liberty kept intact colonial provisions barring jews from voting and holding public office.
seven states limited officeholding to protestants.
massachusetts retained its congregationalist establishment well into the nineteenth century.
its new constitution declared church attendance compulsory while guaranteeing freedom of individual worship.
it would not end public financial support for religious institutions until 1833.
throughout the country however catholics gained the right to worship without persecution.
marylands constitution of 1776 restored to the large catholic population the civil and political rights that had been denied them for nearly a century.
6 the revolution within a draft of thomas jeffersons virginia bill for establishing religious freedom published in 1779 in order to encourage public discussion of the issue.
the bill was enacted in 1786.
toward religious toleration jefferson and religious liberty in virginia thomas jefferson drew up a bill for establishing religious freedom which was introduced in the house of burgesses in 1779 and adopted after considerable controversy in 1786.
i have sworn on the altar of god he would later write eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man jefferson viewed established churches as a major example of such despotism and as his statement reveals believed that religious liberty served gods will.
jeffersons bill whose preamble declared that god hath created the mind free eliminated religious requirements for voting and officeholding and government financial support for churches and barred the state from forcing individuals to adopt one or how did the expansion of religious liberty after the revolution reflect the new american ideal of freedom.
another religious outlook.
late in life jefferson would list this measure along with the declaration of independence and the founding of the university of virginia as the three accomplishments leaving out his two terms as president for which he wished to be remembered.
religious liberty became the model for the revolutionary generations definition of rights as private matters that must be protected from governmental interference.
in an overwhelmingly christian though not necessarily churchgoing nation the separation of church and state drew a sharp line between public authority and a realm defined as private reinforcing the idea that rights exist as restraints on the power of government.
it also offered a new justification for the idea of the united states as a beacon of liberty.
in successfully opposing a virginia tax for the general support of christian churches james madison insisted that one reason for the complete separation of church and state was to reinforce the principle that the new nation offered asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every nation and religion the revolution and the churches thus the revolution enhanced the diversity of american christianity and expanded the idea of religious liberty.
but even as the separation of church and state created the social and political space that allowed all kinds of religious institutions to flourish the culture of individual rights of which that separation was a part threatened to undermine church authority.
one example was the experience of the moravian brethren who had emigrated from germany to north carolina on the eve of independence.
to the dismay of the moravian elders younger members of the community like so many other americans of the revolutionary generation insisted on asserting their alleged freedom and human rights some became unruly and refused to obey the orders of town leaders.
many rejected the communitys tradition of arranged marriages insisting on choosing their own husbands and wives.
to the elders the idea of individual liberty which they called disparagingly the american freedom was little more than an opportunity for temptation a threat to the spirit of self sacrifice and communal loyalty essential to christian liberty.
but despite such fears the revolution did not end the influence of religion on american society quite the reverse.
american churches in the words of one presbyterian leader learned to adapt to living at a time when a spirit of liberty prevails thanks to religious freedom the early republic witnessed an amazing proliferation of religious denominations.
the most well established churches anglican presbyterian and congregationalist found themselves constantly challenged by upstarts like free will baptists and universalists.
today even as debate continues over the ezra stiles the president of yale college drew this sketch of a flag in his diary on april 24 1783 shortly after congress ratified the treaty of paris.
thirteen stars surround the coat of arms of pennsylvania.
the banner text illustrates the linkage among virtue liberty and american independence.
6 the revolution within defining economic freedom proper relationship between spiritual and political authority more than 1 300 religions are practiced in the united states.
a the self an engraving in the columbian magazine 1789 illustrates various admirable qualities radiating outward from the virtuous citizen including love for ones family community and nation.
virtuous citizenry despite the separation of church and state colonial leaders were not hostile to religion.
most were devout christians and even deists who attended no organized church believed religious values reinforced the moral qualities necessary for a republic to prosper.
public authority continued to support religious values in laws barring non christians from office and in the continued prosecution of blasphemy and breaches of the sabbath.
pennsylvanias new democratic constitution required citizens to acknowledge the existence of god and it directed the legislature to enact laws for the prevention of vice and immorality in the nineteenth century pennsylvanias lawmakers took this mandate so seriously that the state became as famous for its laws against swearing and desecrating the sabbath as it had been in colonial times for religious freedom.
patriot leaders worried about the character of future citizens especially how to encourage the quality of virtue the ability to sacrifice self interest for the public good.
some like jefferson john adams and benjamin rush put forward plans for the establishment of free state supported public schools.
these would instruct future citizens in what adams called the principles of freedom equipping them for participation in the nowexpanded public sphere and for the wise election of representatives.
a broad diffusion of knowledge was essential for a government based on the will of the people to survive and for america to avoid the fixed class structure of europe.
no nation jefferson wrote could expect to be ignorant and free defining economic freedom toward free labor in economic as well as political and religious affairs the revolution rewrote the definition of freedom.
in colonial america slavery was one part of a broad spectrum of kinds of unfree labor.
in the generation after independence with the rapid decline of indentured servitude and apprenticeship and the transformation of paid domestic service into an occupation for blacks and white females the halfway houses between slavery and freedom disappeared at least for white men.
the decline of these forms of labor had many causes.
wage workers became more available as indentured servants completed their terms of required labor and considerable numbers of servants and apprentices took advantage of the turmoil of the revolution to escape from their masters.
the democratization of freedom contributed to these changes.
the lack of freedom inherent in apprenticeship and servitude increasingly came how did the definition of economic freedom change after the revolution and who benefited from the changes.
to be seen as incompatible with republican citizenship.
ebenezer fox a young apprentice on a massachusetts farm later recalled how he and other youths made a direct application of the doctrines we heard daily in relation to the oppression of the mother country to our own circumstance.
i thought that i was doing myself a great injustice by remaining in bondage when i ought to go free fox became one of many apprentices during the revolution who decided to run away or as he put it to liberate myself on the eve of the battles of lexington and concord in 1775 fox and a friend set off for rhode island.
after briefly working as a sailor fox still a teenager joined the continental army.
in 1784 a group of respectable new yorkers released a newly arrived shipload of indentured servants on the grounds that their status was contrary to.
the idea of liberty this country has so happily established by 1800 indentured servitude had all but disappeared from the united states.
this development sharpened the distinction between freedom and slavery and between a northern economy relying on what would come to be called free labor that is working for wages or owning a farm or shop and a southern economy ever more heavily dependent on the labor of slaves.
the soul of a republic americans of the revolutionary generation were preoccupied with the social conditions of freedom.
could a republic survive with a sizable dependent class of citizens.
a general and tolerably equal distribution of landed property proclaimed the educator and newspaper editor noah webster is the whole basis of national freedom equality he added was the very soul of a republic it outstripped in importance liberty of the press trial by jury and other palladia of freedom even a conservative like john adams who distrusted the eras democratic upsurge hoped that every member of society could acquire land so that the multitude may be view from bushongo tavern an engraving from the columbian magazine 1788 depicts the landscape of york county pennsylvania exemplifying the kind of rural independence many americans thought essential to freedom.
6 the revolution within defining economic freedom possessed of small estates and the new nation could avoid the emergence of fixed and unequal social classes.
at the revolutions radical edge some patriots believed that government had a responsibility to limit accumulations of property in the name of equality.
to most free americans however equality meant equal opportunity rather than equality of condition.
many leaders of the revolution nevertheless assumed that in the exceptional circumstances of the new world with its vast areas of available land and large population of independent farmers and artisans the natural workings of society would produce justice liberty and equality.
like many other americans of his generation thomas jefferson believed that to lack economic resources was to lack freedom.
jefferson favored a limited state but he also believed that government could help create freedoms institutional framework.
his proudest achievements included laws passed by virginia abolishing entail the limitation of inheritance to a specified line of heirs to keep an estate within a family and primogeniture the practice of passing a familys land entirely to the eldest son.
these measures he believed would help to prevent the rise of a future aristocracy to the same end jefferson proposed to award fifty acres of land to every person of full age who did not already possess it another way government could enhance the liberty of its subjects.
of course the land jefferson hoped would secure american liberty would have to come from indians.
the politics of inflation the revolution thrust to the forefront of politics debates over whether local or national authorities should take steps to bolster household independence and protect americans livelihoods by limiting price increases.
economic dislocations sharpened the controversy.
to finance the war congress issued hundreds of millions of dollars in paper money.
coupled with wartime disruption of agriculture and trade and the hoarding of goods by some americans hoping to profit from shortages this produced an enormous increase in prices.
the country charged a letter to a philadelphia newspaper in 1778 had been reduced to the brink of ruin by the infamous practices of monopolizers hunger the writer warned will break through stone walls between 1776 and 1779 more than thirty incidents took place in which crowds confronted merchants accused of holding scarce goods off the market.
often they seized stocks of food and sold them at the traditional just price a form of protest common in eighteenth century england.
in one such incident a crowd of 100 massachusetts women accused an eminent wealthy stingy merchant of hoarding coffee opened his warehouse and carted off the goods.
a large concourse of men wrote abigail adams stood amazed silent spectators of the whole transaction a broadside printed by the extralegal philadelphia price control committee setting the retail prices of various goods such as coffee sugar and rum.
advocates of a free market strongly opposed the committees efforts.
the debate over free trade in 1779 with inflation totally out of control in one month prices in philadelphia jumped 45 percent congress urged states to adopt measures to fix wages and prices.
the policy embodied the belief that the task of republican government was to promote the public good not individuals self interest.
bitter comments appeared in the philadelphia press about the how did the definition of economic freedom change after the revolution and who benefited from the changes.
citys elite expending huge sums on public dinners and other extravaganzas while many in the city were destitute of the necessities of life but when a committee of safety tried to enforce price controls it met spirited opposition from merchants and other advocates of a free market.
in opposition to the traditional view that men should sacrifice for the public good believers in freedom of trade argued that economic development arose from economic self interest.
just as newton had revealed the inner workings of the natural universe so the social world also followed unchanging natural laws among them that supply and demand regulated the prices of goods.
adam smiths great treatise on economics the wealth of nations published in england in 1776 was beginning to become known in the united states.
smiths argument that the invisible hand of the free market directed economic life more effectively and fairly than governmental intervention offered intellectual justification for those who believed that the economy should be left to regulate itself.
advocates of independence had envisioned america released from the british navigation acts trading freely with all the world.
opponents of price controls advocated free trade at home as well.
let trade be as free as air wrote one merchant.
natural liberty would regulate prices.
here were two competing conceptions of economic freedom one based on the traditional view that the interests of the community took precedence over the property rights of individuals the other that unregulated economic freedom would produce social harmony and public gain.
after 1779 the latter view gained ascendancy.
in 1780 robert morris a philadelphia merchant and banker became director of congressional fiscal policy.
state and federal efforts to regulate prices ceased.
but the clash between these two visions of economic freedom would continue long after independence had been achieved.
yield to the mighty current of american freedom so a member of the south carolina legislature implored his colleagues in 1777.
the current of freedom swept away not only british authority but also the principle of hereditary rule the privileges of established churches long standing habits of deference and hierarchy and old limits on the political nation.
yet in other areas the tide of freedom encountered obstacles that did not yield as easily to its powerful flow.
the limits of liberty colonial loyalists not all americans shared in the democratization of freedom brought on by the american revolution.
loyalists those who retained their allegiance to the crown experienced the conflict and its aftermath as a loss of liberty.
many leading loyalists had supported american resistance in the 1760s but drew back at the prospect of independence and war.
loyalists included some of the most prominent americans and some of the most humble.
altogether an estimated 20 to 25 percent of free americans remained loyal to the british and nearly 20 000 fought on their side.
at some points in the war loyalists serving with the british outnumbered washingtons army.
there were loyalists in every colony but they were most numerous in new york pennsylvania and the backcountry of the carolinas and georgia.
6 the revolution within the limits of liberty some were wealthy men whose livelihoods depended on close working relationships with britain lawyers merchants anglican ministers and imperial officials.
many feared anarchy in the event of an american victory.
liberty one wrote can have no existence without obedience to the laws the struggle for independence heightened existing tensions between ethnic groups and social classes within the colonies.
some loyalist ethnic minorities like highland scots in north carolina feared that local majorities would infringe on their freedom to enjoy cultural autonomy.
in the south many backcountry farmers who had long resented the domination of public affairs by wealthy planters sided with the british.
so did tenants on the new york estates of patriot landlords like the livingston family.
robert livingston had signed the declaration of independence.
when the army of general burgoyne approached livingstons manor in 1777 tenants rose in revolt hoping the british would confiscate his land and distribute it among themselves.
their hopes were dashed by burgoynes defeat at saratoga.
in the south numerous slaves sided with the british hoping an american defeat would bring them freedom.

neighbors are on opposite sides children are against their fathers freedom of expression is often a casualty of war and many americans were deprived of basic rights in the name of liberty.
after dr abner beebe of east haddam connecticut spoke very freely in favor of the british a mob attacked his house and destroyed his gristmill.
beebe himself was assaulted stripped naked and hot pitch tar was poured upon him the new state governments or in other instances crowds of patriots suppressed newspapers thought to be loyal to britain.
pennsylvania arrested and seized the property of quakers mennonites and moravians pacifist denominations who refused to bear arms because of their religious beliefs.
with the approval of congress many states required residents to take oaths of allegiance to the new nation.
those who refused were denied the right to vote and in many cases forced into exile.
the flames of discord wrote one british observer are sprouting from the seeds of liberty some wealthy loyalists saw their land confiscated and sold at auction.
twenty eight estates belonging to new hampshire governor john wentworth and his family were seized as were the holdings of great new york loyalist landlords like the de lancey and philipse families.
most of the buyers of this land were merchants lawyers and established landowners.
unable to afford the purchase price tenants had no choice but to continue to labor for the new owners.

there were loyalists in every colony they were most numerous in new york and north and south carolina.
6 the revolution within the limits of liberty when the war ended as many as 100 000 loyalists including 20 000 slaves were banished from the united states or emigrated voluntarily mostly to britain canada or the west indies rather than live in an independent united states.
but for those who remained hostility proved to be short lived.
in the treaty of paris of 1783 as noted in chapter 5 americans pledged to end the persecution of loyalists by state and local governments and to restore property seized during the war.
american leaders believed the new nation needed to establish an international reputation for fairness and civility.
states soon repealed their test oaths for voting and officeholding.
loyalists who did not leave the country were quickly reintegrated into american society although despite the promise of the treaty of paris confiscated loyalist property was not returned.
the indians revolution another group for whom american independence spelled a loss of freedom the indians was less fortunate.
despite the proclamation of 1763 discussed in chapter 4 colonists had continued to move westward during the 1760s and early 1770s leading indian tribes to complain of intrusions on their land.
lord dunmore virginias royal governor observed in 1772 that he had found it impossible to restrain the americans.
they do not conceive that government has any right to forbid their taking possession of a vast tract of country or to force them to honor treaties with indians.
kentucky the principal hunting ground of southern cherokees and numerous ohio valley indians became a flash point of conflict among settlers land speculators and native americans with the faraway british government seeking in vain to impose order.
many patriot leaders including george washington patrick henry and thomas jefferson were deeply involved in western land speculation.
washington himself had acquired over 60 000 acres of land in western pennsylvania after the seven years war by purchasing land vouchers a form of soldiers wages from his men at discount rates.
indeed british efforts to restrain land speculation west of the line specified by the proclamation of 1763 had been one of the many grievances of virginias revolutionary generation.
about 200 000 native americans lived east of the mississippi river in 1790.
like white americans indians divided in allegiance during the war of independence.
some like the stockbridge tribe in massachusetts suffered heavy losses fighting the british.
many tribes tried to maintain neutrality only to see themselves break into pro american and pro british factions.
most of the iroquois nations sided with the british but the oneida joined the americans.
despite strenuous efforts to avoid conflict members of the iroquois confederacy for the first time faced each other in battle.
after the war the oneida submitted to congress claims for losses suffered during the war including sheep hogs kettles frying pans plows and pewter plates evidence of how fully they had been integrated into the market economy.
in the south younger cherokee leaders joined the british while older chiefs tended to favor the americans.
other southern tribes like the choctaw and creek remained loyal to the crown.
among the grievances listed by jefferson in the declaration of independence was britains enlisting savages to fight on its side.
but in the h o w d i d t h e r e v o l u t i o n d i m i n i s h t h e f r e e d o m s o f b o t h l o y a l i s t s a n d na t i v e a m e r i c a n s.
war that raged throughout the western frontier savagery was not confined to either combatant.
in the ohio country the british encouraged indian allies to burn frontier farms and settlements.
for their part otherwise humane patriot leaders ignored the traditional rules of warfare when it came to indians.
william henry drayton a leader of the patriot cause in south carolina and the states chief justice in 1776 advised officers marching against the cherokees to cut up every indian cornfield burn every indian town and enslave all indian captives.
three years later washington dispatched an expedition led by general john sullivan against hostile iroquois with the aim of the total destruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible after his campaign ended sullivan reported that he had burned forty indian towns destroyed thousands of bushels of corn and uprooted a vast number of fruit trees and vegetable gardens.
many iroquois communities faced starvation.
in the ohio valley as we will see in chapter 7 fighting did not end until the 1790s.
white freedom indian freedom independence created governments democratically accountable to voters who coveted indian land.
indeed to many patriots access to indian land was one of the fruits of american victory.
driving the indians from the ohio valley wrote jefferson would add to the empire of liberty an extensive and fertile country but liberty for whites meant loss of liberty for indians.
the whites were no sooner free themselves a pequot william apess would later write than they turned on the poor indians independence offered the opportunity to complete the process of dispossessing indians of their rich lands in upstate new york the ohio valley and the southern backcountry.
the only hope for the indians jefferson wrote lay in their removal a cartoon depicting a british officer buying the scalps of patriots from indians.
jefferson listed british incitement of indians against the colonists as one of americans grievances in the declaration of independence.
6 the revolution within slavery and the revolution beyond the mississippi even as the war raged americans forced defeated tribes like the cherokee to cede most of their land.
american independence a group of visiting indians told the spanish governor at st louis was the greatest blow that could have been dealt us the treaty of paris marked the culmination of a century in which the balance of power in eastern north america shifted away from the indians and toward white americans.
the displacement of british power to canada coming twenty years after the departure of the french left indians with seriously diminished white support.
some indian leaders like joseph brant a young mohawk in upstate new york hoped to create an indian confederacy lying between canada and the new united states.
he sided with the british to try to achieve this goal.
but in the treaty of paris the british abandoned their indian allies agreeing to recognize american sovereignty over the entire region east of the mississippi river completely ignoring the indian presence.
to indians freedom meant defending their own independence and retaining possession of their land.
like other americans they appropriated the language of the revolution and interpreted it according to their own experiences and for their own purposes.
the iroquois declared one spokesman were a free people subject to no power on earth creeks and choctaws denied having done anything to forfeit their independence and natural rights when massachusetts established a system of state guardianship over previously self governing tribes a group of mashpees petitioned the legislature claiming for themselves the rights of man and complaining of this infringement of freedom freedom had not played a major part in indians vocabulary before the revolution.
by the early nineteenth century dictionaries of indian languages for the first time began to include the word.
in a sense indians definition of their rights was becoming americanized.
but there seemed to be no permanent place for the descendants of the continents native population in a new nation bent on creating an empire in the west.
slavery and the revolution while indians experienced american independence as a real threat to their own liberty african americans saw in the ideals of the revolution and the reality of war an opportunity to claim freedom.
when the united states declared its independence in 1776 the slave population had grown to 500 000 about one fifth of the new nations inhabitants.
slaveowning and slave trading were accepted routines of colonial life.
advertisements announcing the sale of slaves and seeking the return of runaways filled colonial newspapers.
sometimes the same issues of patriotic newspapers that published accounts of the activities of the sons of liberty or arguments against the stamp act also contained slave sale notices.
the language of slavery and freedom slavery played a central part in the language of revolution.
apart from liberty it was the word most frequently invoked in the eras legal and what was the impact of the revolution on slavery.
political literature.
eighteenth century writers frequently juxtaposed freedom and slavery as the two extremes of happiness and misery in society yet in the eras debates over british rule slavery was primarily a political category shorthand for the denial of ones personal and political rights by arbitrary government.
those who lacked a voice in public affairs declared a 1769 petition demanding an expansion of the right to vote in britain were enslaved by the eve of independence the contrast between britain a kingdom of slaves and america a country of free men had become a standard part of the language of resistance.
such language was employed without irony even in areas where nearly half the population in fact consisted of slaves.
south carolina one writer declared in 1774 was a sacred land of freedom where it was impossible to believe that slavery shall soon be permitted to erect her throne colonial writers of the 1760s occasionally made a direct connection between slavery as a reality and slavery as a metaphor.
few were as forthright as james otis of massachusetts whose pamphlets did much to popularize the idea that parliament lacked the authority to tax the colonies and regulate their commerce.
freedom otis insisted must be universal what man is or ever was born free if every man is not otis wrote of blacks not as examples of the loss of rights awaiting free americans but as flesh and blood british subjects entitled to all the civil rights of such otis was hardly typical of patriot leaders.
but the presence of hundreds of thousands of slaves powerfully affected the meaning of freedom for the leaders of the american revolution.
in a famous speech to parliament warning against attempts to intimidate the colonies the british statesman edmund burke suggested that familiarity with slavery made colonial leaders unusually sensitive to threats to their own liberties.
where freedom was a privilege not a common right he observed those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom on the other hand many british observers could not resist pointing out the colonists apparent hypocrisy.
how is it asked dr samuel johnson that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty from the drivers of negroes obstacles to abolition the contradiction between freedom and slavery seems so self evident that it is difficult today to appreciate the power of the obstacles to abolition.
at the time of the revolution slavery was already an old institution in america.
it existed in every colony and formed the basis of the economy and social structure from maryland southward.
at least 40 percent of virginias population and even higher proportions in georgia and south carolina were slaves.
virtually every founding father owned slaves at one point in his life including not only southern planters but northern merchants lawyers and farmers.
john adams and tom paine were notable exceptions.
advertisement for newly arrived slaves in a savannah newspaper 1774.
even as colonists defended their own liberty against the british the buying and selling of slaves continued.
6 the revolution within slavery and the revolution thomas jefferson owned more than 100 slaves when he wrote of mankinds unalienable right to liberty and everything he cherished in his own manner of life from lavish entertainments to the leisure that made possible the pursuit of arts and sciences ultimately rested on slave labor.
some patriots in fact argued that slavery for blacks made freedom possible for whites.
eliminating the great bulk of the dependent poor from the political nation left the public arena to men of propertied independence.
owning slaves offered a route to the economic autonomy widely deemed necessary for genuine freedom a point driven home by a 1780 virginia law that rewarded veterans of the war of independence with 300 acres of land and a slave.
south carolina and georgia promised every white military volunteer a slave at the wars end.
so too the lockean vision of the political community as a group of individuals contracting together to secure their natural rights could readily be invoked to defend bondage.
nothing was more essential to freedom in this view than the right of self government and the protection of property against outside interference.
these principles suggested that for the government to seize property including slave property against the owners will would be an infringement on liberty.
if government by the consent of the governed formed the essence of political freedom then to require owners to give up their slave property would reduce them to slavery.

cause of general liberty nonetheless by imparting so absolute a value to liberty and defining freedom as a universal entitlement rather than a set of rights specific to a particular place or people the revolution inevitably raised questions about the status of slavery in the new nation.
before independence there had been little public discussion of the institution even though enlightened opinion in the atlantic world had come to view slavery as morally wrong and economically inefficient a relic of a barbarous past.
as early as 1688 a group of german quakers issued a protest regarding the rights of blacks declaring it as unjust to have them slaves as it is to have other white ones samuel sewall a boston merchant published the selling of joseph in 1700 the first antislavery tract printed in america.
all the sons of adam sewall insisted were entitled to have equal right unto liberty slavery as noted in chapter 4 had initially been banned in georgia although it later came to sustain the rice based plantation economy in that colony.
during the course of the eighteenth century antislavery sentiments had spread among pennsylvanias quakers whose belief that all persons possessed the divine inner light made them particularly receptive.
but it was during the revolutionary era that slavery for the first time became a focus of public debate.
the pennsylvania patriot benjamin rush in 1773 called upon advocates for american liberty to espouse the cause of.
general liberty and warned that slavery was one of those what was the impact of the revolution on slavery.
national crimes that one day would bring national punishment jefferson as mentioned in the previous chapter unsuccessfully tried to include criticism of slavery in the declaration of independence.
although a slaveholder himself in private he condemned slavery as a system that every day imposed on its victims more misery than ages of that which the colonists rose in rebellion to oppose petitions for freedom the revolution inspired widespread hopes that slavery could be removed from american life.
most dramatically slaves themselves appreciated that by defining freedom as a universal right the leaders of the revolution had devised a weapon that could be used against their own bondage.
the language of liberty echoed in slave communities north and south.
living amid freedom but denied its benefits slaves appropriated the patriotic ideology for their own purposes.
the most insistent advocates of freedom as a universal entitlement were african americans who demanded that the leaders of the struggle for independence live up to their self proclaimed creed.
as early as 1766 white charlestonians had been shocked when their opposition to the stamp act inspired a group of blacks to parade about the city crying liberty nine years later the provincial congress of south carolina felt compelled to investigate the high notions of liberty the struggle against britain had inspired among the slaves.
the first concrete steps toward emancipation in revolutionary america were freedom petitions arguments for liberty presented to new englands courts and legislatures in the early 1770s by enslaved africanamericans.
how one such petition asked could america seek release from english tyranny and not seek the same for disadvantaged africans in her midst some slaves sued in court for being illegally detained in slavery the turmoil of war offered other avenues to freedom.
many slaves ran away from their masters and tried to pass as freeborn.
the number of fugitive slave advertisements in colonial newspapers rose dramatically in the 1770s and 1780s.
as one owner put it in accounting for his slave jims escape i believe he has nothing in view but freedom in 1776 the year of american independence lemuel haynes a black member of the massachusetts militia and later a celebrated minister urged that americans extend their conception of freedom.
if liberty were truly an innate principle for all mankind haynes insisted even an african had as equally good a right to his liberty in common with englishmen throughout the revolutionary period petitions pamphlets and sermons by blacks expressed astonishment that white patriots failed to realize that every principle from which america has acted demanded emancipation.
blacks sought to make white americans understand slavery as a concrete reality the denial of all the essential elements of freedom not merely as a metaphor for the loss of political self determination.
petitioning for their freedom in 1773 a group of new england slaves exclaimed we have no property.
we have no wives.
no children.
we have no city.

my love of freedom wrote the black poet phillis wheatley in 1783 arose from the cruel fate of being snatchd from africs shore.
brought as a slave to boston in 1761 wheatley learned to read and published her first poem in a new england newspaper in 1765 when she was around twelve years old.
the fact that a volume of her poems had to be printed with a testimonial from prominent citizens including patriot leader john hancock affirming that she was in fact the author illustrates that many whites found it difficult to accept the idea of blacks intellectual ability.
yet by invoking the revolutions ideology of liberty to demand their own rights and by defining freedom as a universal entitlement blacks demonstrated how american they had become even as they sought to redefine what american freedom in fact represented.
british a portrait of the poet phillis wheatley 1753 1784.
emancipators as noted in the previous chapter some 5 000 slaves fought for american independence and many thereby gained their freedom.
yet far more slaves obtained liberty from the british.
lord dunmores proclamation of 1775 and the phillipsburgh proclamation of general henry clinton issued four years later offered sanctuary to slaves who escaped to british lines.
numerous signers of the declaration of independence lost slaves as a result.
thirty of thomas jeffersons slaves ran away to the british as did slaves owned by patrick henry and james madison.
all told nearly 100 000 slaves including one quarter of all the slaves in south carolina and onethird of those in georgia deserted their owners and fled to british lines.
this was by far the largest exodus from the plantations until the outbreak of the civil war.
some of these escaped slaves were recaptured as the tide of battle turned in the patriots favor.
but at the wars end some 20 000 were living in three enclaves of british control new york charleston and savannah.
george washington insisted they must be returned.
sir guy carleton the british commander in new york replied that to do so would be a dishonorable violation of the public faith since they had been promised their freedom.
in the end more than 15 000 black men women and children accompanied the british out of the country.
they ended up in nova scotia england and sierra leone a settlement for former slaves from the united states established by the british on the coast of west africa.
some were re enslaved in the west indies.
a number of their stories were indeed remarkable.
harry washington an african born slave of george washington had run away from mount vernon in 1771 but was recaptured.
in 1775 he fled to join lord dunmore and eventually became a corporal in a black british regiment the black pioneers.
he eventually ended up in sierra leone where in 1800 he took part in an unsuccessful uprising by black settlers against the british appointed government.
the issue of compensation for the slaves who departed with the british poisoned relations between britain and the new united states for decades to come.
finally in 1827 britain agreed to make payments to 1 100 americans who claimed they had been improperly deprived of their slave property.
what was the impact of the revolution on slavery.
the book of negroes compiled by british commanders when they evacuated new york city in 1783 lists some 3 000 african americans who had sought their freedom behind british lines and departed with the british army.
many ended up in nova scotia some eventually made their way to sierra leone in west africa.

voluntary emancipations for a brief moment the revolutionary upheaval appeared to threaten the continued existence of slavery.
during the war of independence nearly every state prohibited or discouraged the further importation of slaves recent h1 voices of freedom from abigail adams to john adams braintree mass.
march 31 1776 from their home in massachusetts abigail adams maintained a lively correspondence with her husband while he was in philadelphia serving in the continental congress.
in this letter she suggests some of the limits of the patriots commitment to liberty.
which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors.
do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.
remember all men would be tyrants if they could.
if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves i wish you would write me a letter half as long as i write you and tell me if you may where your fleet have gone.
what sort of defense virginia can make against our common enemy.
whether it is so situated as to make an able defense.
i have sometimes been ready to think that the passion for liberty cannot be equally strong in the breasts of those who have been accustomed to deprive their fellow creatures of theirs.
of this i am certain that it is not founded upon that generous and christian principle of doing to others as we would that others should do unto us.
i long to hear that you have declared an independency and by the way in the new code of laws bound by any such laws in which we have no voice or representation.
that your sex are naturally tyrannical is a truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of master for the more tender and endearing one of friend.
why then not put it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity.
men of sense in all ages abhor those customs which treat us only as the vassals of your sex.
regard us then as beings placed by providence under your protection and in imitation of the supreme being make use of that power only for our happiness.
f r o m pe t i t i o n s o f s l a v e s t o the massachusetts legislature 1773 and 1777 many slaves saw the struggle for independence as an opportunity to assert their own claims to freedom.
among the first efforts toward abolition were petitions by massachusetts slaves to their legislature.
the efforts made by the legislative of this province in their last sessions to free themselves from slavery gave us who are in that deplorable state a high degree of satisfaction.
we expect great things from men who have made such a noble stand against the designs of their fellow men to enslave them.
we cannot but wish and hope sir that you will have the same grand object we mean civil and religious liberty in view in your next session.
the divine spirit of freedom seems to fire every breast on this continent.
your petitioners apprehend that they have in common with all other men a natural and unalienable right to that freedom which the great parent of the universe hath bestowed equally on all mankind and which they have never forfeited by any compact or agreement whatever but they were unjustly dragged by the hand of cruel power from their dearest friends and.
from a populous pleasant and plentiful country and in violation of laws of nature and of nations and in defiance of all the tender feelings of humanity brought here.
to be sold like beast s of burden.
among a people professing the mild religion of jesus.
in imitation of the laudable example of the good people of these states your petitioners have long and patiently waited the event of petition after petition by them presented to the legislative body.
they cannot but express their astonishment that it has never been considered that every principle from which america has acted in the course of their unhappy difficulties with great britain pleads stronger than a thousand arguments in favor of your petitioners and their desire to be restored to the enjoyment of that which is the natural right of all men.
questions 1.
what does abigail adams have in mind when she refers to the unlimited power husbands exercise over their wives.
how do the slaves employ the principles of the revolution for their own aims.
what do these documents suggest about the boundaries of freedom in the era of the american revolution.
6 the revolution within slavery and the revolution from africa.
the war left much of the plantation south in ruins.
during the 1780s a considerable number of slaveholders especially in virginia and maryland voluntarily emancipated their slaves.
in 1796 robert carter iii a member of one of virginias wealthiest families provided for the gradual emancipation of the more than 400 slaves he owned.
in the same year richard randolph a member of another prominent virginia family drafted a will that condemned slavery as an infamous practice provided for the freedom of about 90 slaves and set aside part of his land for them to own.
farther south however the abolition process never got under way.
when the british invaded south carolina during the war john laurens whose father henry was charlestons leading merchant and revolutionaryera statesman proposed to lead a corps of emancipated blacks in the defense of liberty south carolinas leaders rejected the idea.
they would rather lose the war than lose their slaves.
however black soldiers from the colony of saint domingue some free and some slave fought on the american side as part of a french contingent in the unsuccessful defense of savannah georgia in 1778.
abolition an engraving from a commemorative pitcher presented to the abolitionist joseph curtis by the new york manumission society in 1819 depicts liberty releasing slaves from bondage.
curtis holds aloft a mirror reflecting the rising sun.
founded in 1785 by alexander hamilton john jay and others the society was instrumental in the passage of new yorks 1799 law providing for the gradual abolition of slavery.
in the north between 1777 when vermont drew up a constitution that banned slavery and 1804 when new jersey acted every state north of maryland took steps toward emancipation the first time in recorded history that legislative power had been invoked to eradicate slavery.
but even here where slavery was peripheral to the economy the method of abolition reflected how property rights impeded emancipation.
generally abolition laws did not free living slaves.
instead they provided for the liberty of any child born in the future to a slave mother but only after he or she had served the mothers master until adulthood as compensation for the owners future economic loss.
children born to slave mothers in pennsylvania after passage of the states emancipation act of 1780 had to serve the owner for twenty eight years far longer than had been customary for white indentured servants.
these laws gave indentured servitude rapidly declining among whites a new lease on life in the case of northern blacks.
abolition in the north was a slow drawn out process.
for slaves alive when the northern laws were passed hopes for freedom rested on their own ability to escape and the voluntary actions of their owners.
and many northern slaveholders proved reluctant indeed when it came to liberating their slaves.
new york city where one fifth of the white families owned at least one slave in 1790 recorded only seventy six such voluntary acts between 1783 and 1800.
the first national census in 1790 recorded 21 000 slaves still living in new york and 11 000 in new jersey.
new yorker john jay chief justice of the united states owned five slaves in 1800.
as late as 1830 the census revealed that there were still 3 500 slaves in the north.
the last slaves in connecticut did not become free until 1848.
in 1860 eighteen elderly slaves still resided in new jersey.
free black communities all in all the revolution had a contradictory impact on american slavery and therefore on american freedom.
gradual as it was the abolition of slav visions of freedom liberty displaying the arts and sciences.
this 1792 painting by samuel jennings is one of the few visual images of the early republic explicitly to link slavery with tyranny and liberty with abolition.
the female figure offers books to newly freed slaves.
other forms of knowledge depicted include a globe an artists palette and the top of a column evoking the republic of ancient rome.
beneath her left foot lies a broken chain.
in the background free slaves enjoy some leisure time.
painted at the same time as the haitian revolution was spreading fear of a slave rebellion the work celebrates emancipation rather than seeing it as threatening.
questions 1.
what attributes of freedom does the artist emphasize most strongly in the painting.
how do the figures in the painting convey ideas about race.
6 the revolution within a tray painted by an unknown artist in the early nineteenth century portrays lemuel haynes a celebrated black preacher and critic of slavery.
daughters of liberty ery in the north drew a line across the new nation creating the dangerous division between free and slave states.
abolition in the north voluntary emancipation in the upper south and the escape of thousands from bondage created for the first time in american history a sizable free black population many of whose members took new family names like freeman or freeland.
on the eve of independence virtually every black person in america had been a slave.
now free communities with their own churches schools and leaders came into existence.
they formed a standing challenge to the logic of slavery a haven for fugitives and a springboard for further efforts at abolition.
in 1776 fewer than 10 000 free blacks resided in the united states.
by 1810 their numbers had grown to nearly 200 000 most of them living in maryland and virginia.
in all the states except virginia south carolina and georgia free black men who met taxpaying or property qualifications enjoyed the right to vote under new state constitutions.
as the widespread use of the term citizens of color suggests the first generation of free blacks at least in the north formed part of the political nation.
for many americans white as well as black the existence of slavery would henceforth be recognized as a standing affront to the ideal of american freedom a disgrace to a free government as a group of new yorkers put it.
in 1792 when samuel jennings of philadelphia painted liberty displaying the arts and sciences he included among the symbols of freedom a slaves broken chain graphically illustrating how freedom had become identified not simply with political independence but with emancipation.
nonetheless the stark fact is that slavery survived the war of independence and thanks to the natural increase of the slave population continued to grow.
the national census of 1790 revealed that despite all those who had become free through state laws voluntary emancipation and escape the number of slaves in the united states had grown to 700 000 200 000 more than in 1776.
daughters of liberty revolutionary women the revolutionary generation included numerous women who contributed to the struggle for independence.
deborah sampson the daughter of a poor massachusetts farmer disguised herself as a man and in 1782 at age twenty one enlisted in the continental army.
sampson displayed remarkable courage participating in several battles and extracting a bullet from her own leg so as not to have a doctor discover her identity.
ultimately her commanding officer discovered her secret but kept it to himself and she was honorably discharged at the end of the war.
years later congress how did the revolution affect the status of women.
awarded her a soldiers pension.
other patriotic women participated in crowd actions against merchants accused of seeking profits by holding goods off the market until their prices rose contributed homespun goods to the army and passed along information about british army movements.
in philadelphia esther reed the wife of patriot leader joseph reed and sarah franklin bache the daughter of benjamin franklin organized a ladies association to raise funds to assist american soldiers.
they issued public broadsides calling for the women of america to name a treasuress in each county in the united states who would collect funds and forward them to the governors wife or if he were unmarried to mistress washington referring to themselves as brave americans who had been born for liberty the ladies association illustrated how the revolution was propelling women into new forms of public activism.
within american households women participated in the political discussions unleashed by independence.
was not every fireside john adams later recalled a theater of politics adamss own wife abigail adams as has been mentioned was a shrewd analyst of public affairs.
mercy otis warren the sister of james otis and husband of james warren a founder of the boston committee of correspondence was another commentator on politics.
she promoted the revolutionary cause in poems and dramas and later published a history of the struggle for independence.
gender and in this painting from 1797 deborah sampson who donned mens clothes to fight in the war of independence is portrayed in genteel female attire.
politics gender nonetheless formed a boundary limiting those entitled to the full blessings of american freedom.
lucy knox the wife of general henry knox wrote her husband during the war that when he returned home he should not consider himself commander in chief of your own house but be convinced that there is such a thing as equal command but the winning of independence did not alter the family law inherited from britain.
the principle of coverture described in chapter 1 remained intact in the new the 1781 cipher book a notebook for mathematics exercises of martha ryan a north carolina girl contains images of ships and a port town and the patriotic slogan liberty or death illustrating how women shared in the political culture of the revolutionary era.
6 the revolution within keep within compass a lateeighteenth century engraving illustrates the happiness of a virtuous woman if she remains within the world of the home and family and some of the troubles awaiting her if she ventures outside.
the woman appears in a space marked off by a compass an instrument for drawing a circle.
daughters of liberty nation.
the husband still held legal authority over the person property and choices of his wife.
the words to have and to hold appeared in deeds conveying land from one owner to another and in common marriage vows.
despite the expansion of democracy politics remained overwhelmingly a male realm.
for men political freedom meant the right to self government the power to consent to the individuals and political arrangements that ruled over them.
for women however the marriage contract superseded the social contract.
a womans relationship to the larger society was mediated through her relationship with her husband.
in both law and social reality women lacked the essential qualification of political participation the opportunity for autonomy based on ownership of property or control of ones own person.
since the common law included women within the legal status of their husbands women could not be said to have property in themselves in the same sense as men.
men took pride in qualities like independence and masculinity that distinguished them from women and still considered control over their families an element of freedom.
among the deprivations of slavery cited by a group of black male petitioners in 1774 was that it prevented their wives from submitting themselves to husbands in all things as the natural order of the universe required.
many women who entered public debate felt the need to apologize for their forthrightness.
a group of quaker women who petitioned congress during the war of independence protesting the mistreatment of men who would not take an oath of loyalty hoped the lawmakers would take no offense at the freedom of women most men considered women to be naturally submissive and irrational and therefore unfit for citizenship.
while public debate in the revolutionary era viewed mens rights as natural entitlements discussions of womens roles emphasized duty and obligations not individual liberty.
their rights were nonpolitical deriving from their roles as wives and mothers.
overall the republican citizen was by definition male.
in a notable case a massachusetts court returned to james martin confiscated property previously owned by his mother who had fled the state during the revolution with her loyalist husband.
like other states massachusetts seized the land of those who had supported the british.
but the court ruled it was unreasonable to expect a wife to exercise independent political judgment.
to rebel against the king was one thing but one could hardly ask mrs martin to rebel against her husband.
therefore the court reasoned she should not have been punished for taking the british side.
republican motherhood the revolution nonetheless did produce an improvement in status for many women.
according to the ideology of republican motherhood that emerged as a result of independence women played an indispensable role by training future citizens.
the foundation of national morality wrote john adams must be laid in private families even though republican motherhood ruled out direct female involvement in politics it encouraged the expansion of educational opportunities for women so that they could how did the revolution affect the status of women.
impart political wisdom to their children.
women wrote benjamin rush needed to have a suitable education to enable them to instruct their sons in the principles of liberty and government the idea of republican motherhood reinforced the trend already evident in the eighteenth century toward the idea of companionate marriage a voluntary union held together by affection and mutual dependency rather than male authority.
in her letter to john adams quoted above abigail adams recommended that men should willingly give up the harsh title of master for the more tender and endearing one of friend the structure of family life itself was altered by the revolution.
in colonial america those living within the household often included indentured servants apprentices and slaves.
after independence southern slaves remained rhetorically at least members of the owners family in the north however with the rapid decline of various forms of indentured servitude and apprenticeship a more modern definition of the household as consisting of parents and their children took hold.
hired workers whether domestic servants or farm laborers were not considered part of the family.
like slaves some free women adapted the rhetoric of the revolution to their own situation.
ann baker carson later recalled how she became estranged from the tyrannical husband she had married at age sixteen.
i was an american she wrote.
a land of liberty had given me birth.
i felt myself his equal she left the marriage rather than continue as a female slave but unlike the case of actual slaves the subordination of women did not become a major source of public debate until long after american independence.
the arduous struggle for portrait of john and elizabeth lloyd cadwalader and their daughter anne.
this 1772 portrait of a prominent philadelphia businessman and his family by the american artist charles willson peale illustrates the emerging ideal of the companionate marriage which is based on affection rather than male authority.
liberty the revolution changed the lives of virtually every american.
as a result of the long struggle against british rule the public sphere and with it the two pages from a little pretty pocketbook intended for the instruction and amusement of little master tommy and pretty miss polly 1787 which taught virtuous behavior to young children.
the revolution stimulated interest in improving female education.

right to vote expanded markedly.
bound labor among whites declined dramatically religious groups enjoyed greater liberty blacks mounted a challenge to slavery in which many won their freedom and women in some ways enjoyed a higher status.
on the other hand for indians many loyalists and the majority of slaves american independence meant a deprivation of freedom.
in the words of one british admirer the genuine liberty on which america is founded is totally and entirely a new system of things and men a new nation which defined itself as an embodiment of freedom had taken its place on the world stage.
not only britain but all europe are spectators of the conflict the arduous struggle for liberty wrote ezra stiles a future president of yale college in 1775.
we consider ourselves as laying the foundation of a glorious future empire and acting a part for the contemplation of the ages like stiles many other americans were convinced that their struggle for independence had worldwide significance.
american independence indeed formed part of a larger set of movements that transformed the atlantic world.
the year 1776 saw not only paines common sense and jeffersons declaration but also the publication in england of adam smiths the wealth of nations which attacked the british policy of closely regulating trade and jeremy benthams fragment on government which criticized the nature of british government.
the winds of change were sweeping across the atlantic world.
the ideals of the american revolution helped to inspire countless subsequent struggles for social equality and national independence from the french revolution which exploded in 1789 to the uprising that overthrew the slave system in haiti in the 1790s to the latin american wars for independence in the early nineteenth century and numerous struggles of colonial peoples for nationhood in the twentieth.
but within the new republic the debate over who should enjoy the blessings of liberty would continue long after independence had been achieved.

may commerce flourish and industry be rewarded declared philadelphias mariners and shipbuilders.
throughout the era of the revolution americans spoke of their nation as a rising empire destined to populate and control the entire north american continent.
while europes empires were governed by force americas would be different.
in jeffersons phrase it would be an empire of liberty bound together by a common devotion to the principles of the declaration of independence.
already the united states exceeded in size great britain spain and france combined.
as a new nation it possessed many advantages including physical isolation from the old world a significant asset between 1789 and 1815 when european powers were almost constantly at war a youthful population certain to grow much larger and a broad distribution of property ownership and literacy among white citizens.
on the other hand while americans dreamed of economic prosperity and continental empire the nations prospects at the time of independence were not entirely promising.
control of its vast territory was by no means secure.
nearly all of the 3 9 million americans recorded in the first national census of 1790 lived near the atlantic coast.
large areas west of the appalachian mountains remained in indian hands.
the british retained military posts on american territory near the great lakes and there were fears that spain might close the port of new orleans to american commerce on the mississippi river.
away from navigable waterways communication and transportation were primitive.
the country was overwhelmingly rural fewer than one american in thirty lived in a place with 8 000 inhabitants or more.
the population consisted of numerous ethnic and religious groups and some 700 000 slaves making unity difficult to achieve.
no republican government had ever been established over so vast a territory or with so what were the achievements and problems of the confederation government.
diverse a population.
local loyalties outweighed national patriotism.
we have no americans in america commented john adams.
it would take time for consciousness of a common nationality to sink deep roots.
today with the united states the most powerful country on earth it is difficult to recall that in 1783 the future seemed precarious indeed for the fragile nation seeking to make its way in a world of hostile great powers.
profound questions needed to be answered.
what course of development should the united states follow.
how could the competing claims of local self government sectional interests and national authority be balanced.
who should be considered full fledged members of the american people entitled to the blessings of liberty.
these issues became the focus of heated debate as the first generation of americans sought to consolidate their new republic.
a m e r i c a u n d e r t h e c o n f e d e r at i o n the articles of confederation the first written constitution of the united states was the articles of confederation drafted by congress in 1777 and ratified by the states four years later.
the articles sought to balance the need for national coordination of the war of independence with widespread fear that centralized political power posed a danger to liberty.
it explicitly declared the new national government to be a perpetual union but it resembled less a blueprint for a common government than a treaty for mutual defense in its own words a firm league of friendship among the states.
under the articles the thirteen states retained their individual sovereignty freedom and independence the national government consisted of a one house congress in which each state no matter how large or populous cast a single vote.
there was no president to enforce the laws and no judiciary to interpret them.
major decisions required the approval of nine states rather than a simple majority.
the only powers specifically granted to the national government by the articles of confederation were those essential to the struggle for independence declaring war conducting foreign affairs and making treaties with other governments.
congress had no real financial resources.
it could coin money but lacked the power to levy taxes or regulate commerce.
its revenue came mainly from contributions by the individual states.
to amend the articles required the unanimous consent of the states a formidable obstacle to change.
various amendments to strengthen the national government were proposed during the seven years 1781 1788 when the articles of confederation were in effect but none received the approval of all the states.
4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 slavery and empire agreement whereby spain subcontracted to a foreign power the right to provide slaves to spanish america was an important diplomatic prize.
britains acquisition of the asiento from the dutch in the treaty of utrecht of 1713 was a major step in its rise to commercial supremacy.
in the british empire of the eighteenth century free laborers working for wages were atypical and slavery was the norm.
slave plantations contributed mightily to english economic development.
the first mass consumer goods in international trade were produced by slaves sugar rice coffee and tobacco.
the rising demand for these products fueled the rapid growth of the atlantic slave trade.
atlantic trade in the eighteenth century the caribbean remained the commercial focus of the british empire and the major producer of revenue for the crown.
but slave grown products from the mainland occupied a larger and larger part of atlantic commerce.
a series of triangular trading routes crisscrossed the atlantic carrying british manufactured goods to africa and the colonies colonial products including tobacco indigo sugar and rice to europe and slaves from africa to the new world.
most colonial vessels however went back and forth between cities like new york charleston and savannah and to ports in the caribbean.
areas where slavery was only a minor institution also profited from slave labor.
merchants in new york massachusetts and rhode island participated actively in the slave trade shipping slaves from africa to the caribbean or southern colonies.
the slave economies of the west indies were the largest market for fish grain livestock and lumber exported from new england and the middle colonies.
in 1720 half the ships entering or leaving new york harbor were engaged in trade with the caribbean.
indeed one historian writes the growth and prosperity of the emerging society of free colonial british a mid eighteenth century image of a woman going to church in lima peru accompanied by two slaves.

were achieved as a result of slave labor in britain itself the profits from slavery and the slave trade stimulated the rise of ports like liverpool and bristol and the growth of banking shipbuilding and insurance.
they also helped to finance the early industrial revolution.
overall in the eighteenth century atlantic commerce consisted primarily of slaves crops produced by slaves and goods destined for slave societies.
it should not be surprising that for large numbers of free colonists and europeans freedom meant in part the power and right to enslave others.
and as slavery became more and more entrenched so too as the quaker abolitionist john woolman commented in 1762 did the idea of slavery being connected with the black color and liberty with the white africa and the slave europe france portugal boston newport new york philadelphia baltimore british norfolk colonies wilmington charleston savannah london l wine fruit north america ine ns ho a tl anti c o cean england bristol trade a few african societies like benin for a time opted out of the atlantic slave trade hoping to avoid the disruptions it inevitably caused.

the mainland colonies received only a tiny proportion of the africans brought to the new world most of whom were transported to brazil and the west indies.
rulers took part and they proved quite adept at playing the europeans off against one another collecting taxes from foreign merchants and keeping the capture and sale of slaves under their own control.
few europeans ventured inland from the coast.
traders remained in their factories and purchased slaves brought to them by african rulers and dealers.
the transatlantic slave trade made africa a major market for european goods especially textiles and guns.
both disrupted relationships within and among african societies.
cheap imported textiles undermined traditional craft production while guns encouraged the further growth of slavery since the only way to obtain european weapons was to supply slaves.
by the eighteenth century militarized states like ashanti and dahomey would arise in west africa with large armies using european firearms to prey on their neighbors in order to capture slaves.
from a minor institution slavery grew to become more and more central to west african society a source of wealth for african merchants and of power for newly emerging african kingdoms.
the loss every year of tens of thou how did african slavery differ regionally in eighteenth century north america.
sands of men and women in the prime of their lives to the slave trade weakened and distorted west africas society and economy.
the middle passage for slaves the voyage across the atlantic known as the middle passage because it was the second or middle leg in the triangular trading routes linking europe africa and america was a harrowing experience.
since a slave could be sold in america for twenty to thirty times the price in africa men women and children were crammed aboard vessels as tightly as possible to maximize profits.
the height sometimes between decks wrote one slave trader was only eighteen inches so that the unfortunate human beings could not turn around or even on their sides.
and here they are usually chained to the decks by their necks and legs equiano who later described the shrieks of the women and the groans of the dying survived the middle passage but many africans did not.
diseases like measles and smallpox spread rapidly and about one slave in five perished before reaching the new world.
ship captains were known to throw the sick overboard in order to prevent the spread of epidemics.
the crews on slave ships also suffered a high death rate.
only a small proportion less than 5 percent of slaves carried to the new world were destined for mainland north america.
the vast majority landed in brazil or the west indies where the high death rate on the sugar plantations led to a constant demand for new slave imports.
as late as 1700 only about 20 000 africans had been landed in britains colonies in north america.
in the eighteenth century however their numbers increased steadily.
overall the area that was to become the united states imported between 400 000 and 600 000 slaves.
by 1770 due to the natural reproduction of the slave population around one fifth of the estimated 2 3 million persons not including indians living in the english colonies of north america were africans and their descendants.
chesapeake slavery by the mid eighteenth century three distinct slave systems were well entrenched in britains mainland colonies tobacco based plantation slavery in the chesapeake rice based plantation slavery in south carolina and georgia and nonplantation slavery in new england and the middle colonies.
the largest and oldest of these was the tobacco plantation system of the chesapeake where more than 270 000 slaves resided in 1770 nearly half of the regions population.
on the eve of the revolution virginia and maryland were as closely tied to britain as any other an architects plan for a slave ship.

colonies and their economies were models of mercantilist policy described in chapter 3.
they supplied the mother country with a valuable agricultural product imported large amounts of british goods and were closely linked in culture and political values to london.
as we have seen the period after 1680 witnessed a rapid shift from indentured servitude to slavery on the regions tobacco plantations.
in the eighteenth century the growing world demand for tobacco encouraged continued slave imports.
when tobacco prices fell in the early part of the century some planters shifted to grain production.
but tobacco remained their primary source of wealth.
as virginia expanded westward so did slavery.
by the eve of the american revolution the center of gravity of slavery in the colony had shifted from the tidewater the region along the coast to the piedmont farther inland.
most chesapeake slaves male and female worked in the fields but thousands labored as teamsters as boatmen and in skilled crafts.
numerous slave women became cooks seamstresses dairy maids and personal servants.
the son of george mason one of virginias leading planters and statesmen recorded that his fathers slaves included coopers sawyers blacksmiths tanners shoemakers spinners weavers knitters and even a distiller slavery was common on small farms as well as plantations nearly half of virginias white families owned at least one slave in 1770.
because there is little economy of scale in tobacco growing that is enlarging the size of the producing unit does not lower costs and maximize productivity chesapeake plantations tended to be smaller than in the caribbean and daily interactions between masters and slaves were more extensive.
slavery laid the foundation for the consolida how did african slavery differ regionally in eighteenth century north america.
tion of the chesapeake elite a landed gentry that in conjunction with merchants who handled the tobacco trade and lawyers who defended the interests of slaveholders dominated the regions society and politics.
meanwhile even as the consumer revolution improved the standard of living of lesser whites their long term economic prospects diminished.
as slavery expanded planters engrossed the best lands and wealth among the white population became more and more concentrated.
slavery transformed chesapeake society into an elaborate hierarchy of degrees of freedom.
at the top stood large planters below them numerous lesser planters and landowning yeomen and at the bottom a large population of convicts indentured servants tenant farmers who made up half the white households in 1770 and of course the slaves.
freedom and slavery in the chesapeake with the consolidation of a slave society in the chesapeake planters filled the law books with measures enhancing the masters power over his human property and restricting blacks access to freedom.
violence lay at the heart of the slave system.
even a planter like landon carter who prided himself on his concern for the well being of his slaves noted casually in his diary they have been severely whipped day by day race took on more and more importance as a line of social division.
whites increasingly considered free blacks dangerous and undesirable.
free blacks lost the right to employ white servants and to bear arms were subjected to special taxes and could be punished for striking a white person regardless of the cause.
in 1723 virginia revoked the voting privileges of property owning free blacks.
when the lords of trade in london asked virginias governor to justify discriminating among freemen merely upon account of their complexion he responded that a distinction ought to be made between their offspring and the descendants of an englishman with whom they never were to be accounted equal because virginia law required that freed slaves be sent out of the colony free blacks remained only a tiny part of the population less than 4 percent in 1750.
free and white had become virtually identical.
indian slavery in e a r ly carolina farther south a different slave system based on rice production emerged in south carolina and georgia.
the barbadians who initially settled south carolina in the 1670s were quite familiar with african slavery but their first victims were members of the areas native population.
the early carolina economy focused on the export to the caribbean of indian slaves and to england of deerskins and furs obtained from indians.
the local creek indians initially welcomed the settlers and began selling them slaves generally war captives and their families most of whom were sold to the west indies.
they even launched wars against neighboring tribes specifically for the purpose of capturing and selling slaves.
as the plantation system expanded however the creeks became more and more concerned not only because it led to encroachments on their land but also because they feared enslavement themselves.
they were aware that only a handful of slaves worked in nearby spanish florida.

and as in virginia the introduction of a marketable staple crop in this case rice led directly to economic development the large scale importation of slaves and a growing divide between white and black.
south carolina was the first mainland colony to achieve a black majority.
by the 1730s by which time north carolina had become a separate colony twothirds of its population was black.
in the 1740s another staple indigo a crop used in producing blue dye was developed.
like rice indigo required large scale cultivation and was grown by slaves.
ironically it was africans familiar with the crop at home who taught english settlers how to cultivate rice which then became the foundation of south carolina slavery and of the wealthiest slaveowning class on the north american mainland.
since rice production requires considerable capital investment to drain swamps and create irrigation systems it is economically advantageous for rice plantations to be as large as possible.
thus south carolina planters owned far more land and slaves than their counterparts in virginia.
moreover since mosquitoes bearing malaria a disease to which africans had developed partial immunity flourished in the watery rice fields planters tended to leave plantations under the control of overseers and the slaves themselves.
in the chesapeake field slaves worked in groups under constant supervision.
under the task system that developed in eighteenth century south carolina individual slaves were assigned daily jobs the completion of which allowed them time for leisure or to cultivate crops of their own.
in 1762 one rice district had a population of only 76 white males among 1 000 slaves.
fearful of the ever increasing black population majority south carolinas legislature took steps to encourage the immigration of poor protestants offering each newcomer a cash bounty and occasionally levying taxes on slave imports only to see such restrictions overturned in london.
by 1770 the number of south carolina slaves had reached 100 000 well over half the colonys population.
the georgia experiment rice cultivation also spread into georgia in the mid eighteenth century.
the colony was founded in 1733 by a group of philanthropists led by james oglethorpe a wealthy reformer whose causes included improved conditions for imprisoned debtors and the abolition of slavery.
oglethorpe hoped to establish a haven where the worthy poor of england could enjoy economic opportunity.
the government in london supported the creation of georgia to protect south carolina against the spanish and their indian allies in florida.

how do you think colonists who at this very time were defending their liberty against british policies justified importing and selling slaves.
4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 slavery and empire 1740s georgia offered the spectacle of colonists pleading for the english liberty of self government so that they could enact laws introducing slavery.
in 1751 the proprietors surrendered the colony to the crown.
the colonists quickly won the right to an elected assembly which met in savannah georgias main settlement.
it repealed the ban on slavery and liquor as well as an early measure that had limited land holdings to 500 acres.
georgia became a miniature version of south carolina.
by 1770 as many as 15 000 slaves labored on its coastal rice plantations.
slavery slavery existed in the eighteenth century in all the colonies.
in this 1741 painting of the potter family of matunuck rhode island a young african american boy serves tea.
in the north compared to the plantation regions slavery was far less central to the economies of new england and the middle colonies where small farms predominated.
slaves made up only a small percentage of these colonies populations and it was unusual for even rich families to own more than one slave.
sections of rhode island and connecticut did develop large tobacco and livestock farms employing slave labor but northern slaves were far more dispersed than in the south.
nonetheless slavery was not entirely marginal to northern colonial life.
slaves worked as farm hands in artisan shops as stevedores loading and unloading ships and as personal servants.
in the early eighteenth century about three quarters of the urban elite owned at least one slave.
but with slaves so small a part of the population that they seemed to pose no threat to the white majority laws were less harsh than in the south.
in new england where in 1770 the 17 000 slaves represented less than 3 percent of the regions population slave marriages were recognized in law the severe physical punishment of slaves was prohibited and slaves could bring suits in court testify against whites and own property and pass it on to their children rights unknown in the south.
slavery had been present in new york from the earliest days of dutch settlement.
with white immigration lagging behind that of pennsylvania the colonys hudson valley landlords small farmers and craftsmen continued to employ considerable amounts of slave labor in the eighteenth century.
as new york citys role in the slave trade expanded so did slavery in the city.
in 1746 its 2 440 slaves amounted to one fifth of new york citys total population.
some 30 percent of its laborers were slaves a proportion second only to charleston among american cities.
most were domestic work how did african slavery differ regionally in eighteenth century north america.
ers but slaves worked in all sectors of the economy.
in 1770 about 27 000 slaves lived in new york and new jersey 10 percent of their total population.
slavery was also a significant presence in philadelphia although the institution stagnated after 1750 as artisans and merchants relied increasingly on wage laborers whose numbers were augmented by population growth and the completion of the terms of indentured servants.
in an urban economy that expanded and contracted according to the ups and downs of international trade many employers concluded that relying on wage labor which could be hired and fired at will made more economic sense than a long term investment in slaves.

they came from different cultures spoke different languages and practiced many religions.
eventually an african american people would emerge from the diverse peoples transported to the british colonies in the middle passage.
slavery threw together individuals who would never otherwise have encountered one another and who had never considered their color or residence on a single continent a source of identity or unity.
their bond was not kinship language or even race but slavery itself.
the process of creating a cohesive culture and community took many years and it proceeded at different rates in different regions.
but by the nineteenth century slaves no longer identified themselves as ibo ashanti yoruba and so on but as african americans.
in music art folklore language and religion their cultural expressions emerged as a synthesis of african traditions european elements and new conditions in america.
for most of the eighteenth century the majority of american slaves were african by birth.
for many years they spoke african languages and practiced african religions.
advertisements seeking information about runaways often described them by african origin young gambia negro new banbara negro fellow and spoke of their bearing on their bodies country marks visible signs of ethnic identity in africa.
indeed during the eighteenth century black life in the colonies was re africanized as the earlier creoles slaves born in the new world came to be outnumbered by large scale importations from africa.
compared with the earliest generation of slaves the newcomers worked harder died earlier and had less access to freedom.
charles hansford a white virginia blacksmith noted in a 1753 poem that he had frequently heard slaves speak of their desire to reenjoy life in africa i oft with pleasure have observd how they their sultry countrys worth strive to display in broken language how they praise their case and happiness when in their native place.

4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 african american s l a v e c u lt u r e s a n d slave resistance c u lt u r e s by the mid eighteenth century the three slave systems in british north america had produced distinct african american cultures.
in the chesapeake because of a more healthful climate the slave population began to reproduce itself by 1740 creating a more balanced sex ratio than in the seventeenth century and making possible the creation of family centered slave communities.
because of the small size of most plantations and the large number of white yeoman farmers slaves here were continuously exposed to white culture.
they soon learned english and many were swept up in the religious revivals known as the great awakening discussed later in this chapter.
in south carolina and georgia two very different black societies emerged.
on the rice plantations slaves lived in extremely harsh conditions and had a low birthrate throughout the eighteenth century making rice production dependent on continued slave imports from africa.
the slaves seldom came into contact with whites and enjoyed far more autonomy than elsewhere in the colonies.
the larger structures of their lives were established by slavery but they were able to create an african based culture.
they constructed african style houses chose african names for their children and spoke gullah a language that mixed various african roots and was unintelligible to most whites.
despite a continuing slave trade in which young single males predominated slaves slowly created families and communities that bridged generations.
the experience of slaves who labored in charleston and savannah as servants and skilled workers was quite different.
these assimilated more quickly into euro american culture and sexual liaisons between white owners and slave women produced the beginnings of a class of free mulattos.
in the northern colonies where slaves represented a smaller part of the population dispersed in small holdings among the white population a distinctive african american culture developed more slowly.
living in close proximity to whites they enjoyed more mobility and access to the mainstream of life than their counterparts farther south.
slaves in cities like philadelphia and new york gathered on holidays to perform african dances.
but they had fewer opportunities to create stable family life or a cohesive community.
resistance to slavery the common threads that linked these regional african american cultures were the experience of slavery and the desire for freedom.
throughout the eighteenth century blacks risked their lives in efforts to resist enslavement.
colonial newspapers especially in the southern colonies were filled with advertisements for runaway slaves.
most fugitives were young african men who had arrived recently.
in south carolina and georgia they fled to florida to uninhabited coastal and river swamps or to charleston and savannah where they could pass for free.
in the chesapeake and middle colonies fugitive slaves tended to be familiar with white culture and therefore as one advertisement put it could pretend to be free what edward trelawny the colonial governor of jamaica called a dangerous spirit of liberty was widespread among the new worlds slaves.
the eighteenth centurys first slave uprising occurred in new york city in 1712 what factors led to distinct african american cultures in the eighteenth century.
when a group of slaves set fire to houses on the outskirts of the city and killed the first nine whites who arrived on the scene.
subsequently eighteen conspirators were executed some were tortured and burned alive in a public spectacle meant to intimidate the slave population.
during the 1730s and 1740s continuous warfare involving european empires and indians opened the door to slave resistance.
in 1731 a slave rebellion in louisiana where the french and natchez indians were at war temporarily halted efforts to introduce the plantation system in that region.
there were uprisings throughout the west indies including in the virgin islands owned by denmark and on the french island of guadeloupe.
on jamaica a major british center of sugar production communities of fugitive slaves known as maroons waged outright warfare against british authorities until a treaty of 1739 recognized their freedom in exchange for which they agreed to return future escapees.
the crisis of 1739 1741 on the mainland slaves seized the opportunity for rebellion offered by the war of jenkins ear which pitted england against spain.
in september 1739 a group of south carolina slaves most of them recently arrived from kongo where some it appears had been soldiers seized a store containing numerous weapons at the town of stono.
beating drums to attract followers the armed band marched southward toward florida burning houses and barns killing whites they encountered and shouting liberty floridas spanish rulers offered liberty and protection to fugitives from the british colonies.
the group eventually swelled to some 100 slaves.
after a pitched battle with the colonys militia the rebels were dispersed.
the rebellion took the lives of more than two dozen whites and as many as 200 slaves.
some slaves managed to reach florida where in 1740 they were armed by the spanish to help repel an attack on st augustine by a force from georgia.
the stono rebellion led to a severe tightening of the south carolina slave code and the temporary imposition of a prohibitive tax on imported slaves.
in 1741 a panic which some observers compared to the fear of witches in salem in the 1690s swept new york city.
after a series of fires broke out rumors spread that slaves with some white allies planned to burn part of the city seize weapons and either turn new york over to spain or murder the white population.
more than 150 blacks and 20 whites were arrested and 34 alleged conspirators including 4 white persons were executed.
historians still disagree as to how extensive the plot was or whether it existed at all.
but dramatic events like revolts along with the constant stream of runaways disproved the idea voiced by the governor of south carolina that slaves had no notion of liberty in eighteenth century america dreams of freedom knew no racial boundary.
when white colonists rose in rebellion against british rule tens of thousands of slaves would seize the opportunity to strike for their own liberty.

4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 an empire of freedom an empire of freedom british patriotism despite the centrality of slavery to its empire eighteenth century great britain prided itself on being the worlds most advanced and freest nation.
it was not only the eras greatest naval and commercial power but also the home of a complex governmental system with a powerful parliament representing the interests of a self confident landed aristocracy and merchant class.
in london the largest city in europe with a population approaching 1 million by the end of the eighteenth century britain possessed a single political cultural economic capital.
it enjoyed a common law common language and with the exception of a small number of jews catholics and africans common devotion to protestantism.
for much of the eighteenth century britain found itself at war with france which had replaced spain as its major continental rival.
this situation led to the development of a large military establishment high taxes and the creation of the bank of england to help finance european and imperial conflicts.
for both britons and colonists war helped to sharpen a sense of national identity against foreign foes.
british patriotic sentiment became more and more assertive as the eighteenth century progressed.
symbols of british identity proliferated the songs god save the king and rule britannia and even the modern rules of cricket the national sport.
the rapidly expanding british economy formed another point of pride uniting britons and colonists.
continental peoples according to a popular saying wore wooden shoes that is their standard of living was far below that of britons.
writers hailed commerce as a progressive civilizing force a way for different peoples to interact for mutual benefit without domination or military conflict.
especially in contrast to france britain saw itself as a realm of widespread prosperity individual liberty the rule of law and the protestant faith.
wealth religion and freedom went together.
there is no popish nation wrote the massachusetts theologian cotton mather in 1710 but what by embracing the protestant religion would.
not only assert themselves into a glorious liberty but also double their wealth immediately the british constitution central to this sense of british identity was the concept of liberty.
the fierce political struggles of the english civil war and the glorious revolution bequeathed to eighteenth century britons an abiding conviction that liberty was their unique possession.
they believed power and liberty to be natural antagonists.
to mediate between them advocates of british freedom celebrated the rule of law the right to live under legislation to which ones representatives had consented restraints on the arbitrary exercise of political authority and rights like trial by jury enshrined in the common law.
on both sides of the atlantic every political cause it seemed wrapped itself in the language of liberty and claimed to be defending the rights of englishmen continental writers dissatisfied with the lack of liberty in their own countries looked to britain as a model.
the house of commons house of lords and king each checked the power of the others.
this structure wrote the what were the meanings of british liberty in the eighteenth century.
french political philosopher baron montesquieu made britain the one nation in the world whose constitution has political liberty for its purpose in its balanced constitution and the principle that no man even the king is above the law britons claimed to have devised the best means of preventing political tyranny.
until the 1770s most colonists believed themselves to be part of the freest political system mankind had ever known.
as the coexistence of slavery and liberty within the empire demonstrated british freedom was anything but universal.
it was closely identified with the protestant religion and was invoked to contrast britons with the servile subjects of catholic countries especially france britains main rival in eighteenth century europe.
it viewed nearly every other nation on earth as enslaved to popery tyranny or barbarism.
one german military officer commented in 1743 on the british contempt of foreigners they pride themselves not only upon their being free themselves but being the bulwarks of liberty all over europe and they vilify most of the nations on the continent.
for being slaves as they call us british liberty was fully compatible with wide gradations in personal rights.
yet in the minds of the free residents of great britain and its north american colonies liberty was the bond of empire.
the language of liberty these ideas sank deep roots not only within the political nation those who voted held office and engaged in structured political debate but also far more broadly in british and colonial society.
laborers sailors and artisans spoke the language of british freedom as insistently as pamphleteers and parliamentarians.
increasingly the idea of liberty lost its traditional association with privileges derived from membership in a distinct social class and became more and more identified with a general right to resist arbitrary government.
even though less than 5 percent of the british population enjoyed the right to vote representative government was central to the eighteenth century idea of british liberty.

4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 an empire of freedom on both sides of the atlantic liberty emerged as the battle cry of the rebellious.
frequent crowd actions protesting violations of traditional rights gave concrete expression to popular belief in the right to oppose tyranny.
ordinary persons thought nothing of taking to the streets to protest efforts by merchants to raise the cost of bread above the traditional just price or the royal navys practice of impressment kidnapping poor men on the streets for maritime service.
republican a 1770 engraving from the boston gazette by paul revere illustrates the association of british patriotism and liberty.
britannia sits with a liberty cap and her national shield and releases a bird from a cage.
liberty liberty was central to two sets of political ideas that flourished in the anglo american world.
one is termed by scholars republicanism although few in eighteenthcentury england used the word which literally meant a government without a king and conjured up memories of the beheading of charles i.
republicanism celebrated active participation in public life by economically independent citizens as the essence of liberty.
republicans assumed that only property owning citizens possessed virtue defined in the eighteenth century not simply as a personal moral quality but as the willingness to subordinate self interest to the pursuit of the public good.
only a virtuous people are capable of freedom wrote benjamin franklin.
in eighteenth century britain this body of thought about freedom was most closely associated with a group of critics of the established political order known as the country party because much of their support arose from the landed gentry.
they condemned what they considered the corruption of british politics evidenced by the growing number of government appointees who sat in the house of commons.
they called for the election of men of independence who could not be controlled by the ministry and they criticized the expansion of the national debt and the growing wealth of financial speculators in a commercializing economy.
britain they claimed was succumbing to luxury and political manipulation in a word a loss of virtue thereby endangering the careful balance of its system of government and indeed liberty itself.
in britain country party publicists like john trenchard and thomas gordon authors of catos letters published in the 1720s had little impact.
but their writings were eagerly devoured in the american colonies whose elites were attracted to trenchard and gordons emphasis on the political role of the independent landowner and their warnings against the constant tendency of political power to infringe upon liberty.
liberal freedom the second set of eighteenth century political ideas celebrating freedom came to be known as liberalism although its meaning was quite different from what the word suggests today.
whereas republican liberty had a public and social quality liberalism was essentially individual and private.
the leading philosopher of liberty was john locke whose two treatises of what were the meanings of british liberty in the eighteenth century.
government written around 1680 had limited influence in his own lifetime but became extremely well known in the next century.
many previous writers had compared government to the family assuming that in both inequality was natural and power always emanated from the top.
locke held that the principles that governed the family were inappropriate for organizing public life.
government he wrote was formed by a mutual agreement among equals the parties being male heads of households not all persons.
in this social contract men surrendered a part of their right to govern themselves in order to enjoy the benefits of the rule of law.
they retained however their natural rights whose existence predated the establishment of political authority.
protecting the security of life liberty and property required shielding a realm of private life and personal concerns including family relations religious preferences and economic activity from interference by the state.
during the eighteenth century lockean ideas individual rights the consent of the governed the right of rebellion against unjust or oppressive government would become familiar on both sides of the atlantic.
like other britons locke spoke of liberty as a universal right yet seemed to exclude many persons from its full benefits.
since the protection of property was one of governments main purposes liberalism was compatible with substantial inequalities in wealth and well being.
moreover while locke was one of the first theorists to defend the property rights of women and even their access to divorce and condemned slavery as a vile and miserable estate of man the free individual in liberal thought was essentially the propertied white man.
locke himself had helped to draft the fundamental constitutions of carolina discussed in chapter 3 which provided for slavery and he was an investor in the royal african company the the polling by the renowned eighteenthcentury british artist william hogarth satirizes the idea that british elections are decided by the reasoned deliberations of upstanding property owners.

4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 the public sphere slave trading monopoly.
slaves he wrote cannot be considered as any part of civil society nonetheless by proclaiming that all individuals possess natural rights that no government may violate lockean liberalism opened the door to the poor women and even slaves to challenge limitations on their own freedom.
republicanism and liberalism would eventually come to be seen as alternative understandings of freedom.
in the eighteenth century however these systems of thought overlapped and often reinforced each other.
both political outlooks could inspire a commitment to constitutional government and restraints on despotic power.
both emphasized the security of property as a foundation of freedom.
both traditions were transported to eighteenth century america.
ideas about liberty imported from britain to the colonies would eventually help to divide the empire.
the public sphere the title page of john lockes two treatises of government which traced the origins of government to an original state of nature and insisted that political authorities must not abridge mankinds natural rights.
colonial politics for most of the eighteenth century was considerably less tempestuous than in the seventeenth with its bitter struggles for power and frequent armed uprisings.
political stability in britain coupled with the maturation of local elites in america made for more tranquil government.
new york stood apart from this development.
with its diverse population and bitter memories of leislers rebellion see chapter 3 p 111 new york continued to experience intense political strife among its many economic interests and ethnic groups.
by the 1750s semipermanent political parties competed vigorously for popular support in new york elections.
but in most other colonies although differences over policies of one kind or another were hardly absent they rarely produced the civil disorder or political passions of the previous century.
the the british political philosopher john locke painted by michael dahl around 1696.
right to vote in many respects politics in eighteenth century america had a more democratic quality than in great britain.
suffrage requirements varied from colony to colony but as in britain the linchpin of voting laws was the property qualification.
its purpose was to ensure that men who possessed an economic stake in society and the independence of judgment that went with it determined the policies of the government.
the foundation of liberty the parliamentary leader henry ireton had declared during the english civil war of the 1640s is that those who shall choose the lawmakers shall be men freed from dependence upon others slaves servants tenants adult sons living in the homes of their parents the poor and women all lacked a will of their own and were therefore ineligible to vote.
the wide distribution of property in the colonies however meant that a far higher percentage of the population enjoyed voting rights than in the old world.
it is estimated that between 50 and 80 percent of adult white men could vote in eighteenth century colonial america as opposed to fewer than 5 percent in britain at the time.
colonial politics however was hardly democratic in a modern sense.
in a few instances some towns in massachusetts and on long island propertied women generally widows cast ballots.
but voting was almost what concepts and institutions dominated colonial politics in the eighteenth century.
everywhere considered a male prerogative.
in some colonies jews catholics and protestant dissenters like baptists and quakers could not vote.
propertied free blacks who enjoyed the franchise in virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia in the early days of settlement lost that right during the eighteenth century although north carolina restored it in the 1730s.
in the northern colonies while the law did not bar blacks from voting local custom did.
native americans were generally prohibited from voting.
political c u lt u r e s despite the broad electorate among white men the people existed only on election day.
between elections members of colonial assemblies remained out of touch with their constituents.
strongly competitive elections were the norm only in the middle colonies.
elsewhere many elections went uncontested either because only one candidate presented himself or because the local culture stressed community harmony as in many new england towns.
considerable power in colonial politics rested with those who held appointive not elective office.
governors and councils were appointed by the crown in the nine royal colonies and by the proprietors of pennsylvania and maryland.
only in rhode island and connecticut were these offices elective.
moreover laws passed by colonial assemblies could be vetoed by governors or in london.
in new england most town officers were elected but local officials in other colonies were appointed by the governor or by powerful officials in london.
the duke of newcastle alone could appoint eighty three colonial officials.
property qualifications for officeholding were far higher than for voting.
in south carolina for example nearly every adult male could meet the voting qualification of fifty acres of land or payment of twenty shillings in taxes but to sit in the assembly one had to own 500 acres of land and ten slaves or town property worth 1 000.
as a result throughout the eighteenth century nearly all of south carolinas legislators were planters or wealthy merchants.
despite its boisterous and competitive politics new yorks diminutive assembly with fewer than thirty members was dominated by relatives and allies of the great landed families especially the livingstons and delanceys.
of seventy two men who sat in the new york assembly between 1750 and 1776 fifty two were related to the families who owned the great hudson river estates.
in some colonies a majority of free men possessed the right to vote but an ingrained tradition of deference the assumption among ordinary people that wealth education and social prominence carried a right to public office sharply limited effective choice in elections.
virginia politics for example combined political this anonymous engraving depicting a 1764 pennsylvania election suggests the intensity of political debate in the middle colonies.
4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 the public sphere democracy for white men with the tradition that voters should choose among candidates from the gentry.
aspirants for public office actively sought to ingratiate themselves with ordinary voters distributing food and liquor freely at the courthouse where balloting took place.
in thomas jeffersons first campaign for the house of burgesses in 1768 his expenses included hiring two men for bringing up rum to the polling place.
even in new england with its larger number of elective positions town leaders were generally the largest property holders and offices frequently passed down from generation to generation of the same family.
few americans vigorously pursued elective office or took an active role in public affairs.
by the mid eighteenth century the typical officeholder was considerably richer than the norm when the century began.
colonial government preoccupied with events in europe and imperial rivalries successive british governments during the first half of the eighteenth century adopted a policy of salutary neglect toward the colonies leaving them largely to govern themselves.
with imperial authority so weak the large landowners merchants and lawyers who dominated colonial assemblies increasingly claimed the right to control local politics.
convinced that they represented the will of the people elected colonial assemblies used their control of finance to exert influence over appointed governors and councils.
although governors desired secure incomes for themselves and permanent revenue for their administrations some like robert hunter of new york demanded a life salary assemblies often authorized salaries only one year at a time and refused to levy taxes except in exchange for concessions on appointments land policy and other issues.
typically members of the british gentry who had suffered financial reversals and hoped to recoup their fortunes in america governors learned that to rule effectively they would have to cooperate with the colonial elite.
the rise of the assemblies in the seventeenth century the governor was the focal point of political authority and colonial assemblies were weak bodies that met infrequently.
but in the eighteenth as economic development enhanced the power of american elites the assemblies they dominated became more and more assertive.
their leaders insisted that assemblies possessed the same rights and powers in local affairs as the house of commons enjoyed in britain.
the most successful governors were those who accommodated the rising power of the assemblies and used their appointive powers and control of land grants to win allies among assembly members.
the most powerful assembly was pennsylvanias where a new charter adopted in 1701 eliminated the governors council establishing the only unicameral one house legislature in the colonies.
controlled until midcentury by an elite of quaker merchants the assembly wrested control of finance appointments and the militia from a series of governors representing the penn family.
close behind in terms of power and legislative independence were the assemblies of new york virginia south carolina and especially massachusetts which successfully resisted governors demands what concepts and institutions dominated colonial politics in the eighteenth century.
for permanent salaries for appointed officials.
many of the conflicts between governors and elected assemblies stemmed from the colonies economic growth.
to deal with the scarcity of gold and silver coins the only legal form of currency some colonies printed paper money although this was strongly opposed by the governors authorities in london and british merchants who did not wish to be paid in what they considered worthless paper.
numerous battles also took place over land policy sometimes involving divergent attitudes toward the remaining indian population and the level of rents charged to farmers on land owned by the crown or proprietors.
in their negotiations and conflicts with royal governors leaders of the assemblies drew on the writings of the english country party whose emphasis on the constant tension between liberty and political power and the dangers of executive influence over the legislature made sense of their own experience.
of the european settlements in north america only the british colonies possessed any considerable degree of popular participation in government.
this fact reinforced the assemblies claim to embody the rights of englishmen and the principle of popular consent to government.
they were defenders of the peoples liberty in the words of one new york legislator.
politics in public this language reverberated outside the relatively narrow world of elective and legislative politics.
the political nation was dominated by the american gentry whose members addressed each other in letters speeches newspaper articles and pamphlets filled with latin expressions and references to classical learning.
but especially in colonial towns and cities the eighteenth century witnessed a considerable expansion of the public sphere the world of political organization and debate independent of the government where an informed citizenry openly discussed questions that had previously been the preserve of officials.
in boston new york and philadelphia clubs proliferated where literary philosophical scientific and political issues were debated.
among the best known was the junto a club for mutual improvement founded by benjamin franklin in philadelphia in 1727 for weekly discussion of political and economic questions.
beginning with only a dozen members it eventually evolved into the much larger american philosophical society.
such groups were generally composed of men of property and commerce but some drew ordinary citizens into discussions of public affairs.
colonial taverns and coffeehouses also became important sites not only for social conviviality but also for political debates.
philadelphia had a larger number of drinking establishments per capita than paris.
in philadelphia one clergyman commented the poorest laborer thinks himself entitled to deliver his sentiments in matters of religion or politics with as much freedom as the gentleman or scholar the colonial press neither the spanish possessions of florida and new mexico nor new france possessed a printing press although missionaries had established one in mexico city in the 1530s.

they are listed on the left by their first letters temperance silence order resolution frugality industry sincerity justice moderation cleanliness tranquility chastity and humility.
franklin did not always adhere to these virtues.
the public sphere press expanded rapidly during the eighteenth century.
so did the number of political broadsides and pamphlets published especially at election time.
widespread literacy created an expanding market for printed materials.
by the eve of the american revolution some three quarters of the free adult male population in the colonies and more than one third of the women could read and write and a majority of american families owned at least one book.
philadelphia boasted no fewer than seventy seven bookshops in the 1770s.
circulating libraries appeared in many colonial cities and towns making possible a wider dissemination of knowledge at a time when books were still expensive.
the first the library company of philadelphia was established by benjamin franklin in 1731.
so few were the readers at that time and the majority of us so poor franklin recalled in his autobiography 1791 that he could find only fifty persons mostly young tradesmen anxious for self improvement and willing to pay for the privilege of borrowing books.
but reading he added soon became fashionable libraries sprang up in other towns and ordinary americans came to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank abroad.
the first continuously published colonial newspaper the boston newsletter appeared in 1704 a predecessor publick occurrences both foreign and domestick established in boston in 1690 had been suppressed by authorities after a single issue for criticizing military cooperation with the iroquois.
there were thirteen colonial newspapers by 1740 and twentyfive in 1765 mostly weeklies with small circulations an average of 600 sales per issue.
probably the best edited newspaper was the pennsylvania gazette established in 1728 in philadelphia and purchased the following year by benjamin franklin who had earlier worked as an apprentice printer on his brothers boston periodical the new england courant.
at its peak the gazette attracted 2 000 subscribers.
newspapers initially devoted most of their space to advertisements religious affairs and reports on british society and government.
but by the 1730s political commentary was widespread in the american press.
freedom of expression and its limits the public sphere thrived on the free exchange of ideas.
but free expression was not generally considered one of the ancient rights of englishmen.
the phrase freedom of speech originated in britain during the sixteenth century in parliaments struggle to achieve the privilege of unrestrained debate.
a right of legislators not ordinary citizens it referred to the ability of members of parliament to express their views without fear of reprisal on the grounds that only in this way could they effectively represent the people.
outside of parliament free speech had no legal protection.
a subject could be beheaded for accusing the king of failing to hold true religious beliefs and language from swearing to criticism of the government exposed a person to criminal penalties.
as for freedom of the press governments on both sides of the atlantic viewed this as extremely dangerous partly because they considered ordinary citizens prone to be misled by inflammatory printed materials.
during the english civil war of the 1640s the levelers had called for the adoption of a written constitution an agreement of the people containing what concepts and institutions dominated colonial politics in the eighteenth century.
guarantees of religious liberty and freedom of the press.
but until 1695 when a british law requiring the licensing of printed works before publication lapsed no newspaper book or pamphlet could legally be printed without a government license.
the instructions of colonial governors included a warning about the great inconveniences that may arise by the liberty of printing after 1695 the government could not censor newspapers books and pamphlets before they appeared in print although it continued to try to manage the press by direct payments to publishers and individual journalists.
authors and publishers could still be prosecuted for seditious libel a crime that included defaming government officials or punished for contempt.
elected assemblies not governors most frequently discouraged freedom of the press in colonial america.
dozens of publishers were hauled before assemblies and forced to apologize for comments regarding one or another member.
if they refused they were jailed.
james franklin benjamins older brother spent a month in prison in 1722 after publishing a piece satirizing public authorities in massachusetts.
colonial newspapers vigorously defended freedom of the press as a central component of liberty insisting that the citizenry had a right to monitor the workings of government and subject public officials to criticism.
many newspapers reprinted passages from catos letters in which trenchard and gordon strongly opposed prosecutions for libel.
without freedom of thought they declared there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech but since government printing contracts were crucial for economic success few newspapers attacked colonial governments unless financially supported by an opposition faction.
the trial of zenger the most famous colonial court case involving freedom of the press demonstrated that popular sentiment opposed prosecutions for criticism of public officials.
this was the 1735 trial of john peter zenger a germanborn printer who had emigrated to new york as a youth.
financed by wealthy opponents of governor william cosby zengers newspaper the weekly journal lambasted the governor for corruption influence peddling and tyranny new yorks council ordered four issues burned and had zenger himself arrested and tried for seditious libel.
the judge instructed the jurors to consider only whether zenger had actually published the offending words not whether they were accurate.
but zengers attorney andrew hamilton urged the jury to judge not the publisher but the governor.
if they decided that zengers charges were correct they must acquit him and hamilton proclaimed every man who prefers freedom to a life of slavery will bless you zenger was found not guilty.
the case sent a warning to prosecutors that libel cases might be very difficult to win especially in the superheated atmosphere of new york partisan politics.
to be sure had zenger lambasted the assembly rather than the governor he would in all likelihood have been lodged in jail without the benefit of a trial.
the law of libel remained on the books.
but the outcome helped to promote the idea that the publication of truth should always be permitted and it demonstrated that the idea of free expression was becoming ingrained in the popular imagination.

american the great awakening enlightenment during the eighteenth century many educated americans began to be influenced by the outlook of the european enlightenment.
this philosophical movement which originated among french thinkers and soon spread to britain sought to apply to political and social life the scientific method of careful investigation based on research and experiment.
enlightenment ideas crisscrossed the atlantic along with goods and people.
enlightenment thinkers insisted that every human institution authority and tradition be judged before the bar of reason.
the self educated benjamin franklins wide range of activities establishing a newspaper debating club and library publishing the widely circulated poor richards almanack and conducting experiments to demonstrate that lightning is a form of electricity exemplified the enlightenment spirit and made him probably the best known american in the eighteenth century world.
one inspiration for the enlightenment was a reaction against the bloody religious wars that racked europe in the seventeenth century.
enlightenment thinkers hoped that reason not religious enthusiasm could govern human life.
the criticism of social and political institutions based on tradition and hereditary privilege rather than the dictates of reason could also be applied to established churches.
john locke himself had published the reasonableness of christianity in 1695 which insisted that religious belief should rest on scientific evidence.
during the eighteenth century many prominent americans moved toward the position called arminianism which taught that reason alone was capable of establishing the essentials of religion.
others adopted deism a belief that god essentially withdrew after creating the world leaving it to function according to scientific laws without divine intervention.
belief in miracles in the revealed truth of the bible and in the innate sinfulness of mankind were viewed by arminians deists and others as outdated superstitions that should be abandoned in the modern age.
in the seventeenth century the english scientist isaac newton had revealed the natural laws that governed the physical universe.
here deists believed was the purest evidence of gods handiwork.
many protestants of all denominations could accept newtons findings while remaining devout churchgoers as newton himself had.
but deists concluded that the best form of religious devotion was to study the workings of nature rather than to worship in organized churches or appeal to divine grace for salvation.
by the late colonial era a small but influential group of leading americans including benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson could be classified as deists.
t h e g r e at awa k e n i n g like freedom of the press religion was another realm where the actual experience of liberty outstripped its legal recognition.
religion remained how did the great awakening challenge the religious and social structure of british north america.
central to eighteenth century american life.
sermons theological treatises and copies of the bible were by far the largest category of material produced by colonial printers.
religious disputes often generated more public attention than political issues.
yet many church leaders worried about lax religious observance as colonial economic growth led people to be more and more preoccupied with worldly affairs.
religious revivals many ministers were concerned that westward expansion commercial development the growth of enlightenment rationalism and lack of individual engagement in church services were undermining religious devotion.
these fears helped to inspire the revivals that swept through the colonies beginning in the 1730s.
known as the great awakening the revivals were less a coordinated movement than a series of local events united by a commitment to a religion of the heart a more emotional and personal christianity than that offered by existing churches.
the revivals redrew the religious landscape of the colonies.
the eighteenth century witnessed a revival of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world in part a response to the rationalism of the enlightenment and a desire for greater religious purity.
in the middle east and central asia where islam was widespread followers of a form of the religion known as wahabbism called for a return to the practices of the religions early days.
in eastern europe hasidic jews emphasized the importance of faith and religious joy as opposed to what they considered the overly academic study of jewish learning and history in conventional judaism.
methodism and other forms of enthusiastic religion were flourishing in europe.
like other intellectual currents of the time the great awakening was a transatlantic movement.
during the 1720s and 1730s the new jersey dutch reformed clergyman theodore frelinghuysen his presbyterian neighbors william and gilbert tennent and the massachusetts congregationalist minister jonathan edwards pioneered an intensely emotional style of preaching.
edwardss famous sermon sinners in the hands of an angry god portrayed sinful man as a loathsome insect suspended over a bottomless pit of eternal fire by a slender thread that might break at any moment.
edwardss preaching declared a member of his congregation inspired worshipers to cry out what shall i do to be saved oh i am going to hell only a new birth immediately acknowledging ones sins and pleading for divine grace could save men from eternal damnation.
it is the new birth that makes sinners free declared the reverend joshua tufts.
the preaching of whitefield religious emotionalism was not confined to the american colonies it spread through much of mid eighteenth century europe as well.
more than any other individual the english minister george whitefield who declared the whole world his parish sparked the great awakening.
for two years after his arrival in america in 1739 whitefield brought his highly emotional brand of preaching to colonies from georgia to new england.
god whitefield proclaimed was merciful.
rather than being predestined jonathan edwards one of the most prominent preachers of the great awakening.
4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 george whitefield the english evangelist who helped to spark the great awakening in the colonies.
painted around 1742 by john wollaston who had emigrated from england to the colonies the work depicts whitefields powerful effect on male and female listeners.
it also illustrates whitefields eye problem which led critics to dub him dr.
squintum the great awakening for damnation men and women could save themselves by repenting of their sins.
whitefield appealed to the passions of his listeners powerfully sketching the boundless joy of salvation and the horrors of damnation.
in every sermon he asked his listeners to look into their own hearts and answer the question are you saved if not they must change their sinful ways and surrender their lives to christ.
tens of thousands of colonists flocked to whitefields sermons which were widely reported in the american press making him a celebrity and helping to establish the revivals as the first major intercolonial event in north american history.
although a deist benjamin franklin helped to publicize whitefields tour and made a tidy profit by publishing his sermons and journals.
in whitefields footsteps a host of traveling preachers or evangelists meaning literally bearers of good news held revivalist meetings often to the alarm of established ministers.
critics of the great awakening produced sermons pamphlets and newspaper articles condemning the revivalist preachers for lacking theological training encouraging disrespect for the established church and her ministers and filling churches with general disorder connecticut sought to stem the revivalist tide through laws punishing disruptive traveling preachers.
by the time they subsided in the 1760s the revivals had changed the religious configuration of the colonies and enlarged the boundaries of liberty.
whitefield had inspired the emergence of numerous dissenting churches.
congregations split into factions headed by old lights traditionalists and new lights revivalists and new churches proliferated baptist methodist presbyterian and others.
many of these new churches began to criticize the colonial practice of levying taxes to support an established church they defended religious freedom as one of the natural rights government must not restrict.
the awakening s impact although the revivals were primarily a spiritual matter the great awakening reflected existing social tensions threw into question many forms of authority and inspired criticism of aspects of colonial society.
they attracted primarily men and women of modest means rude ignorant void of manners education or good breeding one anglican minister complained.
revivalist preachers frequently criticized commercial society insisting that believers should make salvation not profit the one business of their lives in new england they condemned merchants who ensnared the unwary in debt as greedy and unchristian.
preaching to the small farmers of the southern backcountry baptist and methodist revivalists criticized the worldliness of wealthy planters and attacked as sinful activities such as gambling horse racing and lavish entertainments on the sabbath.
a few preachers explicitly condemned slavery.
and a few converts such as robert carter iii the grandson of the wealthy planter robert king carter emancipated their slaves after concluding that black and white were brothers in christ.
most masters managed to reconcile christianity and slaveholding.
but especially in the chesapeake the revivals brought numerous slaves into the christian fold an important step in their acculturation as african americans.
and a few blacks touched by the word of god took how did the great awakening challenge the religious and social structure of british north america.
up preaching themselves.
the revivals also spawned a group of female exhorters who for a time shattered the male monopoly on preaching.
the revivals broadened the range of religious alternatives available to americans thereby leaving them more divided than before and at the same time more fully integrated into transatlantic religious developments.
but the impact of the great awakening spread beyond purely spiritual matters.
the newspaper and pamphlet wars it inspired greatly expanded the circulation of printed material in the colonies.
the revivals encouraged many colonists to trust their own views rather than those of established elites.
in listening to the sermons of self educated preachers forming bible study groups and engaging in intense religious discussions ordinary colonists asserted the right to independent judgment.
the common people proclaimed baptist minister isaac backus claim as good a right to judge and act for themselves in matters of religion as civil rulers or the learned clergy the revivalists aim was spiritual salvation not social or political revolution.
but the independent frame of mind they encouraged would have significant political consequences.
i m p e r i a l r i va l r i e s spanish north america the rapid growth of britains north american colonies took place at a time of increased jockeying for power among european empires involving much of the area today included in the united states.
but the colonies of englands rivals although covering immense territories remained thinly populated and far weaker economically.
the spanish empire encompassed an area that stretched from the pacific coast and new mexico into the great plains and eastward through texas and florida.
after 1763 it also included louisiana which spain obtained from france.
on paper a vast territorial empire spanish north america actually consisted of a few small and isolated urban clusters most prominently st augustine in florida san antonio in texas and santa fe and albuquerque in new mexico.
in the second half of the century the spanish government made a concerted effort to reinvigorate its empire north of the rio grande.
it stabilized relations with indians especially the nomadic comanches and apaches who had wreaked havoc in new mexico.
but although ranching expanded in new mexico and texas the economy of the spanish colonies essentially rested on trading with and extracting labor from the surviving indian population.
new mexicos population in 1765 was only 20 000 equally divided between spanish settlers and pueblo indians.
spain began the colonization of texas at the beginning of the eighteenth century partly as a buffer to prevent french commercial influence then spreading in the mississippi valley from intruding into new mexico.
the spanish established complexes consisting of religious missions and presidios military outposts at los adaes la baha and san antonio.
but the region attracted few settlers.
texas had only 1 200 spanish colonists in 1760.
florida stagnated as well remaining an impoverished military outpost.
around 1770 its population consisted of about 2 000 spanish 1 000 black slaves and a few hundred indians survivors of many decades of war and disease.
this 1740 pamphlet by gilbert tennent a presbyterian minister in philadelphia defended the great awakening by comparing anti revival ministers to the false prophets described in the bible.

jamaica the spanish in california on the pacific coast russian fur traders in the eighteenth century established a series of forts and trading posts in alaska.
although only a handful of russian colonists lived in the region spain alarmed by what it saw as a danger to its american empire ordered the colonization of california.
a string of spanish missions and presidios soon dotted the california coastline from san diego to los angeles santa barbara monterey san francisco and sonoma.
born on the spanish mediterranean island of mallorca father junpero serra became one of the most controversial figures in californias early history.
he founded the first california mission in san diego in 1769 and administered the mission network until his death in 1784.
serra was widely praised in spain for converting thousands of indians to christianity teaching them spanish and working to transform their hunting and gathering economies by introducing settled agriculture and skilled crafts.
today he is being considered by the catholic church for elevation to sainthood.
but forced labor and disease took a heavy toll among indians who lived at the missions serra directed.
how did the spanish and french empires in america develop in the eighteenth century.
present day california was a densely populated area with a native population of perhaps 250 000 when spanish settlement began.
but as in other regions the coming of soldiers and missionaries proved a disaster for the indians.
more than any other spanish colony california was a mission frontier.
these outposts served simultaneously as religious institutions and centers of government and labor.
their aim was to transform the culture of the local population and eventually assimilate it into spanish civilization.
father serra and other missionaries hoped to convert the natives to christianity and settled farming.
the missions also relied on forced indian labor to grow grain work in orchards and vineyards and tend cattle.
the combination of new diseases and the resettlement of thousands of indians in villages around the missions devastated indian society.
by 1821 when mexico won its independence from spain californias native population had declined by more than one third.
but the area had not attracted spanish settlers.
in 1800 los angeles with a population of 300 was the largest town.
when spanish rule came to an end in 1821 californios california residents of spanish descent numbered only 3 200.
the french empire spains north american colonies remained peripheral parts of its empire when compared with its possessions in central and south america and the caribbean.
a greater rival to british power in north america as well as in europe and the caribbean was france.
during the eighteenth century the population and economy of canada expanded.
at the same time french traders pushed into the mississippi river valley southward from the great lakes and northward from mobile founded in 1702 and new orleans established in 1718.
in the st lawrence river valley of french canada prosperous farming communities developed.
by 1750 the area had a population of about 55 000 colonists.
another 10 000 about half europeans half african american slaves resided in louisiana mostly concentrated on the lower mississippi river and along the gulf coast.

battle for the continent rouge.
new orleans already had a vibrant social life as well as an established community with churches schools and governmental buildings.
nonetheless the population of french north america continued to be dwarfed by the british colonies.
prejudice against emigration to north america remained widespread in france.
a french novel written in 1731 known today as the basis for the nineteenth century opera manon told the story of a prostitute punished by being transported to louisiana and of her noble lover who followed her there.
it expressed the popular view of the colony as a place of cruel exile for criminals and social outcasts.
nonetheless by claiming control of a large arc of territory and by establishing close trading and military relations with many indian tribes the french empire posed a real challenge to the british.
french forts and trading posts ringed the british colonies.
in present day mississippi and alabama and in the western regions of georgia and the carolinas french and british traders competed to form alliances with local indians and control the trade in deerskins.
the french were a presence on the new england and new york frontiers and in western pennsylvania.
b at t l e f o r t h e c o n t i n e n t the middle ground for much of the eighteenth century the western frontier of british north america was the flashpoint of imperial rivalries.
the ohio valley became caught up in a complex struggle for power involving the french british rival indian communities and settlers and land companies pursuing their own interests.
here by mid century resided numerous indians including shawnees and delawares who had been pushed out of pennsylvania by advancing white settlement cherokees and chickasaws from the southern colonies who looked to the region for new hunting grounds and iroquois seeking to exert control over the areas fur trade.
on this middle ground between european empires and indian sovereignty villages sprang up where members of numerous tribes lived side by side along with european traders and the occasional missionary.
by the mid eighteenth century indians had learned that direct military confrontation with europeans meant suicide and that an alliance with a w h a t w a s t h e i m p a c t o f t h e s e v e n ye a r s wa r o n i m p e r i a l a n d i n d i a n w h i t e r e l a t i o n s.
single european power exposed them to danger from others.
the indians of the ohio valley recognized that the imperial rivalry of britain and france posed both threat and opportunity.
as one delaware spokesman remarked it was impossible to know where the indians land lay for the french claimed all the land on one side of the ohio river and the english on the other side on the other hand indians sought with some success to play european empires off one another and to control the lucrative commerce with whites.
the iroquois were masters of balance of power diplomacy.
the british accepted their sovereignty in the ohio valley but it was challenged by the french and their indian allies.
in 1750 few white settlers inhabited the ohio valley.
but already scotchirish and german immigrants virginia planters and land speculators were eyeing the regions fertile soil.
in 1749 the government of virginia awarded an immense land grant half a million acres to the ohio company an example of the huge domains being parceled out to those with political connections.
the companys members included the colonys royal governor robert dinwiddie and the cream of virginia society lees carters and the young george washington.
the land grant threatened the regions indians as well as pennsylvania land speculators who also had claims in the area.
it sparked the french to bolster their presence in the region.
it was the ohio companys demand for french recognition of its land claims that inaugurated the seven years war known in the colonies as the french and a map of upstate new york by governor william tryon of colonial new york demonstrates that the area was considered the realm of the six iroquois nations whose domain also stretched into the ohio valley.
4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 battle for the continent indian war the first of the centurys imperial wars to begin in the colonies and the first to result in a decisive victory for one combatant.
it permanently altered the global balance of power.
the the cover of a magazine published in pennsylvania in 1758 depicts an englishman and a frenchman attempting to trade with an indian.
the frenchman offers a tomahawk and musket the englishman a bible and cloth.
of course the depictions of the two europeans reflect pro british stereotypes.
seven years war before 1688 england was a marginal power.
spains empire was far more extensive france had greater influence in europe and the dutch dominated overseas trade and finance.
only in the eighteenth century after numerous wars against its great rivals france and spain did britain emerge as the worlds leading empire and its center of trade and banking.
the war of the spanish succession known in the colonies as queen annes war lasted from 1702 to 1713 the war of jenkins ear named after a british seaman mistreated by the spanish from 1739 to 1742 and king georges war from 1740 to 1748.
to finance these wars britains public expenditures taxes and national debt rose enormously.
the high rate of taxation inspired discontent at home and would later help to spark the american revolution.
by the 1750s british possessions and trade reached around the globe.
every part of the world affects us in some way or another remarked the duke of newcastle.
the existence of global empires implied that warfare among them would also be global.
what became a worldwide struggle for imperial domination which eventually spread to europe west africa and asia began in 1754 with british efforts to dislodge the french from forts they had constructed in western pennsylvania.
in the previous year george washington then only twenty one years old had been dispatched by the colonys governor on an unsuccessful mission to persuade french soldiers to abandon a fort they were building on lands claimed by the ohio company.
in 1754 washington returned to the area with two companies of soldiers.
he hastily constructed fort necessity.
after an ill considered attempt to defend it against a larger french and indian force resulting in the loss of one third of his men washington was forced to surrender.
soon afterward an expedition led by general edward braddock against fort duquesne todays pittsburgh was ambushed by french and indian forces leaving braddock and two thirds of his 3 000 soldiers dead or wounded.
for two years the war went against the british.
french and indian forces captured british forts in northern new york.
the southern backcountry was ablaze with fighting among british forces colonists and indians.
inhumanity flourished on all sides.
indians killed hundreds of colonists in western pennsylvania and pushed the line of settlement all the way back to carlisle only 100 miles west of philadelphia.
in nova scotia the british rounded up around 5 000 local french residents called acadians confiscated their land and expelled them from the region selling their farms to settlers from new england.
some of those expelled eventually returned to france others ended up as far away as louisiana where their descendants came to be known as cajuns.
as the british government under prime minister william pitt who took office in 1757 raised huge sums of money and poured men and naval forces into the war the tide of battle turned.
pitts strategy was to provide funds to prussia and austria to enable them to hold the line against france and its ally spain in europe while the british struck at the french weak point its colonies.
by 1759 britain with colonial and indian soldiers playing a w h a t w a s t h e i m p a c t o f t h e s e v e n ye a r s wa r o n i m p e r i a l a n d i n d i a n w h i t e r e l a t i o n s.
major role had captured the pivotal french outposts of forts duquesne ticonderoga north of albany and louisbourg on cape breton island which guarded the mouth of the st lawrence river.
in september of that year a french army was defeated on the plains of abraham near quebec.
in 1760 montreal the last outpost of new france surrendered.
british forces also seized nearly all the islands in the french caribbean and established control of india.
in europe meanwhile prussia and austria managed to fend off the coalition of france russia and spain.
a world transformed as long as the world has stood there has not been such a war declared a british emissary to the delaware indians.
britains victory fundamentally reshaped the world balance of power.
in the peace of paris in 1763 france ceded canada to britain receiving back in return the sugar islands of guadeloupe and martinique far more lucrative colonies from the point of view of french authorities.
as part of the reshuffling of imperial possessions spain ceded florida to britain in exchange for the return of the philippines and cuba seized by the british during the war.
spain also acquired from france the vast louisiana colony.
frances 200 year old north american empire had come to an end.
with the exception of two tiny islands retained by france off the coast of newfoundland the entire continent east of the mississippi river was now in british hands.
peace remarked prime minister pitt will be as hard to make as war eighteenth century warfare conducted on land and sea across the globe was enormously expensive.
the seven years war put strains on all the participants.
the wars cost produced a financial crisis in france that almost three decades later would help to spark the french revolution.
the british would try to recoup part of the cost of war by increasing taxes on their american colonies.
we no sooner leave fighting our neighbors the french commented the british writer dr samuel johnson but we must fall to quarreling among ourselves in fact the peace of paris was soon followed by open warfare in north america between the british and native americans.
pontiac s rebellion throughout eastern north america the abrupt departure of the french in the aftermath of the seven years war eliminated the balance of power diplomacy that had enabled groups like the iroquois to maintain a significant degree of autonomy.
even as england and its colonies celebrated their victory as a triumph of liberty indians saw it as a threat to their own freedom.
indians had fought on both sides in the war although mainly as allies of the french.
their primary aim however was to maintain their independence from both empires.
domination by any outside power indians feared meant the loss of freedom.
without consulting them the french had ceded land indians claimed as their own to british control.
the treaty of paris left indians more dependent than ever on the british and ushered in a period of confusion over land claims control of the fur trade and tribal relations in general.
to indians it was clear that continued expansion of the british colonies posed a dire threat.
one british army officer reported that native americans say we mean to make slaves of them by taking their land.
4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 battle for the continent in 1763 in the wake of the french defeat indians of the ohio valley and great lakes launched a revolt against british rule.
although known as pontiacs rebellion after an ottawa war leader the rebellion owed at least as much to the teachings of neolin a delaware religious prophet.
during a religious vision the master of life instructed neolin that his people must reject european technology free themselves from commercial ties with whites and dependence on alcohol clothe themselves in the garb of their ancestors and drive the british from their territory although friendly french inhabitants could remain.
neolin combined this message with the relatively new idea of pan indian identity.
all indians he preached were a single people and only through cooperation could they regain their lost independence.
the common experience of dispossession the intertribal communities that had developed in the ohio country and the mixing of indian warriors in french armies had helped to inspire this sense of identity as indians rather than members of individual tribes.
the proclamation line in the spring and summer of 1763 ottawas hurons and other indians besieged detroit then a major british military outpost seized nine other forts and killed hundreds of white settlers who had intruded onto indian lands.
british forces soon launched a counterattack and over the next few years the tribes one by one made peace.
but the uprising inspired the government in london to issue the proclamation of 1763 prohibiting further colonial settlement west of the appalachian mountains.
these lands were reserved exclusively for indians.
moreover the proclamation banned the sale of indian lands to private individuals.
henceforth only colonial governments could arrange such purchases.
the british aim was less to protect the indians than to stabilize the situation on the colonial frontier and to avoid being dragged into an endless series of border conflicts.
but the proclamation enraged both settlers and speculators hoping to take advantage of the expulsion of the french to consolidate their claims to western lands.
they ignored the new policy.
george washington himself ordered his agents to buy up as much indian land as possible while keeping the transactions a profound secret because of their illegality.
failing to offer a viable solution to the question of westward expansion the proclamation of 1763 ended up further exacerbating settlerindian relations.
p e n n s y lva n i a and the indians the seven years war not only redrew the map of the world but produced dramatic changes within the american colonies as well.
nowhere was this more evident than in pennsylvania where the conflict shattered the decades old rule of the quaker elite and dealt the final blow to the colonys policy of accommodation with the indians.
during the war with the frontier ablaze with battles between settlers and french and indian warriors western pennsylvanians demanded that colonial authorities adopt a more aggressive stance.
when the governor declared war on hostile delawares raised a militia and offered a bounty for indian scalps many of the assemblys pacifist quakers resigned their seats effectively ending their control w h a t w a s t h e i m p a c t o f t h e s e v e n ye a r s wa r o n i m p e r i a l a n d i n d i a n w h i t e r e l a t i o n s.

voices of freedom from the interesting narrative of the life of olaudah equiano o r g u s t a v u s va s s a t h e a f r i c a n 1 7 8 9 olaudah equianos autobiography published in london was the most prominent account of the slave experience written in the eighteenth century.
in this passage which comes after equianos description of a slave auction in the caribbean he calls on white persons to live up to their professed different lots and it was very moving on this occasion to see and hear their cries at parting.
o ye nominal christians.
might not an african ask you learned you this from your god.
who says unto you do unto all men as you would men should do belief in liberty.
is it not enough that we are torn from our we were not many days in the merchants custody country and friends to toil for your luxury and lust of gain.
must every tender feeling be sacrificed to your avarice.
are the dearest friends and relations now before we were sold after their usual manner which is this on a signal given as the beat of a drum the buyers rush in at once into the yard where the slaves are confined and make choice of that parcel they like best.
in this manner without scruple are relations and friends separated most of them never to see each other again.
i remember in the vessel in which i was brought over.
there were several brothers who in the sale were sold in rendered more dear by their separation from their kindred still to be parted from each other and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of slavery with the small comfort of being together and mingling their sufferings and sorrows.
why are parents to lose their children brothers their sisters or husbands their wives.
surely this is a new refinement in cruelty.
from pontiac speeches 1762 and 1763 pontiac was a leader of the pan indian resistance to english rule known as pontiacs rebellion which followed the end of the seven years war.
neolin was a delaware religious prophet who helped to inspire the rebellion.
why do you not clothe yourselves in skins as they did use bows and arrows and the stone pointed lances which they used.
you have bought guns knives kettles and blankets from the white man until you can no longer do without them and what is worse you have drunk the poison firewater which turns you into fools.
fling all these things away live as your wise forefathers did before you.
englishmen although you have conquered the french you have not yet conquered us.
we are not your slaves.

4 slavery freedom and the struggle for empire to 1763 benjamin franklin produced this famous cartoon in 1754 calling on britains north american colonies to unite against the french.
battle for the continent a dozen men women and children who lived there under the protection of pennsylvanias governor.
they then marched on lancaster where they killed fourteen additional indians.
like participants in bacons rebellion nearly a century earlier they accused colonial authorities of treating indians too leniently.
they petitioned the legislature to remove all indians from the colony.
the indians claim to freedom and independency they insisted threatened pennsylvanias stability.
when the paxton boys marched on philadelphia in february 1764 intending to attack moravian indians who resided near the city the governor ordered the expulsion of much of the indian population.
by the 1760s pennsylvanias holy experiment was at an end and with it william penns promise of true friendship and amity between colonists and the native population.
no other large colony had a smaller indian population or a more remorseless determination on the part of settlers to eliminate those who remained.
colonial identities like the indians colonists emerged from the seven years war with a heightened sense of collective identity.
before the war the colonies had been largely isolated from one another.
outside of new england more americans probably traveled to england than from one colony to another.
in 1751 governor george clinton of new york had called for a general conference on indian relations but only three colonies bothered to send delegates.
the albany plan of union of 1754 drafted by benjamin franklin at the outbreak of the seven years war envisioned the creation of a grand council composed of delegates from each colony with the power to levy taxes and deal with indian relations and the common defense.
rejected by the colonial assemblies whose powers franklins proposal would curtail the plan was never sent to london for approval.
participation in the seven years war created greater bonds among the colonies.
but the war also strengthened colonists pride in being members of the british empire.
it has been said that americans were never more british than in 1763.
colonial militiamen and british regulars fought alongside each other against the french.
tensions developed between the professional british military and the often undisciplined american citizen soldiers but the common experience of battle and victory also forged bonds between them.
for much of the century new englanders had called for the conquest of canada as a blow for protestant freedom against popish slavery now that this had been accomplished british victory in the seven years war seemed a triumph of liberty over tyranny.
the defeat of the catholic french reinforced the equation of british nationality protestantism and freedom.
in fact however after 1763 britains global empire was not predominantly protestant or british or free.
it now included tens of thousands of french catholics and millions of persons in india governed as subjects rather than as citizens.
the english statesman edmund burke wondered whether british liberty could be reconciled with rule over this vast heterogeneous intricate mass of interests burke was almost alone in seeing the newly expanded empire as a challenge to the principles of british freedom.
but soon the american colonists would come to believe that membership in the empire jeopardized their liberty.
when they did they set out on a road that led to independence.

the american revolution inaugurated an era of political upheaval throughout the western world known to historians ever since as the age of revolution.
it helped to inspire popular uprisings in europe the caribbean and latin america and forever changed the course of american development.
liberty emerged as the eras foremost rallying cry.
the revolutionary generation insisted that the meaning of their struggle lay not only in political independence but also in the establishment of what the writer thomas paine called an asylum of liberty for all mankind.
the american revolution not only broke the political bond with great britain but also inspired groups within american society to claim greater rights for themselves.
propertyless men demanded the right to vote.
women began to challenge their subordination to men.
indentured servants ran away from their masters.
and slaves seized the opportunity to gain their freedom by fighting in the continental army or by escaping to the british side.
by the time it had run its course the revolution had greatly expanded some realms of american freedom.
it severed the connection between church and state promoted the emergence of a lively public sphere in which ordinary men and sometimes women participated in political debate and it challenged the monopoly on political power by colonial elites.
it set in motion the abolition of slavery in the northern states.
on the other hand for some americans independence meant a loss of liberty.
many of those who had remained loyal to england were persecuted and forced to leave the country.
the end of the british presence removed the last barrier to the westward expansion of the american population making inevitable the dispossession of the remaining indian population east of the mississippi river.
and the formation of a national government in which slaveowners occupied the presidency for most of the half century after independence helped to consolidate the institution of slavery in the south.
three processes set in motion by the revolution gained strength in the early decades of the nineteenth century and profoundly affected americans ideas about freedom.
the first was the democratization of politics.
most members of the convention that drafted the nations constitution in 1787 assumed that men of property and education would dominate the new american government.
but the democratic upsurge inspired by the revolution coupled with the swift emergence of political parties offering radically different programs for national development encouraged a broad popular participation in politics.
by the 1830s a flourishing democratic system was firmly in place.
property qualifications for voting had been eliminated in nearly every state two parties competed throughout the country and voter turnout stood at record levels.
political democracy had become a defining element of american freedom.
second the development of steamboats canals and railroads brought rapid improvements in transportation and communication and created a broad market for farm products and manufactured goods.
the market revolution opened up vast areas of the american interior to commercial farming and it stimulated the early development of factory production.
it offered new opportunities for personal advancement to many americans while reducing others to what seemed an unfree situation working for wages under the constant supervision of an employer.
the market revolution also made possible the third major development of this era the populations westward movement and the rise of the west as a distinct social and political region.
the market revolution and westward shift of population also helped to reshape the idea of freedom identifying it more and more closely with economic opportunity physical mobility and individual self definition and fulfillment.
many of the founding fathers had feared that economic growth rapid territorial expansion and the development of political parties would endanger the unity of the new republic.
and between the coming of independence and 1840 the new nation faced a series of crises as americans divided according to political and regional loyalties and battled for advantage in the expanding economy.
political conflict often revolved around the relationship between government and the economy.
should the national government seek to promote economic development and direct its course by enacting a system of tariffs internal improvements and a national bank.
or should it stand aside and allow americans to pursue economic self interest without governmental interference.
in the 1790s the former view was represented by the federalist party the latter by the jeffersonian republicans.
in the 1830s a similar division emerged between whigs and democrats.
advocates of both visions of the role of the national government insisted that theirs was the best program to promote american liberty.
american freedom also continued to be shaped by the presence of slavery.
rather than dying out as some of the founders had hoped slavery expanded rapidly in territorial extent and economic importance.
slavery helped to define the boundaries of american freedom.
the privileges of voting officeholding and access to economic opportunity were increasingly restricted to whites.
women too were barred from these elements of freedom.
their role according to the prevailing social values was to remain in the private sphere of the home.
the contradiction embedded in american life from the earliest days of settlement expanding freedom for some coexisting with and indeed depending on lack of freedom for others continued to bedevil the new nation.

what key events sharpened the divisions between britain and the colonists in the late 1760s and early 1770s.
what key events marked the move toward american independence.
how were american forces able to prevail in the revolutionary war.
l o n the night of august 26 1765 a violent crowd of bostonians assaulted the elegant home of thomas hutchinson chief justice and lieutenant governor of massachusetts.
hutchinson and his family were eating dinner when the rioters arrived.
they barely had time to escape before the crowd broke down the front door and proceeded to destroy or carry off most of their possessions including paintings furniture silverware and notes for a history of massachusetts hutchinson was writing.
by the time they departed only the outer walls of the home remained standing.
the immediate cause of the riot was the stamp act a recently enacted british tax that many colonists felt violated their liberty.
critics of the measure had spread a rumor that hutchinson had written to london encouraging its passage in fact he privately opposed it.
only a few days earlier hutchinson had helped to disperse a crowd attacking a building owned by his relative andrew oliver a merchant who had been appointed to help administer the new law.
both crowds were led by ebenezer mackintosh a shoemaker who had fought against the french during the seven years war and enjoyed a wide following among bostons working people.
arrested after the destruction of hutchinsons home mackintosh was released after the intervention of the loyal nine a group of merchants and craftsmen who had taken the lead in opposing the stamp act.
the violence had gone far beyond what the loyal nine intended and they promised authorities that resistance to the stamp act would henceforth be peaceful.
the riot nonetheless convinced hutchinson that for britain to rule america effectively there must be an abridgement of what are called english liberties whether colonists would accept such an abridgement however was very much in doubt.
the riot of august 26 was one small episode in a series of events that launched a half century of popular protest and political upheaval throughout the western world.
the momentous era that came to be called the age of revolution began in british north america spread to europe and the caribbean and culminated in the latin american wars for independence.
in all these struggles liberty emerged as the foremost rallying cry for popular discontent.
rarely has the idea played so central a role in political debate and social upheaval.
if the attack on hutchinsons home demonstrated the depths of feeling aroused by britains efforts to impose greater control over its empire it also revealed that revolution is a dynamic process whose consequences no one can anticipate.
the crowds fury expressed resentments against the rich and powerful quite different from colonial leaders objections to parliaments attempt to tax the colonies.
the stamp act crisis inaugurated not only a struggle for colonial liberty in relation to great britain but also a multi sided battle to define and extend liberty within america.
what were the roots and significance of the stamp act controversy.
the crisis begins when george iii assumed the throne of great britain in 1760 no one on either side of the atlantic imagined that within two decades britains american colonies would separate from the empire.
but the seven years war which left britain with an enormous debt and vastly enlarged overseas possessions to defend led successive governments in london to seek ways to make the colonies share the cost of empire.
having studied the writings of british opposition thinkers who insisted that power inevitably seeks to encroach upon liberty colonial leaders came to see these measures as part of a british design to undermine their freedom.
having only recently gloried in their enjoyment of british liberty they came to conclude that membership in the empire was a threat to freedom rather than its foundation.
this conviction set the colonies on the road to independence.
consolidating the empire the seven years war to which the colonists contributed soldiers and economic resources underscored for rulers in london how important the empire was to britains well being and its status as a great power.
now they believed new regulations were needed to help guarantee the empires continued strength and prosperity.
before 1763 parliament had occasionally acted to forbid the issuance of paper money in america and to restrict colonial economic activities that competed with businesses at home.
the wool act of 1699 hat act of 1732 and iron act of 1750 forbade colonial manufacture of these items.
the molasses act of 1733 sought to curtail trade between new england and the french caribbean by imposing a prohibitive tax on french produced molasses used to make rum in american distilleries.
and the navigation acts discussed in chapter 3 sought to channel key american exports like tobacco through british ports.
the colonists frequently ignored all these measures.
as to internal affairs within the colonies the british government frequently seemed uninterested.
there was no point one official said in worrying about the behavior of colonists who plant tobacco and puritanism only like fools beginning in the late 1740s the board of trade which was responsible for overseeing colonial affairs attempted to strengthen imperial authority.
it demanded that colonial laws conform to royal instructions and encouraged colonial assemblies to grant permanent salaries to royal governors.
but the outbreak of the seven years war suspended this initiative.
having treated the colonists as allies during the war britain reverted in the mid 1760s to seeing them as subordinates whose main role was to enrich the mother country.
during this period the government in london concerned itself with the colonies in unprecedented ways hoping to make british rule more efficient and systematic and to raise funds to help pay for the war and to finance the empire.
nearly all british political leaders supported the new laws that so enraged the colonists.
americans britons felt should be grateful to the empire.
to fight the seven years war britain had borrowed from banks and individual investors more than 150 million the equivalent of tens of trillions of dollars in todays money.
an engraving from a massachusetts almanac published in 1774 depicts lieutenant governor thomas hutchinson whose house had been destroyed by a mob nine years earlier.
the devil carries a list of hutchinsons crimes it was common in this period to use religious symbols to demonize political opponents.
5 the american revolution 1763 1783 according to the doctrine of virtual representation the house of commons represented all residents of the british empire whether or not they could vote for members.
in this 1775 cartoon criticizing the idea a blinded britannia on the far right stumbles into a pit.
next to her two colonists complain of being robbed by british taxation.
in the background according to an accompanying explanation of the cartoon stand the catholic city of quebec and the protestant town of boston the latter in flames.
the crisis begins interest on the debt absorbed half the governments annual revenue.
the tax burden in britain had reached unprecedented heights.
it seemed only reasonable that the colonies should help pay this national debt foot part of the bill for continued british protection and stop cheating the treasury by violating the navigation acts.
nearly all britons moreover believed that parliament represented the entire empire and had a right to legislate for it.
millions of britons including the residents of major cities like manchester and birmingham had no representatives in parliament.
but according to the widely accepted theory of virtual representation which held that each member represented the entire empire not just his own district the interests of all who lived under the british crown were supposedly taken into account.
when americans began to insist that because they were unrepresented in parliament the british government could not tax the colonies they won little support in the mother country.
to their surprise however british governments found that the effective working of the empire required the cooperation of local populations.
time and again british officials backed down in the face of colonial resistance only to return with new measures to centralize control of the empire that only stiffened colonial resolve.
the british government had already alarmed many colonists by issuing writs of assistance to combat smuggling.
these were general search warrants that allowed customs officials to search anywhere they chose for smuggled goods.
in a celebrated court case in boston in 1761 the lawyer james otis insisted that the writs were an instrument of arbitrary power destructive to english liberty and the fundamental principles of the constitution and that parliament therefore had no right to authorize them.
american independence was then and there born john adams later remarked a considerable exaggeration.
many colonists were also outraged by the proclamation of 1763 mentioned in the previous chapter barring further settlement on lands west of the appalachian mountains.
taxing the colonies in 1764 the sugar act introduced by prime minister george grenville reduced the existing tax on molasses imported into north america from the french west indies from six pence to three pence per gallon.
but the act also established a new machinery to end widespread smuggling by colonial merchants.
and to counteract the tendency of colonial juries to acquit merchants charged with violating trade regulations it strengthened the admiralty courts where accused smugglers could be judged without benefit of a jury trial.
thus colonists saw the measure not as a welcome reduction in taxation but as an attempt to get them to pay a levy they would otherwise have evaded.
at the same time a revenue act placed goods such as wool and hides which had previously been traded freely with holland france and southern what were the roots and significance of the stamp act controversy.
europe on the enumerated list meaning they had to be shipped through england.
together these measures threatened the profits of colonial merchants and seemed certain to aggravate an already serious economic recession resulting from the end of the seven years war.
they were accompanied by the currency act which reaffirmed the earlier ban on colonial assemblies issuing paper as legal tender that is money that individuals are required to accept in payment of debts.
the stamp act crisis the sugar act was an effort to strengthen the long established and longevaded navigation acts.
the stamp act of 1765 represented a new departure in imperial policy.
for the first time parliament attempted to raise money from direct taxes in the colonies rather than through the regulation of trade.
the act required that all sorts of printed material produced in the colonies newspapers books court documents commercial papers land deeds almanacs etc carry a stamp purchased from authorities.
its purpose was to help finance the operations of the empire including the cost of stationing british troops in north america without seeking revenue from colonial assemblies.
whereas the sugar act had mainly affected residents of colonial ports the stamp act managed to offend virtually every free colonist rich and poor farmers artisans and merchants.
it was especially resented by members of the public sphere who wrote published and read books and newspapers and followed political affairs.
the prospect of a british army permanently stationed on american soil also alarmed many colonists.
and by imposing the stamp tax without colonial consent parliament directly challenged the authority of local elites who through the assemblies they controlled had established their power over the raising and spending of money.
they were ready to defend this authority in the name of liberty.
opposition to the stamp act was the first great drama of the revolutionary era and the first major split between colonists and great britain over the meaning of freedom.
nearly all colonial political leaders opposed the act.
in voicing their grievances they invoked the rights of the freeborn englishman which they insisted colonists should also enjoy.
opponents of the act occasionally referred to the natural rights of all mankind.
more frequently however they drew on time honored british principles such as a communitys right not to be taxed except by its elected representatives.
liberty they insisted could not be secure where property was taken away without consent taxation and an engraving of james otis graces the cover of the boston almanack for 1770.
he is flanked by the ancient gods hercules and minerva carrying a liberty cap.
representation at stake were clashing ideas of the british empire itself.
american leaders viewed the empire as an association of equals in which free settlers overseas enjoyed the same rights as britons at home.
colonists in other outposts of the empire such as india the west indies and canada echoed this outlook.
all in the name of liberty claimed the right to govern their own affairs.

the crisis begins laws to remain in force would reduce them to slavery the british government and its appointed representatives in america by contrast saw the empire as a system of unequal parts in which different principles governed different areas and all were subject to the authority of parliament.
to surrender the right to tax the colonies would set a dangerous precedent for the empire as a whole.
in an empire extended and diversified as that of great britain declared governor francis bernard of massachusetts in 1765 there must be a supreme legislature to which all other powers must be subordinate parliament bernard continued was the sanctuary of liberty a description with which many americans were beginning to disagree.
some opponents of the stamp act distinguished between internal taxes like the stamp duty which they claimed parliament had no right to impose and revenue legitimately raised through the regulation of trade.
but more and more colonists insisted that britain had no right to tax them at all since americans were unrepresented in the house of commons.
no taxation without representation became their rallying cry.
virginias house of burgesses approved four resolutions offered by the fiery orator patrick henry.
they insisted that the colonists enjoyed the same liberties privileges franchises and immunities as residents of the mother country and that the right to consent to taxation was a cornerstone of british freedom the house of burgesses rejected as too radical three other resolutions including henrys call for outright resistance to unlawful taxation but these were also reprinted in colonial newspapers.
in october 1765 the stamp act congress with twenty seven delegates from nine colonies including some of the most prominent men in america met in new york and endorsed virginias position.
its resolutions began by affirming the allegiance of all colonists to the crown of great britain and their due subordination to parliament.
but they went on to insist that the right to consent to taxation was essential to the freedom of a people soon merchants throughout the colonies agreed to boycott british goods until parliament repealed the stamp act.
this was the first major cooperative action among britains mainland colonies.
in a sense by seeking to impose uniformity on the colonies rather than dealing with them individually as in the past parliament had inadvertently united america.
liberty and resistance no word was more frequently invoked by critics of the stamp act than liberty throughout the colonies opponents of the new tax staged mock funerals in which libertys coffin was carried to a burial ground only to have the occupant miraculously revived at the last moment whereupon the assembled crowd repaired to a tavern to celebrate.
as the crisis continued what were the roots and significance of the stamp act controversy.
symbols of liberty proliferated.
the large elm tree in boston on which protesters had hanged an effigy of the stamp distributor andrew oliver to persuade him to resign his post came to be known as the liberty tree.
its image soon began to appear in prints and pamphlets throughout the colonies.
open air meetings were held beneath the tree and as a result the space came to be called liberty hall.
in new york city a pine mast erected in 1766 as a meeting place for opponents of the stamp act was called the liberty pole.
colonial leaders resolved to prevent the new laws implementation and by and large they succeeded.
even before the passage of the stamp act a committee of correspondence in boston communicated with other colonies to encourage opposition to the sugar and currency acts.
now such committees sprang up in other colonies exchanging ideas and information about resistance.
initiated by colonial elites the movement against the stamp act quickly drew in a far broader range of americans.
the act wrote john adams a boston lawyer who drafted a set of widely reprinted resolutions against the measure had inspired the people even to the lowest ranks to become more attentive to their liberties more inquisitive about them and more determined to defend them than they were ever before known political debate adams added pervaded the colonies our presses have groaned our pulpits have thundered our legislatures have resolved our towns have voted politics in the streets opponents of the stamp act however did not rely solely on debate.
even before the law went into effect crowds forced those chosen to administer it to resign and destroyed shipments of stamps.
in new york city processions involving hundreds of residents shouting liberty paraded through the streets nearly every night in late 1765.
they were organized by the newly created sons of liberty a body led by talented and ambitious lesser merchants like alexander mcdougall isaac sears and john lamb.
fluent in dutch french and german lamb became the sons liaison to the citys numerous ethnic groups.
these self made men had earned fortunes as privateers plundering french shipping during the seven years war and complained new yorks lieutenant governor opposed every limitation of trade and duty on it while they enjoyed no standing among the colonys wealthy elite and carried little weight in municipal affairs they enjoyed a broad following among the citys craftsmen laborers and sailors.
the sons posted notices reading liberty property and no stamps and took the lead in enforcing the boycott of british imports.
their actions were viewed with increasing alarm by the aristocratic livingston and de lancey families who dominated new york politics.
as the assault on thomas hutchinsons house in boston demonstrated crowds could easily get out of hand.
in november 1765 a new york crowd reportedly a warning by the sons of liberty against using the stamps required by the stamp act which are shown on the left.
5 the american revolution 1763 1783 the crisis begins composed of sailors blacks laborers and youths hurled stones at fort george at the tip of manhattan island.
they then proceeded to destroy the home of major thomas james a british officer who was said to have boasted that he would force the stamps down new yorkers throats.
stunned by the ferocity of american resistance and pressured by london merchants and manufacturers who did not wish to lose their american markets the british government retreated.
in 1766 parliament repealed the stamp act.
but this concession was accompanied by the declaratory act which rejected americans claims that only their elected representatives could levy taxes.
parliament proclaimed this measure possessed the power to pass laws for the colonies and people of america.
in all cases whatever since the debt ridden british government continued to need money raised in the colonies passage of the declaratory act promised further conflict.
the regulators the stamp act crisis was not the only example of violent social turmoil during the 1760s.
many colonies experienced contentious internal divisions as well.
as population moved westward the conflicting land claims of settlers speculators colonial governments and indians sparked fierce disputes.
rural areas had a long tradition of resistance by settlers and small farmers against the claims of land speculators and large proprietors.
as in the stamp act crisis liberty was their rallying cry but in this case liberty had less to do with imperial policy than secure possession of land.
beginning in the mid 1760s a group of wealthy residents of the south carolina backcountry calling themselves regulators protested the underrepresentation of western settlements in the colonys assembly and the legislators failure to establish local governments that could regularize land titles and suppress bands of outlaws.
the lack of courts in the area they claimed had led to a breakdown of law and order allowing an infernal gang of villains to commit shocking outrages on persons and property.
they added we are free men british subjects not born slaves a parallel movement in north carolina mobilized small farmers who refused to pay taxes kidnapped local officials assaulted the homes of land speculators merchants and lawyers and disrupted court proceedings.
here the complaint was not a lack of government but corrupt county authorities.
these local officials the regulators claimed threatened inexpensive access to land and the prosperity of ordinary settlers through high taxes and court fees.
demanding the democratization of local government the regulators condemned the rich and powerful the colonys elite who used their political authority to prosper at the expense of poor industrious farmers.
at their peak the regulators numbered around 8 000 armed farmers.
the region remained in turmoil until 1771 when in the battle of alamance the farmers were suppressed by the colonys militia.
the tenant uprising also in the mid 1760s tenants on the livingston philipse and cortland manors along the hudson river north of new york city stopped paying rent and began seizing land.
like opponents of the stamp act they called what were the roots and significance of the stamp act controversy.
themselves the sons of liberty.
the original sons however opposed their uprising and it was soon suppressed by british and colonial troops.
meanwhile small farmers in the green mountains took up arms to protect their holdings against intrusions by new york landlords.
the legal situation there was complex.
the area was part of new york but during the 1750s the governor of new hampshire had issued land grants to new england families pocketing a fortune in fees.
when new yorkers tried to enforce their own title to the area the settlers leader ethan allen insisted that land should belong to the person who worked it.
outsiders he claimed were trying to enslave a free people in the mid 1770s allen and his green mountain boys gained control of the region which later became the state of vermont.
the emerging rift between britain and america eventually superimposed itself on conflicts within the colonies.
but the social divisions revealed in the stamp act riots and backcountry uprisings made some members of the colonial elite fear that opposition to british measures might unleash turmoil at home.
as a result they were more reluctant to challenge british authority when the next imperial crisis arose.
the road to revolution the townshend crisis in 1767 the government in london decided to impose a new set of taxes on americans.
they were devised by the chancellor of the exchequer the cabinets chief financial minister charles townshend.
in opposing the stamp act some colonists including benjamin franklin then representing the pennsylvania assembly in london had seemed to suggest that they would not object if britain raised revenue by regulating trade.
taking them at their word townshend persuaded parliament to impose new taxes on goods imported into the colonies and to create a new board of customs commissioners to collect them and suppress smuggling.
he intended to use the new revenues to pay the salaries of american governors and judges thus freeing them from dependence on colonial assemblies.
although many merchants objected to the new enforcement procedures opposition to the townshend duties developed more slowly than in the case of the stamp act.
leaders in several colonies nonetheless decided in 1768 to reimpose the ban on importing british goods.
homespun virtue the boycott began in boston and soon spread to the southern colonies.
reliance on american rather than british goods on homespun clothing rather than imported finery became a symbol of american resistance.
it also reflected as the colonists saw it a virtuous spirit of self sacrifice as compared with the self indulgence and luxury many americans were coming to associate with britain.
women who spun and wove at home so as not to purchase british goods were hailed as daughters of liberty.
the idea of using homemade rather than imported goods especially appealed to chesapeake planters who found themselves owing increasing c h.
5 the american revolution 1763 1783 the road to revolution amounts of money to british merchants.
nonimportation wrote george washington reflecting virginia planters concern about their growing burden of debt gave the extravagant man an opportunity to retrench his expenses by reducing the purchase of british luxuries without having to advertise to his neighbors that he might be in financial distress.
in this way washington continued virginians could maintain the liberty which we have derived from our ancestors while reducing their considerable debts.
virginias leaders also announced a temporary ban on the importation of slaves but smaller planters in the piedmont region away from the coast where the institution was expanding ignored this restriction.
urban artisans who welcomed an end to competition from imported british manufactured goods strongly supported the boycott.
philadelphia and new york merchants at first were reluctant to take part although they eventually agreed to go along.
nonimportation threatened their livelihoods and raised the prospect of unleashing further lower class turmoil.
as had happened during the stamp act crisis the streets of american cities filled with popular protests against the new duties.
extralegal local committees attempted to enforce the boycott of british goods.
the boston massacre boston once again became the focal point of conflict.
royal troops had been stationed in the city in 1768 after rioting that followed the british seizure of the ship liberty for violating trade regulations.
the sloop belonged to john hancock one of the citys most prominent merchants.
the soldiers who competed for jobs on bostons waterfront with the citys laborers became more and more unpopular.
on march 5 1770 a fight between a snowball throwing crowd of bostonians and british troops escalated into an armed confrontation that left five bostonians dead.
one of those who fell in what came to be called the boston massacre was crispus attucks a sailor of mixed indian african white ancestry.
attucks would later be remembered as the first martyr of the american revolution the commanding officer and eight soldiers were put on trial in massachusetts.
ably defended by john adams who viewed lower class crowd actions as a dangerous method of opposing british policies seven were found not guilty while two were convicted of manslaughter.
but paul revere a member of the boston sons of liberty and a silversmith and engraver helped to stir up indignation against the british army by producing a widely circulated and quite inaccurate print of the boston massacre depicting a line of british soldiers firing into an unarmed crowd.
by 1770 as merchants profits shriveled and many members of the colonial elite found they could not do without british goods the nonimportation movement was collapsing.
the value of british imports to the colonies declined by about one third during 1769 but then rebounded to its former level.
british merchants who wished to remove a possible source of future interruption of trade pressed for repeal of the townshend duties.
when the british ministry agreed leaving in place only a tax on tea and agreed to remove troops from boston american merchants quickly abandoned the boycott.
visions of freedom the boston massacre.
less than a month after the boston massacre of 1770 in which five colonists died paul revere produced this engraving of the event.
although it inaccurately depicts what was actually a disorganized brawl between residents of boston and british soldiers this image became one of the most influential pieces of political propaganda of the revolutionary era.
questions 1.
how does revere depict the british and colonists in this encounter and who does he blame for the five colonists deaths.
what attitude toward british authorities is revere attempting to promote through this engraving.
5 the american revolution 1763 1783 wilkes and the road to revolution liberty once again an immediate crisis had been resolved.
nonetheless many americans concluded that britain was succumbing to the same pattern of political corruption and decline of liberty that afflicted other countries.
the overlap of the townshend crisis with a controversy in britain over the treatment of john wilkes reinforced this sentiment.
a radical journalist known for scandalous writings about the king and ministry wilkes had been elected to parliament from london but was expelled from his seat.
wilkes and liberty became a popular rallying cry on both sides of the atlantic.
in addition rumors circulated in the colonies that the anglican church in england planned to send bishops to america.
among members of other protestant denominations the rumors strongly denied in london sparked fears that bishops would establish religious courts like those that had once persecuted dissenters.
the conviction that the british government had set itself on a course dangerous to liberty underpinned colonial resistance when the next crisis arose.
the william hogarths depiction of john wilkes holding a liberty cap.
wilkess publication north briton bitterly attacked the king and prime minister for which wilkes was arrested tried and acquitted by a london jury.
he became a popular symbol of freedom on both sides of the atlantic.
the bostonians paying the excise man a 1774 engraving shows colonists pouring tea down the throat of a tax collector who has been covered with tar and feathers.
a noose hangs menacingly from the liberty tree.
in the background is the boston tea party.
tea act the next crisis underscored how powerfully events in other parts of britains global empire affected the american colonies.
the east india company a giant trading monopoly effectively governed recently acquired british possessions in india.
numerous british merchants bankers and other individuals had invested heavily in its stock.
a classic speculative bubble ensued with the price of stock in the company rising sharply and then collapsing.
to rescue the company and its investors the british government decided to help it market its enormous holdings of chinese tea in north america.
tea once a preserve of the wealthy had by now become a drink consumed by all social classes in england and the colonies.
to further stimulate its sales and bail out the east india company the british government now headed by frederick lord north offered the company a series of rebates and tax exemptions.
these enabled it to dump low priced tea on the american market undercutting both established merchants and smugglers.
money raised through the taxation of imported tea would be used to help defray the costs of colonial government thus threatening once again the assemblies control over finance.
the tax on tea was not new.
but many colonists insisted that to pay it on this large new body of imports would acknowledge britains right to tax the colonies.
as tea shipments arrived resistance developed in the major ports.
on december 16 1773 a group of colonists disguised as indians boarded three ships at anchor in boston harbor and threw more than 300 chests of tea into the water.
the event became known as the boston tea party.
the loss to the east india company was around 10 000 the equivalent of more than 4 million today.
the intolerable acts the british government declared lord north must now demonstrate whether we have or have not any authority in that country its response to the boston tea party was swift and decisive.
parliament closed the port of what key events sharpened the divisions between britain and the colonists in the late 1760s and early 1770s.
boston to all trade until the tea was paid for.
it radically altered the massachusetts charter of 1691 by curtailing town meetings and authorizing the governor to appoint members to the council positions previously filled by election.
parliament also empowered military commanders to lodge soldiers in private homes.
these measures called the coercive or intolerable acts by americans united the colonies in opposition to what was widely seen as a direct threat to their political freedom.
at almost the same time parliament passed the quebec act.
this extended the southern boundary of that canadian province to the ohio river and granted legal toleration to the roman catholic church in canada.
with an eye to the growing tensions in colonies to the south the act sought to secure the allegiance of quebecs catholics by offering rights denied to their coreligionists in britain including practicing their faith freely and holding positions in the civil service.
the act not only threw into question land claims in the ohio country but persuaded many colonists that the government in london was conspiring to strengthen catholicism dreaded by most protestants in its american empire.
fears of religious and political tyranny mingled in the minds of many colonists.
especially in new england the cause of liberty became the cause of god.
a gathering of 1 000 residents of farmington connecticut in may 1774 adopted resolutions proclaiming that as the sons of freedom they would resist every attempt to take away our liberties and properties and to enslave us forever they accused the british ministry of being instigated by the devil the coming of independence the continental congress british actions had destroyed the legitimacy of the imperial government in the eyes of many colonists.
opposition to the intolerable acts now spread to small towns and rural areas that had not participated actively in previous resistance.
in september 1774 in the town of worcester massachusetts 4 600 militiamen from thirty seven towns half the adult male population of the entire county lined both sides of main street as the british appointed officials walked the gauntlet between them.
in the same month a convention of delegates from massachusetts towns approved a series of resolutions called the suffolk resolves for the county in which boston is located that urged americans to refuse obedience to the new laws withhold taxes and prepare for war.
to coordinate resistance to the intolerable acts a continental congress convened in philadelphia that month bringing together the most prominent political leaders of twelve mainland colonies georgia did not take part.
from massachusetts came the brace of adamses john and his the mitred minuet a british cartoon from 1774 shows four roman catholic bishops dancing around a copy of the quebec act.

virginias seven delegates included george washington richard henry lee and the renowned orator patrick henry.
henrys power as a speaker came from a unique style that combined moral appeals with blunt directness.
his manner one contemporary observed was vehement without transporting him beyond the power of self command.
his lightning consisted in quick successive flashes the distinctions between virginians pennsylvanians new yorkers and new englanders henry declared are no more.
i am not a virginian but an american in march 1775 henry concluded a speech urging a virginia convention to begin military preparations with a legendary credo give me liberty or give me death the continental association before it adjourned at the end of october 1774 with an agreement to reconvene the following may if colonial demands had not been met the congress endorsed the suffolk resolves and adopted the continental association which called for an almost complete halt to trade with great britain and the west indies at south carolinas insistence exports of rice to europe were exempted.
the association also encouraged domestic manufacturing and denounced every species of extravagance and dissipation congress authorized local committees of safety to oversee its mandates and to take action against enemies of american liberty including businessmen who tried to profit from the sudden scarcity of goods.
the committees of safety began the process of transferring effective political power from established governments whose authority derived from great britain to extralegal grassroots bodies reflecting the will of the people.
by early 1775 some 7 000 men were serving on local committees throughout the colonies a vast expansion of the political nation the committees became training grounds where small farmers city artisans propertyless laborers and others who had heretofore had little role in government discussed political issues and exercised political power.
in philadelphia the extralegal committees of the 1760s that oversaw the boycott of british goods had been composed almost entirely of prominent lawyers and merchants.
but younger merchants shopkeepers and artisans dominated the committee elected in november 1774 to enforce the continental association.
they were determined that resistance to british measures not be dropped as it had been in 1770.
when the new york assembly refused to endorse the association local committees continued to enforce it anyway.
the sweets of liberty by 1775 talk of liberty pervaded the colonies.
the past few years had witnessed an endless parade of pamphlets with titles like a chariot of liberty and oration on the beauties of liberty the latter a sermon delivered in boston by joseph allen in 1772 became the most popular public address of the years before independence.
sober men spoke longingly of the sweets of liberty while sleeping americans dreamed of liberty.
one anonymous essayist reported a night vision of the word written in the suns rays.
commented a british emigrant who arrived in maryland early in 1775 they are all liberty mad what key events marked the move toward american independence.
the right to resist oppressive authority and the identification of liberty with the cause of god so deeply ingrained by the imperial struggles of the eighteenth century were now invoked against britain itself by colonists of all backgrounds.
the first mass meeting in the history of northampton county pennsylvania whose population was overwhelmingly of german ancestry gathered in 1774.
by the following year a majority of the countys adult population had joined militia associations.
many german settlers whose close knit communities had earlier viewed with some suspicion the famous english liberty as a byword for selfish individualism now claimed all the rights and privileges of natural born subjects of his majesty as the crisis deepened americans increasingly based their claims not simply on the historical rights of englishmen but on the more abstract language of natural rights and universal freedom.
the first continental congress defended its actions by appealing to the principles of the english constitution the liberties of free and natural born subjects within the realm of england and the immutable law of nature john lockes theory of natural rights that existed prior to the establishment of government offered a powerful justification for colonial resistance.
americans declared thomas jefferson in a summary view of the rights of british america written in 1774 to instruct virginias delegates to the continental congress were a free people claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature and not as the gift of their chief magistrate americans jefferson insisted still revered the king.
but he demanded that empire henceforth be seen as a collection of equal parts held together by loyalty to a constitutional monarch not a system in which one part ruled over the others.
the outbreak of war by the time the second continental congress convened in may 1775 war had broken out between british soldiers and armed citizens of massachusetts.
on april 19 a force of british soldiers marched from boston toward the nearby town of concord seeking to seize arms being stockpiled there.
riders from boston among them paul revere warned local leaders of the troops approach.
militiamen took up arms and tried to resist the british advance.
skirmishes between americans and british soldiers took place at lexington and again at concord.
by the time the british retreated to the safety of boston some fortynine americans and seventy three members of the royal army lay dead.
what the philosopher ralph waldo emerson would later call the shot heard round the world began the american war of independence.
it reverberated throughout the colonies.
when news of the skirmish reached lemuel roberts a poor new york farmer he felt his bosom glow with the call of liberty roberts set off for massachusetts to enlist in the army.
in may 1775 ethan allen and the green mountain boys together with militiamen from connecticut led by benedict arnold surrounded the battle of concord as depicted in a 1775 engraving by amos doolittle a new haven silversmith.
under musket fire from colonials the british retreat across concords north bridge.
in his poem concorde hymn 1837 ralph waldo emerson immortalized the moment by the rude bridge that arched the flood their flag to aprils breeze unfurled here once the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard round the world.

the coming of independence fort ticonderoga in new york and forced it to surrender.
the following winter henry knox george washingtons commander of artillery arranged for some of the ticonderoga cannon to be dragged hundreds of miles to the east to reinforce the siege of boston where british forces were ensconced.
on june 17 1775 two months after lexington and concord the british had dislodged colonial militiamen from breeds hill although only at a heavy cost in casualties.
the battle came to be named after the nearby bunker hill.
but the arrival of american cannon in march 1776 and their entrenchment above the city made the british position in boston untenable.
the british army under the command of sir william howe was forced to abandon the city.
before leaving howes forces cut down the original liberty tree.
meanwhile the second continental congress authorized the raising of an army printed money to pay for it and appointed george washington its commander.
washington who had gained considerable fighting experience during the seven years war was not only the colonies best known military officer but also a prominent virginian.
john adams who proposed his name recognized that having a southerner lead american forces would reinforce colonial unity.
in response britain declared the colonies in a state of rebellion dispatched thousands of troops and ordered the closing of all colonial ports.
independence.
by the end of 1775 the breach with britain seemed irreparable.
but many colonists shied away from the idea of independence.
pride in membership in the british empire was still strong and many political leaders especially in colonies that had experienced internal turmoil feared that a complete break with the mother country might unleash further conflict.
anarchy from below in their view was as much a danger as tyranny from above.
many advocates of independence one opponent warned would find it very agreeable to divide the property of the rich among the poor.
such fears affected how colonial leaders responded to the idea of independence.
the elites of massachusetts and virginia who felt supremely confident of their ability to retain authority at home tended to support a break with britain.
massachusetts had borne the brunt of the intolerable acts.
southern leaders not only were highly protective of their political liberty but also were outraged by a proclamation issued in november 1775 by the earl of dunmore the british governor and military commander in virginia offering freedom to any slave who escaped to his lines and bore arms for the king.
in new york and pennsylvania however the diversity of the population made it difficult to work out a consensus on how far to go in resisting british measures.
here opposition to previous british laws had unleashed demands by small farmers and urban artisans for a greater voice in political affairs.
as a result many established leaders drew back from further what key events marked the move toward american independence.
resistance.
joseph galloway a pennsylvania leader and delegate to the second continental congress who worked to devise a compromise between british and colonial positions warned that independence would be accompanied by constant disputes within america.
he even predicted a war between the northern and southern colonies.
americans galloway declared could only enjoy true liberty self government and security for their persons and property by remaining within the empire.
common sense as 1776 dawned america presented the unusual spectacle of colonists at war against the british empire but still pleading for their rights within it.
even as fighting raged congress in july 1775 had addressed the olive branch petition to george iii reaffirming americans loyalty to the crown and hoping for a permanent reconciliation ironically it was a recent emigrant from england not a colonist from a family long established on american soil who grasped the inner logic of the situation and offered a vision of the broad significance of american independence.
an english craftsman and minor government official thomas paine had emigrated to philadelphia late in 1774.
he quickly became associated with a group of advocates of the american cause including john adams and dr benjamin rush a leading philadelphia physician.
it was rush who suggested to paine that he write a pamphlet supporting american independence.
its author listed only as an englishman common sense appeared in january 1776.
the pamphlet began not with a recital of colonial grievances but with an attack on the so much boasted constitution of england and the principles of hereditary rule and monarchical government.
rather than being the most perfect system of government in the world paine wrote the english monarchy was headed by the royal brute of england and the english constitution was composed in large part of the base remains of two ancient tyrannies.
monarchical tyranny in the person of the king and aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the peers of more worth is one honest man to society and in the sight of god he continued than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived far preferable than monarchy would be a democratic system based on frequent elections with citizens rights protected by a written constitution.
turning to independence paine drew on the colonists experiences to make his case.
there is something absurd he wrote in supposing a continent to be perpetually governed by an island within the british empire americas prospects were limited liberated from the navigation acts and trading freely with the entire world its material eminence was certain.
paine tied the economic hopes of the new nation to the idea of commercial freedom.
with independence moreover the colonies could for the first time insulate themselves from involvement in the endless imperial wars of europe.
britain had dragged its american colonies into conflicts with countries like spain and france which never were.
our enemies as americans but as our being the subjects of great britain membership in the british empire paine insisted was a burden to the colonies not a benefit.
toward the close of the pamphlet paine moved beyond practical considerations to outline a breathtaking vision of the historical importance of the thomas paine advocate of american independence in a 1791 portrait.

i challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation to show a single advantage that this continent can reap by being connected with great britain.
but in the following pages i offer nothing more than simple facts plain arguments and common sense.
male and female are the distinctions of nature good and bad the distinctions of heaven but how a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest and distinguished like some new species is worth enquiring into and whether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind.
one of the strongest natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings is that nature disapproves it otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ass for a lion.
the sun never shined on a cause of greater worth.
tis not the affair of a city a country a province or a kingdom but of a continent of at least one eighth part of the habitable globe.
tis not the concern of a the injuries and disadvantages which we sustain by that connection are without number.
any submission to or dependence on great britain tends directly to involve this continent in european wars and quarrels and set us at variance with nations who would otherwise seek our friendship and against whom we have neither anger nor complaint.

ye that dare oppose not only the tyranny but the tyrant stand forth.

from james chalmers plain truth addressed to the inhabitants of america 1776 common sense inspired a wide ranging debate about whether american freedom would be more secure inside or outside the british empire.
james chalmers a maryland plantation owner made the case for the loyalists as those who opposed american independence were called.

the cause of america he proclaimed in stirring language is in great measure the cause of all mankind the new nation would become the home of freedom an asylum for mankind paines impact most of paines ideas were not original.
what made common sense unique was his mode of expressing them and the audience he addressed.
previous political writings had generally been directed toward the educated elite.
when i mention the public declared john randolph of virginia in 1774 i mean to include the rational part of it.
the ignorant vulgar are unfit.
to manage the reins of government just as evangelical ministers had shattered the trained clergys monopoly on religious preaching paine pioneered a new style of political writing one designed to expand dramatically the public sphere where political discussion took place.
he wrote clearly and directly and he avoided the complex language and latin phrases common in pamphlets aimed at educated readers.
common sense quickly became one of the most successful and influential pamphlets in the history of political writing selling by paines estimate some 150 000 copies.
paine directed that his share of the profits be used to buy supplies for the continental army.
in february 1776 the massachusetts political leader joseph hawley read common sense and remarked every sentiment has sunk into my well prepared heart the hearts of hawley and thousands of other americans had been prepared for paines arguments by the extended conflict over britains right to tax the colonies the outbreak of war in 1775 and the growing conviction that britain was a corrupt society where liberty was diminishing.
the intensification of fighting in the winter of 1775 1776 when americans unsuccessfully invaded canada while the british burned falmouth now portland maine and bombarded norfolk virginia gave added weight to the movement for independence.
in the spring of 1776 scores of american communities adopted resolutions calling for a separation from britain.
only six months elapsed between the appearance of common sense and the decision by the second continental congress to sever the colonies ties with great britain.
the declaration of independence on july 2 1776 the congress formally declared the united states an independent nation.
two days later it approved the declaration of independence written by thomas jefferson and revised by the congress before approval.
see the appendix for the full text.
most of the declaration consists of a lengthy list of grievances directed against king george iii ranging from quartering troops in colonial homes to imposing taxes without the colonists consent.
britains aim it declared was to establish absolute tyranny over the colonies.
one clause in jeffersons draft which condemned the inhumanity of the slave trade and criticized the king for overturning colonial laws that sought to restrict the importation of slaves was deleted by the congress at the insistence of georgia and south carolina.
the declarations enduring impact came not from the complaints against what key events marked the move toward american independence.
an early draft with corrections of the declaration of independence in thomas jeffersons handwriting.
note how the elimination of unnecessary words added to the documents power all men are created equal and independent became all men are created equal and inherent and inalienable rights became inalienable in the final version this would be changed to unalienable.
george iii but from jeffersons preamble especially the second paragraph which begins we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness by unalienable rights jefferson meant rights so basic so rooted in human nature itself or in what john locke had called the state of nature that no government could take them away.
jefferson then went on to justify the breach with britain.
government he wrote derives its powers from the consent of the governed when a government threatens its subjects natural rights the people have the authority to alter or to abolish it the declaration of independence is ultimately an assertion of the right of revolution.
the declaration and american freedom the declaration of independence changed forever the meaning of american freedom.
it completed the shift from the rights of englishmen to the rights of mankind as the object of american independence.
in jeffersons language the laws of nature and of natures god not the british constitution or the heritage of the freeborn englishman justified independence.
no longer a set of specific rights no longer a privilege to be enjoyed by a corporate body or people in certain social circumstances liberty had become a universal entitlement.
jeffersons argument natural rights the right to resist arbitrary authority etc drew on the writings of john locke who as explained in the previous chapter saw government as resting on a social contract viola c h.
5 the american revolution 1763 1783 the coming of independence tion of which destroyed the legitimacy of authority.
but when jefferson substituted the pursuit of happiness for property in the familiar lockean triad that opens the declaration he tied the new nations star to an open ended democratic process whereby individuals develop their own potential and seek to realize their own life goals.
individual self fulfillment unimpeded by government would become a central element of american freedom.
tradition would no longer rule the present and americans could shape their society as they saw fit.
an america as a symbol of liberty a 1775 engraving from the cover of the pennsylvania magazine edited by thomas paine soon after his arrival in america.
the shield displays the colonys coat of arms.
the female figure holding a liberty cap is surrounded by weaponry of the patriotic struggle including a cartridge box marked liberty hanging from a tree right.
asylum for mankind a distinctive definition of nationality resting on american freedom was born in the revolution.
from the beginning the idea of american exceptionalism the belief that the united states has a special mission to serve as a refuge from tyranny a symbol of freedom and a model for the rest of the world has occupied a central place in american nationalism.
the new nation declared itself in the words of virginia leader james madison the workshop of liberty to the civilized world paines remark in common sense we have it in our power to begin the world over again and his description of the new nation as an asylum for mankind expressed a sense that the revolution was an event of global historical importance.
countless sermons political tracts and newspaper articles of the time repeated this idea.
unburdened by the institutions monarchy aristocracy hereditary privilege that oppressed the peoples of the old world america and america alone was the place where the principle of universal freedom could take root.
this was why jefferson addressed the declaration to the opinions of mankind not just the colonists themselves or great britain.
first to add his name to the declaration of independence was the massachusetts merchant john hancock president of the second continental congress with a signature so large he declared according to legend that king george iii could read it without his spectacles.
the of global declaration independence the american colonists were less concerned with securing human rights for all mankind than with winning international recognition in their struggle for independence from britain.
but jefferson hoped that this rebellion would become the signal of arousing men to burst the chains.
and to assume the blessings and security of self government and for more than two centuries the declaration has remained an inspiration not only to generations of americans denied the enjoyment of their natural rights but to colonial peoples around the world seeking independence.
the what key events marked the move toward american independence.
declaration quickly appeared in french and german translations although not at first in spanish since the government feared it would inspire dangerous ideas among the peoples of spains american empire.
in the years since 1776 numerous anti colonial movements have modeled their own declarations of independence on americas.
the first came in flanders part of todays belgium then part of the austrian empire where rebels in 1790 echoed jeffersons words by declaring that their province is and of rights ought to be a free and independent state by 1826 the year of jeffersons death some twenty other declarations of independence had been issued in europe the caribbean and spanish america.
today more than half the countries in the world in places as far flung as china issued after the revolution of 1911 and vietnam 1945 have such declarations.
many of these documents like jeffersons listed grievances against an imperial power to justify revolution.
few of these documents however have affirmed the natural rights life liberty and the pursuit of happiness jefferson invoked.
over time the declaration in a global context has become an assertion of the right of various groups to form independent states rather than a list of the rights of citizens that their governments could not abridge.
but even more than the specific language of the declaration the principle that legitimate political authority rests on the will of the people has been adopted around the world.
in 1776 the declaration inspired critics of the british system of government to demand political reform.
in 1780 even as the american war of independence raged a jesuit educated indian of peru took the name of the last inca ruler tpac amaru and led an uprising against spanish rule.
by the time it was suppressed in 1783 some 10 000 spanish and 100 000 indians had perished.
in the dutch french and spanish empires where european governments had been trying to tighten their control much as the british had done in north america local elites demanded greater autonomy often drawing on the constitutional arguments of american patriots.
the idea that the people possess rights was quickly internationalized.
slaves in the caribbean colonial subjects in india and indigenous inhabitants of latin america could all speak this language to the dismay of those who exercised power over them.
securing independence the balance of power declaring americans independent was one thing winning independence another.
the newly created american army confronted the greatest military power on earth.
viewing the americans as traitors britain resolved to crush the rebellion.
on the surface the balance of power seemed heavily weighted in britains favor.
it had a well trained army supplemented by hired soldiers from inspired by the american revolution the british reformer john cartwright published an appeal for the annual election of parliament as essential to liberty in britain.
he included an engraving contrasting the principles of reform on the left with despotism on the right.
5 the american revolution 1763 1783 a french engraving depicts new yorkers tearing down the statue of king george iii in july 1776 after the approval of the declaration of independence.
the statue was later melted down to make bullets for the continental army.
securing independence german states like hesse the worlds most powerful navy and experienced military commanders.
the americans had to rely on local militias and an inadequately equipped continental army.
washington himself felt that militiamen were too accustomed to unbounded freedom to accept the proper degree of subordination necessary in soldiers.
moreover many americans were not enthusiastic about independence and some actively supported the british.
on the other hand many american soldiers did not lack military experience having fought in the seven years war or undergone intensive militia training in the early 1770s.
they were fighting on their own soil for a cause that inspired devotion and sacrifice.
during the eight years of war from 1775 to 1783 some 200 000 men bore arms in the american army whose soldiers were volunteers and militias where service was required of every able bodied man unless he provided a substitute.
as the war progressed enlistment waned among propertied americans and the continental army increasingly drew on young men with limited economic prospects landless sons of farmers indentured servants laborers and african americans.
the patriots suffered dearly for the cause.
of the colonies free white male population aged sixteen to forty five one in twenty died in the war of independence the equivalent of nearly 3 million deaths in todays population.
but so long as the americans maintained an army in the field the idea of independence remained alive no matter how much territory the british occupied.
despite british power to conquer the thirteen colonies would be an enormous and expensive task and it was not at all certain that the public at home wished to pay the additional taxes that a lengthy war would require.
the british moreover made a string of serious mistakes.
from the outset the british misjudged the degree of support for independence among the american population as well as the capacity of american citizen soldiers.
these people admitted the british general thomas gage h o w w e r e a m e r i c a n f o r c e s a b l e t o p r e v a i l i n t h e r e v o l u t i o n a r y wa r.
show a spirit and conduct against us that they never showed against the french in the seven years war and everybody has judged them from their former appearance and behavior which has led many into great mistakes moreover european rivals notably france welcomed the prospect of a british defeat.
if the americans could forge an alliance with france a world power second only to britain it would go a long way toward equalizing the balance of forces.
blacks in the revolution at the wars outset george washington refused to accept black recruits.
but he changed his mind after lord dunmores 1775 proclamation mentioned above which offered freedom to slaves who joined the british cause.
some 5 000 blacks enlisted in state militias and the continental army and navy.
since individuals drafted into the militia were allowed to provide a substitute slaves suddenly gained considerable bargaining power.
not a few acquired their freedom by agreeing to serve in place of an owner or his son.
in 1778 rhode island with a higher proportion of slaves in its population than any other new england state formed a black regiment and promised freedom to slaves who enlisted while compensating the owners for their loss of property.
blacks who fought under george washington and in other state militias did so in racially integrated companies although invariably under white officers.
they were the last black american soldiers to do so officially until the korean war except for the few black and white soldiers who fought alongside each other in irregular units at the end of world war ii.
except for south carolina and georgia the southern colonies also enrolled free blacks and slaves to fight.
they were not explicitly promised freedom but many received it individually after the war ended.
and in 1783 the virginia legislature emancipated slaves who had contributed towards the establishment of american liberty and independence by serving in the army.
fighting on the side of the british also offered opportunities for freedom.
before his forces were expelled from virginia 800 or more slaves had escaped from their owners to join lord dunmores ethiopian regiment wearing uniforms that bore the motto liberty to slaves during the war blacks fought with the british in campaigns in new york new jersey and south carolina.
other escaped slaves served the royal army as spies guided their troops through swamps and worked as military cooks laundresses and construction workers.
george washington himself saw seventeen of his slaves flee to the british some of whom signed up to fight the colonists.
there is not a man of them but would leave us if they believed they could make their escape his cousin lund washington reported.

5 the american revolution 1763 1783 triumphant entry of the royal troops into new york an engraving showing the army of sir william howe occupying the city in 1776.
new york city would remain in british hands for the duration of the war of independence.
the first securing independence years of the war had the british commander sir william howe prosecuted the war more vigorously at the outset he might have nipped the rebellion in the bud by destroying washingtons army.
but while he suffered numerous defeats in the first years of the war washington generally avoided direct confrontations with the british and managed to keep his army intact.
having abandoned boston howe attacked new york city in the summer of 1776.
washingtons army had likewise moved from massachusetts to brooklyn to defend the city.
howe pushed american forces back and almost cut off washingtons retreat across the east river.
washington managed to escape to manhattan and then north to peekskill where he crossed the hudson river to new jersey.
but the 3 000 men he had left behind at fort washington on manhattan island were captured by howe.
howe pursued the american army but never managed to inflict a decisive defeat.
demoralized by successive failures however many american soldiers simply went home.
once 28 000 men washingtons army dwindled to fewer than 3 000.
indeed washington feared that without a decisive victory it would melt away entirely.
to restore morale and regain the initiative he launched successful surprise attacks on hessian soldiers at trenton new jersey on december 26 1776 and on a british force at princeton on january 3 1777.
shortly before crossing the delaware river to attack the hessians washington had thomas paines inspiring essay the american crisis read to his troops.

but in july howe instead moved his forces from new york city to attack philadelphia.
in september the continental congress fled to lancaster in central pennsylvania and howe occupied the city of brotherly love.
not having been informed of burgoynes plans howe had unintentionally abandoned him.
american forces blocked burgoynes way surrounded his army and on october 17 1777 forced him to surrender at saratoga.
the victory provided a significant boost to american morale.
during the winter of 1777 1778 the british army now commanded by sir henry clinton was quartered in philadelphia.
in the revolution as in most eighteenth century wars fighting came to a halt during the winter.
british officers took part in an elegant social life complete with balls and parties.
most notable was the great meschianza an extravaganza that included a regatta a procession of medieval knights and a jousting tournament.
meanwhile washingtons army remained encamped at valley forge where they suffered terribly from the frigid weather.
but saratoga helped to persuade the french that american victory was possible.
in 1778 american diplomats led by benjamin franklin concluded a treaty of amity and commerce in which france recognized the united states and agreed to supply military assistance.
still smarting from their defeat in the seven years war the french hoped to weaken britain their main european rival and perhaps regain some of their lost influence and territory in the western hemisphere.
soon afterward spain also joined the war on the american side.
french assistance would play a decisive part in the wars end.
at the outset however the french fleet showed more interest in attacking british outposts in the west indies than directly aiding the americans.
and the spanish confined themselves to regaining control of florida which they had lost to the british in the seven years war.
nonetheless french and spanish entry transformed the war of independence into a global conflict.
by putting the british on the defensive in places ranging from gibraltar to the west indies it greatly complicated their military prospects.
the war in the south in 1778 the focus of the war shifted to the south.
here the british hoped to exploit the social tensions between backcountry farmers and wealthy planters that had surfaced in the regulator movements to enlist the support of the numerous colonists in the region who remained loyal to the crown and to disrupt the economy by encouraging slaves to escape.
in december 1778 british forces occupied savannah georgia.
in may 1780 clinton captured charleston south carolina and with it an american army of 5 000 men.
the year 1780 was arguably the low point of the struggle for independence.
congress was essentially bankrupt and the army went months without being paid.
the british seemed successful in playing upon social conflicts within the colonies as thousands of southern loyalists joined up with british forces fourteen regiments from savannah alone and tens of thousands of slaves sought freedom by fleeing to british lines.
in august lord charles cornwallis routed an american army at camden south carolina.
the following month one of washingtons ablest commanders benedict arnold defected and almost succeeded in turning over to the h o w w e r e a m e r i c a n f o r c e s a b l e t o p r e v a i l i n t h e r e v o l u t i o n a r y wa r.

when the news reached london public support for the war evaporated and peace negotiations soon began.
given its immense military prowess britain abandoned the struggle rather quickly.
many in britain felt the west indies were more valuable economically than the mainland colonies.
in any event british merchants expected to continue to dominate trade with the united states and did so for many years.
two years later in september 1783 american and british negotiators concluded the treaty of paris.
the american delegation john adams benjamin franklin and john jay achieved one of the greatest diplomatic triumphs in the countrys history.
they not only won recognition of american independence but also gained control of the entire region between canada and florida east of the mississippi river and the right of americans to fish in atlantic waters off of canada a matter of considerable importance to new englanders.
at british insistence the americans agreed that colonists who had remained loyal to the mother country would not suffer persecution and that loyalists property that had been seized by local and state governments would be restored.
until independence the thirteen colonies had formed part of britains american empire along with canada and the west indies.
but canada rebuffed repeated calls to join the war of independence and leaders of the west indies fearful of slave uprisings also remained loyal to the crown.
with the treaty of paris the united states of america became the western hemispheres first independent nation.

how did the revolution diminish the freedoms of both loyalists and native americans.
what was the impact of the revolution on slavery.
how did the revolution affect the status of women.
l b orn in massachusetts in 1744 abigail adams became one of the revolutionary eras most articulate and influential women.
at a time when educational opportunities for girls were extremely limited she taught herself by reading books in the library of her father a congregational minister.
in 1764 she married john adams a young lawyer about to emerge as a leading advocate of resistance to british taxation and eventually of american independence.
during the war of independence with her husband away in philadelphia and europe serving the american cause she stayed behind at their massachusetts home raising their four children and managing the familys farm.
the letters they exchanged form one of the most remarkable correspondences in american history.
she addressed john as dear friend and signed her letters portia after brutuss devoted wife in shakespeares play julius caesar.
though denied an official role in politics abigail adams was a keen observer of public affairs.
she kept her husband informed of events in massachusetts and offered opinions on political matters.
later when adams served as president he relied on her advice more than on members of his cabinet.
in march 1776 a few months before the second continental congress declared american independence abigail adams wrote her best known letter to her husband.
she began by commenting indirectly on the evils of slavery.
how strong she wondered could the passion for liberty be among those accustomed to deprive their fellow citizens of theirs she went on to urge congress when it drew up a code of laws for the new republic to remember the ladies all men she warned would be tyrants if they could women she playfully suggested will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation it was the leaders of colonial society who initiated resistance to british taxation.
but as abigail adamss letter illustrates the struggle for american liberty emboldened other colonists to demand more liberty for themselves.
all revolutions enlarge the public sphere inspiring previously marginalized groups to express their own dreams of freedom.
at a time when so many americans slaves indentured servants women indians apprentices propertyless men were denied full freedom the struggle against britain threw into question many forms of authority and inequality.
abigail adams did not believe in female equality in a modern sense.
she accepted the prevailing belief that a womans primary responsibility was to her family.
but she resented the absolute power husbands exercised over their wives.
put it out of the power of husbands she wrote to use us as they will a discreet reference to mens legal control over the bodies of their wives and their right to inflict physical punishment on them.
her letter is widely remembered today.
less familiar is how did equality become a stronger component of american freedom after the revolution.
john adamss response which illuminated how the revolution had unleashed challenges to all sorts of inherited ideas of deference and authority we have been told that our struggle has loosened the bands of government everywhere that children and apprentices were disobedient that schools and colleges were grown turbulent that indians slighted their guardians and negroes grew insolent to their masters to john adams this upheaval including his wifes claim to greater freedom was an affront to the natural order of things.
to others it formed the essence of the american revolution.
d e m o c r at i z i n g f r e e d o m the dream of equality the american revolution took place at three levels simultaneously.
it was a struggle for national independence a phase in a century long global battle among european empires and a conflict over what kind of nation an independent america should be.
with its wide distribution of property lack of a legally established hereditary aristocracy and established churches far less powerful than in britain colonial america was a society with deep democratic potential.
but it took the struggle for independence to transform it into a nation that celebrated equality and opportunity.
the revolution unleashed public debates and political and social struggles that enlarged the scope of freedom and challenged inherited structures of power within america.
in rejecting the crown and the principle of hereditary aristocracy many americans also rejected the society of privilege patronage and fixed status that these institutions embodied.
to be sure the men who led the revolution from start to finish were by and large members of the american elite.
the lower classes did not rise to power as a result of independence.
nonetheless the idea of liberty became a revolutionary rallying cry a standard by which to judge and challenge home grown institutions as well as imperial ones.
jeffersons seemingly straightforward assertion in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal announced a radical principle whose full implications no one could anticipate.
in both britain and its colonies a well ordered society was widely thought to depend on obedience to authority the power of rulers over their subjects husbands over wives parents over children employers over servants and apprentices slaveholders over slaves.
inequality had been fundamental to the colonial social order the revolution challenged it in many ways.
henceforth american freedom would be forever linked with the idea of equality equality before the law equality in political rights equality of economic opportunity and for some equality of condition.
whenever i use the words freedom or rights wrote thomas paine i desire to be understood to mean a perfect equality of them.
the floor of freedom is as level as water abigail adams a portrait by gilbert stuart painted over several years beginning in 1800.
stuart told a friend that as a young woman adams must have been a perfect venus.
