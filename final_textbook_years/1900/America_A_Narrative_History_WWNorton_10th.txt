1106 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 yet that is exactly what franklin delano roosevelt sought to do in 1932 as he assumed the presidency.
he would save capitalism by transforming it.
like his hero his cousin theodore roosevelt he believed that the basic problem of twentieth century life was the excessive power of large corporations.
only the federal government could regulate corporate capitalism for the public benefit.
few leaders have taken office in more dire circumstances.
yet within days of becoming president roosevelt took dramatic steps that forever changed the scope and role of the federal government.
he believed that americas democratic form of government had the ultimate responsibility to help people who were in distress not out of a sense of charity but out of a sense of obligation.
along with a supportive congress he set about enacting dozens of bold measures to relieve human suffering and promote economic recovery.
roosevelt was an inspiring personality overflowing with cheerful strength strong convictions and an unshakeable confidence in himself and in the resilience of the american people.
he was also a pragmatist willing to try different approaches.
his program for recovery the new deal was therefore a series of trial and error actions rather than a comprehensive scheme.
none of the well intentioned but often poorly planned initiatives worked perfectly and some failed miserably.
yet their combined effect was to restore hope and energy to the nation.
from hooverism to the new deal the great depression revealed herbert hoover to be a brilliant mediocrity.
his initial response to the economic disaster was denial there was no crisis he insisted.
all that was needed he and others in his administration argued was to let the economy cure itself.
the best policy treasury secretary andrew mellon advised would be to liquidate labor liquidate stocks liquidate the farmers liquidate real estate letting events run their course he claimed would purge the rottenness out of the capitalist system but mellons d o nothing approach did not work.
falling wages and declining land and home values made it even harder for struggling farmers businesses and households to pay their bills.
with so many people losing jobs and income consumers and businesses simply could not buy enough goods and services to reenergize the economy.
hoovers efforts at recovery as the months passed president hoover proved less willing than andrew mellon to sit by and let events take their course.
as the great engineer he in fact did more than any previous president in addressing such calamitous economic from hooverism to the new deal 1107 circumstances.
he invited business labor government and agricultural leaders to a series of white house conferences in which he urged companies to maintain employment and wage levels asked union leaders to end strikes and pleaded with state governors to accelerate planned construction projects so as to keep people working.
he also formed committees and commissions to study various aspects of the economic calamity and he cut the income tax.
yet nothing worked.
unemployment continued to rise and wage levels continued to fall.
upbeat messages in speech after speech hoover became an ineffective cheerleader for american capitalism.
in early may 1930 the president told the u s chamber of commerce that he was convinced we have passed the worst and with continued effort we shall rapidly recover a few weeks later hoover assured a group of bankers that the depression is over the hoover administration also circulated upbeat slogans such as business is better and keep smiling but uplifting words were not enough.
more and more people kept losing their jobs and homes.
hoover never felt comfortable giving comfort to a desperate hooverville of the many hoovervilles set up in seattle washington alone this particular shantytown near the shipyards was the largest.
it lasted nine years.
1108 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 nation.
his recurring statement no one has yet starved was hardly reassuring or as it turned out accurate.
short sighted tax in creases the great depression was the greatest national emergency since the civil war and the nation was woefully unprepared to deal with it.
as personal income plummeted so did government tax revenues.
despite the depression president hoover insisted on trying to balance the federal budget by raising taxes and cutting b udgets precisely the wrong prescription for a sick economy.
he pushed through congress the revenue act of 1932 the largest and most poorly timed peacetime tax increase in american history.
by taking money out of consumers pockets the higher taxes accelerated the economic slowdown.
people had less money to spend when what the struggling economy most needed was increased consumer spending.
hoovers reaction to the social crisis by the fall of 1930 many cities were buckling under the strain of lost revenue and human distress.
the federal government had no programs to deal with homelessness and joblessness.
state and local governments cut spending worsening the economic situation.
all across the country shantytowns sprouted in vacant lots.
people erected shacks out of cardboard and scrap wood and metal.
they called their makeshift villages hoovervilles to mock the president.
to keep warm they wrapped themselves in newspapers calling them hoover blankets.
as their numbers rose more and more homeless and jobless people called for government to step in.
frustrated by his critics hoover dismissed the concerns of calamity mongers and weeping men hoover feared that the nation would be plunged into socialism if the government provided direct supyoung and hungry a toddler begs for port to the poor.
his governing phichange in one of the homeless camps.
losophy rooted in americas mythic from hooverism to the new deal 1109 commitment to rugged individualism and free enterprise set firm limits on emergency government action.
the president still trumpeted the virtues of self reliance and individual initiative claiming that government assistance would rob people of the desire to help themselves.
hoover hoped that the natural generosity of the american people and charitable organizations would be sufficient and he believed that volunteers the backbone of local charity organizations would relieve the social distress caused by the depression.
but his faith in traditional voluntarism was misplaced.
local and state relief agencies were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the social crisis as were churches and charitable organizations like the salvation army and the red cross.
rising criticism of hoover that the economic collapse was so unexpected made people all the more insecure and anxious and president hoover increasingly became the target of their frustration.
the democrats shrewdly exploited his predicament.
in november 1930 they gained their first national election victory since 1916 winning a majority in the house and a near majority in the senate.
hoover refused to see the elections as a warning.
instead he grew more resistant to calls for federal intervention in the struggling economy.
by 1932 15 million p eople were unemployed.
the new york times concluded that hoover had failed as a party leader.
he has failed as an economist.
he has failed as a business leader.
he has failed as a personality because of his awkwardness of manner and speech and lack of mass magnetism when hoover asked treasury secretary andrew mellon for a nickel to phone a friend the secretary replied here are two nickels call all of them congressional initiatives with a new congress in session in 1932 demands for federal action forced hoover to do more.
that year congress set up the reconstruction finance corporation rfc to make emergency loans to banks life insurance companies and railroads.
but if the federal government could help huge banks and railroads asked new york democratic senator robert f wagner why not extend a helping hand to that forlorn american in every village and every city of the united states who has been without wages since 1929 hoover however held back and signed only the emergency relief act 1932 which authorized the rfc to make loans to the states for construction projects.
critics called the rfc a breadline for businesses while the unemployed went hungry.
1110 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 anger and frustration unemployed military veterans members of the bonus expeditionary force that served during the great war clash with washington d c police at anacostia flats in july 1932 farmers and veterans in protest meanwhile the average annual income of families working the land during the early 1930s was 240.
prices for agricultural products fell so low that farmers lost money if they took them to market.
thousands of midwestern farmers protested the low prices by dumping milk vegetables and fruits on the highways.
fears of organized revolt arose when thousands of unemployed military veterans converged on the nations capital in the spring of 1932.
the bonus expeditionary force made up of veterans of the american expeditionary force aef that fought in europe in the great war pressed congress to pay the cash bonuses owed to nearly 4 million veterans.
the house passed a bonus bill but the senate voted it down because it would have forced a tax increase.
most of the disappointed veterans went home.
the rest along with their wives and children having no place to go camped in vacant federal buildings and in a shantytown within sight of the capitol.
eager to remove the homeless veterans hoover persuaded congress to pay for their train tickets home.
more left but others stayed even after congress adjourned hoping to meet with the president.
late in july hoover ordered the government buildings cleared.
in doing so a policeman panicked fired into the crowd and killed two veterans.
the secretary of war then dispatched 700 from hooverism to the new deal 1111 soldiers to remove the bonus army the soldiers commanded by army chief of staff general douglas macarthur used horses and tanks to disperse the unarmed veterans and their families.
then exceeding orders the soldiers burned the makeshift camp.
fifty five veterans were injured and 135 arrested.
widespread news coverage of the assault on the unemployed veterans led even more people to view hoover and the republicans as heartless.
the democratic governor of new york was horrified as he read newspaper accounts of the armys violent assault on the bonus army.
well franklin roosevelt told an aide this elects me as the next president.
the veterans were finally paid their bonus in 1936.
the disheartened angry mood of the bonus army matched that of the country and of president hoover himself.
he worked hard but the stress sapped his health and morale.
i am so tired he said that every bone in my body aches when aides urged him to be more of a public leader he replied i have no wilsonian qualities he hated giving speeches and when he did his tone came across as cold and uncaring.
he also got along badly with journalists who often highlighted his sour demeanor and dull monotone voice.
a sculptor claimed that if you put a rose in hoovers hand it would wilt the man who in 1928 had promised americans permanent prosperity was now a laughingstock.
in the end hoover failed because he never understood or acknowledged the seriousness of the nations economic problems.
the 1932 election in june 1932 glum republicans gathered in chicago to nominate president hoover for a second term.
by contrast the democrats arrived in chicago for their convention a few weeks later confident that they would nominate the next president.
fifty year old new york governor franklin delano roosevelt won on the fourth ballot.
roosevelt broke precedent by traveling to chicago to accept the nomination in person.
the stakes were high he said because hoover and the republicans had failed to address the economic disaster.
i pledge you i pledge myself to a new deal for the american people that would break foolish traditions and create a new enlightened administration of competence and courage roosevelt first had to defeat hoover however.
the race he said would be more than a political campaign it is a call to arms it was a vague but uplifting message of hope at a time when many people were slipping into despair.
roosevelt exuded energy and confidence.
his campaign song was happy days are here again throughout the campaign roosevelt attacked hoover for his extravagant government spending and repeatedly promised a new deal for the american people stressing that a revitalized economy required new ideas and aggressive 1112 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 action.
the country needs and unless i mistake its temper the country demands bold persistent experimentation he said.
above all try something in contrast to roosevelt hoover lacked vitality and vision.
roosevelts proposals for unprecedented government action he warned would destroy the very foundations of our american system the election was more than a contest between two men and two political parties it was a battle between two philosophies of government that would decide the direction our nation will take over a century to come hoover lost decisively.
americans swept roosevelt into office with 23 million votes to hoovers 16 million.
in 1928 hoover had carried 40 states four years later he won but six.

what roosevelt called the forgotten man would no longer be forgotten.
roosevelts rise born in 1882 the adored only child of wealthy aristocratic parents young franklin roosevelt had enjoyed a pampered life that freed him from worrying about a job or a paycheck.
he was educated by tutors at springwood his fathers hudson river estate near hyde park north of new york city.
he attended harvard college and columbia university law school.
he did not graduate.
while a law student in 1905 he married anna eleanor roosevelt the favorite niece of theodore roosevelt then president of the united states who was also franklins distant cousin.
in 1910 franklin roosevelt won a democratic seat in the new york state senate.
tall handsome athletic and blessed with a sparkling personality and infectious smile he seemed destined for greatness.
in 1913 woodrow wilson appointed him assistant secretary of the navy.
in 1920 roosevelt became james coxs vice presidential running mate on the democratic ticket.
trial by fire then a tragedy occurred.
in 1921 at age thirty ine roosevelt who loved to swim and sail play tennis and golf contracted n polio an infectious neuromuscular disease that left him permanently disabled and forced him to use cumbersome leg braces to stand or walk.
but roosevelt fought back.
for seven years aided by his remarkable wife eleanor he strengthened his body to compensate for his disability.
the exhausting daily regimen of physical therapy transformed roosevelt.
polio crippled his legs but expanded his sympathies.
he became less pompous more considerate more focused and more able to identify with the problems of people facing hard times.
roosevelt had a remarkable ability to make people feel at ease and express concern about their troubles.
the aristocrat had developed the common touch as well as a great talent for public relations but he also was vain and calculating and a clever manipulator.
in other words he was a consummate politician.
a peoples president roosevelt was neither a masterful administrator nor a deep thinker.
one of his closest aides said the president never 1114 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 read a serious book but roosevelt had many virtues courage good instincts unrelenting optimism and a charming personality.
he loved talking to people and he was determined to help those who could not help themselves.
colonel edward house the veteran democratic counselor explained that his former boss woodrow wilson liked humanity as a whole and disliked people individually roosevelt by contrast was genuinely fond of people and shows it what truly set roosevelt apart was his willingness to experiment with different ways of using government power and resources to address pressing problems.
he embraced the orthodoxy of a balanced budget and complained about a bloated bureaucracy for example only to incur more budget deficits than all his predecessors combined as he dramatically expanded the scope of federal government.
his inconsistencies reflected his distinctive personality as he launched his presidency and the new deal.
the 1933 inauguration inaugurated in march 1933 franklin delano roosevelt assumed leadership during a crisis that threatened the very fabric of american capitalism.
the situation is critical franklin the prominent journalist walter lippmann warned.
you may have to assume dictatorial powers as had already happened in germany italy and the soviet union.
roosevelt did not become a dictator but he did take extraordinary steps while assuring americans that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself he confessed in his inaugural address that he did not have all the answers but he did know that this nation asks for action and action now he asked congress for a broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency just as if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe roosevelts uplifting speech won rave reviews.
nearly 500 000 americans wrote letters to the new president and even the p ro republican chicago tribune praised his courageous confidence the first hundred days in march 1933 president roosevelt confronted four major challenges reviving the industrial economy relieving the widespread human misery rescuing the ravaged farm sector and reforming those aspects of the capitalist system that had helped cause the depression.
he quickly addressed all of those challenges and more.
the new president admitted that he would try several different experiments some would succeed and others would fail but the important thing was to do something bold and fast.
it was no time for timid leadership or paralyzing doubts.
the defining characteristic of roosevelts approach to pres thers even when idential leadership was action.
he had a genius for leading o he did not know for sure where he was taking them.
to advise him roosevelt assembled a brain trust of brilliant specialists who feverishly developed fresh roosevelts new deal 1115 ideas to address the nations urgent problems.
roosevelt and his advisers initially settled on a three pronged strategy to revive the economy.
first they addressed the immediate banking crisis and provided short term emergency relief for the jobless.
second the new d ealers men and women professors journalists economists social work ers and political appointees who swarmed to washington during the winter of 1933 encouraged agreements between management and unions.
third they attempted to raise depressed commodity prices corn cotton wheat beef pork etc.
by paying farmers subsidies to reduce the sizes of their crops franklin delano roosevelt preparing and herds so that prices would rise and to deliver the first of his popular thereby increase farm income.
fireside chats to a national radio the new congress was as ready audience.
this message focused on to take action as was the new presi measures to reform the american banking system.
from march 9 to june 16 the so called first hundred days congress approved fifteen major pieces of legislation proposed by roosevelt.
several of these programs comprised what came to be called the first new deal 1933 1935.
shoring up the financial system money is the lubricant of capitalism and money was fast disappearing from circulation by 1933.
ever since the stock market crash of 1929 panicky depositors had been withdrawing their money from banks and the stock market.
taking so much money out of circulation worsened the depression and brought the banking system to the brink of collapse.
throughout the twenties an average of almost 700 banks a year failed.
after 1929 that number doubled and then tripled.
banking regulation on his second day in office march 9 1933 roosevelt called congress into special session to pass the emergency banking relief act which declared a f our day bank holiday to allow the financial panic 1116 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 to subside.
herbert hoover criticized the move as a step toward gigantic socialism for the first time in history all u s banks closed their doors.
roosevelts financial experts worked all night drafting a bill to restore confidence in the banks.
on march 12 in the first of his r adio broadcast fireside chats to the nation the president assured the 60 million listeners that it was safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress the following day people took their money back to the banks.
capitalism was saved in eight days said one of roosevelts advisers.
a few weeks later on june 16 roosevelt signed the g lass steagall banking act of 1933 part of which created the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which guaranteed customer accounts in banks up to 2 500 the galloping snail a vigorous roosevelt drives congress to action in this detroit news cartoon from march 1933.
roosevelts new deal 1117 thus reducing the likelihood of future panics.
in addition to insuring savings accounts the glass steagall act called for the separation of commercial banking from investment banking to prevent conventional banks from investing the savings of depositors in the risky stock market only banks that specialized in investment could trade shares in the stock market after 1933.
in addition the federal reserve board was given more authority to intervene in future financial emergencies.
the banking crisis had ended and the administration was ready to pursue a broader program of economic recovery.
regulating wall street before the great crash in 1929 there was little government oversight of the securities stocks and bonds industry.
in 1933 the roosevelt administration developed two important pieces of legislation intended to regulate the operations of the stock market and eliminate fraud and abuses.
the first the securities exchange act of 1933 was the first major federal legislation to regulate the sale of stocks and bonds.
it required corporations that issued stock for public sale to disclose all relevant information about the operations and management of the company so that purchasers could know what they were buying.
the second bill the securities exchange act of 1934 established the securities and exchange commission a federal agency to enforce the new laws and regulations governing the issuance and trading of stocks and bonds.
the federal budget roosevelt next convinced congress to pass an economy act 1933 allowing him to cut government workers salaries reduce payments to military veterans for n on service connected disabilities and reorganize federal agencies to help reduce government expenses.
he then took the dramatic step of ending prohibition in part because it was being so widely violated in part because most democrats wanted it ended and in part because he wanted to regain the federal tax revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages.
the twenty first amendment ratified on december 5 1933 ended the noble experiment of prohibition.
helping the unemployed and homeless another urgent priority in 1933 was relieving the widespread human distress.
herbert hoover had stubbornly refused to help the unemployed and homeless since he assumed that individual self reliance acts of charity and the efforts of local organizations the red cross churches and city missions would be sufficient.
the roosevelt administration however knew that the numbers of people in need far exceeded the capacity of charitable organizations and local agencies.
as harry l hopkins an aide to roosevelt said hunger is not debatable 1118 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 the new president pushed through a series of programs that created what came to be called the welfare state he did not believe that the government should give people cash called a dole but he insisted that the federal government help the unemployed and homeless by getting them jobs.
for the first time the federal government took primary responsibility for assisting the most desperate americans.
putting people to work the federal emergency relief administration fera headed by harry l hopkins was roosevelts first major effort to deal with unemployment.
it sent grants to the states to spend on the unemployed and homeless.
after the state sponsored programs funded by the fera proved inadequate congress created the civil works administration cwa in november 1933.
it marked the first l arge scale federal experiment with work relief by putting people directly on the government payroll at competitive wages 40 an hour for unskilled workers 1 for skilled.
the cwa provided 4 million federal jobs during the winter of 1933 1934 and organized a variety of useful projects repairing 500 000 miles of roads laying sewer lines constructing or improving more than 1 000 airports and 40 000 public schools and providing 50 000 teaching jobs that helped keep small rural public schools open.
as the number of people employed by the cwa soared however the programs costs skyrocketed to more than 1 billion.
roosevelt balked at such high costs and worried that the people hired would become dependent upon federal jobs.
so in the spring of 1934 he ordered the cwa dissolved.
by april some 4 million workers were again unemployed.
the ccc the most successful of the new deal jobs programs was the civilian conservation corps ccc managed by the war department.
it built 2 500 camps to house up to half a million unemployed unmarried young men ages seventeen to twenty seven.
they worked as soil soldiers in national forests parks and recreational areas and on soil conservation projects.
the ccc also recruited 150 000 unemployed military veterans and 85 000 native americans housing them in separate camps.
ccc workers had to be between 60 and 78 inches tall weigh more than 107 pounds and have at least six teeth.
they were to be paid 1 a day for no more than nine months so as to make room for others.
critics charged that the ccc would undermine wage gains made by the labor union movement but roosevelt responded that the young men selected for the program would be those who have no chance to get a job congress passed the bill only after oscar de priest an african american legislator from illinois introduced an amendment requiring that the agency not discriminate on account of race color or creed.
roosevelts new deal 1119 federal relief programs civilian conservation corps enrollees in 1933 on a break from work.
directed by army officers and foresters the ccc camps were operated like military bases.
ccc workers cleared brush built trails roads bridges campgrounds fire towers fish hatcheries and 800 parks planted 3 billion trees taught farmers how to control soil erosion and fought fires.
the enrollees supervised by soldiers were given shelter clothing and food and took classes to learn to read and earn h igh school diplomas.
women were excluded from the ccc and african americans and native americans were housed in segregated facilities.
roosevelt loved to visit the ccc camps.
after sharing a meal with one group he said i wish i could spend a couple of months here myself by 1942 when the ccc was dismantled some 3 million young men had passed through the program.
saving homes during 1933 a thousand homes or farms were being foreclosed upon each day because people could not afford to pay their mortgages.
to address the problem roosevelt convinced congress to create the home owners loan corporation which helped people refinance their mortgages at lower interest rates so as to avoid bankruptcy.
in 1934 roosevelt 1120 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 c reated the federal housing administration fha which offered americans much longer home mortgages twenty years in order to reduce their monthly payments.
up to that point most mortgages were for less than ten years duration and covered only a portion of the purchase price.
reviving the industrial sector the centerpiece of the new deals efforts to revive the industrial economy was the national industrial recovery act nira of 1933.
one of its two major sections created massive public works construction projects funded by the federal government as a means of creating jobs.
the nira started the public works administration pwa granting 3 3 billion for the construction of government buildings highways bridges dams port facilities and sewage plants.
the second and more controversial part of the nira created the national recovery administration nra headed by hugh s johnson a hard drinking retired army general known for his administrative expertise a blustering dictatorial and appealing bureaucrat.
the nra represented a radical shift in the federal governments role in the economy.
never before in peacetime had washington bureaucrats taken charge of setting prices wages and standards for working conditions.
the primary purpose of the nra was to promote economic growth by ignoring a nti trust laws and allowing executives of competing businesses to negotiate among themselves and with labor unions to create codes of fair competition that would set prices production levels minimum wages and maximum hours within each industry no matter how small.
in new york city for example women who made their living as burlesque show strippers agreed to an nra code limiting the number of performers on stage and the number of performances they could provide each night.
in exchange for allowing companies to cooperate rather than compete the nra codes included fair labor policies long sought by unions and social progressives a national forty hour work week minimum weekly wages of 13 12 in the south where living costs were lower and a ban on the employment of children under the age of sixteen.
the nra also included a provision that guaranteed the right of workers to organize unions.
these were landmark changes and for a time the downward spiral of wages and prices subsided.
but as soon as economic recovery began small business owners complained that the larger corporations dominated the nra whose price fixing robbed small producers of the chance to compete.
and because the nra wage codes excluded agricultural and domestic workers at the insistence of southern democrats most african americans derived no direct benefit from the program.
when the supreme court declared the nra unconstitutional in may 1935 few regretted its demise.
roosevelts new deal 1121 the nra experiment did however have lasting effects.
it set new workplace standards such as the f orty hour work week created a national minimum wage and helped end the abuse of child labor.
its endorsement of collective bargaining between workers and owners spurred the growth of unions.
yet as 1934 ended industrial recovery was still nowhere in sight.
agricultural assistance in addition to rescuing the banks and providing jobs to the unemployed roosevelt created the farm credit administration to help farmers deal with their crushing debts and lower their mortgage payments to avoid bankruptcy.
the agricultural adjustment act of 1933 created a new federal agency the agricultural adjustment administration aaa which sought to raise prices for crops and herds by paying farmers to cut back production.
the money for such payments came from a tax levied on the processors of certain basic c ommodities cotton gins flour mills and slaughterhouses.
by the time the aaa was created however the spring growing season was already under way.
the prospect of another bumper cotton crop forced the aaa to organize a plow under program in which farmers were paid to kill the sprouting seeds in their fields.
to destroy a growing crop was a shocking commentary on our civilization agriculture secretary henry a wallace admitted.
i could tolerate it only as a cleaning up of the wreckage from the old days of unbalanced production moreover in an effort to raise pork prices some 6 million baby pigs were slaughtered and buried.
by the end of 1934 the aaa efforts had worked wheat cotton and corn production had declined and prices for those commodities had risen.
farm income increased by 58 percent between 1932 and 1935.
at the end of the first hundred days of roosevelts presidency the principle of an activist federal government had been established.
while journalists characterized the aaa nra ccc cwa and other new programs as alphabet soup and conservative critics warned that roosevelt was leading america toward fascism or communism the president had become the most popular man in the nation.
dust bowl migrants at the same time that the agricultural economy was struggling a terrible drought created an ecological catastrophe known as the dust bowl.
colorado new mexico kansas nebraska texas arkansas and oklahoma were hardest hit.
crops withered and income plummeted.
strong winds swept across the treeless plains scooping up tons of parched topsoil into billowing dark clouds called black blizzards which engulfed farms and towns.
by 1938 topsoil had disappeared from more than 25 million acres of prairie land.
1122 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 okies on the run a sharecropping family reaches its destination of bakersfield california in 1935 after we got blowed out in oklahoma parched farmers could not pay their debts and banks foreclosed on family farms.
suicides soared and millions of people abandoned their farms.
many uprooted farmers and their families from the south and the midwest headed toward california where jobs were said to be plentiful.
frequently lumped to gether as okies or arkies most of the dust bowl refugees were from cotton belt communities in arkansas texas missouri and oklahoma.
during the 1930s and 1940s some 800 000 people mostly whites headed to the far west.
without money to pay rent or a mortgage homeless migrants set up squatter camps often called little oklahomas alongside highways or close to towns where they could get food and supplies.
when one crop was harvested the migrants moved on to the next carrying their belongings with them.
most people uprooted by the dust bowl went to californias urban a reas los angeles san diego or san francisco.
others moved into the san joaquin valley the states agricultural heartland.
there they discovered that california was no paradise.
only a few could afford to buy land.
most had to work as farm laborers.
living in tents or crude cabins migrant workers suffered from exposure to the elements poor sanitation and social abuse.
as an okie reported when roosevelts new deal 1123 the big farmers need us they call us migrants and when weve picked their crop were bums and we got to get out the tennessee valley authority early in his pres idency franklin roosevelt declared that the south is the nations no.
1 economic problem indeed since the end of the civil war the economy and quality of life in the southern states had lagged far behind the rest of the nation.
that gap only widened during the depression.
to help the blighted south roosevelt created one of the most innovative programs of the first new deal the tennessee valley authority tva norris dam the massive dam in which would bring electrical power tennessee completed in 1936 was flood control efforts and jobs to appa essential in creating jobs and expanding lachia the desperately poor mountain electricity under the tva.
ous region that stretched from west virginia through western virginia and north carolina kentucky eastern tennessee and northern georgia and alabama.
by 1940 the tva a multipurpose public corporation had constructed twenty one hydroelectric dams which created the great lakes of the south and produced enough electricity to power the entire region at about half the average national rate.
the tva also dredged rivers to allow for boat and barge traffic promoted soil conservation and forestry management drew new industries to the region encouraged the formation of labor unions and improved schools and libraries.
it gave 1 5 million farms access to electricity and indoor plumbing for the first time.
progress is rarely without its burdens or inconsistencies.
many new deal programs helped some people and hurt others.
tough choices had to be made.
building all of those huge dams in appalachia and the resulting lakes meant displacing thousands of hardscrabble people from homes and villages that were destroyed to make way for progress.

first proof during roosevelts first year in office his programs and his personal charm generated widespread support.
the first new deal p rograms as well as roosevelts leadership had given americans a sense of renewed faith in the future.
in the congressional elections of 1934 the democrats increased their dominance in congress with an almost unprecedented midterm victory for a party in power.
eleanor roosevelt one of the reasons for franklin roosevelts popularity was his energetic wife eleanor roosevelt who would prove to be one of the most influential leaders of the time.
she ceaselessly prodded her husband about social justice issues and sometimes scolded him yet she always supported his ambitions and decisions.
roosevelts new deal 1125 born in 1884 in new york city eleanor married her distant cousin franklin in 1905.
all too quickly she learned that franklins domineering mother sara delano roosevelt would always be the most important woman in his life.
he might have been happier with a wife who was completely uncritical like his mother eleanor wrote later.
that i was never able to be and he had to find it in other people during the 1920s eleanor shy and insecure revealed that at heart she was a creature of conscience.
she began a lifelong crusade on behalf of women blacks and youth giving voice to the voiceless.
her tireless compassion resulted in large part from the self doubt and loneliness she had experienced as the child of an alcoholic father and an aloof mother.
equally influential in shaping eleanors outlook was the sense of betrayal she felt upon discovering in 1918 that her husband had fallen recklessly in love with lucy mercer her friend and secretary.
the bottom dropped out of my own particular world she recalled.
eleanor and franklin decided to maintain their marriage but as their son james said it became an armed truce eleanor later observed that she could forgive but never forget but she never truly forgave or forgot.
t art tongued alice roosevelt longworth the daughter of theodore roosevelt and a cousin of eleanor s actually nurtured the affair hosting mercer and franklin for dinner several times.
she later explained that roosevelt deserved a good time.
he was married to eleanor franklin and eleanor were both s trong willed people who were concerned for each others happiness while acknowledging their inability to provide it.
in the white house they lived entirely apart rarely seeing each other except for formal occasions and public events.
eleanor roosevelt redefined the role of the first lady.
she was not content just to host social events in the white house.
instead she became an outspoken and relentless activist the first woman to address a national political eleanor roosevelt intelligent convention to write a nationally syndi principled and a political figure in cated newspaper column and to hold her own right she is pictured here addressing the red cross convention regular press conferences.
the tireless in 1934.
eleanor everywhere crisscrossed the 1126 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 nation speaking in support of the new deal meeting with african american leaders supporting womens causes and labor unions and urging americans to live up to their humanitarian ideals.
in 1933 she convened a white house conference on the emergency needs of women which urged the federal emergency relief administration fera to ensure that it pay particular attention to see that women are employed wherever possible within six months some 300 000 women were at work on various federal government projects.
a popular joke in washington claimed that president roosevelts nightly prayer was dear god please make eleanor a little tired but he was in fact deeply dependent on his industrious wife.
she was the impatient agitator dedicated to what should be done he was the calculating politician concerned with what could be done.
the new deal under fire by 1934 franklin roosevelt had become the best loved and most hated president of the twentieth century.
he was loved because he believed in and fought for the common people for the forgotten man and woman.
and he was loved for what one french leader called his glittering personality roosevelt radiated energy and hope joy in his work courage in a crisis optimism for the future and a monumental self assurance bordering on arrogance.
his famously arched eyebrows upturned chin and twinkling eyes along with his cigarette holder itself tilted upward symbolized his jaunty determination to triumph over the nations massive problems.
meeting him said british prime minister winston churchill was like uncorking a bottle of champagne roosevelt he added was the greatest man i have ever known roosevelt was perhaps the most visible and accessible president who had occupied the white house.
twice a week he held press conferences explaining new legislation addressing questions and criticisms and in the process winning over most journalists.
roosevelt also mastered the art of using carefully timed radio addresses fireside chats to speak to the nation.
but he was hated too especially by business leaders and political conservatives who believed that the new deal and the higher taxes it required were moving america toward socialism.
some called roosevelt a traitor to his class even his cousin alice theodores daughter accused him of being a dictator.
others on the left hated him for not doing enough to end the depression.
by the mid 1930s the early new deal programs had slowed the economys downward slide but prosperity remained elusive.
we have been patient and long suffering said a farm leader.
we were promised a new deal.
instead we have the same old stacked deck the new deal under fire 1127 in many respects the conflicting opinions of roosevelt reflected his own divided personality and erratic management style.
he was at the same time a man of idealistic principles and a practical politician prone to snap judgments capable of both compromise and contradictory actions.
he once admitted to an aide that to implement the new deal he had to deceive misrepresent leave false impressions.
and trust to charm loyalty and the result to make up for it.
a great man cannot be a good man continuing hardships although the programs making up the first new deal helped ease the devastation caused by the depression they did not restore prosperity or end the widespread suffering.
as late as 1939 some 9 5 million workers 17 percent of the labor force remained unemployed.
critics stressed that the economy while stabilized remained mired in the depression.
theres no way like the american way margaret bourke whites famous 1937 photograph of desperate people waiting in a louisville kentucky disaster relief line captures the continuing racial divide of the era and the elusiveness of the american dream for many minorities.
1128 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 african americans and the new deal however progressive franklin delano roosevelt was on social issues he showed little interest in the plight of african americans even as black voters were shifting from the republicans the party of lincoln to the democrats.
roosevelt like woodrow wilson before him failed to address long standing patterns of racism and segregation in the south for fear of angering conservative southern democrats in congress.
as a result many new deal programs discriminated against blacks.
as mary white ovington the treasurer of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp stressed the racism in any agency varies according to the white people chosen to administer it but always there is discrimination for example the payments from the aaa to farm owners to take land out of production in an effort to raise the prices for farm products forced hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers and sharecroppers both blacks and whites off the land.
the fha refused to guarantee mortgages on houses purchased by blacks in white neighborhoods and both the ccc and the tva practiced racial segregation.
the naacp waged an energetic legal campaign against racial prejudice throughout the 1930s but a major setback occurred in the supreme court ruling on grovey v townsend 1935 which upheld the texas democrats w hites only election primary.
thanks to relentless pressure from eleanor roosevelt the president did appoint more african americans to government positions than ever before.
one of the most visible was mary mcleod bethune the child of former slaves from south carolina who had founded bethune cookman college in florida and served as head of the naacp in the 1920s.
in 1935 roosevelt approved her appointment as the director of the division of negro affairs within the national youth administration an agency that provided jobs to unemployed young americans.
bethune worked with other blacks in new deal agencies to form an informal black cabinet to ensure that african americans had equal access to federal programs.
court cases and civil liberties the continuing prejudice against blacks in the south was vividly revealed in a controversial case in alabama.
in 1931 an all white jury on flimsy conflicting testimony convicted nine black youths ranging in age from thirteen to twenty one of raping two young white women while riding a freight train.
eight of the scottsboro boys were sentenced to death before cheering whites who packed the courtroom while 10 000 spectators outside celebrated with a brass band.
in his award w inning novel native son 1940 african american writer richard wright the new deal under fire 1129 scottsboro case haywood patterson center one of the defendants in the case with his attorney samuel liebowitz left in decatur alabama in 1933 recalled the mob who surrounded the scottsboro jail with rope and kerosene after the initial conviction.
the injustice of the scottsboro case sparked protests throughout the nation and the world.
the two white girls it turned out had been selling sex to white and black boys on the train.
one of the girls eventually recanted the rape charges and began appearing at rallies on behalf of the defendants.
no case in legal history had produced as many trials appeals reversals and retrials as the scottsboro case.
further it prompted two important legal interpretations.
in powell v alabama 1932 the u s supreme court overturned the original convictions because the judge had not ensured that the accused were provided adequate defense attorneys.
the court ordered new trials.
in another case norris v alabama 1935 the court ruled that the systematic exclusion of african americans from alabama juries had denied the scottsboro defendants equal protection under the law a principle that had widespread impact on state courts by opening up juries to blacks.
although the state of alabama eventually dropped the charges against the four youngest of the scottsboro defendants and granted paroles to the others their lives were ruined.
the last defendant was released from prison in 1950 native americans and the depression the great depres sion also ravaged native americans.
they were initially encouraged by roosevelts appointment of john collier as commissioner of the bureau of indian affairs bia.
collier steadily increased the number of native americans 1130 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 employed by the bia and ensured that native americans gained access to the various relief programs.
colliers primary objective however was passage of the indian reorganization act.
designed to reinvigorate native american cultural traditions by restoring land to tribes the proposed law would have granted them the right to start businesses establish self governing constitutions and receive federal funds for vocational training and economic development.
the act that congress passed however was a much diluted version of colliers original proposal and the indian new deal brought only partial improvement to the lives of native americans.
but it did spur the various tribes to revise their constitutions so as to give women the right to vote and hold office.
cultural life during the depression in view of the celebrated if e xaggerated alienation felt by the lost generation of writers artists and intellectuals during the 1920s one might have expected the onset of the great depression to have deepened their despair.
instead it brought a renewed sense of militancy and affirmation as if society could no longer afford the art for art s sake outlook of the 1920s.
said one writer early in 1932 i enjoy the period thoroughly.
the breakdown of our cult of business success and optimism the miraculous disappearance of our famous american complacency all this is having a tonic effect in the early 1930s the tonic effect of commitment sometimes sparked revolutionary political activities.
by the summer of 1932 even the golden boy of the lost generation the writer f scott fitzgerald had declared that to bring on the revolution it may be necessary to work within the communist party but few americans remained communists for long.
being a notoriously independent lot most writers rebelled at demands to hew to a shifting party line.
and many abandoned communism upon learning that the soviet leader josef stalin practiced a tyranny more horrible than anything under the russian czars.
literature and the depression among the writers who ad dressed themes of social significance during the 1930s two deserve special notice john steinbeck and richard wright.
the novel that best captured the ordeal of the depression steinbecks the grapes of wrath 1939 treats workers as people rather than variables in a political formula.
steinbeck had traveled with displaced okies driven from the oklahoma dust bowl to pursue the illusion of good jobs in the fields of californias central valley.
this firsthand experience allowed him to create a vivid tale of the joad familys painful journey west.
among the most talented novelists to emerge in the 1930s was richard wright.
the grandson of former slaves and the son of a mississippi sharecropper the new deal under fire 1131 who deserted his family wright ended his formal schooling with the ninth grade as valedictorian of his class.
he then worked in memphis and devoured books he borrowed on a white friends library card all the while saving to go north to escape the racism of the south.
in chicago the federal writers project gave him a chance to develop his talent.
his period as a communist from 1934 to 1944 gave him an intellectual framework that did not overpower his fierce independence.
native son 1940 wrights masterpiece is the story of bigger thomas a product of the ghetto who is hemmed in by forces beyond his control and finally impelled to commit murder.
popular culture while many writers and artists dealt with the suffering and social tensions aroused by the great depression the more popular cultural outlets such as radio programs and movies provided a welcome escape from the decades grim realities.
in 1930 more than 10 million families owned a radio by the end of the decade the number had tripled.
franklin roosevelt was the first president to take full advantage of the popularity of radio broadcasting.
he hosted sixteen fireside chats to generate support for his new deal initiatives.
in the late 1920s movies were transformed by the introduction of sound.
the talkies made movies by far the most popular form of entertainment during the 1930 s much more popular than they are today.
the introduction of double features in 1931 and the construction of outdoor d rive in theaters in 1933 boosted interest and attendance.
more than 60 percent of the population 70 million people paid a quarter to see at least one movie each week.
the movies of the 1930s rarely dealt directly with hard times.
people wanted to be cheered up when they entered movie houses.
in stand up and cheer.
1934 featuring child star shirley temple president roosevelt appoints a broadway producer to his cabinet as the secretary of amusement.
his goal is to use entertainment to distract people from the ravages of the depression.
most feature films transported viewers into the escapist realm of adventure spectacle and fantasy.
gone with the wind 1939 based on margaret mitchells pulitzer p rize winning novel was a good example of such escapism as were the wizard of oz 1939 and walt disneys feature cartoons.
moviegoers also relished shoot em up gangster films spectacular musicals especially those starring dancers fred astaire and ginger rogers screwball romantic comedies featuring wacky situations zany characters and witty dialogue like it happened one night 1934 my man godfrey 1936 and mister deeds goes to town 1936 and horror films such as dracula 1931 frankenstein 1931 the mummy 1932 king kong 1933 the invisible man 1933 and werewolf of london 1935.
1132 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 a paramount picture 1934 the glamor of actress claudette colberts cleopatra is sharply contrasted with the exhaustion of the average theatergoer in this painting by reginald marsh.
the growing popularity of movies offered americans escape from the daily challenges of the great depression though marshs work suggests that this was fleeting at best.
perhaps the best way to escape the daily troubles of the depression was to watch one of the zany comedies of the marx brothers former vaudeville performers turned movie stars.
as one hollywood official explained the movies of the new deal under fire 1133 the 1930s were intended to laugh the big bad wolf of the depression out of the public mind the cocoanuts 1929 animal crackers 1930 monkey business 1931 horse feathers 1932 and duck soup 1933 introduced moviegoers to the anarchic antics of chico groucho harpo and zeppo marx who combined slapstick humor with verbal wit to create plotless masterpieces of irreverent satire.
critics assault the new deal for all of their criticisms of the inadequacy of new deal programs native americans and african americans still voted in large majorities for franklin roosevelt.
other new deal critics however hated roosevelt the man as much as they despised his policies.
many republican business executives were so angered by the presidents promotion of a welfare state and the goals of labor unions that they refused to use the presidents name calling him instead that man in the white house huey long others criticized roosevelt for not doing enough to help the common people.
the most potent of the presidents populist opponents was huey pierce long jr a democratic senator from louisiana.
a short colorful man with wild curly hair long known as kingfish was a theatrical politician a demagogue who appealed to the raw emotions of the masses.
the swaggering son of a backwoods farmer he sported pink suits and pastel shirts red ties and t wo toned shoes.
he claimed to serve the poor arguing that his louisiana would be a place where every man is a king but no one wears a crown first as louisianas governor then as its most powerful u s senator long viewed the state as his personal empire.
reporters called him the dictator of louisiana true he reduced state taxes improved roads and schools built charity hospitals and provided better pub huey long as the powerful governor lic services but in the process he used of louisiana long was a shrewd lawyer and consummate wheeler dealer bribery intimidation and blackmail to politician.
get his way.
1134 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 in 1933 long arrived in washington as a supporter of roosevelt and the new deal but he quickly grew suspicious of the nras efforts to cooperate with big business.
having developed presidential aspirations he had also grown jealous of prince franklin roosevelts popularity.
to launch his own presidential candidacy long devised a simplistic plan for dealing with the great depression that he called the share the wealth society.
long wanted to raise taxes on the wealthiest americans and redistribute the money to the people giving every poor family 5 000 and every worker an annual income of 2 500 providing pensions to retirees reducing working hours paying bonuses to military veterans and enabling every qualified student to attend college.
it did not matter that his plan would have spent far more money than would have been raised by his proposed taxes.
as he told a group of iowa farmers maybe somebody says i dont understand it government finance.
well you dont have to.
just shut your damn eyes and believe it.
thats all by early 1935 long claimed to have enough support to unseat roosevelt.
i can take him he bragged.
hes a phony.
hes scared of me.
i can outpromise him and he knows it.
people will believe me and they wont believe him longs antics led the president to declare that the louisiana senator was one of the two most dangerous men in the country the other was general douglas macarthur.
the townsend plan another popular critic of roosevelt was a retired california doctor francis e townsend.
shocked by the sight of three elderly women digging through garbage cans for food scraps he began promoting the townsend recovery plan in 1934.
townsend wanted the federal government to pay 200 a month to every american over sixty who agreed to quit working.
the recipients would have to spend the money each month.
townsend claimed that his plan would create jobs for young people by giving older people the means to retire and it would energize the economy by enabling retirees to buy more products.
but like huey longs share the wealth scheme the numbers in townsends plan did not add up although it would have served only 9 percent of the population it would have paid those retirees more than half the total national income.
townsend like long didnt care about the plans cost.
not surprisingly it attracted great support among americans sixty years of age and older.
thousands of townsend clubs sprang up across the nation and advocates flooded the white house with letters urging roosevelt to enact it.
father coughlin a third outspoken critic was father charles e coughlin a roman catholic radio priest in detroit michigan.
in fiery the new deal under fire 1135 weekly broadcasts that attracted as many as 40 million listeners he assailed roosevelt as anti god and claimed that the new deal was a communist conspiracy.
during the 1930s coughlin became increasingly a nti semitic claiming that roosevelt was a tool of international jewish bankers and relabeling the new deal the jew deal he praised adolf hitler and the nazis for killing jews because he believed that all jews were communists who must be hunted down.
during the 1940 presidential campaign the thuggish coughlin gave a nazi salute and bragged when we get through with the jews in america theyll think the treatment they received in germany was nothing of long townsend and coughlin long had the largest political following.
a 1935 poll showed that he could draw more than 5 million votes as a third party candidate for president perhaps enough to prevent roosevelts reelection.
roosevelt decided to steal the thunder from his most vocal critics by instituting an array of new programs.
im fighting communism huey longism coughlinism townsendism roosevelt told a reporter in early 1935.
he needed to save our system the capitalist system from such crackpot ideas promoters of welfare capitalism dr francis e townsend rev.
gerald l k smith and rev.
charles e coughlin left to right attend the townsend recovery plan convention in cleveland ohio.
1136 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 opposition from the court the opposition to the new deal came from all directions.
among the most powerful opponents was the u s supreme court.
by the m id 1930s businesses were filing lawsuits against various elements of the new deal and some of them made their way to the supreme court.
on may 27 1935 the u s supreme court killed the national industrial recovery act nira by a unanimous vote.
in schechter poultry corporation v united states the justices ruled that congress had given too much of its authority to the president when the nira created the national recovery administration nra giving it the power to bring business and labor leaders together to create codes of fair competition for their industries an activity that violated federal anti trust laws.
in a press conference soon after the court announced its decision roosevelt fumed we have been relegated to the horse and buggy definition of interstate commerce then on january 6 1936 in united states v butler the supreme court declared the agricultural adjustment acts tax on middle men the companies that processed food crops and commodities like cotton unconstitutional.
in response to the courts decision the roosevelt administration passed the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 which reestablished the earlier crop reduction payment programs but left out the tax on processors.
although the aaa helped boost the overall farm economy conservatives criticized its sweeping powers.
by the end of its 1936 term the supreme court had ruled against new deal programs in seven of nine major cases.
the same line of conservative judicial reasoning roosevelt warned might endanger other new deal programs if he did not act swiftly to prevent it.
the second new deal to rescue his legislative program from judicial and political challenges roosevelt in january 1935 launched the second more radical phase of the new deal explaining that social justice no longer a distant ideal has become a definite goal of his administration.
in his effort to steal huey longs thunder the president called on congress to pass a cluster of what he designated as must legislation that included a federal construction program to employ the jobless banking reforms increased taxes on the wealthy and social security programs to protect people during unemployment old age and illness.
roosevelts closest aide harry l hopkins told the cabinet boys this is our hour.
weve got to get everything we want a public works program social security wages and hours everything now or never the second new deal 1137 the wpa in the first three months of 1935 dubbed the second hundred days roosevelt convinced congress to pass most of the second new deals must legislation.
the results changed the face of american life.
the first major initiative was the 4 8 billion emergency relief appropriation act.
the largest peacetime spending bill in history to that point it included an array of federal job programs managed by a new agency the works progress administration wpa.
the wpa quickly became the nations largest employer hiring an average of 2 million people annually over four years.
wpa workers built new yorks laguardia airport restored the st louis riverfront and managed the bankrupt city of key west florida.
the wpa also employed a wide range of writers artists actors and musicians in new cultural programs the federal theatre project the federal art project the federal music project and the federal writers project.
the national youth administration nya also under the wpa provided part time employment to students and aided jobless youths.
two future presidents were among the beneficiaries t wenty seven year old lyndon b johnson federal art project a group of wpa artists at work on building the transcontinental railroad a mural celebrating the contributions of foreign newcomers that appears in the immigrants dining hall on ellis island outside of new york city.
1138 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 directed an nya program in texas and richard m nixon a struggling duke university law student found work through the nya at 35 an hour.
although the wpa took care of only 3 million of some 10 million jobless at any one time it helped some 9 million people before it expired in 1943 the wagner act another major element of the second new deal was the national labor relations act often called the wagner act in honor of the new york senator robert wagner who drafted it and convinced roosevelt to support it.
the wagner act was one of the most important pieces of labor legislation in history guaranteeing workers the right to organize unions and bargain directly with management about wages and other issues.
it also created a national labor relations board to oversee union activities.
social security as francis townsend had stressed the great depression hit the oldest americans and those with disabilities especially hard.
to address the problems faced by the elderly and disabled roosevelt proposed the social security act of 1935.
social security was he announced the cornerstone and supreme achievement of the new deal.
the basic concept of government assistance to the elderly was not new.
progressives during the early 1900s had proposed a federal system of social security for the aged poor disabled and unemployed.
other nations had already enacted such programs but not the united states.
the hardships caused by the great depression revived the idea however and roosevelt masterfully guided the legislation through congress.
the social security act was designed largely by secretary of labor frances perkins the first woman cabinet member in history.
its centerpiece was a self financed federal retirement fund for people over sixty five.
beginning in 1937 workers and employers contributed payroll taxes to establish the fund.
most of the collected taxes were spent on pension payments to retirees whatever was left over went into a trust fund for the future.
roosevelt stressed that social security was not intended to guarantee everyone a comfortable retirement.
rather it was meant to supplement other sources of income and protect the elderly.
only during the 1950s did voters and politicians come to view orking class social security as the primary source of retirement income for w americans.
the social security act also set up a shared federal state unemployment insurance program financed by a payroll tax on employers.
in addition it committed the national government to a broad range of social welfare activities based upon the assumption that unemployables people who were unable to w ork would remain a state responsibility while the national g overnment would provide work the second new deal 1139 relief for the a ble bodied.
to that end the social security act provided federal funding for three s tate administered public a ssistance programs old age assis tance aid to dependent children and aid for the b lind and further aid for maternal child welfare and public health services.
when compared with similar programs in europe the u s social security system was conservative.
it was the only government managed retirement program in the world financed by taxes on the earnings of workers most other countries funded such programs out of general government revenues.
the social security payroll tax was also a regressive tax because it used a single withholding tax rate for everyone regardless of income level.
it thus pinched the poor more than the rich and it hurt efforts to revive the economy because it removed from circula social security a poster distributed tion a significant amount of money.
in by the government to educate the public addition the social security system at about the new social security act.
the insistence of southern democrats determined to maintain white supremacy excluded 9 5 million workers who most needed the new program farm laborers domestic workers maids and cooks and the s elf employed a disproportionate percentage of whom were african americans.
roosevelt regretted the acts limitations but he knew that they were necessary compromises to gain congressional approval and to withstand court challenges.
as he told an aide who criticized funding the program out of employee contributions i guess youre right on the economics but those taxes were never a problem of economics.
they are politics all the way through.
we put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a moral legal and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits.
with those taxes in there no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.
1140 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 roosevelt also preferred that workers fund their own social security pensions because he wanted americans to view their retirement checks as an entitlement as something that they had paid for and deserved.
conservatives condemned the social security act as tyrannical and socialistic former president herbert hoover refused to apply for a social security card because of his opposition to the radical program.
he received a social security number anyway.
taxing the rich another major bill in the second phase of the new deal was the revenue act of 1935 sometimes called the wealth tax act but popularly known as the soak the rich tax.
it raised tax rates on annual income above 50 000 in part because of stories that many wealthy americans were not paying taxes.
the powerful banker j p morgan confessed to a senate committee that he had created fictitious sales of stock to his wife that enabled him to pay no taxes.
labor union violence this 1935 photograph captures unionized strikers fighting scabs or nonunion replacement employees as the scabs try to pass the picket line and enter the factory.
the second new deal 1141 morgan and other business leaders fumed over roosevelts tax and spending policies.
newspaper tycoon william randolph hearst growled that the wealth tax was essentially communism roosevelt countered by stressing that i am fighting communism.
i want to save our system the capitalistic system yet he added that saving capitalism and rebalancing its essential elements required a more equal distribution of wealth a new direction for unions the new deal reinvigorated the labor union movement.
when the national industrial recovery act nira demanded that every industry code affirm workers rights to organize unionists quickly translated it to mean the president wants you to join the union john l lewis head of the united mine workers umw was among the first to capitalize on the pro union spirit of the nira.
he rebuilt the umw from 150 000 members to 500 000 within a year.
encouraged by lewiss success sidney hillman of the amalgamated clothing workers and david dubinsky of the international ladies garment workers organized workers in the clothing industry.
as leaders of industrial unions composed of all types of workers in a particular industry skilled or unskilled which were in the minority by far they found the smaller more restrictive craft unions composed of skilled male workers only with each union serving just one trade to be obstacles to organizing workers in the countrys basic industries.
in 1935 with the passage of the wagner act industrial unionists formed a committee for industrial organization cio.
craft unionists began to fear submergence by the mass unions made up mainly of unskilled workers.
jurisdictional disputes divided them and in 1936 the american federation of labor afl expelled the cio unions which then formed a permanent structure called after 1938 the congress of industrial organizations also known by the initials cio.
the rivalry spurred both groups to greater efforts.
the cio focused on organizing the automobile and steel industries.
until the supreme court upheld the wagner act in 1937 however companies failed to cooperate with its p ro union provisions.
employers instead used various forms of intimidation to fight the infant unions.
early in 1937 automobile workers spontaneously tried a new tactic the sit down strike in which they refused to leave a workplace until employers had granted them collective bargaining rights.
led by the fiery walter reuther thousands of employees at the general motors assembly plants in flint michigan occupied the factories and stopped all production.
company officials called in police to harass the strikers sent spies to union meetings and threatened to fire the workers.
they also pleaded with president roosevelt to dispatch federal troops.
he refused while expressing his displeasure with the sit down strike which the courts later declared 1142 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 illegal.
the standoff lasted more than a month.
then on february 11 1937 the company relented and signed a contract recognizing the united automobile workers uaw as a legitimate union.
roosevelts second term on june 27 1936 franklin delano roosevelt accepted the democratic partys nomination for a second term.
the republicans chose governor alfred m landon of kansas a progressive republican who had endorsed many new deal programs.
we cannot go back to the days before the depression he scolded conservative republicans.
we must go forward facing our new problems the republicans hoped that the followers of huey long charles e coughlin francis e townsend and other roosevelt critics would combine to draw enough democratic votes away from the president to give landon a winning margin.
but that possibility faded when an assassin the son in law of a louisiana judge whom long had sought to remove shot and killed the forty two year old senator in 1935.
in the 1936 election roosevelt carried every state except campaigning for a second term roosevelt campaigning with labor leader john l lewis to the right of roosevelt in wilkes barre pennsylvania.
the second new deal 1143 maine and vermont with a popular vote of 27 7 million to landons 16 7 million the largest margin of victory to that point.
democrats would also dominate the new congress by 77 to 19 in the senate and 328 to 107 in the house.
in winning another landslide election roosevelt forged a new electoral coalition that would affect national politics for years to come.
while holding the support of most traditional democrats north and south he made strong gains in the west among beneficiaries of new deal agricultural programs.
in the northern cities he held on to the ethnic groups helped by new deal welfare policies.
many middle class voters whose property had been saved by new deal measures flocked to support roosevelt as did intellectuals stirred by the ferment of new ideas coming from the government.
the revived labor union movement also threw its support to roosevelt and in the most meaningful shift of all a majority of african americans voted for a democratic president.
my friends go home and turn lincolns picture to the wall a pittsburgh journalist told black voters.
that debt has been paid in full the court packing plan roosevelts landslide victory convinced him that he could do almost anything and the voters would support him.
he believed his reelection demonstrated that the nation wanted even more government action to revive the economy.
the t hree to one democratic majorities in congress ensured that he could pass new legislation.
but one major roadblock stood in the way the conservative supreme court made up of nine old men lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the social security and wagner acts were pending before the court.
given the courts conservative bent and its earlier anti new deal rulings roosevelt feared that the second new deal was in danger of being nullified.
for that reason he hatched a clumsy plan to reform the court by enlarging it.
congress not the constitution determines the size of the supreme court which over the years had numbered between six and ten justices.
in 1937 the number was nine.
on february 5 1937 roosevelt without consulting congressional leaders or even his own advisers asked congress to name up to six new supreme court justices one for each of the current justices over seventy years old explaining that the aging members of the court were falling behind in their work and needed help.
but the court packing scheme as opponents labeled the plan backfired.
it was too manipulative and far too political and quickly became the most controversial proposal of roosevelts presidency.
the plan ignited a firestorm of opposition among conservative republicans and even aroused fears among democrats that the president was seeking dangerous new powers.
as it turned out several court decisions during the spring of 1937 surprisingly upheld disputed provisions of the wagner and social security acts.
in 1144 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 addition a conservative justice resigned and roosevelt replaced him with a new dealer senator hugo black of alabama.
despite criticism from both parties roosevelt insisted on forcing his court packing bill through congress.
on july 22 1937 the senate overwhelmingly voted it down.
it was the biggest political blunder and greatest humiliation of roosevelts career.
the episode fractured the democratic party and damaged the presidents prestige.
the momentum of his 1936 landslide victory was lost.
as secretary of agriculture henry a wallace later remarked the whole new deal really went up in smoke as a result of the supreme court fight a slumping economy during 1935 and 1936 the economy finally began showing signs of revival.
by the spring of 1937 industrial output had risen above the 1929 level.
in 1937 however roosevelt worried about federal budget deficits and rising inflation ordered sharp cuts in government spending.
the economy stalled then slid into a slump deeper than that of 1929.
in only three months unemployment rose by 2 million people.
when the spring of 1938 failed to bring economic recovery roosevelt reversed himself and asked congress to adopt a new federal spending program and congress voted 3 3 billion in new expenditures.
the increase in government spending reversed the economys decline but only during world war ii would employment again reach pre 1929 levels.
the c ourt packing fight the sit down strikes and the 1937 recession all undercut roosevelts prestige and power.
when the 1937 congressional session ended the only major new deal initiatives were the w agner steagall national housing act and the b ankhead jones farm tenant act.
the housing act developed by senator robert f wagner set up the federal housing authority which extended long term loans to cities to build public housing projects in blighted neighborhoods and provide subsidized rents for poor people.
later during world war ii it financed housing for workers in new defense plants.
the farm tenant act created a new agency the farm security administration fsa which provided loans to keep farm owners from losing their land to bankruptcy.
it also made loans to tenant farmers to enable them to purchase farms.
in the end however the fsa proved to be little more than another relief operation that tided a few farmers over during difficult times.
a more effective answer to the problem eventually arrived in the form of national mobilization for war which landed many struggling tenant farmers in military service or the defense industry broadened their horizons and taught them new skills.
in 1938 the democratic congress also enacted the fair labor standards act.
it replaced many of the provisions that had been in the nira which had the second new deal 1145 been declared unconstitutional.
the federal government established a minimum wage of 40 an hour and a maximum workweek of forty hours.
the act which applied only to businesses engaged in interstate commerce also prohibited the employment of children under the age of sixteen.
setbacks for the president during the late 1930s the democrats in congress increasingly split into two factions with conservative southerners on one side and liberal northerners on the other.
many white southern democrats balked at the partys growing dependence on the votes of northern labor unions and african americans.
senator ellison cotton ed smith of south carolina and several other southern delegates walked out of the 1936 democratic party convention with smith declaring that he would not support any party that views the negro as a political and social equal other critics believed that roosevelt was exercising too much power and spending too much money.
some southern democrats began to work with conservative republicans to veto any additional new deal programs.
roosevelt now headed a divided party and the congressional elections of november 1938 handed the administration another setback when the democrats lost 7 seats in the senate and 80 in the house.
in his state of the union message in 1939 roosevelt for the first time presented no new reform programs but instead spoke of the need to preserve our reforms the conservative coalition of republicans and southern democrats had stalemated the president.
as one observer noted the new deal has been reduced to a movement with no program with no effective political organization with no vast popular party strength behind it a halfway revolution the new deals political momentum petered out in 1939 just as a new world war was erupting in europe and asia.
many new deal programs had failed or were poorly conceived and implemented but others were changing american life for the better social security federal regulation of stock markets and banks minimum wage levels for workers federally insured bank accounts the right to join labor unions.
never before had the federal government intervened so directly in the economy or spent so much on social welfare programs.
franklin roosevelt had also transformed the nations political dynamics luring black voters in large numbers to the democratic party and he had raised the nations spirits through his relentless optimism.
roosevelt had led the nation out of the depression and changed the role of the federal government.
by the end of the 1930s its power and scope were vastly larger than in 1932.
landmark laws expanded the powers of the national 1146 chapter 25 the great depression 1929 1939 meeting of the a nti new dealers democratic senator ellison d cotton ed smith of south carolina cringes at the thought of a fourth term for roosevelt while meeting with fellow anti new dealers at the mayflower hotel in washington d c government by establishing new regulatory agencies and laying the foundation of a social welfare system.
most important of all the new deal brought faith and hope to the discouraged and desperate.
as a ccc worker recalled late in life roosevelt restored a sense of confidence and morale and hope hope being the greatest of all new deal programs provided stability for tens of millions of people.
we arent on relief anymore one woman noted with pride.
my husband is working for the government the enduring reforms of the new deal also constituted a significant change from the progressivism of theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson.
they had assumed that the function of government was to use aggressive regulation of industry and business to ensure that people had an equal opportunity to pursue the american dream.
but franklin roosevelt and the new dealers insisted that the government should provide at least a minimal quality of life for all americans.
the enduring protections afforded by b ank deposit insurance unemployment benefits a minimum hourly wage the wagner act and social security the second new deal 1147 pensions gave people a sense of security and protected the nation against future economic crises.
there has not been a similar depression since the 1930s.
the greatest failure of the new deal was its inability to restore prosperity and end record levels of unemployment.
in 1939 10 million a mericans nearly 17 percent of the workforce remained jobless.
only the second world war would finally produce full e mployment in the armed forces as well as in factories supporting the military.
roosevelts energetic pragmatism was his greatest strength and weakness.
he was flexible in developing new policies and programs he kept what worked and discarded what failed.
he sharply increased the regulatory powers of the federal government and laid the foundation for what would become an expanding system of social welfare programs.
despite what his critics charged however roosevelt was no socialist he sought to preserve the basic capitalist economic structure while providing protection to the nations most vulnerable people.
in this sense the new deal represented a halfway revolution that permanently altered the nations social and political landscape.
in a time of peril roosevelt created for americans a more secure future.
chapter review summary hoovers failure the first phase of the federal response to the great depression included president hoovers attempts at increasing public works and exhorting unions businesses and farmers to cooperate to revive economic growth.
his belief in voluntary self reliance prevented him from using federal intervention to relieve the human suffering and contributed to his underestimation of the financial collapse.
such programs as the reconstruction finance corporation were too few and too late.
by march 1933 the economy was shattered.
millions of americans were without jobs without the basic necessities and without hope.
the first new deal in 1933 newly inaugurated president franklin delano roosevelt and his brain trust set out to restore the economy and public confidence.
during his early months in office congress and roosevelt enacted the first new deal which propped up the banking industry with the federal deposit insurance corporation provided short term emergency work relief in the form of jobs for the unemployed promoted industrial recovery with the national recovery administration and passed the agricultural adjustment act intended to raise agricultural prices by encouraging farmers to cut production.
most of the early new deal programs eased hardships but did not restore prosperity they helped to end the economys downward spiral but still left millions unemployed and mired in poverty.
new deal under fire the supreme court ruled that many of the first new deal programs were unconstitutional violations of private property and states rights.
many conservatives criticized the new deal for expanding the scope and reach of the federal government so much that it was steering the nation toward socialism.
the radio priest father charles e coughlin charged that the new deal was a jewish atheist communist conspiracy.
other critics did not think the new deal reforms went far enough.
senator huey long of louisiana and dr francis townsend of california proposed radical plans to reshape the distribution of wealth from the rich to the poor.
african americans criticized the widespread racial discrimination in new deal policies and agencies.
the second new deal and the new deals legacy roosevelt responded to the criticism and the continuing economic hardship with a second new deal which sought to reshape the nations social structure by expanding the role of the federal government.
many of the programs making up the second new deal such as the works progress administration social security and the wagner act aimed to achieve greater social justice by establishing new regulatory agencies and laying the foundation of a federal social welfare system.
frustrated by the supreme courts opposition to the first new deal roosevelt proposed his court packing scheme but it was rejected by the senate.
support for the new deal began to lose steam amid the lingering effects of the great depression.
however the new deal the second new deal 1149 established the idea that the federal government should provide at least a minimal quality of life for all americans and it provided people with some security against a future crisis reaffirming for millions a faith in american capitalism.

w hen franklin roosevelt became president in 1933 he shared with most americans a determination to stay out of international disputes.
his focus was on combating the great depression at home.
while the united states had become deeply involved in global trade during the twenties it had remained aloof from global conflicts.
so called isolationists insisted that there was no justification for america to become embroiled in international affairs much less another major war.
with each passing year during the thirties however germany italy and japan threatened the peace and stability of europe and asia.
roosevelt strove mightily to keep the united states out of what he called the spreading epidemic of world lawlessness as fascist dictatorships in germany and italy and ultranationalist militarists in japan violated international law by invading neighboring countries.
by the end of the decade roosevelt had decided that the only way for the united states to avoid fighting in another war was to offer all possible assistance to its allies great britain france and china.
roosevelts efforts to stop aggressor nations ignited a fierce debate between isolationists and interventionists which ended with shocking suddenness on december 7 1941 when japan staged a surprise attack against u s military bases at pearl harbor in hawaii.
the second world war that americans had struggled to avoid had arrived at last.
it would become the most significant event of the twentieth century engulfing five continents and leaving few people untouched.
the japanese attack unified americans as never before.
men and women rushed to join the armed forces.
eventually 16 4 million people would serve focus questions 1.

1064 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties were immigrants some of whom had a passion for socialism or a narchism as well as a willingness to use violence to achieve their political goals.
fears of an invasion of foreign radicals led congress to pass the emergency immigration act of 1921 which limited total immigration to 150 000 a year and restricted newcomers from each european country to 3 percent of the total number of that nationality represented in the 1910 census.
three years later after people complained that too many eastern and southern europeans were still being admitted congress passed the immigration act of 1924.
it reduced the number of admitted europeans to 2 percent of the 1890 census so as to include fewer new immigrants from southern and eastern europe jews italians poles and russians.
the purpose of the new quotas was to shrink the total number of immigrants to favor immigrants from northern and western europe and to reduce those from southern and eastern europe.
a kansas congressman expressed the prejudices against german and italian catholics felt by many rural american protestants on the one side is beer bolshevism unassimilating settlements and perhaps many flags on the other side is constitutional government one flag stars and stripes the immigration laws targeted particular groups.
for example they banned immigrants from japan or china.
the immigration act of 1924 however allowed newcomers from countries in the western hemisphere.
an unintended result was that people of latin american descent chiefly mexicans puerto ricans and cubans became the fastest growing ethnic minority during the twenties.
the number of mexicans living in texas increased tenfold between 1900 and 1930 in response to the needs of texas farmers for stoop laborers.
cotton picking suits the mexican was the common assertion among texas growers.
because mexican migrant workers were mostly homeless nomads willing to move with the seasons farm owners came to prefer them over black and white tenants and farm laborers.
sacco and vanzetti the nativism embedded in the new immigration laws reinforced the connection between european immigrants and political radicalism.
that connection erupted in the most widely publicized criminal case of the twenties.
on may 5 1920 two italian immigrants who described themselves as revolutionary anarchists eager to topple the american government shoemaker nicola sacco and fish peddler bartolomeo vanzetti were arrested outside boston massachusetts for stealing 16 000 from a shoe factory and killing the paymaster and a guard.
both men were armed with loaded pistols when reactionary conservatism and immigration restriction 1065 sacco and vanzetti the trial and conviction of these working class italian immigrants became a public spectacle amid the growing mood of nativism.
arrested both lied to police and both were identified by eyewitnesses.
the stolen money however was never found and several people claimed that they were with sacco and vanzetti far from the scene of the crime when it occurred.
the sacco and vanzetti case occurred at the height of italian immigration to the united states and against the backdrop of numerous terror attacks by anarchists some of which sacco and vanzetti had participated in.
the charged atmosphere called the red hysteria by one journalist ensured that the mens trial would be a public spectacle.
in july 1921 sacco and vanzetti were convicted and sentenced to death.
their legal appeals lasted six years before they were electrocuted on august 23 1927 still claiming their innocence.
to millions of workers and liberals around the world sacco and vanzetti became martyrs victims of capitalist injustice.
people still debate their guilt or innocence.
the new klan the most violent of the reactionary movements during the twenties was a revived ku klux klan the infamous post civil war group 1066 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties of anti black racists that had r e created itself in 1915.
the old klan had died out in the 1870s once white democrats regained control of the former confederate states after reconstruction.
the new klan the invisible empire of the knights of the ku klux klan was by 1920 a nationwide organization devoted to the maintenance of white supremacy and 100 percent americanism only natives white protestants born in the united states could be members.
at its peak the new klan numbered over 4 million members making it the largest far right movement in history.
shrouded in secret signs and codes practicing weird rituals and costumed in white sheets and spooky hats the klan called for militant patriotism restrictions on immigration and voting and strict personal morality.
it opposed bootleg liquor and labor unions and it preached hatred against not only african americans but roman catholics jews immigrants communists atheists prostitutes and adulterers.
the united states was no melting pot shouted imperial wizard william j simmons it is a garbage can.
when the hordes of aliens walk to the ballot box and their votes outnumber yours then that alien horde has got you by the throat bigotry became big business.
the new klan was mobilized by shrewd marketers eager to make money on racism.
each member of a local klavern paid a 10 initiation fee and 5 in annual dues and was required to buy an official klan robe a pointed hood and other accessories.
whole families attended klan gatherings klasping hands while listening to violent speeches watching fireworks and burning crosses.
a colorado judge said that his neighbors had paid ten dollars to hate somebody by joining the klan and they were determined to get their moneys worth in texas the klan focused on imposing its severe view of righteous protestant morality on others.
members used the instruments of t errorism harassment intimidation often in the form of burning crosses beatings and tar and feathers to discipline alcoholics gamblers adulterers and other sinners.
in the spring of 1922 alone the dallas klan flogged s ixty eight men.
the reborn klan headquartered in atlanta grew rapidly across the nation and especially in the rural midwest.
during the twenties 40 percent of its anglo saxon members were in three midwestern states illinois indiana and ohio.
recruiters called kleagles were told to play upon whatever prejudices were most acute in a particular area in texas the klan fed on prejudice against mexicans in california hatred focused on japanese americans in new york the enemy was primarily jews and catholics.
most klan members were small farmers sharecroppers or wage workers but the organization also attracted clergymen engineers doctors lawyers accountants business leaders and teachers.
as a prominent southern journalist reactionary conservatism and immigration restriction 1067 observed the new klan was anti negro anti alien a nti red anti catholic a nti jew anti darwin anti modern anti liberal fundamentalist vastly moral militantly protestant african americans grew increasingly concerned.
the chicago defender the black newspaper with the widest circulation in the nation urged its readers to fight back against klansmen trying to win what their fathers in the civil war lost by fire and sword by 1923 the klans membership had surpassed 4 million including judges mayors sheriffs state legislators six governors and three u s senators.
the grand dragon an indiana con man named david c stephenson grew so influential in electing local and state officials the kluxing of america as he called it that he boasted i am the law in indiana k lan endorsed candidates won the indiana governorship and controlled the state legislature.
at the 1924 republican state convention stephenson patrolled the aisles with a pistol.
he later confessed that he purchased the county and state officials stephenson who had grown wealthy by skimming from the dues he collected from klan members as well as selling robes and hoods planned to run for president of the united states.
the klans influence both in indiana and nationwide suddenly crumbled however after stephenson was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 1925 for kidnapping and raping a twenty eight year old woman who then ku klux klan rally in 1925 the kkk marched down pennsylvania avenue in washington d c 1068 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties c ommitted suicide.
membership tumbled and klan organizations splintered or shut down altogether.
several states passed anti klan laws and others banned the wearing of masks and burning of crosses.
by 1930 nationwide membership had dwindled to 100 000 mostly southerners.
yet the impulse underlying the klan lived on fed by deep seated fears and hatreds that have yet to disappear.
fundamentalism while fighting growing immorality and the alien menace the klan also defended old time religion against dangerous ideas circulating in progressive or liberal protestant churches.
the most threatening ideas were that the bible was not literally the word of god and that charles darwins theories of biological evolution were true.
conservative protestants embraced a militant fundamentalism distinctive for its hostility toward new liberal beliefs and its insistence on the literal truth of the bible.
the result was a religious civil war often called the m odernist fundamentalist conflict.
it divided congregations and whole denominations.
a burst of protestant fundamentalism swept the country largely as a reaction to the spread of modernism in mainline protestantism which sought to accommodate christian teaching with modern science.
in a famous 1922 sermon titled shall the fundamentalists win harry emerson fosdick the progressive pastor at new york citys first presbyterian church dismissed biblical fundamentalism as immeasurable folly the bible he explained was not literally the word of god but instead was a representation of gods wonders.
christianity had nothing to fear from darwinian evolution or modern science he argued for liberal christianity saves us from the necessity of apologizing for immature states in the development of the biblical revelation fosdicks liberalism he was an outspoken critic of racism and social injustice outraged fundamentalists who launched an effort to try him for heresy.
fosdick decided to resign instead.
among national leaders however only the great commoner william jennings bryan the former democratic congressman secretary of state and three time presidential candidate had the support prestige and eloquence to transform fundamentalism into a popular crusade.
bryan was a strange bird a liberal progressive and pacifist populist in politics and a right wing religious crusader.
he remained a firm believer in the literal truth of the bible.
bryan backed new state laws banning the teaching of evolution in public schools.
he condemned darwins theory of evolution which suggested that human beings over millions of years had evolved from monkeys and apes reactionary conservatism and immigration restriction 1069 with the same passion he had once directed against republican presidential candidates.
the scopes trial during the 1920s anti evolution bills were introduced in numerous state legislatures but the only victories came in the s outh and there were few of those.
miriam ma ferguson the first woman governor of texas her husband pa ferguson had earlier been impeached as governor outlawed school textbooks that included sections on darwinism.
i am a christian mother who believes that jesus christ died to save humanity she declared and i am not going to let that kind of rot go into texas schoolbooks the dramatic highpoint of the fundamentalist war on darwinism came not in texas but in tennessee where in 1925 the legislature outlawed the teaching of evolution in public schools and colleges.
in the mining town of dayton in eastern tennessee civic leaders eager to create publicity for their depressed economy persuaded john t scopes a t wenty four year old substitute high school science teacher to become a test case against the new law.
he was arrested for teaching darwins theory of evolution.
the scopes trial did indeed bring worldwide publicity to dayton but not the kind town leaders had hoped for.
before the start of the twelve day trial on july 10 1925 the sweltering streets of dayton overflowed with evangelists atheists hot dog and soda pop peddlers and some 200 newspaper and radio reporters.
main street merchants festooned their shop windows with pictures of apes and monkeys lampooning darwinian evolution.
one store urged visitors dont monkey around when you come to dayton come to us a man tattooed with bible verses preached on a street corner while a live monkey was paraded about town.
the two warriors pitting science against fundamentalism were both national celebrities bryan who had offered his services to the prosecution and chicagoan clarence darrow the nations most famous defense attorney a tireless defender of the rights of the working class who had volunteered to defend scopes and evolution.
bryan insisted that the trial was about a states right to determine what was taught in the public schools.
it was a contest between evolution and christianity a duel to the death darrow who viewed the law as a blood sport countered scopes is not on trial.
civilization is on trial his goal was to prevent bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the united states by proving that america was founded on liberty and not on narrow mean intolerable and brainless prejudice of soulless religio maniacs on july 20 the seventh day of the trial the defense called bryan as an expert witness on biblical interpretation.
darrow began by asking him about 1070 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties monkey trial in this snapshot of the courtroom scopes far left clasps his face in his hands and listens to one of his attorneys second from right.
darrow far right too listens on visibly affected by the sweltering weather.
biblical stories.
did he believe that jonah was swallowed by a whale and that joshua made the sun stand still.
yes bryan replied.
all things were possible with god.
darrow pressed on relentlessly even cruelly.
what about the great flood and noahs ark.
was eve really created from adams rib.
bryan hesitated and fumbled to reply.
the crowd grew uneasy as the hero of fundamentalism crumpled in the heat.
bryan appealed to the judge for relief claiming that the bible was not on trial only to have darrow yell i am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent christian on earth believes a humiliated bryan claimed that darrow was insulting christians.
darrow his thumbs clasping his colorful suspenders shot back you insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion at one point darrow and bryan their patience exhausted lunged at each other prompting the judge to adjourn court.
as the trial ended the judge said that the only question for the jury was whether john t scopes had taught evolution and no one had denied that he had done so.
the jurors did not even sit down before deciding in nine minutes that scopes was guilty.
but the tennessee supreme court while upholding reactionary conservatism and immigration restriction 1071 the a nti evolution law waived scopess 100 fine on a technicality.
both sides claimed victory.
five days after the trial ended bryan still in dayton died in his sleep at age sixty five.
scopes left dayton to study geology at the university of chicago he became a petroleum engineer.
for all of its comic aspects the scopes trial symbolized the waning of an old order in america and the rise of a modern outlook more pluralistic diverse and skeptical more tolerant of controversial ideas and less obsessed with intellectual control.
still the debate between fundamentalism and modernism continues today.
prohibition william jennings bryan died knowing that one of his crusades had succeeded the distribution of alcoholic beverages had been outlawed nationwide.
the movement to prohibit the sale of beer wine and liquor forged an unusual alliance between rural and s mall town protestants and urban political progressives between believers in old time religion who opposed drinking as sinful and progressive social reformers mostly women who were convinced that prohibition would reduce prostitution and alcohol related violence.
what connected the two groups were the ethnic and social prejudices that many members shared.
the head of the anti saloon league for example declared that german americans eat like gluttons and drink like swine for many anti alcohol crusaders in fact the primary goal of prohibition seemed to be policing the behavior of the f oreign born the working class and the poor just as fundamentalists sought to enforce their religious beliefs on others.
during the great war the need to use grain for food rather than for making booze combined with a grassroots backlash against beer brewers because of their german background also transformed the cause of prohibition into a virtual test of american patriotism.
on december 18 1917 congress sent to the states the eighteenth amendment.
ratified on january 16 1919 it banned the manufacture sale and transportation of intoxicating liquors effective one year later.
the popular christian evangelist billy sunday who described himself as a temperance republican down to my toes told the 10 000 people gathered at his tabernacle to celebrate the outlawing of booze that the age of righteousness was at hand men will walk upright now women will smile and the children will laugh as the most ambitious social reform ever attempted in the united states however prohibition proved to be a colossal and costly failure.
it did not suddenly persuade people to quit drinking.
instead it compelled millions to 1072 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties reak or stretch the law.
in 1923 a federal agent said it would take a visitor b in any city less than thirty minutes to find a drink.
in new orleans he added it would only take thirty five seconds.
the national prohibition act of 1919 commonly called the volstead act outlined the rules and regulations needed to enforce the eighteenth amendment.
it had so many loopholes that it virtually guaranteed failure however.
technically it never said that drinking alcohol was illegal only the manufacture distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages.
in addition individuals and organizations were allowed to keep and drink any liquor owned on january 16 1919.
not surprisingly people stocked up before the law took effect.
farmers were allowed to preserve their fruits through the process of fermenting them which resulted in barns stockpiled with hard cider and homemade wine.
so called medicinal liquor was also still allowed which meant that physicians and even veterinarians wrote numerous prescriptions for medicinal brands such as old grand dad and jim beam whiskies.
thousands of people set up home breweries to make their own beer producing 700 million gallons in 1929 alone.
wine was made just as easily and bathtub gin was the easiest of all requiring little more than a one gallon still and some fruit grain or potatoes.
liquor crossed the nations 18 700 mile long borders more easily than people did.
two thirds of the illegal liquor came from canada most of the rest from mexico or overseas.
the new law was too sweeping to enforce and too inconveniencing for most americans to respect.
it also had unexpected consequences.
the loss of liquor taxes cost the federal government 10 percent of its annual revenue and the closing of breweries distilleries and saloons eliminated thousands of jobs.
an even greater weakness of prohibition was that congress never supplied adequate funding to enforce it.
given the public thirst for alcohol and the profits to be made in making and selling it illegally bootlegging it would have taken armies of agents to police the nation and jail cells would have overflowed with violators.
new yorks mayor said it would take 250 000 policemen to enforce prohibition in his city alone.
in w orking class and e thnic rich detroit the bootleg industry was second in size only to the auto industry.
moreover a huge number of prominent americans regularly broke the law.
president warren g harding drank and served bootleg liquor in the white house explaining that he was unable to see this as a great moral issue and the largest bootlegger in washington d c reported that a majority of both houses of congress were regular customers.
reactionary conservatism and immigration restriction 1073 the efforts to defy prohibition generated widespread police corruption and boosted organized crime.
many of the activities and images associated with the roaring twenties were fueled by bootleg liquor supplied by crime syndicates and sold in speakeasies which local policemen often ignored in exchange for bribes.
w ell organized crime syndicates behaved like giant corporations they controlled the entire stream of liquors production pricing all fair in drink and war torpedoes distribution and sales.
as a result the filled with malt whiskey were discovered prohibition era was a f ourteen year in the new york harbor in 1926 an orgy of unparalleled criminal activity.
elaborate attempt by bootleggers to by 1930 more than o ne third of amer smuggle alcohol during prohibition.
each torpedo had an air compartment icans in federal prison were prohibition so it could be floated to shore.
although total national alcohol consumption did decrease during the twenties as did the number of deaths from alcohol abuse in many cities drinking actually increased during prohibition.
new york citys police commissioner estimated that there were 32 000 speakeasies in the city in 1929.
there had been only 15 000 saloons when prohibition started.
as the popular humorist will rogers quipped prohibition is better than no liquor at all prohibition supplied organized crime with a source of enormous new income.
the most famous prohibition era gangster was alphonse scarface capone.
in 1927 his c hicago based bootlegging prostitution and gambling empire brought him an annual income of 60 million and involved an army of 700 gangsters involved in 300 murders none solved.
capone was a larger than life hero to many.
he gave huge tips to waiters and hatcheck girls and provided a soup kitchen for chicagos poorest residents.
when criticized he claimed to be providing the public with the goods and services it demanded some call it bootlegging.
some call it racketeering.
i call it business.
they say i violate the prohibition law.
who doesnt capone neglected to add that he had also beaten to death several police officers ordered the execution of dozens of rivals and bribed mayors judges and policemen.
law enforcement officials led by fbi agent eliot ness began to smash capones bootlegging operations in 1929.
in the 1074 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties end he was tried and convicted on charges of tax evasion and sentenced to eleven years in prison.
a republican resurgence in national politics the s mall town backlash against the immorality of modern city l ife whether represented by fears of immigrant radicals plotting revolution liberal churches not taking the bible literally or jazzed up flappers swilling cocktails was mirrored by a republican resurgence determined to reverse the progressivism of theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson.
progressivism lost its energies for several reasons.
for one thing its leaders were no more.
roosevelt died in 1919 at the age of sixty just as he was beginning to campaign for the 1920 republican presidential nomination.
wilson too had envisioned an unprecedented third term but a stroke forced him to finish out his second term broken physically and mentally.
many americans preferred other candidates anyway.
organized labor resented the wilson administrations crackdown on striking workers in 1919 1920.
farmers in the great plains and the west thought that wartime price controls on commodities had discriminated against them.
liberal intellectuals became disillusioned with grassroots democracy because of popular support for prohibition the ku klux klan and religious fundamentalism.
by 1920 middle class voters had become preoccupied with restoring a new era of prosperity based on mass production and mass consumption.
finally the public turned away from progressivism in part because it had accomplished its major goals the eighteenth amendment 1919 which outlawed alcoholic beverages and the nineteenth amendment 1920 which allowed women nationwide to vote.
progressivism did not disappear in the 1920s however.
progressive republicans and democrats dominated key leadership positions in congress during much of the decade even while conservative republicans occupied the white house.
the progressive impulse for honest efficient government and regulation of business remained strong especially at the state and local levels where efforts to improve public education public health and s ocial welfare programs gained momentum during the decade.
at the national level however conservative republicans returned to power.
harding and normalcy after the great war and the furious debate over the league of nations most americans were weary of woodrow wilsons crusading idealism.
wilson himself recognized the shifting public a republican resurgence 1075 mood.
it is only once in a generation he remarked that a people can be lifted above material things.
that is why conservative government is in the saddle two thirds of the time in 1920 republican leaders turned to a likeable mediocrity as their presidential candidate warren g harding a dapper s ilver haired u s senator from ohio.
harding was selected not for his abilities or experience which were minimal but because he was from a key state and looked presidential.
harding set the conservative tone of his campaign when he told a boston audience that it was time to end wilsons progressivism and internationalism america did not need heroics but healing not nostrums but normalcy not revolution but restoration not agitation but adjustment not surgery but serenity not the dramatic but the dispassionate harding pledged to safeguard america first.
to exalt america first to live for and revere america first the democrats were initially encouraged by the republicans decision to nominate harding but they also had to find a candidate of their own.
at their convention the divided delegates finally chose another ohioan james cox a former newspaper publisher and three term governor of the state.
for vice president the convention chose new yorker franklin delano roosevelt only thirty eight years old who as assistant secretary of the navy occupied the same position his republican cousin theodore roosevelt had once held.
handsome vigorous and a stirring speaker he would deliver more than 1 000 speeches during the campaign.
but coxs campaign was disorganized and underfunded and the democrats struggled against the conservative postwar mood.
in the words of progressive journalist william allen white americans were tired of issues sick at heart of ideals and weary of being noble the republicans took the offensive blaming wilson and the democrats for the nations troubles.
harding won big getting 16 million votes to 9 million for cox who carried no state outside the solid south.
it wasnt a landslide a democratic organizer contended.
it was an earthquake the lopsided victory increased the republican majority in both houses of congress.
franklin roosevelt predicted that his party could not hope to return to power until the republicans led the nation into a serious period of depression and unemployment he was right.
just a plain fellow hardings vanilla promise of a return to normalcy reflected his unexceptional background and limited abilities.
one of his own speechwriters admitted that his boss was both indolent and ignorant of most of the big questions that would confront him a farmers 1076 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties the ohio gang president warren g harding third from right surrounded himself with a network of friends often appointing them to public office despite inferior qualifications.
son and newspaper editor harding described himself as just a plain fellow who was old fashioned and even reactionary in matters of faith and morals and had pledged total abstinence from alcohol.
in fact however harding was a h ell raiser.
he drank outlawed liquor in the white house smoked and chewed tobacco hosted twice weekly poker games and had numerous extramarital affairs and even fathered children with women other than his domineering wife florence harding whom he called the duchess his dalliances brought him much grief.
one of the women blackmailed him demanding money for her silence which she received.
the public was virtually unaware of hardings escapades.
voters saw him as a handsome charming politician who looked the part of a leader.
yet harding privately worried about his own limitations.
i am not fit for this office and should never have been here he once admitted.
i cannot hope to be one of the great presidents but perhaps i may be remembered as one of the best loved tart tongued alice roosevelt longworth daughter of theodore roosevelt said harding was not a bad man.
he was just a slob a republican resurgence 1077 harding in office had much in common with ulysses s grant.
his cabinet like grants mixed some of the best minds in the party whom he had promised to seek out with a few of the worst.
charles evans hughes like grants hamilton fish became a distinguished secretary of state.
herbert hoover in the commerce department andrew w mellon in the treasury department and henry c wallace in the agriculture department functioned efficiently and made policy on their own.
other cabinet members and administrative appointees however were not so conscientious.
the secretary of the interior landed in prison and the attorney general narrowly escaped serving time.
many lesser offices went to members of the ohio gang a group of hardings drinking buddies who met in a house on k street near the white house to help the president relieve the pressures of his high office.
harding and his lieutenants set about dismantling or neutralizing many progressive regulatory laws and agencies.
the presidents four supreme court appointments were all conservatives including chief justice william howard taft who announced that he had been appointed to reverse a few decisions during the 1920s the taft led court struck down a federal child labor law and a minimum wage law for women issued numerous injunctions against striking unions and passed rulings limiting the powers of federal agencies that regulated big businesses.
andrew mellon and the economy the harding administration inherited a slumping economy burdened by high wartime taxes and a national debt that had ballooned from 1 billion in 1914 to 27 billion in 1920 because of the expenses associated with the war.
unemployment was at nearly 12 percent.
to generate economic growth secretary of the treasury andrew mellon at the time the t hird richest man in the world behind john d rockefeller and henry ford developed what came to be called the mellon plan which called for reducing federal spending and lowering tax rates.
mellon persuaded congress to pass the landmark budget and accounting act of 1921 which created a bureau of the budget to streamline the process of preparing an annual federal budget to be approved by congress.
the bill also created a general accounting office to audit spending by federal agencies.
this act fulfilled a long held progressive desire to bring greater efficiency and nonpartisanship to the budget preparation process.
the brilliant but cold mellon his son described him as a thin voiced thin bodied shy and uncommunicative man also proposed a series of tax reductions.
by 1918 the tax rate on the highest income bracket had risen to 73 percent.
mellon believed that such high rates were pushing wealthy amer 1078 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties icans to avoid paying taxes by investing their money in foreign countries or in tax free government bonds.
his policies systematically reduced tax rates while increasing tax revenues.
the top tax rate was cut from 73 percent in 1921 to 24 percent in 1929.
rates for individuals with the lowest annual incomes were also cut substantially helping the working poor.
by 1926 those with incomes of 300 000 or more were the source of 65 percent of federal income tax revenue.
in 1921 less than 20 percent had come from this group.
during this same period the overall tax burden on those with incomes of less than 10 000 dropped from 155 million to 32 5 million.
by 1929 barely 2 percent of american workers had to pay any income tax at all.
at the same time mellon helped harding reduce the federal budget from its wartime highs.
government expenditures fell as did the national debt and the economy soared.
unemployment plummeted to 2 4 percent in 1923.
mellons supporters labeled him the greatest secretary of the treasury since alexander hamilton in the late eighteenth century.
in addition to tax cuts mellon who had earlier built huge empires in the steel oil shipbuilding coal banking and aluminum industries promoted the l ong standing republican policy of high tariffs on imported goods.
the fordney mccumber tariff of 1922 increased rates on imported chemical and metal products to help prevent the revival of german corporations that had dominated those industries before the great war.
to please commercial farmers the new act included tariffs on agricultural imports as well.
reduced regulation the republican economic program also sought to dismantle or neutralize many progressive regulatory laws and agencies.
harding appointed commissioners to these federal agencies who would promote regulatory capitalism and policies friendly to business interests.
the prominent republican senator henry cabot lodge who helped guide hardings choice of men to lead the regulatory agencies boasted that we have torn up wilsonism by the roots racial progressivism in one area however warren g harding proved to be more progressive than woodrow wilson.
he reversed the wilson administrations segregationist policy of excluding african americans from federal government jobs.
he also spoke out against the vigilante racism that had flared up across the country during and after the war.
in his first speech to a joint session of congress in 1921 harding insisted that the nation must deal with the festering race question the horrific racial incidents were a stain on americas democratic ideals.
the new president unlike his democratic predecessor attacked the ku klux klan for fomenting hatred and prejudice and a republican resurgence 1079 violence and he urged congress to wipe the stain of barbaric lynching from the banners of a free and orderly representative democracy the senate however failed to pass the bill harding promoted.
setbacks for unions urban workers shared in the affluence of the 1920s.
a workman is far better paid in america than anywhere else in the world a french visitor wrote in 1927 and his standard of living is enormously higher nonfarm workers gained about 30 percent in real wages between 1921 and 1928 while farm income rose only 10 percent.
yet organized labor suffered in the 1920s.
although president harding endorsed collective bargaining and tried to reduce the t welve hour workday and the s ix day workweek to give the working class time for leisure and family life he ran into stiff opposition in congress.
the widespread strikes of 1919 had created fears that unions promoted radical socialism.
between january 1920 and august 1921 the unemployment rate jumped from 2 percent to 14 percent and industrial production fell by 23 percent as the gastonia strike these textile workers pit their strength against that of a national guardsman during a strike at the loray mill in gastonia north carolina in 1929.
1080 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties the economy made the transition from war to peace.
the brief postwar depression so weakened the unions that in 1921 business groups in chicago designated the open shop to be the american plan of employment.
unlike the closed shop which forced businesses to hire only union members the open shop gave an employer the right to hire anyone.
a labor organizer identified another reason for the weakness of unions in the new era the ford car has done an awful lot of harm to the unions.
as long as men have enough money to buy a s econd hand ford and tires and gasoline theyll be out on the road and paying no attention to union meetings employers often required workers to sign yellow dog contracts which forced them to agree not to join a union.
owners also used labor spies blacklists and intimidation to block unions.
some employers such as henry ford tried to kill the unions with kindness by introducing programs of industrial democracy guided by company sponsored unions or various schemes of welfare capitalism such as profit sharing bonuses pensions health programs and recreational activities.
the result was that union membership dropped from about 5 million in 1920 to 3 5 million in 1929 as industrial production soared and joblessness fell to 3 percent.
but the a nti union effort led by businesses that wanted to keep wages low and unions weak helped to create a purchasing power crisis whereby the working poor were not earning enough income to buy the abundance of goods being churned out by ever m ore productive industries.
productivity increased by 43 percent in the roaring twenties but wages barely rose.
in fact large groups of hourly workers such as miners and textile mill hands saw their income drop.
executives used company profits to pay dividends to stockholders invest in new equipment and increase their own salaries while doing little to help wage earners.
in 1929 an estimated 5 percent of the nations workforce executives received one third of the nations income.
in other words the m uch trumpeted new economy was not benefiting enough working class americans to be sustainable.
the gap between income levels and purchasing power would be a major cause of the great depression as the republican formula of high tariffs low wages low taxes little regulation and anti unionism would eventually implode.
isolationism in foreign affairs in addition to the senates rejection of american membership in the league of nations the postwar spirit of isolation found other expressions.
george jean nathan a drama critic expressed the sentiments of many americans when he announced that the great problems of the world social political economic a republican resurgence 1081 and theological do not concern me in the slightest.
what concerns me alone is myself and the interests of a few close friends yet the desire to stay out of foreign wars did not mean that the united states could ignore its expanding global interests.
as a result of the great war the united states had become the worlds chief banker and american investments and loans enabled foreigners to purchase u s exports.
war debts and reparations probably nothing did more to heighten americas isolationism from foreign affairs and anti american feelings among e uropeans than the complex issue of paying off huge war debts during the 1920s.
in 1917 when france and great britain ran out of money to pay for military supplies during the first world war the u s government had advanced them massive loans first for the war effort and then for postwar reconstruction projects.
most americans including andrew w mellon expected the w ar related debts to be paid back but europeans had a different perception.
the european allies had held off the german army at great cost while the united states was raising an army in 1917.
the british also noted that after the american revolution the newly independent united states had repudiated old debts to british investors the french likewise pointed out that they had never been repaid for helping the americans win the revolution and gain their independence.
but the most difficult challenges in the 1920s were the practical problems of repayment.
to get u s dollars to use to pay their w ar related debts european nations had to sell their goods to the united states.
however soaring american tariff rates during the 1920s made imported european goods more expensive and the war related debts incurred by britain and france harder to pay.
the french and the british insisted that they could repay their debts to the united states only if they could collect the 33 billion in reparations owed them by defeated germany.
that was an unrealistic assumption because the german economy was in a shambles during the 1920s ravaged by runaway inflation.
twice during the 1920s the financial strain on germany brought the structure of international payments to the verge of collapse and both times the international reparations commission called in private american bankers to work out rescue plans.
loans provided by u s banks thus propped up the german economy so that germany could pay its reparations to britain and france thereby enabling them to pay their debts to the united states.
attempts at disarmament after the great war many americans decided that the best way to keep the peace was to limit the size of armies and navies.
the united states had no intention of maintaining a large army 1082 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties after 1920 but under the shipbuilding program begun in 1916 it had constructed a powerful navy second only to that of great britain.
although neither the british nor the americans wanted a naval armaments race both were worried about the growth of japanese power.
to address the problem president harding in 1921 invited diplomats from eight nations to a peace conference in washington d c at which secretary of state charles evans hughes made a blockbuster proposal.
the only way out of an expensive naval arms race he declared is to end it now by eliminating scores of existing warships.
he pledged that america would junk 30 battleships and cruisers and then named 36 british and japanese warships that would also be destroyed.
it was one of the most dramatic moments in diplomatic history.
the stunned audience of diplomats ambassadors admirals and senators stood and roared its approval.
in less than fifteen minutes one journalist reported hughes had destroyed more warships than all the admirals of the world have sunk in a cycle of centuries following hughess lead delegates from the united states britain japan france and italy signed the five power treaty 1922 which limited the size of their navies.
it was the first disarmament treaty in history.
the agreement also in effect divided the world into regions u s naval power became supreme in the western hemisphere japanese power in the western pacific and british power from the north sea to singapore.
the kellogg briand pact during and after the great war many americans embraced the fanciful ideal of simply abolishing war with a stroke of a pen.
in 1921 a wealthy chicagoan founded the american committee for the outlawry of war.
we can outlaw this war system just as we outlawed slavery and the saloon said one of the more enthusiastic converts.
the seductive notion of simply abolishing war culminated in the signing of the kellogg briand pact.
this unique treaty started with an initiative by the french foreign minister aristide briand who in 1927 proposed to secretary of state frank b kellogg that the two countries agree never to go to war against each other.
this innocent seeming proposal was actually a clever ploy to draw the united states into the french security system by the back door.
in any future war for instance such a pact would inhibit the united states from seeking reprisals in response to any french intrusions on neutral rights.
kellogg was outraged to discover that briand had urged leaders of the american peace movement to put pressure on the government to sign the accord.
kellogg then turned the tables on briand.
he countered with a plan to have all nations sign the pact.
caught in a trap of his own making the french a republican resurgence 1083 foreign minister finally agreed.
the pact of paris its official name signed on august 27 1928 declared that the signatories renounce it war as an instrument of national policy eventually s ixty two nations signed the pact but all reserved the right of self defense as an escape hatch.
the u s senate ratified the agreement by a vote of 85 to 1.
one senator who voted for this worthless but perfectly harmless peace treaty wrote a friend later that he feared it would confuse the minds of many good people who think that peace may be secured by polite professions of neighborly and brotherly love the world court the isolationist mood in the united states was no better illustrated than in the repeated refusal by the senate during the 1920s to approve american membership in the world court formally called the permanent court of international justice at the hague in the netherlands.
created in 1921 by the league of nations the world court composed of fifteen international judges was intended to arbitrate disputes between nations.
presidents harding coolidge and hoover all asked the senate during the 1920s to approve american membership in the world court but the legislative body refused for the same reasons that the senate had refused to sign the versailles treaty they did not want the united states to be bound in any way by an international organization.
improving relations in latin america the isolationist attitude during the 1920s led the decades republican presidents harding calvin coolidge and herbert h oover to soothe tensions with americas neighbors to the south most of which harbored long festering resentments against yankee imperialism the harding administration agreed in 1921 to pay the republic of colombia the 25 million it had demanded for americas rights to the panama canal.
in 1924 american troops left the dominican republic after eight years of intervention.
u s marines left nicaragua in 1925 but returned a year later at the outbreak of disorder and civil war.
there in 1927 the coolidge administration brought both parties into an agreement for u s supervised elections but one rebel leader csar augusto sandino held out and the marines stayed until 1933.
the troubles in nicaragua increased strains between the united states and mexico.
relations had already been soured by repeated mexican threats to expropriate american oil properties in mexico.
in 1928 however the u s ambassador negotiated an agreement protecting american rights acquired before 1917.
expropriation did in fact occur in 1938 but the mexican government agreed to reimburse american owners.
1084 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties teapot dome scandal in this 1924 political cartoon republican officials try to outrun the teapot dome scandal represented by a giant steamrolling teapot on an o il slicked highway.
the harding scandals as time passed president harding found himself increasingly distracted by scandals in his administration.
early in 1923 the head of the veterans bureau resigned when faced with an investigation for stealing medical and hospital supplies intended for former servicemen.
a few weeks later the legal adviser to the bureau killed himself.
soon thereafter jesse smith a colleague of attorney general harry m daugherty who was illegally selling federal paroles pardons and judgeships from his justice department office was found shot dead in a hotel room after he had threatened to quit the racket then daugherty himself was accused of selling for personal gain german assets seized after the war.
when asked to testify about the matter he refused on the grounds that doing so might incriminate him.
the most serious of the scandals was called the teapot dome affair the teapot dome was a g overnment owned oil field in wyoming that p rovided a republican resurgence 1085 reserve fuel for warships.
after harding moved administrative control of the oil field from the department of the navy to the department of the interior secretary of the interior albert b.
fall deeply in debt and eight years overdue in paying his taxes began signing overly generous federal contracts with close friends who were executives of petroleum companies that wanted access to the oil.
in doing so fall took bribes of about 400 000 from an oil tycoon.
fall was convicted of conspiracy and bribery and sentenced to a year in prison the first former cabinet official to serve time because of misconduct in office.
how much harding knew of the scandals remains unclear but he knew enough to be troubled.
my god this is a hell of a job he confided to a journalist.
i have no trouble with my enemies i can take care of my enemies all right.
but my damn friends my god damn friends.
theyre the ones that keep me walking the floor nights in 1923 harding left on what would be his last journey a speaking tour to the west coast and a trip to the alaska territory.
along the way he discussed with herbert hoover the secretary of commerce what he should do about the scandal involving albert fall.
hoover gave the correct response publish it and at least get credit for integrity on your side before harding had time to act on such advice he suffered an attack of food poisoning in seattle then seemed to be recovering only to die in san francisco.
he was fifty seven years old.
largely as a result of hardings corrupt associates his administration came to be viewed as one of the worst in history.
even hoover admitted that harding was not a man with either the experience or the intellectual quality that the position needed and that he was unable to admit or resolve the terrible corruption by his playmates more recent assessments however suggest that the scandals obscured hardings accomplishments.
he led the nation out of the turmoil of the postwar years and helped create the economic boom of the 1920s.
he endorsed diversity and civil rights and was a forceful proponent of womens rights.
still even hardings foremost scholarly defender admits that he lacked good judgment and probably should never have been president coolidge conservatism the news of hardings death reached vice president calvin coolidge when he was visiting his father in the isolated village of plymouth notch vermont his birthplace.
there at 2 47 a m on august 3 1923 colonel john coolidge a farmer and merchant issued the presidential oath of office to his son.
calvin coolidge born on the fourth of july in 1872 was a throwback to an earlier era.
a puritan in his personal life he was horrified by the j azzed up 1086 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties roaring twenties.
he sincerely believed in the ideals of personal integrity and devotion to public service and like harding he was an evangelist for capitalism and minimal government regulation of business.
an inactive president although coolidge had won every political race he had entered beginning in 1898 he had never loved the limelight.
shy and awkward he was a man of famously few words hence his nickname silent cal voters liked his uprightness his straight talking style and his personal humility.
he was a simple direct man of strong principles and intense patriotism who championed self discipline and hard work.
alice roosevelt longworth said the atmosphere in the coolidge white house compared to that of harding was as different as a new england front parlor is from the back room in a speak easy coolidge she quipped looked like he had been weaned on a pickle as a state senator in massachusetts coolidge had often aligned himself with republican progressives.
he voted for womens suffrage a state income tax a minimum wage for female workers and salary increases for public school teachers.
by the time he entered the white house however he had abandoned most of those causes.
coolidge was determined not to be an activist president.
walter lippmann the foremost political journalist of the twenties wryly observed that it is a grim determined alert inactivity which keeps mr coolidge occupied constantly to coolidge activist presidents created more problems than solutions.
unlike theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson he knew he was not a great man nor did he have an ambitious program to push through congress.
four fifths of our troubles coolidge believed would disappear if we would sit down and keep still following his own logic he insisted on twelve hours of sleep and a calvin coolidge silent cal was so lengthy afternoon nap.
the irreverent inactive as president that when he died journalist h l mencken claimed that in 1933 american humorist dorothy coolidge slept more than any other parker remarked how could they tell president a republican resurgence 1087 evangelist for capitalism americans embraced the unflappability and unstained integrity of silent cal.
he was refreshingly simple and direct a man of strong principles intense patriotism pinched frugality and few words.
he promoted his regressive conservatism with a ruthless consistency.
even more than harding coolidge linked the nations welfare with the success of big business.
the chief business of the american people is business he preached.
the man who builds a factory builds a temple.
the man who works there worships there coolidge famously declared that wealth is the chief end of man with the help of treasury secretary mellon and republican controlled congresses coolidge continued hardings efforts to lower income tax rates.
where harding had sought to balance the interests of labor agriculture and industry he focused on promoting industrial development by limiting federal regulation of business and industry and reducing taxes.
the nation had too many laws coolidge insisted and we would be better off if we did not have any more true to his word he vetoed fifty acts of congress.
as a journalist said in a great day of y es men calvin coolidge was a no man after having dinner with the president at the white house colonel house the prominent democrat decided that he has more ability than i had given him credit for but he has little imagination and no initiative.
he will make a safe president but would not do anything brilliant or spectacular coolidge was also obsessed with reducing federal spending even to the point of issuing government workers only one pencil at a time and only after they turned in the stub of the old pencil.
his fiscal frugality and p ro business stance led the wall street journal to rejoice never before here or anywhere else has a government been so completely fused with business in filling out hardings unexpired term calvin coolidge distanced himself from the scandals of the administration by putting in charge of the prosecutions two lawyers of undoubted integrity.
a man of honesty and ability he was a good administrator who delegated well and managed republican factions adroitly.
the election of 1924 coolidge restored the dignity of the presidency while capably managing the warring republican factions.
he easily gained the partys 1924 presidential nomination.
meanwhile the democrats again fell to fighting among themselves prompting humorist will rogerss classic statement that i am a member of no organized political party.
i am a democrat the partys fractiousness reflected the ongoing divisions between urban and rural america north and south.
the nominating convention split down the middle on a proposal to express disapproval of ku klux klan bigotry.
it then took 103 ballots to decide on a 1088 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties presidential candidate former ambassador john w davis a prominent wall street lawyer from west virginia who could nearly outdo coolidge in his l imited government conservatism.
while the democrats bickered rural populists and urban progressives decided to abandon both major parties as they had done in 1912.
reorganizing the old progressive party they nominated robert m fighting bob la follette for president.
as a republican senator la follette had voted against the 1917 declaration of war against germany.
now in addition to the progressives he won the support of the socialist party and the american federation of labor.
in the 1924 election coolidge swept both the popular and the electoral votes by decisive majorities.
davis and the democrats took only the solidly democratic south and la follette carried only wisconsin his home state.
the popular vote went 15 7 million for coolidge 8 4 million for davis and 4 8 million for la f ollette the largest popular vote ever polled by a third party candidate up to that time.
coolidges big victory represented the height of postwar political conservatism.
business executives interpreted the republican victory as an endorsement of their influence on government and coolidge saw the economys surging prosperity as confirmation of his aggressive support of the interests of business.
the rise of herbert hoover during the twenties the drive for industrial efficiency which had been a prominent theme among progressives powered the wheels of mass production and consumption and became a cardinal belief of republican leaders.
herbert hoover secretary of commerce in the harding and coolidge cabinets was himself a remarkable success story.
born into an iowa farm family in 1874 orphaned at age eight and raised by quaker uncles in iowa and oregon he was a shy but industrious loner who graduated from stanford university and became a world renowned mining engineer oil tycoon financial wizard and multimillionaire before the age of forty.
his meteoric success and genius for managing difficult tasks bred in him a s elf confidence that bordered on conceit.
s hort tempered and quick to take offense hoover had to have complete control of any project he managed.
in his twenties he was already planning to be president of the united states.
a progressive conservative after applying his managerial skills to the food administration during the great war hoover served with a republican resurgence 1089 the u s delegation at the versailles peace conference.
he idolized woodrow wilson and supported american membership in the league of nations.
a young franklin roosevelt then assistant secretary of the navy was dazzled by hoover the man he would eventually defeat in the presidential election of 1932.
in 1920 roosevelt said that hoover was certainly a wonder boy and i wish we could make him president of the united states hoover however soon disappointed roosevelt by declaring himself a republican progressive conservative in a book titled american individualism 1922 hoover wrote of an ideal of service that went beyond rugged individualism to promote the greater good.
he wanted government officials to encourage business leaders to forgo cutthroat competition and engage in voluntary cooperation by forming trade associations that would share information and promote standardization and efficiency.
as secretary of commerce during the 1920s hoover transformed the small commerce department into the governments most dynamic agency.
he looked for new markets for business created a bureau of aviation to promote the new airline industry and established the federal radio commission.
the business of farming during the 1920s agriculture remained the weakest sector in the economy.
the wartime boom fed by agricultural exports lasted into 1920 before commodity prices collapsed as european agricultural production returned to prewar levels.
overproduction brought farming technology mechanization became increasingly important in early t wentieth century agriculture.
here farmers pose alongside their new equipment ca.
1090 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties lower prices for crops that persisted into 1923 and after that improvement was spotty.
a bumper cotton crop in 1926 resulted only in a price collapse and an early taste of depression in much of the south where foreclosures and bankruptcies spread.
yet the most successful farms like the most successful corporations were getting larger more efficient and more mechanized.
by 1930 about 13 percent of all farmers had tractors the proportion was even higher on the western plains.
better plows harvesters combines and other machines accompanied improved crop yields fertilizers and methods of animal breeding.
most farmers however were still struggling to survive.
they asked for political help and in 1924 senator charles l mcnary of oregon and representative gilbert n haugen of iowa introduced the first mcnary haugen bill which sought to secure equality for agriculture in the benefits of the protective tariff the proposed bill called for surplus american crops to be sold on the world market to raise prices in the home market.
the goal was to achieve parity that is to raise domestic prices so that farmers would have the same purchasing power relative to the prices they had enjoyed between 1909 and 1914 a time viewed as a golden age of american agriculture.
the mcnary haugen bill passed both houses of congress in 1927 but was vetoed by president coolidge who dismissed it as unsound and unconstitutional.
the process was repeated in 1928.
in a broader sense however mcnary haugenism did not fail.
the debates over the bill made the farm problem a national policy issue and defined it as a matter of surpluses.
moreover the evolution of the mcnary haugen plan revived the idea of a political alliance between the rural south and the west a coalition that in the next decade would have a dominant influence on national farm policy.
the 1928 election hoover versus smith on august 2 1927 while on vacation in the black hills of south dakota president coolidge suddenly announced i do not choose to run for president in 1928 his decision surprised the nation and cleared the way for hoover to win the republican nomination.
the partys platform took credit for the nations longest period of sustained prosperity the governments cost cutting debt and tax reduction and the high tariffs as vital to american agriculture as.
to manufacturing designed to protect american businesses from foreign competition.
the democratic nomination went to four term new york governor alfred e smith called the happy warrior by franklin d roosevelt in his nominating speech.
the candidates presented sharply different images hoover the successful businessman and bureaucratic manager from an iowa farm and smith a professional irish american politician from new york citys lower east a republican resurgence 1091 campaign sheet music the sheet music for the democratic nominee alfred e smith left and the republican nominee herbert hoover right drew on popular tunes and motifs of the time.
to working class democrats in northern cities smith was a hero the poor grandson of irish catholic immigrants who had worked himself up to governor of the most populous state.
his outspoken criticism of prohibition also endeared him to the irish italians and others who wanted to have a drink at a saloon.
on the other hand as the first roman catholic nominated for president by a major party a product of new yorks machine run politics and a wet on prohibition in direct opposition to his partys platform smith represented all that was opposed by southern and western rural democrats as well as most rural and s mall town republicans.
a kansas newspaper editor declared that the whole puritan civilization which has built a sturdy orderly nation is threatened by smith the ku klux klan issued a klarion kall for a krusade against him mailing thousands of postcards proclaiming that alcohol smith the catholic new yorker was the antichrist.
while hoover stayed above the fray reminding americans of their unparalleled prosperity and promising a job for every man smith was forced to deal with constant criticism.
he denounced his opponents for injecting bigotry hatred intolerance and un american sectarian division into the campaign.
1092 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties but no democrat could have beaten hoover in 1928.
the nation was prosperous and at peace and hoover seemed the best person to sustain the good times.
he was perhaps the best trained economic mind ever to run for president and he was widely viewed as the brilliant engineer who never failed on election day hoover the first quaker to be president won in a landslide with 21 million popular votes to smiths 15 million and an electoral college majority of 444 to 87.
he even penetrated the democrats solid south winning virginia north carolina tennessee florida and texas leaving smith only six deep south herbert hoover i have no fears for the future of our country hoover told the states plus massachusetts and rhode nation at his inauguration in 1929.
republicans also kept control of both houses of congress.
hidden in the results however was a glimpse of hope for democrats.
overall smiths vote total especially strong in the largest cities doubled that of john davis four years earlier.
in 1932 franklin d roosevelt would build upon that momentum to win back the presidency for the democrats.
but for now hoover was in command.
coolidge however was skeptical that hoover could sustain the good times.
he quipped that the wonder boy had offered him unsolicited advice for six years all of it bad coolidges doubts about hoovers political abilities would prove all too accurate as the new president would soon be struck by an economic earthquake that would test all of his skills and expose his weaknesses as a leader.
the causes of the great depression herbert hoovers election in 1928 boosted the hopes of investors in what had come to be called the great bull market since 1924 the prices of stock shares invested in u s companies had steadily risen.
beginning in 1927 prices soared further on wings of reckless speculation driven by a mass mania unmatched in history.
in 1919 some 317 million shares of stock changed hands in 1929 the the causes of the great depression 1093 number was more than a billion.
much of the nations total capital was sucked into the stock market.
treasury secretary andrew w mellons tax reductions had given people more money to spend or invest and much of it went into the stock market.
in some respects the stock market had become the economy.
in april 1929 hoover voiced concern about the orgy of mad speculation in the stock market and urged investors to be more cautious while privately telling his own broker to sell many of his stock holdings.
the stock market what made it so easy for hundreds of thousands of people to invest in stocks was the common practice of buying on margin that is an investor could make a small cash down payment the margin on shares of stock and borrow the rest from a stockbroker who held the stock certificates as security in case the price plummeted.
if stock prices rose as they did in 1927 1928 and most of 1929 the investor made enough profits to pay for the margin loan and reinvest the rest.
but if the stock price declined and the buyer failed to meet a margin call for cash to pay off the brokers loan the broker could sell the stock at a much lower price to cover the loan.
by august 1929 stockbrokers were lending investors more than two thirds of the face value of the stocks they were buying.
yet few people seemed concerned and stock prices kept rising.
despite the soaring stock market there were signs that the economy was weakening.
by 1927 steel production residential construction and automobile sales were slowing as was the rate of consumer spending.
by m id 1929 industrial production employment and other measures of economic activity were also declining.
still the stock market rose.
then in early september 1929 the speculative bubble burst when the stock market fell sharply.
by the middle of october world markets had gone into a steep decline.
still most investors remained upbeat.
the nations foremost economist irving fisher of yale university told investors on october 17 that stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau five days later a leading bank president assured reporters that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the stock market or with the underlying business and credit structure the crash the next week however stock market values wobbled then tumbled again triggering a wild scramble among terrified investors.
as they rushed to sell their shares the decline in stock prices accelerated.
on black tuesday october 29 the worst day in the stock markets history to that point widespread panic set in.
stock prices went into free fall and brokers found themselves flooded with stocks they could not sell.
on that day investors lost 15 billion.
by the end of the month they had lost 50 billion.
1094 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties an atmosphere of gloom settled over the financial community.
life would no longer be ever again all fun and games comedian harpo marx sighed as he anticipated the onset of the worst depression in history.
even the zany marx brothers movies during the thirties could not laugh the big bad wolf of the depression out of the public mind the carefree pleasure seeking of the jazz age ended not with a whimper but with the booming crash on wall street.
fear and uncertainty spread like a virus across the nation and the world.
wild rumors circulated of fortunes lost and careers ruined.
investors who had borrowed heavily to buy stocks were now forced to sell their holdings at huge losses so they could pay their debts.
some stockbrokers and investors committed suicide.
in new york the president of a bankrupt cigar company jumped off the ledge of a hotel and two business partners joined hands and leaped to their deaths from the ritz hotel.
room clerks in manhattan hotels began asking guests at registration if they wanted a room for jumping or sleeping.
the national economy began to sputter and stumble.
in 1930 at least 26 355 businesses shut down even more failed the following year.
the resulting slowdown in economic growth called a recession became so severe and long lasting that it came to be known as the great depression.
but the collapse of the stock market did not cause the great depression.
rather it revealed that the prosperity of the 1920s had been built on weak foundations.
the stock market crash had the added effect of creating a psychological panic that accelerated the economic decline.
frightened of losing everything people rushed to take their money out of banks and out of the stock market.
such behavior only made things worse.
by 1932 more than 9 000 banks had closed as the nations formerly robust economy experienced a shocking collapse.
why the economy collapsed what were the underlying causes of the great depression.
most scholars emphasize a combination of interrelated elements.
the economy had actually begun to fall into a recession months before the stock market crash.
put most simply the once roaring economy fell victim to overproduction and underconsumption.
during the twenties manufacturing production increased 43 percent but the purchasing power of consumers did not grow nearly as fast.
in essence the economy was producing more and more products that consumers could not afford to buy and too many people had been borrowing too much money for unproductive purposes such as speculating in the stock market.
the causes of the great depression 1095 bank run as news of the great crash spread across the world people rushed to banks to withdraw their deposits.
the line for this millbury massachusetts savings bank wraps around the building.
too many business owners had taken large profits while denying wage increases to employees.
by plowing profits into business expansion executive salaries and stock dividends rather than wage increases employers created a growing imbalance between production and consumption supply and demand.
because union membership plummeted during the twenties organized labor no longer exerted as much leverage with management over wage increases.
two thirds of families in 1929 earned less than 2 000 annually an amount said by economists to provide only basic necessities at the same time that the stock market was crashing factories were reducing production or shutting down altogether.
from 1929 to 1933 u s economic output called gross domestic product or gdp dropped almost 27 percent.
by 1932 o ne quarter of the workforce was out of work.
as the financial and industrial sectors collapsed the farm sector stagnated.
farm incomes had soared during the great war because the european nations needed american grains beef and pork.
eager to sustain their prosperity farmers took out mortgages to buy more acreage or equipment to boost output.
increasing production during the twenties however led to lower prices for grains and livestock.
to make matters worse record harvests in the summer and fall of 1929 1096 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties caused prices for corn wheat and cotton to fall precipitously pinching the income of farmers with mounting debts.
governments role government policies also contributed to the depression.
high tariffs hurt the economy by reducing foreign trade.
like most republican presidents herbert hoover supported congressional efforts to raise tariffs on imported goods to keep out foreign competition.
the s moot hawley tariff of 1930 authored by republicans reed owen smoot and willis c hawley was intended to help the farm sector by raising tariff barriers on farm products imported into the united states.
but a swarm of corporate lobbyists convinced congress to add hundreds of new imported manufactured items to the tariff bill.
more than 1 000 economists urged hoover to veto the tariff bill because its logic was flawed by trying to protect american farmers from foreign competition the bill would actually raise prices on most raw materials and consumer products.
and by reducing european imports into the united states the bill would make it much harder for france and great britain to repay their war debts.
hoover signed the bill anyway causing another steep drop in the stock market.
the smoot hawley tariff also prompted other countries to retaliate by passing tariffs of their own thereby making it more difficult for american farms and businesses to sell their products abroad.
u s exports plummeted worsening the depression.
another factor contributing to the great depression was the stance of the federal reserve board the fed the government agency that served as a central bank by managing the nations money supply and interest rates.
instead of expanding the money supply to generate growth the federal reserve did the reverse reducing the money supply out of concern for possible inflation in consumer prices.
between 1929 and 1932 the money supply shrank by a third leading almost 10 000 small banks to close and take millions of their depositors with them into bankruptcy.
the impact of europe a final cause of the depression was the chaotic state of the european economy which had never fully recovered from the great war.
during the late 1920s nations such as great britain france spain and italy slowed their purchases of american goods as their economies began slowly recovering.
meanwhile the german economy continued to flounder.
a related factor was the inability of european nations to pay their war debts to each other and to the united states.
the american government insisted that the 11 billion it had loaned the allies be repaid but great britain and france had no money.
they were forced to borrow huge sums 5 billion from u s banks which only increased their overall indebtedness.
after the stock market crash in october 1929 american banks could no longer prop up the european economies.
the human toll of the depression 1097 the federal reserves tighter monetary policy also drastically slowed the amount of american capital money going abroad.
the german economy which had grown dependent on loans from american banks was devastated as american money dried up.
then the smoot hawley tariff made it even more difficult for european nations to sell their products in the united states.
so as the european economy sputtered it dragged the american economy deeper into depression.
the human toll of the depression the depression came to be called great because its effects were so severe and long lasting.
by 1932 perhaps a quarter of the u s population could not afford housing or adequate food.
the carefree optimism of the twenties disappeared grassroots protests erupted as the depression worsened.
hungry people looted grocery stores angry mobs stopped local sheriffs from foreclosing on farms and judges were threatened at bankruptcy hearings.
some talked of revolution and radical change.
folks are restless mississippi governor theodore bilbo told reporters in 1931.
communism is gaining a foothold.
in fact im getting a little pink myself yet for all the radical talk few americans embraced communism.
there was anger and rebellion among a few recounted an iowa farmer but most people lived in helpless despair and submission unemployment and relief as the economy spiraled downward between 1930 and 1933 growing numbers of workers were fired or had their wages cut.
unemployment soared to 4 million in 1930 then 8 million in 1931 and to 12 million by 1932.
desperate unemployed city dwellers became s treet corner merchants.
some 6 000 jobless new yorkers sold apples on street corners to survive.
they could buy a crate of apples grown in the pacific northwest for 1 75.
if they sold a crate of sixty apples at a nickel apiece they could pocket 1 25.
the motto of the apple sellers was buy an apple a day and eat the depression away many struggling business executives and professionals lawyers doctors dentists accountants stockbrokers teachers nurses and engineers went without food and medical care to save money and avoid the humiliation of going on relief the sense of shame cut across class lines.

at first the poor made homeless by the depression were usually placed in almshouses also called poorhouses or workhouses.
by 1933 however the homeless overwhelmed the small number of public facilities more than 40 percent of home mortgages were in default.
people were forced to live in culverts under bridges on park benches and in doorways and police stations.
to make matters worse the poor were subject to frequent abuse and arrest.
the constitutions of fourteen states even banned paupers from voting.
millions of homeless people mostly men took to living on the road or the rails.

many struggling parents sent their children to live with relatives or friends.
some 900 000 children simply left home and joined the growing army of homeless tramps during the great depression for the first time ever more people left the united states than arrived as immigrants.
plight of working women the depression put women in a peculiar position.
by 1932 an estimated 20 percent of working women were unemployed a slightly lower percentage than men.
because women held a disproportionate number of the lowest paying jobs they were often able to keep them.
even so many women also had the added burden of keeping their families together emotionally with their husbands out of work.
magazines 1100 chapter 24 the reactionary twenties just dropping off a rsum in october 1938 the federal government opened six custodian positions and 15 000 african american women lined up overnight to turn in their applications.
pictured here is a policeman leaping over a hedge to keep the crowd under control.
published numerous articles about the challenge of maintaining households when the husband had been unmanned by losing his job.
as the depression deepened however married women in the workforce became the primary targets of layoffs.
some twenty six states passed laws prohibiting their employment.
the reasoning was that a married woman who presumably had a husband to take care of h er should not steal a job from a man supporting a family.
it was acceptable for single women to find jobs because these were usually considered womens work salesgirls beauticians schoolteachers secretaries and nurses.
the job market for african american women was even more restricted with most of them working as maids cooks or laundresses.
in a desperate attempt to create jobs for unemployed men many employers and even whole states adopted policies barring married women from employment.
for example three fourths of the public school systems across the nation during the great depression fired women teachers who the human toll of the depression 1101 got married.
as a legislator commented the working woman in d epression era america was the first orphan in the storm minorities most african americans still lived in the eleven southern states of the former confederacy where the farm dominated economy was depressed before 1929 and worsened during the great depression.
african americans in the south earned their meager livelihoods from farming as tenants and sharecroppers.
pervasive racial discrimination kept blacks out of the few labor unions in the south and consigned them to the most menial lowest paying jobs.
they also continued to be the victims of violence and intimidation.
most blacks were still excluded from voting and were segregated in public places like hotels and trains.
already living in poverty they were among the hardest hit by the depression.
as a blues song called hard times aint gone nowhere revealed hard times dont worry me i was broke when it first started out some 3 million rural blacks in the south lived in cramped cabins without electricity running water or bathrooms.
in many mills factories mines and businesses the philosophy of last hired first fired meant that the people who could least afford to be jobless were fired first.
blacks who had left the south to take factory jobs in the north were among the first to be laid off.
blacks had the highest rate of joblessness in the early years of the great depression.
at no time in the history of the negro since slavery reported the urban league has his economic and social outlook seemed so discouraging churches and other charity organizations gave aid but some refused to provide support for blacks mexicans and asians.
impoverished whites found themselves competing with local hispanics and asians for seasonal farmwork in the cotton fields or orchards of large corporate farms.
many chinese japanese and filipino farm laborers moved to cities.
mexicans who had come to the united states during the 1920s were also mostly migrant farmworkers traveling from farm to farm to work during harvest and planting seasons of different crops.
they settled in california new mexico arizona colorado texas and the midwestern states.
as economic conditions worsened government officials called for the deportation of mexican born americans to avoid the cost of providing them with public services.
by 1935 more than 500 000 mexican americans 250 000 from texas alone and their american born children were deported to mexico.
everywhere one looked in the early 1930s people were suffering.
city county and state governments quickly proved incapable of managing the spreading misery.
as americans turned to the federal government for ideas and answers herbert hoover the great engineer struggled to provide adequate responses to the unprecedented crisis of the great depression.
chapter review summary the reactionary twenties with the end of the great war a renewed surge of immigration led to a wave of nativism.
to americans who feared that many immigrants were political radicals the sacco and vanzetti case confirmed their suspicions.
nativists persuaded congress to restrict future immigration particularly from eastern and southern europe in the immigration act of 1924.
other reactionary movements reflected the feeling of many white protestants that their religion and way of life were under attack.
a revived ku klux klan promoted hatred of catholics jews immigrants communists and liberals as well as african americans.
fundamentalist protestants campaigned against teaching evolution in public schools.
their efforts culminated in the 1925 scopes trial in dayton tennessee where a high school teacher was convicted of violating a state law prohibiting the teaching of evolution.
along with progressive reformers conservative protestants also supported the nationwide prohibition of alcoholic beverages that had gone into effect in 1920 despite widespread disregard for the law and the increased criminal activity and violence associated with it.
union membership declined in the 1920s as businesses adopted new techniques such as the so called open shop to resist unions a conservative supreme court rolled back workers rights and workers themselves lost interest in organizing amid the general prosperity of the decade.
republican resurgence although the eighteenth amendment paving the way for prohibition and the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing womens right to vote marked the culmination of progressivism at the national level the movement lost much of its appeal as disillusionment with the great war and its results created a public preference for disarmament and isolationism stances reflected in the f ive power treaty of 1922.
warren g hardings landslide presidential victory in 1920 was based on his call for a return to normalcy harding and his fellow republicans including his vice president and successor calvin coolidge followed policies advocated by secretary of the treasury andrew mellon that emphasized lowering taxes and government spending as well as raising tariffs to protect domestic industries.
the plan succeeded spectacularly in reviving the economy.
harding died suddenly in 1923 soon after news broke about the teapot dome affair involving a government owned oil field in wyoming one of many incidents of corruption growing out of hardings appointments.
coolidge an austere frugal man who identified with the interests of business restored trust in the presidency and won reelection in a landslide in 1924.
in the 1928 presidential election herbert hoover secretary of commerce under harding and coolidge won a third straight decisive victory for the republicans.
the great depression the 1929 stock market crash revealed the structural flaws in the economy but it was not the only cause of the great depression 1929 1941.
during the twenties business owners did not provide adequate wage increases for workers thus preventing consumers purchasing power from keeping up with increases in production.
the nations agricultural sector also suffered from overproduction throughout the decade.
government policies such as high tariffs that helped to reduce international trade and the reduction of the nations money supply as a means of dealing with the financial panic exacerbated the emerging economic depression.
the human toll of the depression thousands of banks and businesses closed and millions of homes and jobs were lost.
by the early 1930s many people were homeless and hopeless begging on street corners and sleeping in doorways.
many state laws and business practices discouraged the employment of married women and discrimination against african americans native americans hispanics and asian americans in hiring was widespread.

t he year 1929 dawned with high hopes.
rarely had a new president entered office with greater expectations.
in fact herbert hoover a man of boundless s elf confidence was worried that people viewed him as a superman that no problem is beyond my capacity he was right to be concerned.
people did consider him a superman the man who had never failed a dedicated public servant whose engineering genius and business savvy would ensure continued prosperity.
in 1929 more americans were working than ever before and earning record levels of income.
but that was about to change.
the great depression which began at the end of 1929 brought the worst of times.
no business slump had been so deep so long or so painful.
by 1932 one of every four americans was unemployed in many large cities nearly half of the adults were out of work.
millions of others saw their working hours and wages reduced.
some 500 000 people had lost homes or farms because they could not pay their mortgages.
over 4 000 banks failed in the first two months of 1933 with more than 3 6 billion in lost deposits.
record numbers of people were out of work out of money and out of hope.

the global scope and scale of the second world war ended americas tradition of isolationism.
by 1945 the united states was the worlds most powerful nation with new international interests and global responsibilities.
the war left power vacuums in europe and asia that the soviet union and the united states sought to fill to protect their military economic and political interests.
instead of bringing peace the end of the war led to a cold war between the two former allies.
as the new yorker magazine asked if you do not know that your country is now entangled beyond recall with the rest of the world what do you know the rise of fascism in europe in 1917 woodrow wilson had led the united states into the first world war to make the world safe for democracy in fact though democracy was in retreat after 1919 while soviet communism was on the march.
so too was fascism a radical form of totalitarian government in which a dictator uses propaganda and brute force to seize control of all aspects of national life the economy the armed forces the legal and educational systems and the press.
fascism in germany and italy thrived on a violent ultranationalist patriotism and almost hysterical emotionalism built upon claims of racial superiority and the simmering resentments that grew out of defeat in the first world war.
at the same time halfway around the world the japanese government fell under the control of expansionists eager to conquer china and most of asia.
japanese leaders were convinced that they were a master race with a mission to lead a resurgent asia just as adolf hitler claimed that germanys mission as home of the supposedly superior aryan race was to dominate europe.

all political parties except the fascists were eliminated and several political opponents were murdered.
there was something darkly comical about the strutting chest thumping mussolini who claimed that my animal instincts are always right there was nothing amusing how fascist propaganda benito mussolinis ever about mussolinis german coun headquarters in romes palazzo terpart the austrian born adolf hitler.
braschi which bore an oversized hitlers remarkable transformation dur reproduction of his head.
ing the 1920s from social misfit to head of the national socialist german workers nazi party startled the world.
hitler and the nazis claimed that they represented a german aryan master race whose purity and strength were threatened by liberals jews socialists communists homosexuals gypsies and other inferior peoples.
hitler promised to make germany strong again by renouncing the versailles treaty defying the limits on its armed forces and uniting the g erman speaking people of europe into a greater german empire that would give the nation living space to expand dominate lesser races and rid the continent of jews.
hitler portrayed himself as germanys savior from the humiliation of having lost the great war and the widespread suffering caused by the great depression.
appointed chancellor on january 30 1933 five weeks before franklin roosevelt was first inaugurated hitler like mussolini was idolized by the masses of voters.
he declared himself absolute leader or fhrer became president in 1934 and supreme commander of the armed forces banned all 1154 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 adolf hitler hitler performs the nazi salute at a rally.
the giant banners triumphant music powerful oratory and expansive military parades were all designed to stir excitement and allegiance among nazis.
political parties except the nazis created a secret police force known as the gestapo and stripped people of voting rights.
there would be no more elections labor unions or strikes.
during the mid 1930s hitlers brutal nazi police state cranked up the engines of tyranny and terrorism propaganda and censorship.
two million brown shirted brawling thugs called storm troopers fanned out across the nation burning books and persecuting imprisoning and murdering communists jews gypsies and their sympathizers.
the expanding axis as the 1930s unfolded a catastrophic series of events in asia and europe sent the world hurtling toward disaster.
in 1931 1932 some 10 000 japanese troops had occupied manchuria in northeast china a territory rich in raw materials and deposits of iron ore and coal.
at the time china was fragmented by civil war between communists led by mao zedong and nationalists led by chiang k ai shek.
the japanese took advantage of chinas weakness to proclaim manchurias independence renaming it the republic of manchukuo in 1934 japan began an aggressive military buildup in anticipation of conquering all of east asia.
from isolationism to intervention 1155 the next year mussolini launched italys reconquest of ethiopia a weak nation in eastern africa that italy had controlled until 1896.
when the league of nations branded mussolini an aggressor and imposed economic sanctions on italy the racist italian leader expressed surprise that european leaders would prefer a horde of barbarian negroes in ethiopia over italy the mother of civilization in 1935 hitler in flagrant violation of the versailles treaty began rebuilding germanys armed forces.
the next year he sent 35 000 soldiers into the rhineland the demilitarized buffer zone between france and germany.
in a staged vote 99 percent of the germans living in the rhineland approved hitlers action.
the failure of france and great britain to enforce the versailles treaty convinced hitler that the western democracies were cowards and would not try to stop him from achieving his goal of german dominance.
the year 1936 also witnessed the outbreak of the spanish civil war which began when spanish troops loyal to general francisco franco with the support of the roman catholic church revolted against the fragile new republican government.
hitler and mussolini rushed troops volunteers warplanes and military and financial aid to support francos fascist insurgency.
while peace in europe was unraveling the japanese government fell under the control of aggressive militarists.
in 1937 a government official announced that the tide has turned against the liberalism and democracy that once swept over the nation on july 7 1937 japanese and chinese soldiers clashed at chinas marco polo bridge near beijing.
the incident quickly escalated into a f ull scale conflict the sino japanese war.
by december the japanese had captured the nationalist chinese capital of nanjing whereupon the undisciplined soldiers ran amok looting the city and mercilessly murdering and raping civilians.
as many as 300 000 chinese were murdered in what came to be called the rape of nanjing.
thereafter the s ino japanese war bogged down into a stalemate.
from isolationism to intervention most americans responded to the mounting crises abroad by deepening their commitment to isolationism.
in his 1933 inaugural address president roosevelt announced that he would continue to promote what he called the good neighbor policy in the western hemisphere declaring that no nation has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another true to his word roosevelt withdrew u s troops from nicaragua and haiti.
the nations deeply rooted isolationist mood was reinforced by a prominent senate inquiry into the role of bankers and businesses in the 1156 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 neutrality a 1938 cartoon shows u s foreign policy entangled by the serpent of isolationism.
merican decision to enter world war i chaired by senator gerald p nye a of north dakota the nye committee began hearings in 1934 that lasted until early 1936.
the committee concluded that weapons makers and bankers the merchants of death had spurred u s intervention in the european conflict in 1917 and were continuing to help frighten nations into military activity u s neutrality in 1935 christian century magazine declared that ninety nine americans out of a hundred would today regard as an imbecile anyone who might suggest that in the event of another european war the united states should again participate in it such widespread isolationism led president roosevelt to sign the first of several neutrality laws passed by congress to help avoid the supposed mistakes that had led the nation into the first world war.
the neutrality act of 1935 prohibited americans from selling weapons or traveling on ships owned by nations at war.
in 1936 congress revised the neutrality act by banning loans to warring nations.
roosevelt however was not so sure that the united states could or should remain neutral.
in october 1937 he delivered a speech in chicago the heart from isolationism to intervention 1157 land of isolationism in which he called for international cooperation to quarantine the aggressors who were responsible for disturbing world peace.
but his appeal fell flat.
the neutrality act of 1937 allowed roosevelt to require that nonmilitary american goods bought by warring nations be sold on a c ash and carry basis that is a nation would have to pay cash and then carry the american made goods away in its own ships.
this was intended to preserve americas profitable trade with warring nations without running the risk of being drawn into the fighting.
the axis alliance in 1937 japan joined germany and italy in establishing the r ome berlin tokyo axis alliance.
hitler and mussolini vowed to create a new order in europe while the japanese imperialists pursued their divine right to control all of east asia by creating what they called the greater east asia co prosperity sphere.
anschluss in march 1938 hitler forced the anschluss union of austria with germany.
hitlers triumphant return to his native country was greeted by p ro german crowds waving nazi flags and tossing flowers.
soon jews not wanted signs appeared in austrian cities.
a month later after arresting more than 70 000 opponents of the nazis german leaders announced that a remarkable 99 75 percent of austrian voters had approved the forced annexation.
in fact some 400 000 austrians mostly liberals and jews were prevented from voting.
again no nation stepped up to oppose hitler and soon the nazi government in austria began arresting or murdering opponents and imprisoning or exiling jews including the famed psychiatrist sigmund freud.
the munich pact 1938 hitler then threatened to annex the sudeten territory sudetenland a mountainous region in western czechoslovakia along the german border where more than 3 million ethnic germans lived.
british and french leaders repeatedly tried to appease hitler hoping that if they agreed to his demands for the sudeten territory he would stop his aggressions.
on september 30 1938 the british prime minister neville chamberlain and the french prime minister douard daladier joined mussolini and hitler in signing the notorious munich pact which transferred the sudetenland to germany.
in prague the capital the czechs listened to the official announcement of the munich pact with the excruciating sadness of people too weak to preserve their own independence.
as pawns in the chess game of european politics the 1158 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 czech people now faced a grim future.
a disgusted president roosevelt privately grumbled that britain and france had left czechoslovakia to paddle its own canoe and predicted that they would wash the blood from their judas iscariot hands hitler he had decided was a wild man a nut with an insatiable desire for a new german empire.
chamberlain claimed that the munich treaty had provided peace for our time.
peace with honor winston churchill a member of the british parliament who would become prime minister in may 1940 strongly disagreed.
in a speech to the house of commons he claimed that england has been offered a choice between war and shame.
she has chosen shame and will get war the munich pact he predicted would not end hitlers assaults.
this is only the beginning of the reckoning churchill was right.
hitler had already confided to aides that he had no intention of abiding by the munich pact.
although hitler had promised that the sudetenland would be his last territorial demand he scrapped his pledge in march 1939 when he sent german tanks and soldiers to conquer the remainder of the czech republic.
the european democracies having shrunk their armies after the great war continued to cower in the face of his ruthless behavior and seemingly unstoppable military.
after german troops seized czechoslovakia on march 15 1939 hitler announced it was the greatest day of my life jews were immediately lumped together with thieves criminals swindlers insane people and alcoholics by the end of may the nazis were filling prisons with czechs who resisted or resented the german occupation.
the rape of czechoslovakia convinced roosevelt that hitler and mussolini were madmen who respect force and force alone throughout late 1938 and 1939 roosevelt tried to convince americans as well as british and french leaders that the fascists would respond only to force not words.
he also persuaded congress to increase military spending in anticipation of a possible war.
the conquest of poland later in 1939 the insatiable hitler having decided that he had the world in my pocket turned to poland germanys eastern neighbor.
conquering poland would give the german army a clear path to invade the soviet union especially the fertile ukraine region.
to ensure that the soviets did not interfere with his plans hitler camouflaged his virulent anticommunism on august 23 1939 when he signed the nazi soviet non aggression pact with josef stalin the antifascist soviet premier.
the announcement of the treaty stunned a world that had understood fascism and communism to be enemies.
the two tyrants agreed to divide northern and eastern europe between them the germans took most of poland and the soviet union claimed a sphere of interest in estonia latvia finland from isolationism to intervention 1159 and a portion of lithuania.
just nine days later at dawn on september 1 an estimated 1 5 million german troops invaded poland from the north south and west.
hitler ordered them to kill without mercy men women and children of the polish race or language he also ordered all terminally ill patients in german hospitals killed to make room for soldiers wounded in poland.
this was the final straw for the western democracies.
having allowed austria and czechoslovakia to be seized by hitlers war machine great britain and france now did an about face.
on september 3 they honored their commitment to defend poland.
europe the worlds smallest continent was again embroiled in what would soon become another world war.
the josef stalin brutal leader of the soviet nations making up the british empire union who rose to power in the m id and commonwealth canada india 1920s after the death of vladimir lenin.
australia new zealand joined the war.
americans watched in horror as another world war erupted.
this nation declared franklin roosevelt will remain a neutral nation but i cannot ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well.
even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind or conscience sixteen days after german troops stormed across the polish border the soviet union invaded poland from the east.
pressed from all sides 700 000 poorly equipped polish soldiers surrendered after a few weeks having suffered 70 000 deaths and many more wounded.
on october 6 1939 the nazis and soviets divided poland between them.
hitlers goal was to obliterate polish civilization especially the jews and germanize the country.
for his part stalin wanted to recapture polish territory lost during the first world war.
over the next five years millions of poles were arrested deported enslaved or murdered.
in april and may 1940 the russians executed some 22 000 polish military officers to ensure that its conquered neighbor would never mount a rebellion.
in late november 1939 the soviets invaded neighboring finland leading president roosevelt to condemn their wanton disregard for law outnumbered five to one finnish troops held off the invaders for three months before being forced to negotiate a treaty that gave the soviet union a tenth of finland.
1160 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 revising the neutrality act in september 1939 president roosevelt decided that the united states must do more to stop aggressor nations.
he summoned congress into special session to revise the neutrality act.
i regret that congress passed the act the president said.
i regret equally that i signed the act after six weeks of heated debate congress passed the neutrality act of 1939 which allowed britain and france to send their ships to the united states to bring back american military supplies.
public opinion supported such measures as long as other nations did the actual fighting.
war in europe the war in europe settled into a three month stalemate during early 1940 as hitlers generals waited out the winter.
then in the early spring germany attacked again.
at dawn on april 9 nazi armies occupied denmark and landed along the norwegian coast.
german paratroopers the first ever used in warfare seized norways airports.
denmark fell in a day norway within a few weeks.
on may 10 german forces invaded the low countries belgium luxembourg and the netherlands holland.
luxembourg fell the first day the netherlands three days later.
belgium lasted until may 28.
a few days later german tanks roared into northern france.
the fight beginning today hitler declared decides the fate of the german nation for the next thousand years his brilliant blitzkrieg lightning war strategy centered on speed.
fast moving columns of tanks motorized artillery and truck borne infantry all supported by warplanes and paratroopers moved so fast that they paralyzed their stunned opponents.
british and french troops sent to help the belgians were forced to make a frantic retreat to the english channel coast with the germans in hot pursuit.
on may 26 while german panzer divisions made up of tanks and other armored vehicles followed hitlers surprising order to rest and refuel great britain was able to organize a weeklong evacuation of british and french soldiers from the beaches at dunkirk on the northern french coast near the border with belgium.
despite attacks from german warplanes some 338 000 defeated and demoralized soldiers escaped to england leaving behind vast stockpiles of vehicles weaponry and ammunition.
wars are not won by evacuations observed prime minister churchill but there was a victory inside this deliverance while the evacuation was unfolding german forces decimated the remaining french armies.
tens of thousands of panicked french refugees clogged the roads to paris.
the crumbling french war effort prompted italys dictator mussolini to declare war on france and great britain which he dismissed as the reactionary democracies of the west on june 14 1940 german soldiers marched unop from isolationism to intervention 1161 posed into paris.
eight days later french leaders surrendered whereupon the germans established a puppet fascist government in the city of vichy.
the rapid fall of france stunned the world.
in the united states complacency about the nazis turned to fear and even panic as people realized the germans could eventually assault america.
the second world war was but ten months old yet germany ruled most of western europe.
only the neutral nations of spain sweden and switzerland had avoided the nazi onslaught.
great britain now stood alone against hitlers relentless military power.
the war is won an ecstatic hitler bragged to mussolini.

first proof why did the german attack on poland begin the second world war whereas hitlers previous invasions of austria and czechoslovakia did not.
1162 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 preparing america for war as hitlers armies conquered europe the united states found itself in no condition to wage war.
after the first world war the u s army was reduced to a small force by 1939 it numbered only 175 000.
by contrast germany had almost 5 million soldiers.
in promoting military preparedness president roosevelt in may 1940 called for increasing the size of the army and producing 50 000 combat planes in 1942 a seemingly outlandish goal since germany was producing only 15 000 warplanes that year.
roosevelt also responded to winston churchills repeated requests for assistance by increasing military shipments to great britain and promising to provide all possible aid to the allies short of war churchill was focused on one strategic objective to convince coax bluff charm seduce or frighten the united states into entering the war.
the manhattan project adding to roosevelts concerns was the possibility that germany might have a secret weapon.
the famous physicist albert einstein a jewish austrian refugee from nazism had alerted roosevelt in the fall of 1939 that the germans were trying to create atomic bombs.
in june 1940 roosevelt set up the national defense research committee to coordinate military research including a top secret effort to develop an atomic b omb the manhattan project before the germans did.
almost 200 000 people worked on the manhattan project including dr j robert oppenheimer who led the team of distinguished scientists scattered among thirty seven secret facilities in thirteen states.
the battle of britain winston churchill prime minister of great britain who led the nation during the second world war.
having conquered western europe hitler began planning the invasion of great britain operation sea lion scheduled for september 1940.
the late summer brought the battle of britain as the germans first sought to destroy britains royal air force raf.
the nazis deployed some 2 500 warplanes from isolationism to intervention 1163 outnumbering the raf two to one.
never has a nation been so naked before its foes churchill admitted.
churchill became the symbol of britains determination to stop hitler.
with his bulldog face e ver present cigar and v for victory gesture he urged the british citizenry to make the war their finest hour he breathed defiance while preparing for a german invasion building fortifications laying mines digging trenches and fashioning tank traps and mobilizing the population.
the british he pledged would confront hitlers invaders with blood toil tears and sweat they would never surrender in july and august 1940 the german air force luftwaffe launched day and night bombing raids against military targets across southeast england.
the pilots in the royal air force their average age was twenty three with the benefit of radar a secret new technology fended off the german assault ultimately destroying 1 700 german warplanes.
hitler then ordered his bombers to target civilians and cities especially london in night raids designed to terrorize british civilians.
in what came to be called the blitz during september and october of 1940 the germans caused massive damage in britains major cities destroying a million homes and killing 40 000 civilians.
the last three the london blitz an aerial photograph of london set aflame by german bombing raids in 1940.
winston churchill responded we shall never surrender 1164 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 nights in london reported the u s ambassador to great britain on september 10 have been simply hell the blitz however enraged rather than demoralized the british people.
a london newspaper headline summarized the nations courage and defiant mood is that the best you can do adolf the british success in the air proved decisive for in october 1940 hitler gave up his invasion plans.
it was the first battle he had lost and it was britains finest hour.
all aid short of war during 1940 franklin roosevelt began a crucial campaign to convince americans that isolationism was impractical and even dangerous.
his phrase all aid short of war became the label for his efforts to help great britain.
the president was especially concerned about a likely german invasion of the british isles.
it is now most urgent prime minister churchill cabled roosevelt that you let us have the destroyers needed to stop such an invasion.
this is a thing to do now to address the challenge roosevelt and churchill whose mother was an american negotiated a trade on september 2 1940 called the destroyers for bases agreement by which fifty old u s warships went to the british royal navy in return for allowing the united states to build military bases on british island colonies in the caribbean.
two weeks later on september 16 1940 roosevelt pushed through a reluctant congress the first peacetime conscription military draft in american history.
the selective training and service act required all 16 million men ages twenty one to t hirty five to register for the draft at one of 6 500 local draft boards.
the minimum age was later reduced to eighteen.
a savage debate the world crisis transformed roosevelt.
having been stalemated for much of his second term by congressional opposition to the new deal he was revitalized by the need to stop nazism.
yet his efforts to aid great britain and prepare america for war outraged isolationists.
a prominent democrat remembered that the dispute between isolationists and so called interventionists was the most savage political debate during my lifetime isolationists mostly midwestern and western republicans formed the america first committee to oppose military preparedness charles lindbergh the first man to fly solo across the atlantic ocean led the isolationist effort.
to lindbergh roosevelts efforts to help britain were driven primarily by jews who owned our motion pictures our press our radio and our government lindbergh assured americans that britain was doomed they should join hands with hitler.
from isolationism to intervention 1165 roosevelts third term the isolationists sought to make the 1940 presidential campaign a debate about the war.
in june just as france was falling to germany the republicans nominated wendell l willkie of indiana a plainspoken corporate lawyer and former democrat who had voted for roosevelt in 1932.
once the campaign started willkie warned that roosevelt was a warmonger and predicted that if you re elect him you may expect war in april 1941 roosevelt responded that he had said this before but i shall say it again and again and again your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars in november 1940 roosevelt won an unprecedented third term by 27 million votes to willkies 22 million and by an even more decisive margin 449 to 82 in the electoral college.
winston churchill wrote roosevelt that he had prayed for your success and i am truly thankful for it the lend lease act once reelected roosevelt found an ingenious way to provide more military aid to britain whose cash was running out.
the lend lease members of the isolationist mothers crusade urging defeat of the l end lease program kneel in prayer in front of the capitol in washington d c.
they feared the program aiding americas allies would bring the united states into the wars in europe and asia.
1166 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 end lease act introduced in congress on january 10 1941 allowed the l president to lend or lease military equipment to any country whose defense the president deems vital to the defense of the united states it was a bold challenge to the isolationists.
as senator hiram johnson of california claimed this bill is war roosevelt responded to critics by arguing that no nation can appease the nazis.
no man can turn a tiger into a kitten by stroking it the united states he added would provide everything the british needed while doing the same for china in its war against japan all in an effort to keep americans from going to war themselves.
we must again be the great arsenal of democracy roosevelt explained.
churchill shored up the presidents efforts by announcing that britain did not need american troops to defeat hitler give us the tools and we will finish the job in early march 1941 congress approved the lend lease act.
let not the dictators of europe or asia doubt our unanimity now roosevelt declared.
between 1941 and 1945 the lend lease program would ship 50 billion worth of supplies to great britain the soviet union france china and other allied nations.
the lend lease act was roosevelts most emphatic effort to move america from isolationism to interventionism and it gave a huge boost to british morale.
churchill called it the most generous act in the history of any nation germany invades the soviet union while americans continued to debate roosevelts efforts to help great britain the european war expanded.
in the spring of 1941 german troops joined italian soldiers in libya forcing the british army in north africa to withdraw to egypt.
in april 1941 nazi forces overwhelmed yugoslavia and greece.
with hungary romania and bulgaria also part of the axis hitler controlled nearly all of europe.
but his ambition was unbounded.
on june 22 1941 without warning hitler launched operation barbarossa a shocking invasion of the soviet union his supposed ally.
hitlers objective in turning on stalin was his l ong standing obsession to destroy communism enslave the vast population of the soviet union open up new lands for german settlement and exploit russias considerable natural resources.
hitlers foolhardy decision was the defining moment of the european war.
the 3 million german soldiers sent to the soviet union would eventually be worn down and thrown back.
at first however the invasion seemed a great success as the german armies raced across the vast plains of ukraine and western russia.
entire soviet armies and cities were surrounded and destroyed.
during the second half of 1941 an estimated 3 million soviet soldiers 50 percent of from isolationism to intervention 1167 the soviet army were captured.
for four months the soviets retreated in the face of the german blitzkrieg.
during the summer of 1941 german forces surrounded leningrad now called st petersburg and began a siege of the city.
as weeks passed food and supplies became scarce.
hunger alone would kill 800 000 people.
desperate people ate cats dogs rats and even sawdust.
as the bitterly cold winter set in corpses were left to freeze in the snow.
still the soldiers and civilians held out.
leningrad became known as the city that refused to die.
by december 1941 other german armies had reached the suburbs of moscow a thousand miles east of berlin.
to american isolationists germanys invasion of russia confirmed that america should stay out of the war and let two dreadful dictatorships bleed each other to death.
roosevelt however insisted on including the soviet union in the l end lease agreement he and churchill were determined to keep the russians fighting hitler so that hitler could not concentrate on great britain.
gradually stalin slowed the nazi advance by forcing the russian people to fight or be killed by their own troops.
during the battle of moscow soviet defenders showed their pitiless resolve by executing 8 000 civilians charged with cowardice slowly the tide started to turn against the germans.
by the winter of 1941 1942 hitlers generals were learning the same bitter lesson that the russians had taught napolon and the french in 1812.
invading armies must contend not only with russias ferocious fighters and enormous population but also vast distances deep snow and subzero temperatures.
the atlantic charter by the late summer of 1941 the united states was no longer a neutral nation.
in august roosevelt and churchill drew up a joint statement of common principles known as the atlantic charter.
the agreement pledged that after the final destruction of the nazi tyranny the victors would promote certain common values the s elf determination of all peoples economic cooperation freedom of the seas and a new system of international security to be called the united nations.
within weeks eleven a nti axis nations including the soviet union had endorsed the atlantic charter.
war in the atlantic no sooner had roosevelt signed the atlantic charter than u s warships came under fire.
on september 4 1941 the greer was tracking a german submarine u boat off the coast of iceland and sharing the information with british warplanes when it was attacked.
roosevelt seized the opportunity to tell americans that the ship was the victim of an unprovoked attack.
in response he essentially began an undeclared war in the atlantic by ordering naval warships to provide protection for convoys all the way to iceland allowing them to shoot on sight any german submarines.

compare and contrast the political military alliances in the first world war with wwn64 those in the second world war.
figure m26 2 first how were the german armies able to seize most of europe so quickly.
proof six weeks later on october 17 1941 a german u boat sank the american warship kearny.
eleven sailors were killed.
the shooting has started roosevelt reported and history has recorded who fired the first shot two weeks later the destroyer reuben james was torpedoed and sunk while escorting a convoy near iceland with a loss of 115 seamen.
the sinkings spurred congress to change the 1939 neutrality act by allowing merchant vessels to be armed and to enter combat zones and the ports of nations at war belligerents.
step by step the united states had begun to engage in naval warfare against nazi germany.
still americans hoped to avoid a ll out war.
from isolationism to intervention 1169 the storm in the pacific in 1940 japan and the united states had begun a series of moves that pushed them closer to war.
convinced that they were asias leading race the japanese had forced the helpless vichy french government under german control to permit the construction of japanese airfields in french controlled indochina now cambodia laos and vietnam.
the united states responded with the export control act of july 2 1940 which authorized president roosevelt to restrict the export of military supplies and other strategic materials crucial to japan.
three weeks later on july 26 roosevelt ordered that all japanese assets in the united states be frozen and that oil shipments be stopped.
the tripartite pact on september 27 1940 the imperial japanese government signed a tripartite pact with nazi germany and fascist italy by which each pledged to declare war on any nation that attacked any of them.
roosevelt called the pact an unholy alliance designed to dominate and enslave the entire human race several weeks later the united states expanded its trade embargo against japan to include iron ore copper and brass deliberately leaving oil as the remaining bargaining chip.
without access to american products japans expansionist plans stalled more than half of its imports came from the united states.
in july 1941 japan announced that it was taking complete control of french indochina in its effort to expand the empire of the rising sun and gain access to the raw materials denied it by the united states.
roosevelt responded by restricting oil exports to japan.
he also closed the panama canal to japanese shipping and merged the filipino army with the u s army.
time magazine claimed that roosevelt was waging the first great undeclared war in u s history the attack on pearl harbor on october 16 1941 hideki tj became the japanese prime minister.

first proof a power ful fleet of japanese warships to prepare for a secret attack on the u s bases in hawaii.
the japanese naval commander admiral isoroku yamamoto knew that his country could not defeat the united states in a long war its only hope was to decide the fate of the war on the very first day by launching a fatal attack on the u s navy.
on november 5 1941 the japanese asked the roosevelt administration to end its embargo or face conflict the american secretary of state cordell hull responded on november 26 that japan must remove its troops from china from isolationism to intervention 1171 explosion of the uss shaw the destroyer exploded after being hit by japanese warplanes at pearl harbor.
the shaw was repaired shortly thereafter and went on to earn eleven battle stars in the pacific campaign.
before the united states would lift its embargo.
the japanese then ordered a fleet of warships to begin steaming toward hawaii.
by this time political and military leaders on both sides considered war inevitable.
yet hull continued to meet with japanese diplomats in washington privately dismissing them as being as crooked as a barrel of fish hooks in late november roosevelt told his war cabinet that the united states or great britain was likely to be attacked perhaps next monday he and others expected the japanese to attack singapore or the philippines.
the u s navy department sent an urgent message to its commanders in the pacific negotiations with japan.
have ceased and an aggressive move by japan is expected within the next few days roosevelt staked his desperate hope for a peaceful solution on a l ast minute message to japans emperor hirohito.
both of us roosevelt said have a sacred duty to restore traditional amity cooperation and prevent further death and destruction in the world 1172 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 by the time roosevelts message arrived japanese warplanes were already headed for u s bases in hawaii.
in the early morning of sunday december 7 1941 japanese planes began bombing the unsuspecting u s fleet at pearl harbor.
of the eight american battleships all were sunk or disabled along with eleven other ships.
japanese bombers also destroyed 180 american warplanes.
the raid which lasted less than two hours killed more than 2 400 american servicemen mostly sailors and civilians and wounded nearly 1 200 more.
at the same time that the japanese were attacking pearl harbor they were assaulting u s military facilities in the philippines and on guam and wake islands in the pacific as well as british bases in singapore hong kong and malaya.
the surprise attack actually fell short of military success in two important ways.
first the bombers ignored the maintenance facilities and oil storage tanks that supported the u s fleet without which the surviving ships might have been forced back to the west coast.
second the japanese missed the u s aircraft carriers that had left port a few days earlier.
in the naval war to come aircraft carriers not battleships would prove to be decisive.
in a larger sense the attack on pearl harbor was a spectacular miscalculation for it brought the american isolationist movement to an abrupt end.
even the japanese admiral who planned the attack had misgivings amid his officers celebrations i fear that we have only succeeded in awakening a sleeping tiger at half past noon on december 8 president roosevelt delivered his war message to congress yesterday december 7 1941 a date which will live in infamy the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of japan he asked congress to declare a state of war the senate approved the resolution t wenty five minutes after roosevelt finished speaking the house followed immediately thereafter.
three days later on december 11 germany and italy declared war on what hitler called the half judaized and the other half negrified united states.
after learning of the attack on pearl harbor hitler shouted that it is impossible for us to lose the war the separate wars in asia europe and africa had now become one global conflict.
roosevelt told the american people in a radio address that it will not only be a long war.
it will be a hard war yet he assured everyone that we are going to win and we are going to win the peace that follows arsenal of democracy waging war against germany and japan required all of americas immense industrial capacity.
on december 18 1941 congress passed the war powers act which gave the president far reaching authority to reorganize government arsenal of democracy 1173 agencies and create new ones regulate business and industry and even censor mail and other forms of communication.
with the declaration of war men between the ages of eighteen and forty five were drafted.
some 16 million men and several hundred thousand women served in the military during the war.
the average american soldier or sailor in the second world war was t wenty six years old stood five feet eight and weighed 144 pounds an inch taller and eight pounds heavier than the typical recruit in the first world war.
only one in ten had attended college and only one in four had graduated from high school.
in 1940 adolf hitler had scoffed at the idea that the united states could produce 50 000 warplanes a year claiming that america was nothing but beauty queens millionaires and hollywood his ignorance of americas industrial potential proved fatal.
by the end of 1942 u s war production had already exceeded the combined output of germany japan and italy.
at an allied planning conference in iran in 1943 josef stalin raised a glass to toast american production without which this war would have been lost the war production board created by roosevelt in 1942 directed the conversion of industries to war pro duction.
in 1941 more than 3 million automobiles were manufactured in the united states only 139 were built during the next four years as automobile plants began making huge numbers of tanks jeeps trucks and war planes.
something is happening that hitler doesnt understand announced time magazine in 1942.
it is the miracle of production in making the united states the great arsenal of democracy the roosevelt administration transformed the nations economy into the worlds most efficient military machine.
by war production board this 1942 poster 1945 the year the war ended the features caricatures of mussolini ho according to united states would be manufactur hitler and tojo w the p oster will fall on their axis if ing half of the goods produced in the americans continued their relentless world.
american factories many run production of military equipment.
ning twenty four hours a day seven 1174 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 days a week produced 300 000 warplanes 89 000 tanks 3 million machine guns and 7 million rifles.
financing the war to cover the wars huge cost more than 3 trillion in todays values congress passed the revenue act of 1942 also called the victory tax.
whereas in 1939 only about 4 million people about 5 percent of the workforce filed tax returns the new act made most workers taxpayers.
by the end of the war 90 percent of workers were paying income tax.
tax revenues covered about 45 percent of military costs from 1939 to 1946 the government borrowed the rest mostly through a massive promotional campaign that sold 185 billion worth of government war bonds which paid interest to purchasers.
by the end of the war the national debt was six times what it had been at the start.
the size of the federal government soared during the war.
more than a dozen new federal agencies were created and the number of civilian federal workers quadrupled from 1 million to 4 million.
jobs were suddenly plentiful as millions quit work to join the military.
the nations unemployment rate plummeted from 14 percent in 1940 to 2 percent in 1943.
people who had long lived on the margins of the economic system especially women were now brought into the labor force.
stubborn pockets of poverty did not disappear but for most civilians especially those who had lost their jobs and homes in the depression the war spelled a better life.
some 24 million americans moved during the war to take advantage of new job opportunities.
many headed to the west coast where shipyards and airplane factories were hiring nonstop.
economic controls the need for the united states not only to equip and feed its own military forces but also provide massive amounts of food clothing and weapons to its allies created shortages of virtually all consumer goods that caused sharp price increases.
in 1942 congress responded by authorizing the office of price administration to set price ceilings.
with prices frozen basic goods had to be allocated through rationing with coupons doled out for limited amounts of sugar coffee gasoline automobile tires and meat.
the government promoted patriotic conservation by urging every family to become a fighting unit on the home front posters featured slogans such as save your stuff to make us tough use it up wear it out make it do or do without and save your scraps to beat the japs people collected scrap metal and tin foil rubber and cardboard for military use.
households were even encouraged to save cooking fat from which glycerin could be extracted to make explosives.
arsenal of democracy 1175 businesses and workers often grumbled about the wage and price controls and on occasion the government seized industries threatened by strikes.
despite these problems the effort to stabilize wages and prices succeeded.
by the end of the war consumer prices had risen about 31 percent far better than the rise of 62 percent during the first world war.
a conservative backlash for all of the patriotism inspired by the war effort criticism of government actions such as rationing increased with each passing year.
in the 1942 congressional elections republicans gained f orty six seats in the house and nine in the senate.
during the 1940s a coalition of conservatives from both parties dismantled nonessential new deal agencies such as the work projects administration originally the works progress administration the national youth administration and the civilian conservation corps.
organized labor despite substantial gains in membership and power during the war felt the impact of the conservative trend.
in the spring of 1943 when 400 000 coal miners went on strike demanding a 2 a day wage increase conservatives in congress passed over roosevelts veto the smith connally war labor disputes act which authorized the government to seize plants and mines and keep them operating if workers went on strike.
the war at home the second world war transformed life at home as it was being fought abroad.
housewives went to work as welders and riveters and farmers joined industrial unions.
some 3 5 million rural folk from the south left farms for cities.
the federal government paid for a national day care program for young children to enable their mothers to work full time.
the dramatic changes required by the war also caused unexpected changes in many areas of social life the impact of which would last long after the wars end.
women in the war the war marked a watershed in the status of women.
during the war nearly 350 000 women served in the womens army corps wac the navys equivalent women accepted for volunteer emergency service waves the marine corps the coast guard and the army air force.
with millions of men going into military service the demand for civilian workers shook up old prejudices about gender roles.
sidney hillman appointed by roosevelt to find workers for defense plants announced that war is calling on the women of america for production skills more than 8 million women entered the civilian workforce.
to help recruit women for 1176 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 women of the workforce 1942 at the douglas aircraft company in long beach california three women assemble the tail section of a boeing b 17 flying fortress bomber.
traditionally male jobs the government launched a promotional campaign featuring the story of rosie the riveter a woman named rosina bonavita who excelled as a riveter at an airplane factory.
many men opposed the surge of women taking traditionally male jobs.
a disgruntled male legislator asked who would handle traditional household tasks if women flocked to factories who will do the cooking the washing the mending the humble homey tasks to which every woman has devoted herself who will rear and nurture the children many women however were eager to escape the grinding routines of domestic life and earn good wages.
a female welder remembered that her wartime job was the first time i had a chance to get out of the kitchen and work in industry and make a few bucks.
this was something i had never dreamed would happen african americans while president roosevelt focused on military strategy his wife eleanor focused on organizing the home front.
she insisted that the governments wartime partnership with business not neglect the needs arsenal of democracy 1177 of workers argued that america could not fight racism abroad while tolerating it at home and championed the mass influx of women into the once male work force during the war.
more than a half million african americans left the south for better opportunities during the war years and more than a million blacks nationwide joined the industrial workforce for the first time.
lured by jobs and higher wages in military related plants and factories african americans from texas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana headed west where the dramatic expansion of d efense related jobs had significant effects on the regions population.
during the war years the number of african americans rose sharply in western cities such as seattle portland and los angeles.
at the same time the war provided a boon to southern textile mills by requiring millions of military uniforms.
manufacturing jobs led thousands of bigotry at home during the detroit riots of 1943 police officers do nothing when a white thug hits a black man.
1178 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 tuskegee airmen the tuskegee airmen were the first african american military pilots.
here the first graduates are reviewed at tuskegee alabama in 1941.
dirt poor sharecroppers and tenant farmers many of them african americans to leave the land for steady work in new mills and factories.
sixty of the 100 army camps created during the war were in southern states further transforming local economies.
during the war the u s rural population decreased by 20 percent.
racial tension at home the most volatile social issue ignited by the war was african american participation in the military.
although the armed forces were still racially segregated in 1941 african americans rushed to enlist after the attack on pearl harbor.
as african american joe louis the world heavyweight boxing champion put it lots of things are wrong with america but hitler aint going to fix them altogether about a million african americans men and women served in the armed forces during the war.
arsenal of democracy 1179 black soldiers and sailors assigned to racially segregated units were initially excluded from combat units.
they loaded ships drove trucks dug latrines and handled supplies and mail.
black officers could not command white soldiers or sailors.
henry l stimson the secretary of war claimed that leadership is not embedded in the negro race military bases had segregated facilities and experienced frequent racial incidents in late 1944 however the need for more troops led the government to revisit its racial policies.
under pressure from the african american community as well as eleanor roosevelt general dwight eisenhower commander of the u s forces in europe agreed to let black volunteers fight in fi fty two all black fifty man platoons commanded by white officers.
a black officer said the decision was the greatest for african americans since enactment of the constitutional amendments following the civil war the black soldiers earned the reputation of being fierce fighters.
the same was true of some 600 african american pilots trained in tuskegee alabama.
the s o called tuskegee airmen flew more than 15 000 missions and their unquestionable excellence spurred military and civilian leaders to desegregate the armed forces after the war.
at wars end however the u s army reimposed segregation.
it would be several more years before the military was truly integrated.
mexican americans as rural dwellers moved west many farm counties experienced a labor shortage.
in an ironic a bout face local and federal authorities who before the war had forced migrant laborers back across the mexican border now recruited them to harvest crops on american farms.
the mexican government would not consent to provide the laborers however until the united states promised to ensure them decent working and living conditions.
the result was the creation of the bracero program in 1942 whereby mexico agreed to provide seasonal farmworkers on y ear long contracts.
under the bracero program some 200 000 mexican farmworkers entered the western united states mostly packed in cattle cars on trains.
at least that many more crossed the border as undocumented workers.
the rising tide of mexican americans in los angeles prompted a stream of anti mexican editorials and ugly racial incidents.
even though some 300 000 mexican americans served in the war and earned a higher percentage of congressional medals of honor than any other minority group racial prejudices still prevailed.
in southern california there was constant conflict between white servicemen and mexican american gang members and teenage zoot suiters zoot suits were flamboyant clothing worn by some young mexican american men.
in 1943 several thousand o ff duty sailors and soldiers joined 1180 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 off to court latinos dressed in zoot suits are loaded onto a los angeles county sheriffs bus for a court appearance in june 1943 by hundreds of local whites rampaged through los angeles assaulting hispanics african americans and filipinos.
the weeklong violence came to be called the zoot suit riots native americans in the military indians supported the war effort more fully than any other group in american society.
almost a third of eligible native american men served in the armed forces.
many others worked in defense related industries and thousands of indian women volunteered as nurses or joined the waves.
as was the case with african americans indians benefited from the experiences afforded by the war by gaining vocational skills and a greater awareness of how to succeed within mainstream society.
why did so many native americans fight for a nation that had stripped them of their land and ravaged their heritage.
some felt that they had no choice.
mobilization for the war effort ended many new deal programs that had provided indians with jobs.
at the same time many viewed the nazis and japanese warlords as threats to their own homeland.
whatever their motivations indians distinguished themselves in the military.
unlike their african american counterparts indian servicemen were integrated into regular units with whites.
perhaps their most distinctive role was serving as code talkers every military branch used indians especially navajos to encode and decipher messages using indian languages unknown to the germans and japanese.
arsenal of democracy 1181 navajo code talkers the complex navajo language made it impossible for the germans and japanese to decode american messages.
here a code talker relays messages for u s marines in the battle of bougainville in the south pacific in 1943 discrimination against japanese americans the attack on pearl harbor ignited a hunger for vengeance against the nisei people of japanese descent living in the united states.
many americans saw no difference between the japanese who attacked pearl harbor and japanese americans.
as idahos governor declared a good solution to the jap problem would be to send them all back to japan then sink the island such hysteria helps explain why the u s government sponsored one of the worst violations of civil liberties during the twentieth century when more than 120 000 nisei were forcibly removed from their homes and transported to ten war relocation camps forced to sell their farms and businesses at great loss within forty eight hours ordered to bring with them only what they could carry the internees were sent by train and bus to ten barbed wire enclosed internment camps scattered across remote areas in the western states.
they lost not only their property but also their liberty.
president roosevelt initiated the relocation when he issued executive order 9066 on february 19 1942 authorizing the forcible removal of all 1182 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 e thnic japanese living on the pacific coast.
it was perhaps his worst decision as president.
roosevelt called his action a military necessity although not a single incident of espionage involving japanese americans was proved.
as it turned out more than 70 percent of those affected were u s citizens.
on evacuation day burt wilson a white schoolboy in sacramento california was baffled as soldiers ushered the nisei children out of his school we wondered what had happened.
they took somebody out of eighth grade a boy named sammy who drew wonderful cartoons.
he was my friend and one day he was there and the next day he was gone.
and that was very difficult for us to understand because we didnt see sammy or any japanese american at least i didn t as the enemy.
few if any nisei were disloyal.
in fact 39 000 japanese americans served in the armed forces during the war and others worked as interpreters and translators.
but all were victims of fear and racial prejudice.
not until 1983 did the government acknowledge the injustice of the internment policy.
five years later a farewell to civil rights american troops escorted japanese americans by gunpoint to remote internment camps some of which were horse racing tracks whose stables served as housing.
the allied drive toward berlin 1183 it granted those nisei still living 20 000 each in compensation a tiny amount relative to what they had lost during four years of confinement.
the allied drive toward berlin by mid 1942 the home front was hearing good news from europe.
u s naval forces had been increasingly successful at destroying german u boats off the atlantic coast.
up to that point german submarines had sunk hundreds of allied cargo vessels killing 2 500 sailors.
stopping the submarine attacks was important because the grand alliance great britain the united states and the soviet union called for the defeat of germany first.
defeating the japanese could wait.
war aims and strategy a major consideration for allied military strategy was the fighting on the vast eastern front in the soviet union.
during 1941 1942 the nazis and soviets waged colossal battles.
the soviet population by far bore the brunt of the war against the nazis leading josef stalin to insist that the americans and british relieve the pressure on his troops by attacking the germans in western europe thereby forcing hitler to pull units away from the russian front.
meanwhile with most of the german army deployed on the russian front the british and american air forces flying from bases in england would bomb military and industrial targets in german occupied western europe and especially in germany itself while american and british generals prepared plans to attack nazi troops in north africa italy and france.
franklin roosevelt and winston churchill agreed that they needed to create a second front in western europe but they could not agree on the timing or location of an invasion.
u s military planners wanted to attack the germans in france before the end of 1942.
the british however were wary of moving too fast.
an allied defeat on the french coast churchill warned was the only way in which we could possibly lose this war finally roosevelt decided to accept churchills compromise proposal for a joint a nglo american invasion of north africa which was occupied by german and italian armies not nearly as strong as those in europe.
the north africa campaign on november 8 1942 british and american forces landed in morocco and algeria on the north african 1184 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 coast operation torch.
they were led by an untested l ittle known u s general dwight d eisenhower.
farther east british armies were pushing the germans and italians back across libya.
the americans lost badly in early battles.
in early 1943 however eisenhower soon known by his nickname ike found an audacious field commander in general george patton who said he loved war more than my life armed with i vory handled pistols and brimming with bravado patton showed american troops how to fight a war of speed and daring.
corporal morris zimmerman a soldier fighting under patton wrote his mother from north africa this is your son reporting from the land of arabs and wine sticky flies and red sand.
i have always wanted to cross an ocean to see what was on the other side and darned if i didnt hammered from all sides and unable to retreat some 250 000 germans and italians surrendered on may 12 1943 leaving all of north africa in allied control.
the continent had been redeemed said winston churchill.
ernie pyle a war correspondent embedded with the american army reported that major general george s patton patton commanded the u s invasion of sicily the largest amphibious action in the war up to that point.
he believed that war brings out all that is best in men the allied drive toward berlin 1185 the u s troops fought like veterans.
they were well handled.
we had enough of what we needed.
everything meshed perfectly and the end was inevitable.
tunisia has been a good w arm up field for our armies but he added the worst was yet to come the casablanca conference five months earlier in janu ary 1943 roosevelt churchill and the a nglo american military chiefs met at a seaside resort near casablanca the largest city in french morocco.
it was a historic occasion.
no u s president had ever flown abroad while in office and none had ever visited africa.
stalin chose to stay in the soviet union but he sent a message which again urged the allies to invade n azi controlled western europe to relieve the pressure on the russians.
at the casablanca conference the british convinced the americans that they should follow up the anticipated victory in north africa with an assault on the italian island of sicily before attacking italy itself.
roosevelt and churchill also decided to step up the bombing of germany and to increase shipments of military supplies to the soviet union and the nationalist chinese forces fighting the japanese.
before leaving the casablanca conference roosevelt announced with churchills blessing that the war would end only with the unconditional surrender of all enemy nations.
this decision was designed to quiet soviet suspicions that the americans and british might negotiate separately with hitler to end the war in western europe.
the announcement also reflected roosevelts determination that every person in germany should realize that this time germany is a defeated nation whatever its impact on soviet morale or enemy resistance however the decision to require unconditional surrender ensured the destruction of germany and japan that would create power vacuums along the western and eastern borders of the soviet union.
the battle of the atlantic while fighting raged in north africa the battle of the atlantic reached its climax.
great britain desperately needed more food and military supplies from the united states but german submarines operating in groups called wolfpacks were sinking the british vessels transporting american goods faster than british shipyards could replace them.
there could be no invasion of german occupied france until the u boat menace was defeated.
by july 1942 some 230 allied ships and almost 5 million tons of war supplies had been lost.
the only thing that ever frightened me during the war recalled churchill was the u boat peril by the end of 1942 however the british and americans had discovered ways to defeat the u boats.
british experts cracked the german naval radio 1186 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 codes enabling allied convoys to steer clear of u boats or to hunt them down with long range warplanes called subchasers and anti submarine weapons deployed on warships.
new technology also helped as sonar and radar allowed allied ships to track submarines.
yet the best tactic against u boats was to group cargo vessels into tightly bunched convoys so that warships could protect them more effectively.
in may 1943 the allies destroyed forty one u boats.
thereafter the u boats were on the defensive and allied shipping losses fell significantly.
sicily and italy on july 10 1943 following the allied victory in north africa about 250 000 british and american troops landed on the coast of sicily.
general eisenhower called it the first page of the liberation of the european continent the island was in allied hands by august 17 bringing to an end benito mussolinis twenty years of fascist rule in italy.
on july 25 1943 the italian king had dismissed mussolini as prime minister and had him arrested.
the new italian government startled the allies when it offered not only to surrender but also to switch sides.
to prevent them from doing so hitler sent german armies into italy.
the italian campaign thereafter became a series of stalemated battles that left people wondering if it had been worth the cost.
winter came early to southern italy making life even more miserable for the soldiers.
the germans positioned themselves behind formidable defenses and rugged terrain that enabled them to slow the allied advance to a crawl.
italy was one hill after another said a u s soldier and when it was wet you were either going up too slow or down too fast but always the mud.
and every hill had a german machine gun on it allied casualties soared as the stalemate continued.
by february 1944 the two sides were in the words of u s commander mark w clark like two boxers in the ring both about to collapse mussolini plucked from prison by a daring german airborne commando raid became head of a puppet fascist government in northern italy as allied forces finally took control of the rest of the country.
on june 4 1944 the u s fifth army entered rome just two days before d day on the coast of france.
we were woken by trucks moving through the street one overjoyed italian remembered.
at first i thought it was the germans but then i heard american accents.
by dawn people were lining the streets.
i cried the tehran conference late in the fall of 1943 in tehran iran churchill and roosevelt had their first joint meeting with josef stalin.
their discussions focused on the planned invasion of n azi controlled france and a simultaneous russian offensive westward across eastern europe.
the three the allied drive toward berlin 1187 leaders agreed to create an international organization the united n ations to maintain peace after the war.
upon arriving back in the united states roosevelt confided to churchill his distrust of stalin saying that it was a ticklish business keeping the russians cozy with us because of the tension between communism and capitalism.
as general eisenhower stressed however the fate of britain and the united states depended on the soviets survival as an ally.
the prize we seek he said in 1942 is to keep 8 million russians soldiers in the war the strategic bombing of europe months of preparation went into the long anticipated allied invasion of german occupied france.
while waiting for d day the day the invasion would begin the u s army air force tried to pound germany into submission with an air campaign that dropped thousands of bombs and killed some 350 000 civilians.
yet the air offensive failed to shatter either german morale or w ar related production.
many bombs missed their targets because of thick clouds high winds and inaccurate navigational systems and many allied planes were shot down.
the bombing campaign however did force the germans to commit precious resources to air raid defense and eventually wore down their air force.
with allied air supremacy assured by 1944 the m uch anticipated invasion of hitlers fortress europe could move forward.
planning an invasion in early 1944 dwight d eisenhower arrived in london with a new title supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force aef that would invade n azi controlled western europe.
eisenhower faced enormous challenges ranging from creating an effective command structure to handling disagreements between president roosevelt and prime minister churchill.
eisenhower also faced the daunting task of planning operation overlord the daring assault on hitlers atlantic wall a formidable array of fortifications mines machine guns barbed wire and jagged beach obstacles along the french coastline.
an attack by sea against heavily fortified defenders was the toughest of military operations.
the planned invasion gave churchill nightmares when i think of the beaches.
choked with the flower of american and british youth.
i see the tides running red with their blood.
i have my doubts.
i have my doubts for months eisenhower neither an experienced strategist nor a combat commander dedicated himself to planning the risky invasion and managing the complex political and military rivalries among the allied leaders.
well organized and efficient he was a high energy perfectionist impatient and 1188 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 general dwight d eisenhower eisenhower visiting with u s paratroopers before they began the d day assault in operation overlord.
often short tempered with his staff.
he attended to every detail including the amassing of 5 million tons of military equipment and munitions and thousands of warplanes and ships.
as d day approached eisenhowers chief of staff predicted only a fifty fifty chance of success.
the seaborne invasion was the greatest gamble and most complex military operation in history.
i am very uneasy about the whole operation admitted sir alan brooke head of british forces.
it may well be the most ghastly disaster of the whole war eisenhower was so concerned that he carried in his wallet a note to be circulated if the allies failed.
it read if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone d day and after operation overlord succeeded in part because it surprised the germans.
the allies made elaborate e fforts including the positioning of british decoy troops and making misleading public statements to fool the nazis into believing that the invasion would come at pas de calais on the french belgian border where the english channel was narrowest.
instead the landings would occur along fifty miles of shoreline in northern normandy a french coastal region almost 200 miles south.
the allied drive toward berlin 1189 on the blustery evening of june 5 1944 eisenhower visited some of the 16 000 american paratroopers preparing to drop behind the german lines in france.
the soldiers their faces blackened by burnt cork and heads shaved to resemble indian warriors noticed eisenhowers concern and tried to lift his spirits.
now quit worrying general one of them said well take care of this thing for you a sergeant said we aint worried.
its hitlers turn to worry after the planes took off eisenhower returned to his car with tears in his eyes.
he later confided to an aide i hope to god i know what im doing as he got into bed that night winston churchill with tears running down his cheeks asked his wife do you know that by the time you wake up in the morning 20 000 men may have been killed as the planes carrying the paratroopers arrived over france thick clouds and german anti aircraft fire disrupted the formations.
some soldiers were dropped miles from their landing sites some were dropped far out at sea and some were dropped so low that their parachutes never opened.
yet the u s 82nd and 101st airborne divisions outfought three german divisions during the chaotic night and prepared the way for the main invasion by destroying bridges and capturing artillery positions and key road junctions.
donald burgett a nineteen year old paratrooper in the 101st airborne division recalled dropping into france in the dark of night and being alone my throat went dry and i swallowed but nothing went down.
my heart pounded sending blood throbbing through my temples and causing a weak feeling in the pit of my stomach but he had no time for fear.
as he stumbled upon others who had survived the landing they soon found themselves embroiled in combat.
the normandy landings as the gray misty light of dawn broke on d day june 6 1944 the biggest invasion fleet in h istory some 5 300 allied ships carrying 370 000 soldiers and sailors filled the horizon off the normandy coast.
sleepy german soldiers guarding the beaches awoke to see the breathtaking array of ships.
i saw an armada like a plague of locusts said a german officer.
the number of ships was uncountable major battles often depend on luck.
when asked what kind of generals he preferred napolon said lucky ones eisenhower was lucky on d day for the germans misinterpreted the normandy landings as a diversion for the real attack at p as de calais.
it helped that the german commander field marshal erwin rommel assuming that the weather was too rough for an invasion had gone home to germany to celebrate his wifes june 6 birthday.
how stupid of me rommel said when he heard the news.
how stupid of me by one in the afternoon he was racing back to france.
1190 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 the landing at normandy d day june 6 1944.
before they could huddle under a seawall and begin to dislodge the nazi defenders u s soldiers on omaha beach had to cross a fifty yard stretch that exposed them to machine guns housed in concrete bunkers.
when hitler learned of the allied landings he boasted that the news couldnt be better.
as long as they the allied armies were in britain we couldnt get at them.
now we have them where we can destroy them in the united states word that the long anticipated liberation of nazi europe had begun captured the nations attention.
businesses closed church bells tolled and traffic was stopped so that people could pray in the streets.
stalin cabled to churchill and roosevelt that the news brought joy to us all resilience and creativity are crucial virtues amid the confusion of great battles the fog of war which rarely go according to plan.
despite eisenhowers meticulous preparations the huge operation almost failed.
during the first day foul weather and rough seas caused injuries and nausea and capsized dozens of landing craft.
more than 1 000 men weighed down by seventy pounds of equipment drowned as they stepped off landing craft into water up to their necks.
some of the boxy flat bottomed landing craft delivered their often seasick troops to the wrong locations.
we have landed in the wrong place shouted fifty six year old brigadier general theodore roosevelt jr son of the former president who would receive the medal of honor for his courage that day.
but we will start the war from here the noise was deafening as shells exploded across the beach and in the surf.
the bodies of the killed wounded and drowned piled up amid wrench the allied drive toward berlin 1191 ing cries for help.
as our boat touched sand and the ramp went down private harry parley remembered i became a visitor to hell as german gunners fired on the attacking soldiers.
the first u s units ashore at omaha beach beneath 130 foot tall cliffs defended by german machine guns and mortars lost more than 90 percent of their men.
in one company 197 of the 205 men were killed or wounded within ten minutes.
officers struggled to rally the exhausted bewildered troops pinned down on the beach.
two kinds of men are staying on this beach shouted cigar smoking colonel george taylor on omaha beach.
the dead and those who are going to die.
move in and die.
get the hell out of here he then began to run forward and his men followed stumbling across the deadly beach into the dunes.
inch by inch backed by waves of reinforcements the u s soldiers pushed across the beach and up the cliffs.
by nightfall 170 000 allied soldiers 57 000 of them americans were scattered across fifty miles of windswept normandy coastline.
so too were the bodies of some 10 724 dead or wounded allied soldiers.
on june 13 a week after the normandy landings erwin rommel the german commander told his wife that the battle is not going at all well for us within three weeks the allies had landed more than 1 million troops 566 000 tons of supplies and 171 000 vehicles.
whether the enemy can still be stopped at this point is questionable german headquarters near paris warned hitler.
the enemy air superiority is terrific and smothers almost every one of our movements.
losses in men and equipment are extraordinary operation overlord was the greatest seaborne invasion in the annals of warfare but it was small when compared with the offensive launched by the soviet army in russia a few weeks later.
between june and august 1944 the soviets killed wounded or captured more german soldiers 350 000 than were stationed in all of western europe.
still the normandy invasion was a turning point in the war.
with the beachhead secured the allied leaders knew that victory was just a matter of time as hitlers armies were caught between the soviets advancing from the east and the allied forces from the west.
what a plan churchill exclaimed to the british parliament.
even stalin applauded the invasions vast conception and masterly execution for all of the allied success however eisenhower privately struggled with the daily casualty reports.
how i wish this cruel business of war could be completed quickly he wrote his wife.
war demands real toughness of fi ber not only in the soldiers who must endure but in the homes that must sacrifice their best 1192 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 the liberation of paris it would take seven more weeks and 37 000 more lives for the allied troops to gain control of normandy the germans lost more than twice that many and some 19 000 french civilians were killed.
then on july 25 1944 american armies broke out from normandy and headed east toward paris.
on august 15 a joint american french invasion force landed on the mediterranean coast and raced up the rhone valley in eastern france.

was it effective.
the allied drive toward berlin 1193 german resistance collapsed after only ten weeks of ferocious fighting.
on d day one german unit the 21st panzer division boasted 12 000 men and 127 tanks ten weeks later having retreated across france it had 300 men and just 10 tanks.
a division of the free french resistance aided by american units had the honor of liberating paris on august 25.
as u s soldiers marched through the cheering crowds a reporter said that he had never seen in any place such joy as radiated from the people of paris this morning by mid september most of france and belgium had been cleared of german troops.
meanwhile the soviet army moved relentlessly westward along a 1 200mile front pushing the germans out of russia.
between d day and the end of the war in europe a year later 1 2 million germans were killed and wounded.
roosevelts fourth term in 1944 amid the largest war in history the calendar required another presidential election.
the republicans nominated new york governor thomas e dewey who argued that it was time for a younger man to replace the tired democratic leader.
voters however preferred the seasoned franklin roosevelt.
on november 7 1944 the president was elected for a fourth term this time by a popular vote of 25 6 million to 22 million and an electoral vote of 432 to 99 the race to berlin by the time franklin roosevelt was reelected allied armies were approaching the german border from the east and west.
churchill worried that if the soviets arrived first in berlin the german capital stalin would control the postwar map of europe urged eisenhower to beat the soviets to berlin.
eisenhower however decided it was not worth the estimated 100 000 americans who would be killed or wounded in such an operation.
the yalta conference as the allied armies converged on berlin stalin hosted roosevelt and churchill at the yalta conference february 4 11 1945 in crimea on the black sea.
the leaders agreed that once germany surrendered the soviets would occupy eastern germany and the americans and british would control western germany.
berlin the german capital within the soviet zone would be subject to joint occupation.
the americans and british later created a fourth occupation zone in germany for the french to administer.
stalins goals at yalta were to retrieve former russian territory transferred to poland after the first world war and to impose soviet control over the countries of eastern and central europe.
roosevelt exhausted and in failing health agreed to stalins proposals because he needed the soviets to support the creation of a new international peacekeeping organization the united 1194 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 nations and to help defeat japan.
military analysts estimated that japan could hold out for eighteen months after the defeat of germany unless the soviets joined the war in the pacific.
stalin agreed to do so but the price was high he demanded territories from japan and china.
roosevelt and churchill got stalin to sign the yalta declaration of liberated europe which called for free and open elections in the liberated nations of eastern europe.
nevertheless the wily stalin would fail to live up to his promises.
when the red army liberated hungary romania bulgaria czechoslovakia poland and eastern germany it plundered and sent back to russia anything of economic value dismantling thousands of factories and mills and rebuilding them in the soviet union.
to ensure control over eastern europe the soviets shipped off to prison anyone who questioned the new communist governments they created.
roosevelt viewed the yalta meeting as a test of whether the wartime alliance between the united states and the soviet union would survive once the conflict ended.
he staked his hopes for postwar cooperation on the creation of the united nations un.
at yalta the big three agreed to hold organizational meetings for the un beginning on april 25 1945.
like woodrow wilson roosevelt was determined to replace americas outdated isolationism with an engaged internationalism.
but to get stalins approval of the un roosevelt gave in to his demands for territory held by japan in northeast asia.
republicans later savagely attacked roosevelt for giving eastern europe over to soviet domination.
some blamed his behavior on his declining health.
he would die in a few weeks.
but even a robust roosevelt could not have dislodged the soviet army from its control of eastern europe.
the course the yalta conference churchill of the war shaped the outcome at yalta roosevelt and stalin with their not roosevelts failed diplomacy.
the respective foreign ministers behind united states had no real leverage.
as them confer on plans for the postwar a u s diplomat admitted stalin held world in february 1945 all the cards i didnt say the result the allied drive toward berlin 1195 was good roosevelt said after returning from the yalta conference.
i said it was the best i could do death of a president by early 1945 nazi germany was on the verge of defeat but sixty three year old franklin roosevelt would not live to join the victory celebrations.
in the spring of 1945 he went to the little white house in warm springs georgia to rest up for the conference that would create the united nations.
on the morning of april 12 1945 he complained of a headache but seemed to be in good spirits.
it was nearly lunchtime when he said to an artist painting his portrait now weve got just about 15 minutes more to work then as she watched him reading some documents he groaned saying that he had terrific pain in the back of his head.
suddenly he slumped over and fell into a coma.
he died two hours later.
on hand to witness the presidents death was lucy mercer rutherford the woman with whom roosevelt had an affair thirty years before.
eleanor roosevelt was in washington d c when franklin died unaware of the presidents guest.
although franklin had promised in 1918 to end all communications with mercer he had in fact secretly stayed in touch even enabling her to attend his presidential inauguration in 1933.
roosevelts death shocked and saddened the world in part because few people were aware that he was sick.
even his sharpest critics were devastated.
ohio senator robert taft known as mr.
republican called roosevelts death one of the worst tragedies in the nations history.
the presidents death removes the greatest figure of our time at the very climax of his career.
he dies a hero of the war for he literally worked himself to death in the service of the american people by contrast hitler viewed roosevelts death as a great miracle the war is not lost he told an aide.
roosevelt is dead a u s soldier was on a warship in the pacific when he heard the news of roosevelts death.
i felt a great sense of loss he said for roosevelt had been president almost all his life.
he was our leader but he was also in some way our friend in the short term he worried about the military implications of roosevelts death.
how will we go on fighting the war when our commander in chief is dead the collapse of nazism adolf hitlers shrinking nazi empire collapsed less than a month later.
in berlin on april 28 as soviet troops prepared to enter the city hitler married his mistress eva braun in an underground bunker.
that same day italian freedom fighters captured mussolini and his mistress.
despite his plea to let me live and i will give you an empire 1196 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 may 8 1945 the celebration in new york citys times square on v e day.
mussolini and his mistress were shot and hung by their heels from a girder above a milan gas station.
on april 30 hitler and his wife retired to their underground bedroom where she poisoned herself and he put a bullet in his head.
their bodies were taken outside doused with gasoline and burned.
on may 2 berlin fell.
axis forces in italy surrendered the same day.
five days later on may 7 the chief of staff of the german armed forces agreed to unconditional surrender.
so ended nazi domination of europe little more than twelve years after hitler had come to power proclaiming his thousand year reich on may 8 v e day victory in europe generated massive celebrations.
in paris an american bomber pilot flew his plane through the eiffel tower.
in new york city 500 000 people celebrated in the streets.
but the elation was tempered by the ongoing war against japan and the immense challenges of helping europe rebuild.
the german economy had to be revived a new democratic government had to be formed and millions of displaced europeans had to be clothed housed and fed.
the holocaust the end of the war in europe revealed the horrific extent of the holocaust hitlers systematic effort to destroy the jews and other racial political sexual and religious undesirables including communists and prostitutes.
reports of the nazis methodical slaughter of jews the allied drive toward berlin 1197 had appeared as early as 1942 but the gruesome stories seemed beyond belief until the allied armies liberated the hundred or so death camps where the germans had imposed their shocking final solution the wholesale extermination of some 6 million jews along with more than 1 million other captured peoples.
at the auschwitz birkenau camp in poland 865 000 were killed as soon as they arrived and up to 6 000 were gassed in a single day.
the allied troops were appalled by what they discovered in the huge extermination camps.
bodies were piled as high as buildings survivors were living skeletons.
general eisenhower reported to his wife that the evidence of starvation cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick american officials even some jewish leaders had dragged their feet in acknowledging the holocaust during the war for fear that relief efforts for jewish refugees might stir up anti semitism at home.
under pressure president roosevelt had set up a war refugee board early in 1944.
it managed to rescue about 200 000 european jews and some 20 000 others.
but the president refused appeals to bomb the concentration camp at auschwitz arguing that the nazis would simply build another one.
overall the allied response to the holocaust survivors american troops liberate survivors of the mauthausen concentration camp in may 1945.
the nazis tattooed the prisoners with identification numbers on their wrists or chests as seen on the man at left.
1198 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 nazi atrocities was inept at best and disgraceful at worst.
in 1944 churchill called the holocaust the most horrible crime ever committed in the history of the world he did not know at the time that stalins death camps killed more people than hitlers.
the pacific war for months after the attack on pearl harbor at the end of 1941 the news from the pacific was all bad as president roosevelt acknowledged.
with stunning speed the japanese captured numerous territories in asia including the british colonies of hong kong burma malaya and singapore and the french colony of indochina.
everywhere in the pacific said winston churchill we were weak and naked the philippines in the philippines u s forces and their filipino allies were overwhelmed by japanese invaders.
on april 10 1942 the japanese gathered some 12 000 captured american troops along with 66 000 filipinos and forced them to march sixty five miles in six days up the bataan peninsula.
already underfed ravaged by tropical diseases and provided with little food and water the prisoners were brutalized in what came to be known as the bataan death march.
those who fell out of line were bayoneted or shot.
others were beaten stabbed or shot for no reason.
more than 10 000 died along the way.
news of the bataan death march outraged americans and contributed to the pacific wars ferocious emotional intensity and mutual atrocities.
by the summer of 1942 japan had seized control of a vast asian empire and was on the verge of assaulting australia when its naval leaders succumbed to what one admiral called victory disease intoxicated with easy victories and lusting for more they pushed into the south pacific intending to isolate australia and strike again at hawaii.
coral sea and midway during the spring of 1942 u s forces in the pacific finally had some success.
in the battle of the coral sea may 2 6 1942 u s naval warplanes forced a japanese fleet headed toward the island of new guinea to turn back after sinking an aircraft carrier and destroying seventy planes.
a few weeks later admiral yamamoto steered his main japanese battle fleet of e ighty six warships toward midway the westernmost of hawaiis inhabited islands from which he hoped to strike pearl harbor again.
this time however the japanese were taken by surprise.
americans had broken the the pacific war 1199 general douglas macarthur macarthur theatrically coming ashore at the island of leyte in the philippines october 1944.
japanese military radio code allowing admiral chester nimitz commander of the u s central pacific fleet to learn where yamamotos fleet was heading.
the first japanese attack hit midway hard on june 4 1942 but at the cost of about a third of their warplanes.
american planes from the yorktown and enterprise then struck back crippling the japanese fleet.
the battle of midway was the first major defeat for the japanese navy in 350 years and the turning point of the pacific war.
the american victory blunted japans military momentum eliminated the threat to hawaii and bought time for the united states to organize its massive industrial productivity for a wider war.
macarthurs pacific strategy american and australian forces were jointly under the command of the imperious general douglas macarthur a military genius with tremendous willpower and courage who constantly irritated his superiors in washington with his unpleasant personality and his repeated efforts to embellish his image.
macarthur had retired in 1937 but was called back into service in m id 1941 in part because he was such a brilliant strategist.
in 1942 he assumed command of the allied forces in the southwest pacific.
on august 7 1942 after first pushing the japanese back in new guinea macarthur landed 16 000 u s marines on guadalcanal island one of 1200 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 the so called solomon islands where the japanese had built an air base.
the u s commander was optimistic that his undersupplied troops could defeat the entrenched japanese even though he said there were a hundred reasons why this operation should fail but it did not fail.
the savage fighting on guadalcanal lasted through february 1943 but resulted in the japanese armys first defeat and a loss of 20 000 men compared to 1 752 americans.
i had never heard or read of this kind of fighting said a u s marine.
these people refuse to surrender the japanese were skilled defensive fighters who rarely surrendered and they controlled most of the largest islands in the pacific.
their suicidal intensity led general macarthur and admiral nimitz to adopt a shrewd leapfrogging strategy whereby they focused on the most important islands and used airpower and sea power to bypass the others leaving the isolated japanese bases to wither on the vine as nimitz put it.
for example when u s warplanes destroyed the japanese airfield at rabaul in eastern new guinea 135 000 japanese troops were left stranded on the island cut off from resupply by air or sea.
what the allies did to rabaul set the pattern for the island hopping strategy in the pacific.
battles in the central pacific on june 15 1944 just days after the d day invasion u s forces liberated tinian guam and saipan three japanese controlled islands.
saipan was strategically important because it allowed the new american b 29 superfortress bombers to strike japan itself.
the struggle for the island lasted three weeks.
some 20 000 japanese were killed compared to 3 500 americans.
but 7 000 more japanese soldiers committed suicide upon the order of their commanding general who killed himself with his sword.
general macarthurs forces invaded the japanese held philippines on october 20.
the japanese knowing that the loss of the philippines would cut them off from essential raw materials brought in warships from three directions to battle the u s fleet.
the four battles fought in the philippine sea from october 23 to october 26 1944 came to be known collectively as the battle of leyte gulf the largest naval engagement in history and the worst japanese defeat of the war.
some 216 u s warships converged to engage 64 japanese ships.
by the end of the first day 36 japanese warships including 4 aircraft carriers had been destroyed.
the battle of leyte gulf included the first japanese kamikaze divine wind attacks in which young suicide pilots deliberately crashed their b omb laden planes into american warships.
from the fall of 1944 to the wars end in the summer of 1945 an estimated 4 000 kamikaze pilots died on suicide missions.
one in seven hit an american ship thirty four of which were sunk.

now he announced with great fanfare people of the philippines i have returned.
the hour of your redemption is here.
rally to me 1202 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 a war to the death the closer the allied forces got to japan the fiercer the resistance they encountered.
while fighting continued in the philippines 30 000 u s marines landed on iwo jima a volcanic atoll 760 miles from tokyo.
the americans thought iwo jima was needed as a base for fighter planes to escort bombers over japan.
the japanese fought with suicidal intensity and it took nearly six weeks to secure the tiny island at a cost of nearly 7 000 american lives and 21 000 of the 22 000 japanese soldiers.
in the end the furious battle was fought for an air base that never materialized.
the assault on the japanese island of okinawa which began on easter sunday april 1 was even bloodier.
only 360 miles from the main japanese islands okinawa was strategically important because it would serve as the staging area for the planned allied invasion of japan.
the conquest of okinawa was the largest amphibious operation of the pacific war involving some 300 000 troops and requiring almost three months of brutal fighting.
more than 150 000 japanese were killed the remaining 7 871 were either captured or surrendered.
a third of u s pilots and a quarter of submariners lost their lives at okinawa.
as the fighting raged on okinawa allied commanders began planning operation d ownfall the invasion of japan itself.
to weaken the japanese defenses destroy their war related industries and erode civilian morale the allied command began bombing raids in the summer of 1944.
in early 1945 general curtis lemay head of the u s.
bomber command ordered devastating firebomb raids upon japanese cities bomb and burn em till they quit on march 9 some 300 b 29 bombers dropped napalm bombs on tokyo.
the attack incinerated sixteen square miles of the city and killed some 100 000 people while rendering a million homeless.
by then american military leaders had lost all moral qualms about targeting civilians.
the kamikaze attacks the japanese savagery toward prisoners of war the burning of manila that killed 100 000 civilians and the rape of china had eroded almost all sympathy for the island nation.
by august 1945 sixty six japanese cities had been firebombed.
secretary of war henry stimson called the lack of public outcry in the united states over the raids appalling the atomic bomb still the japanese leaders showed no willingness to surrender.
in early 1945 new u s president harry s truman learned of the first successful test of an atomic bomb in new mexico.
now that military planners knew the bomb would work they selected two japanese cities as targets.
the first was hiroshima a port city and army headquarters in southern japan.
on july 25 1945 truman who knew nothing about the devastating effects of the pacific war 1203 the aftermath of little boy this image shows the wasteland that remained after the atomic bomb little boy decimated hiroshima japan on august 6 1945 radiation poisoning ordered that the atomic bomb be used if japan did not surrender before august 3.
although an intense debate emerged over the decision to drop the bomb spurred by trumans chief of staff admiral william d leahy who argued that the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender truman said that he never had any doubt that it should be used he later recalled that we faced half a million casualties trying to take japan by land.
it was either that or the atom bomb and i didnt hesitate a minute and ive never lost any sleep over it since to truman and others the use of atomic bombs seemed a logical next step to end the war.
as it turned out scientists greatly underestimated the physical effects of the bomb.
their prediction that 20 000 people would be killed proved much too low.
in m id july 1945 the allied leaders met in potsdam germany near berlin.
there they issued the potsdam declaration.
in addition to outlawing nazism it demanded that japan surrender by august 3 or face prompt and utter destruction truman left potsdam optimistic about postwar relations with the 1204 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 soviet union.
i can deal with stalin he wrote.
he is h onest but smart as hell truman would soon change his mind about stalins honesty.
the deadline calling for japans surrender passed and on august 6 1945 a b 29 bomber named enola gay after the pilots mother took off at 2 00 a m from the island of tinian and headed for hiroshima.
at 8 15 a m flying at 31 600 feet the enola gay released the fi ve ton ten foot long uranium bomb nicknamed little boy forty three seconds later the bomb exploded at an altitude of 1 900 feet creating a blinding flash of light followed by a fireball towering to 40 000 feet.
the tail gunner on the enola gay described the scene its like bubbling molasses down there.
the mushroom is spreading out.
fires are springing up bombing of nagasaki a 20 000 foot everywhere.
its like a peep into hell tall mushroom cloud enveloped the city the bombs incredible shock wave of nagasaki after the atomic bombing and firestorm killed some 78 000 peoon august 9 1945 ple including thousands of japanese soldiers and 23 american prisoners of war housed in the city.
by the end of the year the death toll would reach 140 000 as people died of injuries or radiation poisoning.
in addition of the citys 76 000 buildings only 6 000 were left standing and four square miles of the city were turned to rubble.
president truman was aboard the battleship augusta returning from the potsdam conference when news arrived that the atomic bomb had been dropped.
this is the greatest thing in history he exclaimed.
in the united states americans greeted the news with similar joy.
to them the atomic bomb promised a quick end to the long nightmare of war.
no tears of sympathy will be shed in america for the japanese people the omaha world herald predicted.
had they possessed a comparable weapon at pearl harbor would they have hesitated to use it others reacted more soberly when they considered the implications of atomic warfare.
yesterday journalist hanson baldwin wrote in the new york times we clinched victory in the pacific but we sowed the whirlwind a new age is born 1205 two days after the hiroshima bombing an opportunistic soviet union hoping to share in the spoils of victory hastened to enter the war in the pacific by sending hundreds of thousands of troops into j apanese occupied manchuria along the border between china and the soviet union.
truman and his aides frustrated by the stubborn refusal of japanese leaders to surrender and fearful that the soviet unions entry would complicate negotiations ordered a second atomic bomb fat man to be dropped on japan.
on august 9 the city of nagasaki a shipbuilding center experienced the same nuclear devastation that had destroyed hiroshima.
five days later on august 14 1945 the japanese emperor accepted the terms of surrender.
the formal surrender ceremony occurred on an american warship in tokyo bay on september 2 1945.
upon learning of the unexpected japanese decision to surrender paul fussell one of the american soldiers preparing for the dreaded invasion of japan said he went into his tent and pulled the zipper closed.
and i sat there in silence for at least a full day before i could compose myself because my joy was such that i knew i couldnt survive it in public then he came out and cheered and danced with everyone else.
a new age is born thus ended the costliest war in history.
it was a total war in its scope intensity and numbers.
including deaths from war related disease and famine some 50 million civilians and 22 million combatants died.
the second world war was more costly for the united states than any other foreign war 292 000 combat deaths and 114 000 noncombat deaths among soldiers sailors airmen and marines.
a million more were wounded with half of them seriously disabled.
in proportion to its population however the united states suffered far fewer losses than did the other major allies or their enemies and american territory escaped the devastation suffered in so many parts of the world.
for every american killed in the second world war for example some fifty nine soviets died.
the war was the pivotal event of the turbulent twentieth century.
it engulfed five continents leveled cities reshaped societies and transformed international relations.
german and italian fascism as well as japanese militarism were destroyed.
the war set in motion the fall of china to communism in 1949 and the outbreak of the korean war a year later.
colonial empires in africa and asia rapidly crumbled as the conflict unleashed independence movements.
the soviet union emerged from the war as a new global superpower while the united states as winston churchill told the house of commons stood at the summit of the world 1206 chapter 26 the second world war 1933 1945 why did the allies win.
many factors contributed to the allied victory.
roosevelt and churchill were better at coordinating military efforts and maintaining national morale than were hitler mussolini and the japanese emperor hirohito.
by 1944 hitler had grown increasingly unstable and unpredictable and more withdrawn from the german people especially after a failed attempt by high ranking officers to assassinate him that july.
in the end however what turned the tide was the awesome productivity of american industry and the ability of the soviet union to absorb the massive german invasion and then push back all the way to berlin.
by the end of the war japan had run out of food and germany had run out of fuel.
by contrast the united states was churning out more of everything.
as early as 1942 just a few weeks after the attack on pearl harbor fritz todt a nazi engineer told hitler that the war against the united states was already lost because of americas ability to out produce all the other warring nations combined.
a transformational war like the first world war the second world war had f ar reaching effects.
it shattered the old world order and created a new international system and nations such as france germany great britain and japan were left devastated or impoverished.
henry luce the powerful publisher of time magazine said that the war had demonstrated the moral and practical bankruptcy of all forms of isolationism internationalism was now the dominant outlook as most americans acknowledged that the united states had profound responsibilities for global stability and security.
it had emerged from the war with the most powerful military in the world and as the only nation with atomic weapons.
the expansion of the federal government spurred by the war effort continued after 1945 and presidential authority increased enormously at the expense of congressional and state power.
the war also ended the great depression and launched a long period of unprecedented prosperity and global economic domination.
big businesses grew into gigantic corporations as a result of huge government contracts for military weapons and supplies.
new technologies and products developed for military purposes radar computers electronics plastics and synthetics jet engines rockets atomic e nergy transformed the private sector as did new consumer products generated from war related innovations.
and the opportunities created by the war for women as well as for african americans mexican americans and other minorities set in motion major social changes that would culminate in the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the feminist movement of the 1970s.
in august 1945 president truman announced that the united states had emerged from this war the most powerful nation in this w orld the most a new age is born 1207 powerful nation perhaps in all history but the soviet union despite its profound human losses and physical destruction had gained much new territory built massive armed forces and enhanced its international influence making it the greatest power in eurasia.
a little over a century after frenchman alexis de tocqueville had predicted that europe would eventually be overshadowed by the united states and russia his prophecy had come to pass.
chapter review summary fascism and the start of the war in italy benito mussolini assumed control by promising law and order.
adolf hitler rearmed germany in defiance of the treaty of versailles.
by march 1939 nazi germany had annexed austria and seized czechoslovakia.
hitler then invaded poland with the blitzkrieg strategy in september 1939 after signing a non aggression pact with the soviet union.
the british and french governments declared war.
america goes to war the united states issued neutrality laws to avoid being drawn into wars in europe and asia but with the fall of france roosevelt accelerated military aid to great britain through the lend lease act.
in 1941 the united states and great britain signed the atlantic charter announcing their aims in the war.
after japan joined with germany and italy to form the axis alliance president roosevelt froze japanese assets in the united states and restricted oil exports to japan which frustrated the japanese who decided to launch a surprise attack at pearl harbor hawaii.
the second world war and american society the war had profound social effects.
americans white black and brown migrated west to take jobs in defense industry factories unemployment was soon a thing of the past.
farmers recovered supported by mexican labor through the bracero program.
the federal government through agencies such as the war production board took control of managing the economy.
many women took nontraditional jobs.
about 1 million african americans served in the military in segregated units.
more than 100 000 japanese americans were forcibly interned in war relocation camps road to allied victory in europe by 1943 the allies had defeated the german and italian armies occupying north africa.
from there they launched attacks on sicily and then the mainland of italy.
stalin meanwhile demanded a full scale allied attack on the atlantic coast of france to ease pressure on the russian front but operation overlord was delayed until june 6 1944.
german resistance slowly crumbled.
the big three allied leaders roosevelt churchill and s talin met at the yalta conference in february 1945 where they decided that a conquered germany would be divided into four occupation zones.
in may soviet forces captured berlin and germany surrendered.
after the war allied forces discovered the extent of the holocaust the nazis systematic effort to exterminate the jews.
the pacific war the japanese advance across the pacific was halted in june 1942 with the battle of midway.
fierce japanese resistance at iwo jima and okinawa and japans refusal to surrender after the firebombing of tokyo led the new president harry s truman to order the use of atomic bombs on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki.
postwar world the soviet union and the united states emerged from the war as global superpowers with the united states possessing the worlds s trongest economy.
the opportunities for women and minorities during the war also increased their aspirations and would contribute to the emergence of the civil rights and feminist movements.

pa r t s e ve n the american age the united states emerged from the second world war as the dominant nation on the planet.
it was the worlds preeminent military and economic power and the only nation to possess atomic weapons.
the war changed things in ways no one could have imagined.
some changes came immediately others emerged more slowly.
but their combined effect was truly transformational.
while much of europe and asia struggled to recover from the devastation of the war the united states was virtually unscathed its economic infrastructure intact and operating at peak efficiency.
jobs that had been scarce in the 1930s were now available for the taking.
by 1955 the united states with only 6 percent of the worlds population was producing half of the worlds goods.
american capitalism became a dominant cultural force as u s products fashion and forms of entertainment attracted international attention.
in 1941 henry luce the publisher of time and life magazines proclaimed that the twentieth century had become the american century the ideal of america he explained included a love of freedom a feeling for the equality of opportunity a tradition of s elf reliance and independence america seemed free and unshackled its potential unlimited.
the deepening cold war between democratic and communist nations cast a cloud over the postwar world.
the tense ideological contest with the soviet union produced numerous crises and sparked a witch hunt for communists in the united states.
after 1945 republican and democratic presi dents aggressively sought to contain the spread of communism.
this bedrock assumption embroiled the united states in costly wars in korea and in southeast asia.
a backlash against the vietnam war 1964 1973 also inflamed a rebellious countercultural movement at home in which young idealists not only opposed the war but also provided much of the energy for many overdue social reforms including racial equality gay rights feminism and environmentalism.
the anti war movement destroyed lyndon johnsons presidency in 1968 and provoked a conservative counterattack.
president richard nixons paranoid reaction to his critics led to the watergate affair and the destruction of his presidency.
through all of this turmoil however the expanding role of the federal government that franklin roosevelt and his new deal programs had initiated remained essentially intact.
with only a few exceptions both republicans and democrats after 1945 acknowledged that the federal government must assume greater responsibility for the welfare of individuals.
this fragile consensus however had largely broken down by the late 1980s amid stunning international developments and social changes at home.
the surprising collapse of the soviet union in 1989 and the disintegration of european communism left the united states as the only superpower.
the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the soviet union lowered the threat of nuclear war and reduced public interest in foreign affairs.
yet numerous ethnic nationalist and separatist conflicts brought constant international instability.
the united states found itself drawn into political and military crises in faraway lands such as bosnia somalia afghanistan iraq ukraine and syria.
1213 throughout the 1990s the united states waged a difficult struggle against many groups engaged in organized terrorism.
the challenges of tracking the movements of foreign terrorists became tragically evident in 2001.
at 8 46 on the morning of september 11 2001 the world watched in horror as hijacked commercial airplanes slammed into the world trade center in new york city.
officials identified the hijackers as members of al qaeda arabic for the base a w ell financed network of islamic terrorists led by a wealthy saudi renegade osama bin laden.
president george w bush responded by declaring a war on terror with the passage of the so called patriot act congress gave the president authority to track down and imprison terrorists at home and abroad.
the war on terror began with assaults first on terrorist bases in afghanistan and then on saddam husseins dictatorship in iraq operation iraqi freedom.
yet terrorism proved to be an elusive and resilient foe and the war in iraq and the ensuing u s military occupation was much longer more expensive and less successful than americans had expected.
the surprising victory of barack obama in the 2008 presidential election resulted from people embracing his theme of hope and change he pledged to end the wars in iraq and afghanistan unite the nation and provide jobs to the growing numbers of unemployed.
as the first african american president obama symbolized the societal changes transforming national life.
yet no sooner was obama inaugurated than he inherited the worst economic slowdown since the great depression.
what came to be called the great recession dominated the obama presidency and indeed much of american life bringing with it a prolonged sense of uncertainty and insecurity.
for all of its economic power and military might the united states in the twenty first century has not eliminated the threat of terrorism or unlocked the mystery of sustaining prosperity and reducing economic inequality.
the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 duck and cover a duck and cover air raid drill in 1951 that was commonplace in schools across the country during the cold war.
the drills began in 1949 when the soviet union set off its first nuclear weapon.
pictured above are american schoolchildren practicing ducking and covering in february 1951.
n o sooner did the second world war end than a prolonged cold war between communism and capitalism began.
the awkward wartime alliance between the united states and the soviet union collapsed during the spring and summer of 1945.
with the elimination of their common enemy nazism the two nations became intense global rivals who could not bridge their ideological differences over basic issues such as human rights individual liberties democratic elections and religious freedom.
mutual suspicion and a race to gain influence over nonaligned nations in asia africa the middle east and central and south america further distanced the two former allies.
the defeat of japan and germany had created power vacuums in europe and asia that sucked the soviet union and the united states into an unrelenting war of words fed by clashing strategic interests and political ideologies.
the postwar era also brought a nti colonial liberation movements in asia africa and the middle east that would soon strip great britain france the netherlands and the united states of their global empires.
the philippines for example gained its independence from america in 1946.
the next year great britain withdrew from h indu dominated india after carving out two new islamic nations pakistan and bangladesh originally called east pakistan.
the emergence of communist china the peoples republic in 1949 further complicated global politics.
the mere possibility of nuclear holocaust also cast a cloud of anxiety over the postwar era.
the advent of atomic weapons made the very idea of warfare focus questions 1.
why and how did the cold war between the united states and the soviet union develop after the second world war.
what was the impact of american efforts to contain the soviet union and the expansion of communism during trumans presidency.
how did truman expand the new deal.
how effective was his own fair deal agenda.
what were the major international developments during 1949 1950 and how did they alter u s foreign policy.
how did the red scare emerge after the second world war.
how did it impact american politics and society.
1216 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 unthinkably horrific which in turn made national leaders more cautious in handling disputes.
truman and the cold war in april 1945 less than three months after harry s truman had begun his new role as vice president eleanor roosevelt calmly informed him harry the president is dead when truman asked what he could do to help her the first lady replied is there anything we can do for you.
for you are the one in trouble now truman was largely unknown outside of washington.
what everyone did know however was that he was not franklin delano roosevelt.
truman had no wealthy family had not traveled the world and had not attended harvard or columbia.
in fact he had not gone to college.
born in 1884 in western missouri truman grew up in independence near kansas city.
bookish and withdrawn he was he recalled a bit of a sissy as a boy.
he moved to his grandmothers farm after high school spent a few years working in kansas city banks and grew into an outgoing young man.
during the first world war truman served in france as captain of an artillery battery.
afterward he and a partner started a clothing business but it failed miserably in the recession of 1922 leaving him in debt for the next twenty years.
truman then entered local politics under the tutelage of kansas citys democratic machine.
in 1934 missouri sent him to the u s senate where he remained obscure until he chaired a committee investigating fraud in the w ar mobilization effort.
truman was a plain decent lovable man who lacked roosevelts dash charm brilliance and creativity.
on his first full day as president truman was awestruck.
boys if you ever pray pray for me now he told reporters.
i dont know whether you fellows ever had a load of hay fall on you but when they told me yesterday what had happened i felt like the moon the stars and all the planets had fallen on me washington politicos had low expectations of roosevelts successor.
as truman was seated waiting to be sworn in as the grieving nations new president a democratic official said he looked to me like a very little man as he sat in a huge leather chair.
an unreflective man whose famed decisiveness was rarely troubled by doubts or moral ambiguities truman was famously short tempered profane and dismissive and was notorious for his scrappy press conferences.
if you ask smart aleck questions ill give you smart aleck answers he called publisher william randolph hearst the no.
1 whore monger of our time columnist westbrook pegler the greatest character assas truman and the cold war 1217 sin in the united states and richard nixon a shifty eyed god damned liar the plain speaking man from missouri resembled his hero andrew jackson in his decisiveness bluntness folksy manner salty language and raw courage.
despite his lack of executive experience truman was confident and s elf assured and he needed to be.
managing the transition from war to peace both at home and abroad was a monumental task.
he was expected to lead america into a postwar era complicated by the cold war and the need to rebuild europe and asia.
he ended up doing better than anyone expected.
a common man who be harry s truman the successor to came president at an uncommon time franklin roosevelt who led the united truman rose above his limitations to states out of the second world war do extraordinary things.
he never pre and into the cold war.
tended to be something he was not as he admitted he was an ordinary human being who has been lucky during a visit in 1952 british leader winston churchill confessed to truman that initially he had held him in very low regard.
i loathed your taking the place of franklin roosevelt.
i misjudged you badly.
since that time you more than any other man have saved western civilization origins of the cold war historians have long debated the unanswerable question was the united states or the soviet union more responsible for the onset of the cold war.
the conventional view argues that the soviets led by josef stalin a ruthless communist dictator set out to dominate the globe after 1945.
the united states had no choice but to defend democratic capitalist values.
by contrast revisionist historians insist that instead of continuing roosevelts efforts to collaborate with the soviets president truman pursued a confrontational foreign policy that aggravated tensions.
yet such an interpretation fails to recognize that truman inherited a deteriorating relationship with the soviets.
both sides in the postwar world were captives of a nuclear nightmare of fear suspicion and posturing.
in retrospect the onset of the cold war seems to have been inevitable.
americas commitment to capitalism political s elf determination and religious freedom conflicted dramatically with the soviet unions preference for controlling 1218 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 its neighbors enforcing ideological conformity and prohibiting religious practices.
insecurity as much as communist ideology drove much of soviet behavior after the second world war.
russia after all had been invaded by germany twice in the first half of the twentieth century and some 23 million people died as a result.
soviet leaders were determined to create loyal nations on their borders for protection.
the people of eastern europe were caught in the middle.
conflicts with the soviets the wartime military alliance against nazism disintegrated after 1945 as the soviet union violated the promises it had made at the yalta conference and imposed military control and the communist political system on the nations of eastern europe it had liberated.
on may 12 1945 four days after victory in europe winston churchill asked truman what is to happen about europe.
an iron curtain is drawn down upon the russian front.
we do not know what is going on behind it churchill and truman wanted to lift the iron curtain and help those nations develop democratic governments.
but events during the second half of 1945 dashed those expectations.
as early as the spring of 1945 and continuing for the next two years the soviet union systematically imprisoned half of the european continent.
the red army ran amok raping and killing the liberated citizens of eastern europe.
thereafter the soviets systematically installed puppet governments across central and eastern europe albania bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland romania and yugoslavia.
totalitarian regimes essentially turned once proud nations into soviet colonies.
in their ruthless pursuit of total control the soviets eliminated all political parties except the communists created secret police forces took control of intellectual and cultural life including the mass media undermined the roman catholic church and organized a process of ethnic cleansing whereby whole populations 12 million germans as well as poles and h ungarians were relocated from their homes in eastern europe usually to west germany or to prisons.
more than 500 000 of the refugees died in the process.
anyone who opposed the s oviet installed regimes was exiled silenced executed or imprisoned.
stalins promises at the yalta conference to allow open elections in the nations of eastern europe controlled by soviet armies had turned out to be lies.
in a fit of candor he admitted that a freely elected government in any of these countries would be anti soviet and that we cannot allow u s secretary of state james f byrnes tried to use americas monopoly on atomic bombs to pressure the soviets to abide by the yalta accords.
in april 1945 he suggested to president truman that nuclear weapons might well put us in position to dictate our own terms with the soviets at the end of the containment policy 1219 the war the soviets however paid little attention in part because their spies had kept them informed of what american scientists had been doing and in part because they were developing their own atomic bombs.
throughout the spring of 1945 the soviets created friendly governments in eastern europe arguing that the united states had done the same in italy and japan after those nations had surrendered.
the difference was that the soviets prevented non communists from participating in the political process.
a few days before the opening of the conference to organize the united nations in april truman met with soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov.
the soviets had just put in place a p ro communist government in poland in violation of stalins pledge at yalta to allow free elections.
truman directed molotov to tell stalin that the united states expected the soviet leader to live up to his agreements.
i have never been talked to like that in my life molotov angrily replied.
carry out your agreements truman snapped and you wont get talked to like that later in july 1945 when truman met stalin at the potsdam conference he wrote his mother that he had never seen such pig headed people as are the russians he later acknowledged that the soviets broke their promises as soon as the unconscionable russian dictator stalin returned to moscow truman added with a note of embarrassment and i liked the little son of a bitch the containment policy by the beginning of 1947 relations with the soviet union had grown ice cold.
a year before in february 1946 stalin had proclaimed the superiority of the soviet communist system of government and declared that peace was impossible under the present capitalist development of the world economy his provocative statement suggesting an inevitable war between communism and capitalism led the state department to ask for an analysis of soviet communism from forty two year old george frost kennan the best informed expert on the soviet union then working in the u s embassy in moscow.
kennan responded on february 22 1946 with a famous 5 000 word long telegram the longest in the history of the state department.
he included considerable detail about russian history the pillars of soviet policy stalins neurotic view of world affairs and russias historic determination to protect its western border with europe.
kennan explained that the soviet union was founded on a rigid ideology marxism leninism which saw a fundamental global conflict between communist and capitalist nations and helped soviet rulers justify their amoral 1220 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 actions.
they could not imagine permanent peaceful coexistence with capitalist nations and were fanatically committed to the necessity of perpetual tension and conflict.
in this regard kennan implied franklin roosevelt had mistakenly assumed that his personal diplomacy with stalin would ensure that the soviets behaved.
kennan insisted instead that stalin needed external enemies to maintain his totalitarian power at home.
the soviet goal according to kennan was to build military strength while subverting the stability of the capitalist democracies.
the best way for the united states to deal with such an ideological foe he advised was through patient persistent and firm strategic efforts to contain soviet george f kennan a specialist in the expansionism without resorting to history and behavior of the soviet union war.
the economic power of capitalist american diplomat george kennan democracies was their greatest asset.
developed the rationale for containment at the heart of the truman doctrine.
creating unalterable counterforce to communist expansionism kennan predicted would eventually cause either the breakup or the gradual mellowing of soviet power because communism in kennans view was an inherently unstable system that would eventually collapse.
new secretary of state george c marshall the austere but much revered commander of the u s armed forces during the war was so impressed by kennans analysis that he put him in charge of the state departments policy planning office.
no other american diplomat at the time forecast so accurately what would happen to the soviet union some forty years later.
as kennan recalled my reputation was made.
my voice now carried kennan later acknowledged that his long telegram suffered from excessive optimism and occasional vagueness.
in its broadest dimensions its call for firm and vigilant containment echoed the outlook of truman and his advisers and would guide u s foreign policy for decades.
but how exactly were the united states and its allies to contain the soviet unions expansionist tendencies.
how should the united states respond to the containment policy 1221 soviet aggression around the world.
kennan left the task of containing communism to truman and his advisers most of whom unlike kennan considered containment to be as much a military doctrine as a political strategy.
in 1946 civil war broke out in greece between an authoritarian monarchy backed by the british and a c ommunist led insurgency supported by the soviets.
on february 21 1947 the financially strapped british informed the u s government that they could no longer provide economic and military aid to greece and would withdraw in five weeks.
truman quickly conferred with congressional leaders one of whom republican senator arthur vandenburg of michigan warned the president that he would need to scare the hell out of the american people about the menace of communism to gain public support for his aid program.
truman was eager to do so for he had grown tired of babying the russians the truman doctrine on march 12 1947 president truman gave a national radio speech in which he asked congress for 400 million for economic and military assistance for greece and turkey.
more important the president announced what came to be known as the truman doctrine.
to ensure congressional support he intentionally exaggerated the danger of a communist takeover in greece.
like a row of dominoes truman predicted the fall of greece would topple the other nations of the eastern mediterranean then western europe.
to prevent such a catastrophe he said the united states must support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures in this single sentence the president established the foundation of u s foreign policy for the next forty years.
in essence he was declaring war on communism everywhere.
in trumans view shared by later presidents the assumptions of the domino theory made an aggressive containment strategy against communism a necessity.
trumans speech generated widespread public support.
the new york times said that his message was clear the epoch of isolation is ended.
it is being replaced by an epoch of american responsibility at the state department secretary of state marshall announced that we are now concerned with the peace of the entire world still marshall and others feared that trumans speech was unnecessarily provocative.
george kennan cringed at the presidents grandiose commitment to contain communism everywhere.
in kennans view trumans militarized view of the cold war was a foolish crusade an open ended ideological confrontation without limits rather than a policy with an accompanying program of steps capable of implementation.
efforts to contain communism needed to 1222 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 be selective rather than universal political and economic rather than military the united states could not intervene in every hot spot around the world.
walter lippmann the nations leading political journalist characterized trumans policy of global a nti communism as a strategic monstrosity that would entangle the united states in endless international disputes and force it to partner with right wing dictatorships as turned out to be the case.
truman and his advisers rejected such concerns.
in 1947 congress approved the presidents request for economic and military assistance to greece and neighboring turkey.
the marshall plan in the spring of 1947 most of postwar europe remained broke shattered and desperate.
factories had been bombed to rubble railroads and bridges had been destroyed millions were homeless starving and jobless and political unrest was growing.
by 1947 socialist and communist parties were emerging in many european nations including italy france and belgium.
the crises among the struggling european democracies required bold action.
the united states stepped into the breach.
in may 1947 secretary of state george c marshall delivered a speech at harvard university in which he outlined americas policy toward europe in nonideological terms.
building upon suggestions given him by george kennan and others he called for massive financial and technical assistance to rescue europe including the soviet union.
what came to be known as the marshall plan was intended to reconstruct the european economy neutralize communist insurgencies and build up foreign markets for american products.
as truman said the american capitalist system can survive only if it is part of a world system but the marshall plan was also part of trumans effort to contain the expansionist tendencies its the same thing the marshall plan which distributed massive amounts of economic aid throughout postwar europe is represented in this 1949 cartoon as a modern tractor driven by a prosperous farmer.
in the foreground a poor overworked man is yoked to an o ld fashioned soviet plow forced to go over the ground of the marshal stalin plan while stalin himself tries to persuade others that its the same thing without mechanical problems the containment policy 1223 of the soviet union by reestablishing a strong western europe anchored in american values.
the americans said a british official want an integrated europe looking like the united states of america in december 1947 truman submitted marshalls proposal to congress.
initially republican critics dismissed it as new dealism for europe.
however two months later on february 25 1948 a c ommunist led coup in czechoslovakia the last nation in eastern europe with a democratic government ensured the marshall plans passage.
from 1948 until 1951 the marshall plan provided 13 billion to sixteen european nations.
the soviet union however refused to participate and forced the eastern european countries under its control albania bulgaria poland romania yugoslavia to refuse to participate as well.
the marshall plan officially called the european recovery plan worked as hoped.
by 1951 western europes industrial production had soared to 40 percent above prewar levels and its farm output was larger than ever.
englands economist magazine called the marshall plan an act without peer in history it became the most successful peacetime diplomatic initiative in american history.
divided germany although the marshall plan drew the nations of western europe closer together it increased tensions with the soviet union as stalin saw it as a way to weaken soviet influence in the region.
the breakdown of the wartime alliance between the united states and the soviet union also left the problem of postwar germany unsettled.
in 1945 berlin the german capital had been divided into four sectors or zones each governed by one of the four principal allied nations the united states france great britain and the soviet union.
the devastated german economy continued to languish requiring the u s army to provide food and basic necessities to millions of civilians.
slowly the allied occupation zones evolved into functioning governments.
in 1948 the british french and americans united their three administrative zones into one and developed a common currency to be used in west germany as well as in west berlin a city of 2 4 million people which was more than 100 miles inside the soviet occupation zone of east germany.
the west germans also organized state governments and began drafting a federal constitution.
the political unification of west germany and its economic recovery infuriated stalin who was determined to keep germany weak.
and the status of divided berlin had become a powder keg.
in march 1948 stalin prevented the new west german currency from being delivered to berlin.
then on june 23 he ordered the soviet army occupying eastern germany to stop all road and 1224 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 family reunion a girl gives her grandmother a kiss through the barbed wire fence that divides the dutch german frontier in 1947 rail traffic into west berlin.
the blockade he hoped would force the united states and its allies to leave the divided city.
the americans interpreted stalins blockade as a tipping point in the cold war.
when berlin falls predicted general lucius d clay the u s army commander in germany western germany will be next.
communism will run rampant the united states thus faced a dilemma risk a third world war by using force to break the soviet blockade or begin a humiliating retreat from west berlin leaving the residents to be swallowed up by communism.
truman who prided himself on his decisiveness the buck stops here made clear his stance we stay in berlin period the united states announced an embargo against all goods exported from soviet controlled eastern germany and began organizing a massive airlift to provide food and supplies to west berliners.
by october 1948 the u s and british air forces were flying in 7 000 tons of food fuel medicine coal and equipment to berlin each day.
to support the airlift and prepare for a possible war thousands of former military pilots were called back into service.
truman revived the military draft and congress provided emergency funds to increase military spending.

at times it seemed that the two superpowers were on the verge of war.
for all the threats and harsh words however the berlin airlift went on for eleven months without any shots being fired.
finally on may 12 1949 the soviets lifted their blockade in part because bad russian harvests had made them desperate for food grown in western germany.
the berlin airlift was the first major victory for the west in the cold war and the unprecedented efforts of the united states and great britain to supply west berliners transformed most of them from defeated adversaries into devoted allies.
in may 1949 as the soviet blockade was ending the federal republic of germany west germany was founded.
in october the soviet controlled german democratic republic east germany came into being.
forming alliances the soviet blockade of berlin convinced the united states and its allies that they needed to act together to stop further communist expansion into western europe.
on april 4 1949 the north atlantic treaty was signed by twelve nations the united states great britain france belgium the netherlands luxembourg canada denmark iceland italy norway and portugal.
greece and turkey joined the alliance in 1952 west germany in 1955 and spain in 1982.

the creation of nato marked the high point of efforts to contain soviet expansion.
in 1949 congress provided 1 billion in military equipment to nato members.
by joining nato the united states for the first time since its alliance with france during the revolutionary w ar committed itself to go to war on behalf of its allies.

wwn64 figure m27 1 first proof the containment policy 1227 reorganizing the military the onset of the cold war and the emergence of nuclear weapons led truman to restructure the way the u s armed forces were managed.
in 1947 congress passed the national security act which created a department of defense to oversee the three military branches the army navy and air f orce and the national security council nsc an advisory group of the governments top specialists in international relations.
the act made permanent the joint chiefs of staff a wartime innovation bringing together the leaders of all branches of the armed forces.
it also established the central intelligence agency cia to coordinate global i ntelligence gathering activities.
in 1952 truman created the national security agency nsa within the defense department.
its charge was to encrypt government communications to ensure their privacy and to intercept the communications of other nations.
the nsa also provided surveillance of americans targeted as potential threats.
a jewish nation israel at the same time that the united states was helping to form new alliances it was helping to form a new nation.
palestine the biblical holy land had been a british protectorate since 1919.
for hundreds of years jews throughout the world had dreamed of returning to their ancestral homeland of israel and its ancient capital zion a part of jerusalem.
many zionists jews who wanted a separate jewish nation had migrated there.
more arrived during and after the nazi persecution of european jews.
hitlers effort to exterminate the jews convinced many that their only hope for a secure future was to create their own nation.
late in 1947 the united nations voted to divide partition palestine into separate jewish and arab states.
the jews readily agreed but the arabs were fiercely opposed.
palestine was their ancestral home too jerusalem was as holy to muslims as it was to jews and christians.
arabs viewed the creation of a jewish nation in palestine as an act of war and they attacked israel in early 1948.
hundreds were killed before the haganah jewish militia won control of most of palestine.
when british oversight of palestine officially expired on may 14 1948 david ben gurion the jewish leader in palestine proclaimed israels independence.
president truman officially recognized the new israeli nation within minutes as did the soviet union.
one million jews most of them european immigrants now had their own nation.
early the next morning however the arab league n ations lebanon syria iraq jordan and egypt invaded israel beginning a period of nearly constant warfare in the holy land.
mediators from the un gradually worked out a truce agreement restoring an uneasy peace by may 11 1949 when israel 1228 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 joined the united nations.
israel was allowed to keep all its conquered territories including the whole palestine coast.
the palestinian arabs lost everything.
most of them became stateless refugees who scattered into neighboring lebanon jordan and egypt.
stored up resentments and sporadic warfare between israel and the arab states have festered ever since complicating u s foreign policy which has tried to maintain friendships with both sides but has usually tilted toward israel.
expanding the new deal for the most part republicans and democrats in congress cooperated with president truman on issues related to the cold war though often grudgingly.
senator claude pepper a liberal democrat from florida insisted that if franklin roosevelt were still alive wed be getting on better with russia republican senator robert a taft of ohio accused truman of appeasing russia a policy which has sacrificed throughout eastern europe and asia the freedom of many nations and millions of people on domestic issues however truman faced widespread opposition.
the c ost cutting republicans in congress hoped that they could end the new deal as the war drew to a close.
from war to peace in september 1945 truman called congress into a special emergency session at which he presented a twenty one point program to guide the nations reconversion from wartime back to peacetime.
massive government spending during the war had ended the great depression and brought about full employment but trumans postwar challenge was to ensure that the peacetime economy absorbed the millions of men and women who had served in the armed forces and were now seeking civilian jobs.
during the second half of 1945 and throughout 1946 some 700 000 people in uniform mostly men returned to civilian life.
by 1947 the armed forces had shrunk from 12 million to 1 5 million.
fears of massive unemployment in defense related industries led people to worry about another depression.
a new york times headline predicted 5 000 000 expected to lose arms jobs truman called for unemployment insurance to cover more workers a higher minimum wage construction of massive low cost public housing projects regional development projects to put military veterans to work and much more.
a powerful republican congressman named joseph w martin was stunned by the scope of trumans proposals.
not even president roosevelt he gasped ever asked for so much at one sitting expanding the new deal 1229 drugstore in bronxville ny america quickly demobilized after the long war effort turning its attention to the pursuit of abundance.
trumans primary goal was to prevent prolonged unemployment while avoiding the bitter mistakes that had produced wild price inflation and a recession after the first world war.
he also wanted to retain for a while the wartime controls on wages prices and rents as well as the rationing of scarce food items.
most of all he wanted to minimize unemployment as workers in defense plants were laid off and millions of military veterans went looking for civilian jobs.
truman called on congress to guarantee every american a job.
congress refused to go that far.
instead it approved the employment act of 1946 which authorized truman and the federal government to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power liberals were disappointed by the new presidents inability to win over legislators.
alas for truman said the new republic there was no bugle note in his voice to rally public opinion.
what one misses said max lerner an influential journalist is the confident sense of direction that roosevelt gave despite all the contradictions of his policy throughout 1946 republicans and conservative southern democrats in congress balked at most of trumans efforts to revive or expand new deal 1230 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 programs.
the great depression was over critics stressed.
different times demanded different programs or none at all.
the end of the war caused s hort term economic problems but not the postwar depression many had feared.
many women who had been recruited to work in defense industries were shoved out as men took off uniforms and looked for jobs.
at a shipyard in california the foreman gathered the women workers and told them to go welcome the troop ships as they pulled into port.
the next day all of the women were let go to make room for male veterans.
still several shock absorbers cushioned the economic impact of demobilization.
they included federal unemployment insurance and other social security benefits and the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 known as the gi bill of rights under which the federal government spent 13 billion on military veterans for education vocational training medical treatment unemployment insurance and loans for building houses and starting new businesses.
wages prices and labor unrest the most acute economic problem truman faced was the postwar spike in prices charged for consumer goods.
during the war the government had frozen wages and prices and banned strikes by labor unions.
when wartime economic controls were removed prices for scarce consumer items shot up spurring labor unions to demand pay increases.
when raises were not provided a record number of postwar strikes erupted in 1945 1946 exacerbating the shortages of consumer goods.
workers at general motors went on strike for almost four months making it much more difficult for people to buy a car.
never before or since had so many american workers walked off the job in one year.
labor disputes crippled the crucial coal and railroad industries.
like theodore roosevelt before him truman grew frustrated with the stubbornness of both management and labor leaders.
he took federal control of the coal mines whereupon the mine owners agreed to union demands.
in may 1946 truman threatened to draft striking railroad workers into the military if they did not go back to work.
his threat probably illegal did the trick but it embittered many workers who had long voted democratic.
a leading union official announced that organized labor is through with truman trumans efforts to control rising prices were equally controversial.
on june 30 1946 he lifted wartime controls on consumer prices.
within days prices for groceries skyrocketed rising in two weeks as much as they had risen in the previous three years.
so truman restored price controls.
ranchers were so upset by the presidents change of course that they refused to sell their cattle for slaughter.
suddenly there was a beefsteak crisis as consumers complained that the supply of food was worse than it had been during the war.
expanding the new deal 1231 time magazines washington based political reporter alerted his editor that truman was so unpopular he could not carry missouri now on october 14 just three weeks before the midterm congressional elections truman announced that he was removing price controls on meat.
steaks and hamburger meat soon appeared on grocery shelves but prices again soared.
a republican political strategist loved the turn of events telling his colleagues that the tide is sweepin our way and it was.
political cooperation and conflict during the congressional election campaigns in 1946 republicans adopted a simple four word slogan had enough.
vote republican using loudspeakers republicans drove through city streets saying ladies if you want meat vote republican a union leader tagged truman the no.
1 strikebreaker while much of the public upset by the unions price increases food shortages and the scarcity of automobiles and affordable housing blamed the strikes on the white house.
labor unions had emerged from the war with more power than ever before.
some 14 5 million workers more than a third of the workforce were now unionized.
members had tended to vote democratic but not in the 1946 elections which gave the republicans majorities in both houses of congress for the first time since 1928.
the new deal is kaput one newspaper editor crowed.
the chicago tribune claimed that americans had won the greatest victory for the republic since appomattox the president taunted the united ne termer even many democrats had soured on truman states news is a o circulating a slogan that expressed their frustration im just mild about harry the new republican congress that convened in early 1947 reflected the national discontent.
it curbed the power of unions by passing the taft hartley labor act of 1947 officially called the labor management relations act.
the law allowed employers to campaign against efforts to form unions and outlawed unions from coercing workers to join or refusing to negotiate grievances.
the t aft hartley act also required union leaders to take loyalty oaths declaring that they were not members of the communist party banned strikes by federal employees and imposed a cooling off period of eighty days on any strike that the president deemed dangerous to the public welfare.
yet the most troubling element of the new bill was a provision that allowed state legislatures to pass right to work laws that ended the practice of forcing all wage workers at a company to join a union once a majority voted to unionize.
in a show of support for organized labor truman vetoed the taft hartley bill which unions called the s lave labor act he denounced the shocking bill as bad for labor bad for management and bad for the country w orking class 1232 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 fight for desegregation demonstrators led by activist a philip randolph left picket the democratic national convention on july 12 1948 calling for racial integration of the armed forces.
democrats were delighted.
many unionists who had gone over to the republicans in 1946 returned to the democrats because of trumans strong support.
journalist james wechsler reported that mr.
truman has reached the crucial fork in the road and turned unmistakably to the left congress however overturned the presidents veto and t aft hartley became law.
the number of strikes dropped sharply thereafter and representatives of management and labor learned to work together.
at the same time by 1954 fifteen state legislatures mainly in the south and west had used the taft h artley act to pass right to work laws forbidding union only workplaces.
those states thereafter recruited industries to relocate because of their low wages and nonunion policies.
civil rights another of trumans challenges was the bigotry faced by returning african american soldiers.
when one black veteran arrived home in a uniform decorated with combat medals he was welcomed by a white neighbor who said dont you forget.
that youre still a nigger the second world war had changed americas racial landscape in important ways however.
as a new york times editorial explained in early 1946 this is a particularly good time to campaign against the evils of bigotry prejudice expanding the new deal 1233 and race hatred because we have witnessed the defeat of enemies who tried to found a mastery of the world upon such cruel and fallacious policy african americans had fought in large numbers to overthrow the nazi regime of government sponsored racism and returning veterans were unwilling to put up with racial abuse at home.
the cold war also gave political leaders added incentive to improve race relations.
the soviets often compared racism in the united states to the nazis brutalization of the jews.
in the ideological contest against capitalism communists highlighted examples of american racism to win influence among the newly emerging nations of africa.
black veterans who spoke out against racial bigotry often risked their lives.
in 1946 two african american couples in rural georgia were gunned down by a white mob.
one of the murderers explained that george dorsey one of the victims was a good nigger until he went into the army.
but when he came out he thought he was as good as any white people in the fall of 1946 a delegation of civil rights activists urged president truman to condemn the ku klux klan and the lynching of african americans.
the delegation graphically described incidents of torture and intimidation against blacks in the south.
truman was horrified my god.
i had no idea that it was as terrible as that.
weve got to do something truman thereupon appointed a committee on civil rights to investigate violence against african americans.
a year later with trumans endorsement the commission issued a report to secure these rights which called for a federal anti lynching bill abolition of the poll tax designed to keep poor blacks from voting a voting rights act an end to racial segregation in the armed forces and a ban on racial segregation in public transportation.
southern democrats were furious.
south carolina governor j strom thurmond warned truman that the southern democratic vote was no longer in the bag thurmond would soon leave the party to form the dixiecrats in opposition to truman.
on july 26 1948 truman took a bolder step when he banned racial discrimination in the federal government.
four days later he issued an executive order ending racial segregation in the armed forces.
the air force and navy quickly complied but the army dragged its feet until the early 1950s.
by 1960 however the armed forces were the most racially integrated of all national organizations.
desegregating the military was truman claimed the greatest thing that ever happened to america jackie robinson meanwhile racial segregation was being dismantled in a much more public area professional baseball.
in april 1947 the brooklyn dodgers roster included the first african american to play major 1234 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 jackie robinson robinsons unfaltering courage and superior athletic skills prompted the integration of sports drawing african american and latino spectators to the games.
here he greets his dominican fans at trujillo high school in santo domingo.
league baseball jack roosevelt jackie robinson.
he was born in 1919 in a georgia sharecroppers cabin the grandson of slaves.
six months later his father left town with a neighbors wife never to return.
robinsons mother moved the family to pasadena california where jackie became a marvelous all around athlete.
at ucla he was the first athlete in school history to letter in four sports baseball basketball football and track.
after serving in the army during world war ii he began playing professional baseball in the s o called negro leagues.
he did so well that major league scouts reported that he could play in the big leagues.
at that point branch rickey the president and general manager of the brooklyn dodgers interviewed robinson for three hours on august 28 1945.
rickey asked robinson if he could face racial abuse without losing his temper.
robinson was shocked are you looking for a negro who is afraid to fight back rickey replied that he needed a pathbreaking negro player with guts enough not to fight back robinson assured him he was the best candidate to integrate baseball if you want to take this gamble i will promise there will be no incident he then signed robinson to a contract for 600 a month.
rickey expanding the new deal 1235 explained to his critics that he had found a terrific player who was a strong quiet warrior of incomparable courage capable of looking the other way when provoked.
and he was often provoked.
soon after robinson arrived for preseason practice many of his white dodger teammates refused to take the field with him.
manager leo durocher would have none of that.
as he told the team i dont care if the guy is yellow or black or if he has stripes.
im the manager of this team and i say he plays during the 1947 season teammates and opposing players viciously baited robinson.
pitchers hit him base runners spiked him and spectators booed him and drenched him in beer even as he led the dodgers to the national league championship and eventually six world series appearances.
in cincinnati reds fans posted a sign reading robinson we are going to kill you if you attempt to enter a ball game as crosley field hotels refused him rooms and restaurants denied him service.
hate mail arrived by the bucketful.
one sportswriter called robinson the loneliest man i have ever seen in sports on the other hand black spectators were electrified by robinsons courageous example and turned out in droves to watch him play.
a headline in a boston newspaper expressed the prevailing sentiment triumph of whole race seen in jackies debut in major league ball as time passed robinson won over many fans and players with his courage wit grit and talent.
as sportswriter red smith observed robinson was an example of the unconquerable doing the impossible during his first season with the dodgers robinson stole twice as many bases as anyone else in the national league and he was named rookie of the year.
between 1949 and 1954 robinson had a batting average of 327 among the best in baseball.
yankees catcher yogi berra said he could beat you in a lot of ways robinsons very presence on the field with lily white teams forced spectators sitting in racially divided bleachers to confront the hypocritical reality of segregation.
other teams soon began signing black players.
racial attitudes were changing slowly.
in 1947 robinson was voted the second most popular american behind singer bing crosby.
my life robinson remembered produced understanding among whites and it gave black people the idea that if i could do it they could do it too that blackness wasnt subservient to anything mexican americans in the far west mexican americans often grouped with other spanish speaking immigrants as hispanics or latinos continued to experience ethnic prejudice.
schools in arizona new mexico texas and california routinely segregated mexican american children from whites.
the 500 000 latino veterans were especially frustrated that their efforts in the war were not rewarded with equality at home.
they were frequently 1236 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 denied access to educational medical and housing benefits available to white servicemen.
some mortuaries even denied funeral services to mexican americans killed in combat.
as a funeral director in texas explained the anglo people would not stand for it to fight such prejudicial treatment mexican american war veterans led by dr hector perez garcia a u s army major who had served as a combat surgeon organized the american gi forum in texas in 1948.
soon there were branches across the nation.
garcia born in mexico in 1914 and raised in texas stressed the importance of formal education to mexican americans.
the organizations motto read education is our freedom and freedom should be everybodys business at a time when mexican americans in texas averaged no more than a third grade education garcia and five of his siblings had completed medical school and become physicians.
yet upon his return from the war he encountered discrimination everywhere.
we had no opportunities.
we had to pay poll taxes to vote.
we had segregated schools.
we were not allowed to go into public places garcia and the gi forum initially focused on veterans issues but soon expanded the organizations scope to include fostering equal opportunities and equal treatment for all people.
the gi forum lobbied to end poll taxes sued for the right of latinos to serve on juries and developed schools for jobless veterans.
in 1984 garcia received the presidential medal of freedom the nations highest civilian honor.
shaping the fair deal during 1947 after less than three years in the white house truman had yet to shake the widespread impression that he was not up to the job.
critics proclaimed that to err is truman the editors of time magazine reflected the national sentiment when they wrote mr.
truman has often faced his responsibilities with a cheerful dogged courage.
but his performance was almost invariably awkward uninspired and above all mediocre voters they added believed that truman means well but he doesnt do well most political analysts assumed that the president would lose his effort to win another term.
truman too feared that he would lose.
in july 1947 he met with general dwight d eisenhower as he was preparing to retire as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
worried that general douglas macarthur a self described right wing republican might be the republican presidential nominee in 1948 truman urged eisenhower to run as the democratic nominee and even offered to be his v ice presidential running mate.
eisenhower declined explaining that he was going to become president of columbia university in new york city.
expanding the new deal 1237 with the presidents popularity sinking the democratic party was about to split in two.
southern conservatives resented trumans outspoken support of civil rights while the left wing of the party resented the firing of secretary of commerce henry a wallace for publicly criticizing the administrations a nti soviet policies.
getting tough with the soviet union wallace had argued never brought anything real and l asting whether for schoolyard bullies or world powers.
the tougher we get the tougher the russians will get wallace had said that the united states had no more business in the political affairs of eastern europe than russia has in the political affairs of latin america the danger of another world war he said is much less from communism than it is from american imperialism wallaces comments so outraged the leaders of the state department that truman felt he had no choice but to get rid of him.
despite the gloomy predictions for 1948 truman mounted an intense reelection campaign.
his first step was to shore up the major elements of the new deal coalition of w orking class voters farmers labor unionists and african americans.
in his 1948 state of the union message truman announced that the programs he would later call his fair deal to distinguish them from roosevelts new deal would build upon the efforts of the new deal to help all americans.
the first goal truman said was to ensure civil rights for all americans.
he added proposals to increase federal aid to education expand unemployment and retirement benefits create a comprehensive system of national health insurance enable more rural people to connect to electricity and increase the minimum wage.
the election of 1948 the republican controlled congress dismissed trumans proposals an action it would later regret.
at the republican convention new york governor thomas e dewey won the presidential nomination on the third ballot.
while the platform endorsed most of the new deal reforms and approved the administrations bipartisan foreign policy dewey promised to run things more efficiently.
in july glum democrats gathered for their convention in philadelphia.
everyone assumed a republican victory in november.
a reporter wrote that they behaved as though they had accepted an invitation to a funeral some party leaders including roosevelts son james a california congressman tried to convince dwight eisenhower to accept the democratic nomination and many others joined his dump truman effort.
the popular war hero declined however explaining that his refusal was final and complete delegates who expected to do little more than go through the motions of nominating truman were doubly surprised first by the battle on the conven 1238 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 birth of the dixiecrats alabama delegates stand to boo trumans call for civil rights before they walked out of the 1948 democratic national convention.
tion floor over civil rights and then by trumans endorsement of civil rights for african americans in his acceptance speech.
liberal democrats led by minnesotas hubert humphrey commended truman for his courageous stand on the issue of civil rights and declared that the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of civil rights white segregationist delegates from alabama and mississippi walked out in protest.
the solidly democratic south had fractured over race.
on july 17 a group of rebellious southern democrats met in birmingham alabama.
while waving confederate flags and singing dixie they nominated south carolinas segregationist governor strom thurmond on a states rights democratic party ticket quickly dubbed the dixiecrat party the dixiecrats denounced trumans infamous civil rights initiatives and championed states rights against federal efforts to change the tradition of white supremacy in the south.
a few days later on july 23 the left wing of the democratic party gathered in philadelphia to form a new progressive party and nominate for president henry a wallace roosevelts former secretary of agriculture and vice president whom truman had fired as secretary of commerce.
one democratic leader asked truman to withdraw from the race to help the partys chances.
he replied i was not brought up to run from a fight expanding the new deal 1239 the splits in the democratic ranks seemed to spell the final blow to truman but he refused to give in.
he was finally renominated long after midnight.
by the time he entered the auditorium it was 2 a m but he aroused the faithful by promising that i will win this election and make the republicans like it he pledged to bring congress into special session and demand that it confront the housing crisis and boost the minimum wage.
within days an invigorated truman set out on a 22 000 mile whistle stop train tour making ten speeches a day scolding the do nothing eightieth congress.

why was civil rights such a divisive issue at the democratic convention.
how did the candidacies of strom thurmond and henry wallace end up wwn64 figurehelping m27 2 truman.
first proof 1240 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 dewey defeats truman trumans victory in 1948 was such a surprise that this early edition of the chicago daily tribune reported that dewey had won.
he charged have the propaganda and the money but we have the people and the people have the votes.
thats why were going to win friendly audiences loved his fighting spirit and dogged courage shouting pour it on harry and give em hell harry truman responded i dont give em hell.
i just tell the truth and they think its hell the polls predicted a sure win for dewey but on election day truman pulled off the biggest upset in history taking 24 2 million votes 49 5 percent to deweys 22 million 45 1 percent and winning a thumping margin of 303 to 189 in the electoral college.
democrats also regained control of both houses of congress.
thurmond and wallace each received more than 1 million votes but the revolt of right and left had worked to trumans advantage.
the dixiecrat rebellion backfired by angering black voters who turned out in droves to support truman and the progressive partys radicalism made it hard for republicans to tag truman as soft on communism.
thurmond carried four southern states south carolina mississippi alabama and louisiana.
the fair deal rejected truman viewed his surprising victory as a mandate for expanding the social welfare programs established by franklin roosevelt.
his state of the union message in early 1949 repeated the agenda he had set forth the year before.
every segment of our population and every individual he declared has a right to expect from our government a fair deal the cold war heats up 1241 trumans fair deal promised greater economic opportunity for the mass of the people most of the fair deal proposals that gained congressional approval were ex tensions or enlargements of new deal programs a higher minimum hourly wage expansion of social security coverage to 10 million workers not included in the original 1935 bill and a large s lum clearance and public housing program.
despite enjoying democratic ma jorities in congress however truman ran up against the same alliance of conservative southern democrats and republicans who had worked against roosevelt in the late 1930s.
the bipartisan conservative coalition nixed most of trumans new programs.
congress rejected several civil rights bills national health insurance federal aid to education and a new approach to subsidizing farmers.
it also turned down trumans requested repeal of the a nti union taft hartley act.
yet the fair deal was not a complete failure.
it laid the foundation for programs that the next generation of reformers would promote.
the cold war heats up as during harry trumans first term global concerns during his second term would again distract him from domestic issues.
in his 1949 inaugural address truman called for a vigilant anti communist foreign policy resting on three pillars the united nations the marshall plan and nato.
none of them could help resolve the civil war in china however.
losing china one of the thorniest postwar problems the chinese civil war was fast coming to a head.
chinese nationalists led by chiang kai shek had been fighting mao zedong and the communists since the 1920s.
after the second world war the communists won over most of the peasants.
by the end of 1949 the nationalist government was forced to flee to the island of epublicans formosa which it renamed taiwan.
trumans critics mostly r asked bitterly who lost china to communism what they did not explain was how truman could have prevented a communist victory without a massive u s military intervention which would have been risky unpopular and expensive.
after 1949 the united states continued to recognize the nationalist government on taiwan as the official government of china delaying formal relations with red china the peoples republic of china for thirty years.
the soviets develop atomic bombs as the communists were gaining control of china news that the soviets had detonated a nuclear weapon in 1949 frightened people around the world and led truman to speed 1242 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 up the design of a hydrogen superbomb a weapon far more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on japan.
that the soviets now possessed atomic weapons greatly intensified every cold war confrontation.
there is only one thing worse than one nation having an atomic bomb said nobel prize winning physicist harold c urey.
thats two nations having it the fear of nuclear annihilation joined the fear of communism in deepening the red scare.
nsc 68 in january 1950 president truman grew so concerned about the soviets possessing atomic weapons that he asked the national security council to assess americas changing role in the cold war world.
four months later the council submitted a top secret report mao zedong chairman of the chinese nsc 68.

but where he had focused on political and economic counterpressure the reports tone was global and militaristic calling for a policy of calculated and gradual coercion against soviet expansionism everywhere.
paul nitze kennans successor as director of policy planning for the state department was the reports primary author.
he claimed that the soviets driven to impose their will on the rest of the world were becoming increasingly reckless and would invade western europe by 1954 by which time they would have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the united states.

especially as the united states became involved in an unexpected war in korea that ignited into open combat the smoldering animosity between communism and capitalism around the world.
war in korea by the mid 1950s tensions between the united states and the soviet union in europe had temporarily eased as a result of the balance of terror created by both sides having atomic weapons.
in asia however the situation remained turbulent.
the communists had gained control of mainland china and were threatening to destroy the chinese nationalists who had taken refuge on taiwan.
japan meanwhile was experiencing a dramatic recovery from the devastation caused by u s bombing raids during the second world war.
douglas macarthur showed deft leadership as the consul in charge of u s occupied japan.
he oversaw the disarming of the japanese military the drafting of a 1244 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 democratic constitution and the nations economic recovery all of which were turning japan into americas friend.
to the east however tensions between north and south korea threatened to erupt into civil war.
the japanese had occupied the korean peninsula since 1910 but after they were defeated and withdrew in 1945 the victorious allies had faced the difficult task of creating an independent korean nation.
a divided korea complicating that effort was the presence of soviet troops in northern korea.
they had accepted the surrender of japanese forces above the 38th parallel which divides the korean peninsula while u s forces had overseen the japanese surrender south of the line.
the soviets quickly organized a communist government the democratic peoples republic of korea north korea.
the americans countered by helping to establish a democratic government in the more populous south the republic of korea south korea.
by the end of 1948 separate regimes had appeared in the two sectors soviet and american forces had withdrawn and some 2 million north koreans had fled to south korea.
war erupts on january 12 1950 secretary of state dean acheson gave a speech to the national press club in washington d c in which he said he was often asked has the state department got an asian policy he stressed that the united states had assumed the necessity of.
the military defense of japan he then added that america had created a defensive perimeter running along the aleutian islands off the coast of alaska to japan to the ryukyu islands to the philippines.
where other areas in the pacific are concerned acheson added it must be clear that no person can guarantee these areas against military attack achesons statement came back to haunt him.
on june 24 1950 the secretary of state telephoned president truman mr.
president he reported i have very serious news.
the north koreans have invaded south korea with the encouragement of the soviet union and communist china the s oviet equipped north korean peoples army had rapidly forced the south korean forces into a headlong retreat.
within three days seoul the south korean capital was captured and only 22 000 of the 100 000 south korean soldiers were still capable of combat.
people then and since have argued that achesons clumsy reference to the defensive perimeter in asia may have convinced the north koreans and soviets that the united states would not resist an invasion of south korea.
when reporters asked truman how he would respond to the invasion the president declared by god im going to let them have it he assumed correctly that the north korean attack had been encouraged by the soviets.
theres no telling what theyll do if we dont put up a fight right now truman predicted.
he then made a critical decision without consulting the joint the cold war heats up 1245 fight and flight american soldiers and korean civilian refugees march into the nakdong river region in the south.
chiefs of staff or the congress he decided to wage war through the backing of the united nations rather than by seeking a declaration of war from congress.
he knew that a congressional debate over a war in korea would take so long that it may then be too late to stop the communists.
an emergency meeting of the un security council in late june 1950 censured the north korean breach of peace by sheer coincidence the soviet delegate who held a veto power was at the time boycotting the council because it would not seat communist china in place of nationalist china.
on june 27 the security council called on un members to furnish such assistance to the republic of korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area truman then ordered u s air naval and ground forces into action and appointed seventy year old douglas macarthur supreme commander of the un forces.
the attack on south korea truman said made it plain beyond all doubt that the international communist movement is prepared to use armed invasion to conquer independent nations trumans decisive steps gained strong bipartisan approval but neither the nation nor the administration were united on the objectives of the war or its conduct.
1246 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 the korean conflict was the first military action authorized by the united nations and some twenty other nations participated.
the united states provided the largest contingent by far some 330 000 troops.
the american defense of south korea set a worrisome precedent war by order of a president rather than by a vote of congress which the u s constitution requires.
truman dodged the issue by officially calling the conflict a police action rather than a war.
critics labeled it mr.
trumans war turning the tables the korean war featured brutal combat in terrible conditions punctuated by heavy casualties and widespread destruction on both sides.
for the first three months the fighting in korea went badly for the republic of korea rok and the un forces.
by september 1950 the decimated south korean troops were barely hanging on at pusan at the southern tip of the korean peninsula.
then in a brilliant maneuver on september 15 general macarthur staged a surprise amphibious landing behind the north korean lines at inchn the port city for seoul some 150 miles north of pusan.
un troops drove a wedge through the north korean army only a quarter of whom some 25 000 soldiers managed to flee across the border.
days later south korean troops recaptured seoul.
at that point the vainglorious macarthur became overconfident and persuaded truman to allow u s troops to push across the 38th parallel into north korea.
containment of communism was no longer enough macarthur now sought to rid north korea of the red menace even if this meant expanding the war into china to prevent the chinese from resupplying their north korean allies.
the chinese intervene by october 1950 un forces were about to capture the north korean capital pyngyang.
president truman concerned that macarthurs move would provoke communist china to enter the war repeatedly asked the u s commander to meet with him in washington d c only to be rebuffed.
finally the president flew 7 000 miles to wake island to meet with macarthur who contemptuously refused to salute his commander in chief.
at the meeting on october 15 macarthur dismissed chinese threats to intervene even though they had massed troops on the korean border.
that same day the communist government in beijing announced that china cannot stand idly by as its north korean allies were humiliated.
on october 20 un forces entered the north korean capital and on october 26 advance units reached chosan on the yalu river north koreas border with china.
macarthur predicted total victory by christmas.
instead he blundered into a catastrophe.
on the night of november 25 some 300 000 chinese volunteers the cold war heats up 1247 the korean war 1950 and 1950 1953 china ussr r china manchuria ussr r ve farthest un advance nov 1950 north korea chosan.

we ran like antelopes said an american soldier.
at the chosin reservoir the first marine division was surrounded by seven chinese divisions.
their desperate situation was worsened by minus 40 degree cold nights.
when asked how the u s retreat was going marine general oliver p smith replied retreat hell.
were not retreating were just advancing in a different direction smith eventually directed an ingenious breakout by the marines that saved the division from total destruction.
still the un forces were in retreat.
by january 15 the communist chinese and north koreans had recaptured seoul.
what had started as a defensive war 1248 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 against north korean aggression had become an unlimited war against the north koreans and chinas peoples liberation army.
macarthur crosses the line the chinese intervention caught macarthur wholly unprepared.
he now asked for thirty four atomic bombs and proposed air raids on china explaining to president truman and the joint chiefs of staff that if we lose the war to communism in asia the fall of europe is inevitable his plans horrified the military leadership in washington d c.
it would be said general omar bradley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong enemy truman agreed.
in late 1950 the un forces rallied.
by january 1951 they had secured their lines below seoul and launched a counterattack.
when truman began negotiations with north korea to restore the prewar boundary macarthur undermined the president by issuing an ultimatum for china to make peace or suffer an attack.
on april 5 on the floor of congress the republican minority leader read a letter from macarthur that criticized the president and said that there is no substitute for victory such open insubordination left truman only two choices he could accept macarthurs aggressive demands or fire him.
sacking a hero on april 11 1951 with civilian control of the military at stake truman removed macarthur and replaced him with general matthew b ridgway a commander who better understood how to conduct a modern war in pursuit of limited objectives.
i believe that we must try to limit the war to korea truman explained.
a number of events have made it evident that general macarthur did not agree with that policy.
i have therefore considered it essential to relieve general macarthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy trumans sacking of macarthur the armys only five star general divided the nation.
dean acheson the secretary of state had warned the president that if you relieve macarthur you will have the biggest fight of your administration time magazine reported that seldom had a more unpopular man fired a more popular one senator joseph mccarthy called the president a son of a bitch for sacking macarthur.
in his diary truman noted the ferocious backlash against him quite an explosion.
letters of abuse by the dozens sixty six percent of americans initially opposed trumans decision.
douglas macarthur was a larger than life military hero and was greeted by adoring crowds upon his return to the united states.
republicans in congress protested his removal but truman stood firm i fired him because he wouldnt respect the authority of the president.
i didnt fire him because he was a dumb the cold war heats up 1249 son of a bitch although he was but thats not against the law for generals.
if it was half to three quarters of them would be in jail that all of the top military leaders supported trumans decision deflated much of the criticism.
why hell if macarthur had had his way the president warned hed have had us in the third world war and blown up two thirds of the world a cease fire on june 24 1951 the soviet representative at the united nations proposed a cease fire in korea along the 38th parallel the original dividing line between north and south.
secretary of state acheson accepted the cease fire armistice with the con firing of macarthur in this 1951 sent of the united nations.
china and cartoon by l j roche president harry truman secretary of state north korea responded favorably.
dean acheson and the pentagon truce talks started on july 10 1951 dance in the american publics at panmunjm only to drag on for two proverbial frying pan for the removal years while sporadic fighting contin of general douglas macarthur from his post as the supreme commander ued.
the chief snags were exchanges of u n forces in korea.
of prisoners many captured north korean and chinese soldiers did not want to go home and south koreas insistence on unification of the two rival koreas.
syngman rhee the south korean leader explained that an armistice without national unification is a death sentence without protest by the time a truce was reached on july 27 1953 truman had retired and dwight d eisenhower was president.
no peace treaty was ever signed and korea like germany remained divided.
the inconclusive war incredibly mindless in the way it began often reckless in the way it was managed and largely fruitless in the way it ended cost the united states more than 33 000 battle deaths and 103 000 wounded or missing.
south korean casualties were about 2 million and north korean and chinese casualties were an estimated 3 million.
the impact of the korean war to most americans the north korean attack on south korea provided concrete proof that there was an international communist conspiracy guided by the soviet union to control the world.
1250 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 trumans assumption that stalin and the soviets were behind the invasion of south korea led him to deepen the american commitment to stop communism.
the interests of the united states are global in character he explained.
a threat to the peace of the world anywhere is a threat to our security fearful that the soviets would use the korean conflict as a diversion to invade western europe he ordered a major expansion of u s military forces in europe and around the world.
truman also increased assistance to french troops fighting a communist independence movement in the french colony of indochina which included vietnam starting americas deepening military involvement in southeast asia.
another red scare the korean war excited another red scare at home as people grew fearful that communists were infiltrating american society.
since 1938 the house committee on un american activities huac had kept up a drumbeat of accusations about supposed communist agents in the federal government.
on march 21 1947 president truman signed an executive order also known as the loyalty order requiring federal government workers to undergo a background investigation to ensure they were not communists or even associated with communists or other subversive groups.
truman knew that the loyalty program violated civil liberties but he felt he had no choice.
he was responding to pressure from fbi director j edgar hoover and attorney general tom clark both of whom were convinced that there were numerous spies working inside the federal government.
truman was also eager to blunt criticism that he was not doing enough to ensure that soviet sympathizers were not working in government.
truman thought that the fear about communist subversives was misplaced.
people are very much wrought up about the communist bugaboo he wrote to pennsylvania governor george earle but i am of the opinion that the country is perfectly safe so far as communism is concerned by early 1951 the federal civil service commission had cleared more than 3 million people while only 378 had been dismissed for doubtful loyalty.
others however had resigned for fear they would be dismissed.
in 1953 president dwight d eisenhower revoked the loyalty order.
the hollywood ten charges that hollywood was a hotbed of communism led the house committee on un american activities to launch a full blown investigation of the motion picture industry.
the huac subpoenaed dozens of actors producers and directors to testify at its hearings held in los angeles in october 1947.
ten witnesses refused to testify arguing that another red scare 1251 the red scare and hollywood several courageous movie stars attended the huac hearings to support their friends and colleagues who were accused of being communists.
left to right danny kaye june havoc humphrey bogart and lauren bacall seated.
the questioning violated their first amendment rights.
when asked if he were a member of the communist party screenwriter ring lardner jr replied i could answer but i would hate myself in the morning another member of the so called hollywood ten screenwriter dalton trumbo shouted as he left the hearings this is the beginning of an american concentration camp all ten were cited for contempt given prison terms and blacklisted banned from the film industry.
the witch hunt launched by the huac inspired playwright arthur miller who himself was blacklisted to write the crucible an award winning play produced in 1953.
it is a dramatic account of the notorious witch trials in salem massachusetts at the end of the seventeenth century intended to alert audiences about the dangers of the anti communist hysteria.
alger hiss the spy case most damaging to the truman administration involved alger hiss president of the carnegie endowment for international peace who had served in several government agencies.
whittaker chambers a former soviet spy and later an editor of time magazine who reversed himself and became an informer testifying against supposed communists in the 1252 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 g overnment told the huac in 1948 that hiss had given him secret documents ten years earlier when chambers was spying for the soviets and hiss was working in the state department.
hiss sued for libel and chambers produced microfilms of the state department documents that he said hiss had passed to him.
although hiss denied the accusation he was indicted and after one mistrial convicted in 1950.
the charge was perjury but he was convicted of lying about espionage for which he could not be tried because the statute of limitations on the crime had expired.
more cases of communist infiltration surfaced.
in 1949 eleven top leaders of the communist party of the united states were convicted under the smith act of 1940 which outlawed any conspiracy to advocate the overthrow of the government.
the supreme court upheld the law under the doctrine of a clear and present danger which overrode the right to free speech.
atomic spying in 1950 the fbi unearthed a spy network involving both american and british communists who had secretly passed information about the development of the atomic bomb to the soviet union.
the disclosure led to the arrest of klaus fuchs a g erman born english nuclear physicist who had worked in the united states during the war and helped to develop the atomic bomb.
as it turned out a new york couple former communists julius and ethel rosenberg were part of the same soviet spy ring.
their claims of innocence were undercut by the confession of ethels brother who admitted he was a spy along with his sister and brother in law.
the convictions of fuchs and the rosenbergs fueled republican charges that trumans administration was not doing enough to hunt down communist agents.
the rosenberg case called the crime of the century by j edgar hoover also heightened fears that a vast soviet network of spies and sympathizers was operating in the united states and had given stalin the secret of building atomic weapons.
irving kaufman the federal judge who sentenced the rosenbergs to death explained that plain deliberate murder is dwarfed.
by comparison with the crime you have committed they were the first americans executed for spying.
mccarthys witch hunt evidence of soviet spying encouraged some to exploit fears of the communist menace.
early in 1950 a little known republican senator joseph r mccarthy of wisconsin surfaced as the most ruthless manipulator of anti communist anxieties.
mccarthy eager to attract media attention through his bare knuckle tactics took up the cause of a nti communism with a fiery speech to a womens republican club in wheeling west virginia on february 9 1950 in which he another red scare 1253 charged that the state department was infested with communists.
he claimed to have their names although he never provided them.
mccarthys stunt got him what he wanted most publicity.
as the new york times said it is difficult if not impossible to ignore charges made by senator mccarthy just because they are usually proved exaggerated or false during the next four years mccarthy made more wild accusations initially against many democrats whom he smeared as dupes or fellow travelers of the commies then against officers in the u s army.
truman privately denounced mccarthy as just a ballyhoo artist who has to cover up his shortcomings with wild charges but mccarthy was not so easily dismissed.
he enjoyed the backing of fellow republicans eager to hurt democrats in the 1950 congressional elections by claiming they were not being tough enough in fighting communism.
senator lyndon b johnson of texas said mccarthy was the sorriest senator in washington.
but hes riding high now hes got people scared to death.
by the summer of 1951 however mccarthyism had gotten out of control.
mccarthys feverish excesses were revealed for all to see when he outrageously accused george marshall the former secretary of state and war hero of making common cause with stalin by being an instrument of the communist conspiracy concerns about truth or fair play did not faze mccarthy his focus was on creating a reign of terror through groundless accusations.
truman called him a pathological character assassin however sincere mccarthys desire was to purify america of communist sympathizers his unholy war never un covered a single communist agent.
but his relentless smear campaign which tarnished many lives and reputations and had a chilling effect on free speech went largely unchallenged until the end of the korean war.
during the red scare thousands of l eft wing americans were blacklisted from employment be cause of past political associations real or rumored.
movies with titles like i married a commu joseph r mccarthy the crusading nist fed the hysteria and magazine senator who was determined to identify any communists serving in the federal stories warned of a red under every government.
bed 1254 chapter 27 the cold war and the fair deal 1945 1952 the mccarran act fears of soviet spies working with american sympathizers led congress in 1950 to pass the mccarran internal security act over president trumans veto making it unlawful to combine conspire or agree with any other person to perform any act which would substantially contribute to.
the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship communist organizations had to register with the attorney general.
would be immigrants who had belonged to totalitarian parties in their home countries were barred from entering the united states.
and during any future national emergencies american communists were to be herded into concentration camps.
the mccarran internal security act truman said in his veto message would put the government into the business of thought control the red scare and the cold war playing upon the fears of the american public did not make for good policy in 1919 nor did it work well in the early fifties.
both red scares ended up violating the civil liberties of innocent people.
president truman may have erred in 1947 by creating a government loyalty program that aggravated the anti communist hysteria.
trumans own attorney general tom clark contended that there were so many communists in america that they were everywhere in factories offices butcher shops on street corners in private businesses and each carries with him the germs of death for society truman also overstretched american resources when he pledged to contain communism everywhere.
containment itself proved hard to contain amid the ideological posturing of soviet and american leaders.
its chief theorist george f kennan later confessed that he was partly to blame because he had failed at the outset to clarify the limits of the containment policy and to stress that the united states needed to prioritize its responses to soviet adventurism.
a cold war government the years after the second world war were unlike any other postwar period in american history.
having taken on global burdens the united states became committed to a permanently large national military establishment along with shadowy new government agencies such as the national security council nsc the national security agency nsa and the central intelligence agency cia.
the federal government and the presidency grew larger more powerful and more secretive fueled by the actions of both major political parties as well as by the intense lobbying efforts of what dwight d eisenhower would later call the military industrial complex.
another red scare 1255 fears of communism and concerns about a soviet spy network in the united states mushroomed into politically motivated paranoia.
long standing prejudices against jews fed the hysteria indeed many communist sympathizers were jews from eastern europe.
the red scare also provided a powerful tool for republicans to claim that democrats were soft on communism one of the worst effects of the red scare was to encourage widespread conformity of thought and behavior.
by 1950 it had become dangerous to criticize anything associated with the american way of life.
assessing harry truman on march 30 1952 harry truman announced that he would not seek another presidential term in part because it was unlikely he could win.
less than 25 percent of voters surveyed said that he was doing a good job the lowest presidential approval rating in history.
although americans applauded trumans integrity and courage the unrelenting war against communism at home and abroad led people to question his strategy.
negotiations to end the war in korea had bogged down the red baiting of mccarthyism was expanding and conservative southern democrats members of trumans own party had defeated most of his fair deal proposals.
the war had also brought higher taxes and higher prices for american consumers many of whom blamed the president.
only years later would people and historians fully appreciate how effectively truman had dealt with so many complex problems.
to the end of his presidency truman a plainspoken man who made decisions based on his gut feeling about what was right viewed himself as an ordinary person who had been given opportunities to do extraordinary things.
i have tried my best to give the nation everything i have in me truman told reporters at one of his last press conferences.
there are a great many people.
who could have done the job better than i did it.
but i had the job and had to do it and it was not a simple job by any means.
at the end of one difficult day in the white house truman growled while sipping a bourbon and water they his critics talk about the power of the president how i can just push a button to get things done.
why i spend most of my time kissing somebodys ass by the time truman left the white house in early 1953 the cold war had become an accepted part of the american way of life.
but fears about the spread of communism were counterbalanced by the joys of unexpected prosperity.
toward the end of trumans presidency the economy began to grow at what would become the fastest rate in history transforming social and cultural life and becoming the marvel of the world.
the booming economy brought with it the nifty fifties.
chapter review summary the cold war the cold war was an ideological contest between the western democracies especially the united states and the communist countries.
at the end of the second world war the soviet union established friendly governments in the eastern european countries it occupied behind an iron curtain of totalitarian control and secrecy.
containment president truman responded to the soviet occupation of eastern europe with the policy of containment the aim of which was to halt the spread of communism by opposing it wherever it emerged.
with the truman doctrine 1947 he proposed giving economic and military aid to countries facing communist insurgencies such as greece and turkey he also convinced congress to approve the national security act which reorganized the u s armed forces and created the central intelligence agency.
with the marshall plan truman offered redevelopment aid to all european nations.
in 1948 the berlin airlift overcame a soviet blockade of supplies to west berlin.
in 1949 the united states became a founding member of the north atlantic treaty organization nato a military alliance of western democracies united primarily against the soviet union.
trumans fair deal trumans fair deal was proposed to expand the new deal despite intense republican opposition in congress.
truman could not stop the taft hartley act a republican backed measure to curb the power of labor unions.
truman was more successful in expanding social security and through executive orders desegregating the military and banning racial discrimination in the hiring of federal employees.
after winning a second term in 1948 he proposed a civil rights bill national health insurance federal aid to education and new farm subsidies.
despite the democrats majority in congress however conservative republicans and southern democrats dixiecrats joined forces to defeat these initiatives.
the korean war containment policies proved less effective in east asia as communists won a long civil war in china in 1949 and ignited a war in korea.
in response truman authorized nsc 68 a comprehensive blueprint for american foreign and defense policies that called for a dramatic increase in military spending and nuclear arms.
when north korean troops invaded south korea in june 1950 truman quickly decided to go to war under the auspices of the united nations.
after a year of major gains and reverses by both sides and then two years of stalemate a truce concluded in july 1953 established a demilitarized zone in korea.
the red scare the onset of the cold war inflamed another red scare.
investigations by the house committee on u n american activities huac sought to find subversives within the federal government.
starting in 1950 senator joseph r mccarthy exploited fears of soviet spies infiltrating the highest levels of the u s government.
another red scare 1257 mccarthyism flourished in the short term because the threat of a world dominated by communist g overnments seemed all too real to many americans.

cold war america 1950 1959 the art of consumerism the united states experienced tremendous prosperity after the second world war giving many americans the unprecedented opportunity to engage in carefree consumption during the 1950 s and personal indebtedness.

the image of newlyweds seeking sheltered security in a new age of nuclear terror symbolized how america in the 1950s was awash in contrasting emotions.
the deepening cold war with the soviet union cast a frightening shadow over the nations traditionally sunny optimism.
in 1959 two out of three americans listed the possibility of atomic war as the nations most urgent threat.
still americans emerged from the second world war proud of their military strength international stature and industrial might.
it was a time rich with possibilities.
as the editors of fortune magazine proclaimed in 1946 this is a dream era.
the great american boom is on so it was at least for white m iddle class americans.
during the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s the united states enjoyed unprecedented economic growth and most americans were content.
divorce and homicide rates fell and people lived longer on average thanks in part to medical breakthroughs including new antibiotics and the vaccine invented by dr jonas salk that ended the menace of polio.
the happy days image of america in the fifties as an innocent prosperous nation awash in good times and enlivened by teenage energies has a kernel of truth.
but life was actually much more complicated even contradictory and hypocritical at times as many americans worried about what seemed an uncontrollable future.

that the bombers were never found fueled public concern that the united states was on the brink of chaos and revolution.
the scope and pace of societal changes were bewildering as the emergence of national radio networks talking motion pictures mass ownership of automobiles and national chain stores combined with the soaring popularity of spectator sports and the rise of mass marketing and advertising transformed america into the worlds leading consumer society.
the culture of mass consumption fueled the explosive growth of middle class urban life while assaulting traditional virtues such as frugality prudence and religiosity.
in the political arena reactionaries and rebels battled for control.
the brutal fight between woodrow wilson and the r epublican led senate over the treaty of versailles coupled with the administrations crackdown on dissenters and socialists had weakened an already fragmented and disillusioned progressivism.
as reformer amos pinchot bitterly observed president wilson had put his enemies in office and his friends in jail by 1920 many progressives had grown skeptical of any politician claiming to be a reformer or an idealist.
social reformer jane addams sighed that the 1920s were a period of political and social sag the desire to restore traditional values and social stability led voters to elect republican warren g harding president in 1920.
he promised to return america to normalcy both major parties still included progressive wings but they were shrinking.
the demand for honest efficient government and public services remained strong the impulse for social reform however shifted into a drive for moral righteousness and social conformity.
by 1920 many veteran progressives had withdrawn from public life.
mainstream americans were also shocked by new modernist forms of artistic expression and sexual liberation.
mabel dodge luhan a leading promoter of modern art and literature said that the generation of young literary and artistic rebels that emerged during and after the war was determined to overthrow the old order of things in sum postwar life in america and europe was fraught with turbulent changes contradictory impulses superficial frivolity and seething tensions.
as the french painter paul gauguin acknowledged the upheavals of cultural a new era of consumption 1031 modernism and the chaotic aftermath of the war produced an epoch of confusion a riotous clash of irreverent new ideas with traditional manners and morals.
the nation in 1920 the 1920 census reported that 106 million people lived in the united states a third of the number today.
americas population was remarkably young.
over half the people were under the age of twenty five.
the average life expectancy was just fifty six years for men and fifty eight for women.
american society remained overwhelmingly white 90 percent persons of hispanic origin were considered to be white.
african americans were 9 percent and native americans and asian americans made up most of the rest.
almost half of the white population were either immigrants or the c hildren of immigrants the highest percentage since the late eighteenth century.
for the first time in american history over half of the population lived in cities meaning towns and cities with more than 2 500 residents.
towns with less than 3 000 residents could hardly be called urban.
but some 16 million americans lived in the ten largest cities.
american society was relentlessly becoming more urban and less rural.
the south remained the most rural and poorest region of the nation.
only about half of the farmers in the former confederate states owned their land.
three quarters of farmers in the rest of the nation owned their lands.
the others were either tenants who rented lands or sharecroppers who gave the landowner a share of the crop in exchange for access to land.
most sharecroppers especially black sharecroppers were grimly poor in large part because the entire agricultural sector struggled with low crop prices during the twenties.
and most tenants and sharecroppers were in the south.
a new era of consumption america experienced so many dramatic changes during the twenties that people referred to it as a new era the robust u s economy became the envy of the world.
following the brief postwar recession in 1920 1921 economic growth soared to record levels.
jobs were plentiful and average income rose throughout the decade.
the nations total wealth almost doubled between 1920 and 1930 while wage workers enjoyed record breaking increases in average income.
by 1929 the united states enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world.
1032 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 construction led the way.
the war had caused people to postpone building offices plants homes and apartments.
by 1921 however a building boom was underway that would last the rest of the decade.
at the same time the remarkable growth of the automotive industry created an immediate need for roads and highways.
new construction and new cars stimulated other industries such as lumber steel concrete rubber gasoline and furniture.
technology also played a key role in the prosperity of the twenties.
manufacturing grew more mechanized and efficient.
powerful new machines electric motors steam turbines dump trucks tractors bulldozers steam shovels and more efficient ways of operating farms factories plants mines and mills generated dramatic increases in production.
in 1920 the nations factories produced 5 000 electric refrigerators in 1929 almost a million.
a growing consumer culture in the late nineteenth century the u s economy had been driven by commercial agriculture and large scale industrial production the building of railroads and bridges the manufacturing of steel and the construction of housing and businesses in cities.
during the twenties the dominant aspect of the economy involved an explosion of new consumer goods.
the success of mass production made mass consumption more important than ever.
a 1920 newspaper editorial insisted that with the war over the americans first importance to his country is no longer that of citizen but that of consumer to keep factory production humming required converting once frugal people into enthusiastic shoppers.
people may ruin themselves by saving instead of spending warned one economist.
during the great war the government had urged americans to work long hours conserve resources and do without.
after the war a new consumer culture encouraged carefree spending.
during the war a journalist noted in 1920 we accustomed ourselves to doing without to buying carefully to using economically.
but with the close of the war came reaction.
a veritable orgy of extravagant buying is going on.
reckless spending takes the place of saving waste replaces conservation to keep people buying businesses developed new ways for consumers to finance purchases over time layaway rather than have to pay cash up front buy now pay later.
as paying with cash and staying out of debt came to be seen as needlessly old fashioned practices consumer debt almost tripled during the twenties.
by 1929 almost 60 percent of american purchases were made on the installment plan.
during the new era advertising first developed in the late nineteenth century grew into a huge enterprise.
president calvin coolidge declared that a new era of consumption 1033 advertising had become the most potent influence in adopting and changing the habits and modes of life affecting what we eat what we wear and the work and play of the whole nation a modern home this 1925 westinghouse advertisement urges homemakers to buy its cozy glow jr heater and sol luk luminaire lamp among other new electrical appliances that would do anything for you in return 1034 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 the visibility of ads helped shape how people behaved and how they defined the pursuit of happiness.
zelda sayre fitzgerald the writer and wife of the wildly popular novelist f scott fitzgerald recalled that we grew up founding our dreams on the infinite promises of american advertising new weekday radio programs popular with m iddle class housewives for example were often sponsored by national companies advertising laundry detergent and hand soap hence the term soap operas because women purchased two thirds of consumer goods advertisers targeted them.
an ad in photoplay magazine appealed to the woman of the house because she buys most of the things which go to make the home happy healthful and beautiful.
through her slim safe fingers goes most of the family money the consumer culture generated bewildering changes in everyday life.
the huge jump in the use of electricity was a revolutionary new force.
in 1920 only 35 percent of homes had electricity by 1930 the number was 68 percent.
similar increases occurred in the number of households with indoor plumbing washing machines and automobiles.
moderately priced creature comforts and conveniences such as flush toilets electric irons and fans handheld cameras wristwatches cigarette lighters vacuum cleaners and linoleum floors became more widely available especially among the urban middle class.
as always the poor with little discretionary income remained on the margins of the consumer culture.
the rise of mass culture the powerful consumer culture helped create a marketplace of retail stores and national brands kelloggs corn flakes general electric toasters etc.
in which local and regional businesses were increasingly squeezed out by giant department stores and national chain stores.
by the 1920s woolworths for example had 1 500 stores scattered across the country walgreens had 525.
such national retailers bought goods in such large quantities that they were able to get discounted prices that they passed on to consumers.
mass advertising and marketing campaigns promoting national products increasingly led to a mass culture more and more americans now saw the same advertisements and bought the same products at the same stores.
they also read the same magazines listened to the same radio programs drove the same cars adored the same sports stars and celebrities and watched the same movies.
movie made america in 1896 a new york audience viewed the first moving picture show.
by 1924 there were 20 000 theaters showing 700 a new era of consumption 1035 new silent films a year and the movie business had become the nations chief form of mass entertainment.
hollywood california became the international center of movie production grinding out cowboy westerns crime dramas murder mysteries and the timeless comedies of mack sennetts keystone company where a raft of slapstick comedians most notably london born charlie chaplin a comic genius perfected their art transforming it into a form of social criticism.
movie attendance during the 1920s averaged 80 million people a week more than half the national population and attendance surged even more after 1927 with the appearance of talk charlie chaplin an english born actor ies movies with sound.
in 1930 some who rose to international fame as the 115 million people attended weekly tramp pictured above in the 1921 movies out of a total population of silent film the kid.
123 million many people went more than once.
americans spent ten times as much on movies as they did on tickets to baseball and football games.
but movies did much more than entertain.
they helped expand the consumer culture by feeding the desires of moviegoers setting standards and tastes in fashion music dancing and hairstyles.
they also helped stimulate the sexual revolution.
one boy admitted that it was the movies that taught him how to kiss a girl on her ears neck and cheeks as well as on the mouth a social researcher concluded that movies made young americans in the twenties more sex wise sex excited and sex absorbed than previous generations.
radio radio broadcasting enjoyed even more spectacular growth.
in 1920 station wwj in detroit began transmitting news bulletins and kdka in pittsburgh began broadcasting regularly scheduled programs.
the first radio commercial aired in new york in 1922.
by the end of that year there were 508 stations.
in 1926 the national broadcasting company nbc a subsidiary of the radio corporation of america rca began linking its stations into a national network the columbia broadcasting system cbs entered the field the next year.
1036 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 in 1920 some 41 million radios were manufactured in the united states.
the widespread ownership of radios changed the patterns of everyday life.
at night after dinner families gathered around the radio to listen to live music political speeches news broadcasts weather forecasts baseball and football games boxing matches comedy shows and worship services.
one ad claimed that the radio is your theater your college your newspaper your library calvin coolidge was the first president to address the nation by radio and his monthly talks paved the way for franklin delano roosevelts influential fireside chats during the thirties.
radio transformed jazz music into a national craze.
big band leaders paul whiteman guy lombardo duke ellington glenn miller and tommy and jimmy dorsey regularly performed live over the radio.
country western music also developed a national following as a result of radio broadcasts.
in 1925 a nashville tennessee station wsm began offering a weekly variety show the grand ole opry which featured an array of country music stars.
flying machines advances in transportation were as significant as the impact of commercial radio and movies on popular culture.
in 1903 wilbur and orville wright owners of a bicycle shop in dayton ohio had built and flown the first flying machine over the beach at kitty hawk north carolina.
the development of airplanes advanced slowly until the outbreak of war in 1914 when europeans began using the airplane as a military weapon.
when the united states entered the war it had no combat planes american pilots flew british or french warplanes.
an american aircraft industry arose during the war but collapsed in the postwar demobilization.
under the kelly act of 1925 however the federal government began to subsidize the industry through airmail contracts.
the air commerce act of 1926 provided federal funds for the advancement of air transportation and navigation including the construction of airports.
the aviation industry received a huge psychological boost in 1927 when t wenty six year old charles a lindbergh jr a st louis based mail pilot made the first solo transatlantic flight traveling from new york city to paris in t hirty three and a half hours through severe storms and dense fog.
when lindbergh known as the lone eagle landed in france 100 000 people greeted him with thunderous cheers.
the new york city parade celebrating his accomplishment surpassed the celebration of the end of the great war.
when lindbergh met britains king george v soon after his long flight the monarch asked him how did you pee in paper cups the pilot answered.
five years after lindberghs famous flight new york city celebrated another a new era of consumption 1037 amelia earhart the pioneering aviator would tragically disappear in her 1937 attempt to fly around the world.
pioneering aviator amelia earhart a former stunt pilot at air shows who became the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic.
the car culture by far the most significant economic and social development of the early twentieth century was the widespread ownership of automobiles.
in 1924 when asked about the changes transforming american life a resident of muncie indiana replied i can tell you whats happening in just four letters a u t o a neighbor in muncie said he would go without food before ill see us give up the car the first motorcar horseless carriage had been manufactured for sale in 1895 but the founding of the ford motor company in 1903 had revolutionized the infant industry.
the first cars were handmade expensive and designed for the wealthy.
henry ford changed all that by building a car for the multitude during the twenties he became the godfather of mass production.
he vowed to democratize the automobile.
when im through everybody will be able to afford one and about everyone will have one fords model t the celebrated tin lizzie cheap and rugged built to last forever came out in 1908 at a price of 850 about 22 000 today.
by 1924 as a result of fords ever more efficient production techniques the same car sold for 290 less than 4 000 1038 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 ford motor companys highland park plant 1913 gravity slides and chain conveyors contributed to the mass production of automobiles.
the model t changed little from year to year and it came in only one color black.
other automakers followed fords mass production low priced model.
in 1920 there were more than 8 million registered vehicles in 1929 there were more than 23 million.
the automobile revolution was in part propelled by the discovery of vast oil fields in texas oklahoma wyoming and california.
by 1920 the united states produced two thirds of the worlds oil and gasoline.
the automobile industry also became the leading example of modern mass production techniques.
fords highland park plant outside detroit used a moving conveyor system that pulled the chassis down an assembly line of sequential work stations.
each worker performed a single task such as installing a fender or a wheel as the c ar in process moved down the line.
through this technique a new car could be pieced together in ninety three minutes.
such efficiency enabled ford to lower the price of his cars thereby increasing the number of people who could afford them.
his high profits helped him pay his workers the highest wages in the industry.
although ford was a notorious taskmaster he prohibited his workers from talking sitting smoking or singing while on the job his methods worked.
during the twenties the united states built ten times more automobiles than all of europe combined.
just as the railroad helped transform the pace and scale of life in the second half of the nineteenth century the automobile changed social life during the twentieth century.
americans literally developed a love affair with cars.
in the words of one male driver young people viewed the car as an incredible engine a new era of consumption 1039 of escape from parental control and a safe place to take a girl and hold hands neck pet or.
go the limit cars and networks of new roads enabled people to live farther away from their workplaces thus encouraging suburban sprawl.
cars also helped fuel the economic boom of the 1920s by creating tens of thousands of new jobs and a huge demand for steel glass rubber leather oil and gasoline.
the car culture stimulated road construction sparked a real estate boom in florida and california and dotted the landscape with gasoline stations traffic lights billboards and motor hotels motels.
by 1929 the federal government was constructing 10 000 miles of paved highways each year.
spectator sports during the 1920s automobile ownership and rising incomes changed the way people spent their leisure time.
americans fell in love with spectator sports people in cities could drive into the countryside visit friends and relatives and go to ballparks stadiums or boxing rinks to see baseball or football games and prizefights.
baseball created in the 1870s had become the national pastime by the 1920s.
its popularity fed on superstars.
with larger than life heroes such as new york yankee legends george herman babe ruth jr and henry louis lou gehrig baseball teams attracted intense loyalties and huge crowds.
ruth may well have been the most famous athlete of all time.
in 1920 more than a million spectators attended ruths games.
two years later the yankees built a new stadium dubbing it the house that ruth built and went on to win world series championships in 1923 1927 and 1928.
more than 20 million people attended professional games in 1927 the year that ruth the sultan of swat set a record by hitting sixty home runs.
because baseball remained a segregated sport in the 1920s so called negro leagues were organized for african americans.
football especially at the college level also attracted huge crowds.
it too benefited from outsized heroes such as running back harold edward red grange of the university of illinois the first athlete to appear on the cover of time magazine.
in a game against the university of michigan the galloping ghost scored a touchdown the first four times he carried the ball.
after illinois won students carried grange on their shoulders for two miles across the campus.
when he signed a contract with the chicago bears in 1926 he s ingle handedly made professional football competitive with baseball as a spectator sport.
what ruth and grange were to their sports william harrison jack dempsey was to boxing.
in 1919 he won the world heavyweight title from jess willard a giant of a man weighing three hundred pounds and standing 1040 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 babe ruth this star pitcher and outfielder won the hearts of americans first with the boston red sox then the new york yankees and finally the boston braves.
here he autographs bats and balls for soldiers at training camp.
six and a half feet tall.
dempsey knocked him down seven times in the first round.
willard his face bruised and bloodied gave up in the fourth round and dempsey thereafter became a dominant force in boxing.
like babe ruth the brawling dempsey was especially popular with working class men for he too had been born poor.
in 1927 when james joseph gene tunney defeated dempsey more than 100 000 people attended including a thousand reporters ten state governors and numerous hollywood celebrities.
some 60 million people listened to the fight over the radio.
the jazz age while the masses of americans devoted their free time to spectator sports radio programs and movies many young people especially college students focused their energies on social and cultural rebellion.
f scott fitzgerald a boyishly handsome princeton university dropout was labeled the voice of his generation after his first novel this side of paradise 1920 became a best the jazz age 1041 seller with its colorful account of rowdy student life at princeton.
fitzgerald fastened upon the jazz age as a label for the spirit of rebelliousness and spontaneity he observed among many young americans.
the birth of jazz fitzgeralds jazz age label referred to the popularity of jazz music a dynamic blend of several musical traditions.
it had first emerged as piano based ragtime at the end of the nineteenth century.
thereafter african american musicians such as jelly roll morton duke ellington louis armstrong and bessie smith the empress of the blues combined the energies of ragtime with the emotions of the blues to create jazz originally an african american slang term meaning sexual intercourse.
with its improvisations variations and sensual spontaneity jazz appealed to people of all ethnicities and ages because it was all about pleasure and immediacy letting go and enjoying the freedom of the moment.
louis armstrong an inspired trumpeter with a uniquely froggy voice was the pied piper of jazz an inventive and freewheeling performer who reshaped the american music scene.
born in a new orleans shack in 1900 the grandson of slaves he was abandoned by his father and raised by his prostitute mother who was fifteen when he was born.
as a youth he saw the mean and ugly side of america.
i seen everythin from a child comin up he said once.
nothin happen i aint never seen before then he found music using his natural genius to explore the fertile possibilities of jazz.
as a teen he sneaked into music halls to watch joe king oliver and other early jazz innovators.
in 1922 armstrong moved to chicago where he delighted audiences with his passionate trumpet performances and open hearted personality.
throughout the twenties armstrong and his band crisscrossed the united states spreading the gospel of jazz.
the culture of jazz quickly spread from its origins in new orleans kansas city memphis and st louis to the african american neighborhoods of harlem in new york city and chicagos south side.
large dance halls accommodated the demand for jazz music and the new dances it inspired like the charleston and the black bottom.
affluent whites flocked to the dance halls as well as to black nightclubs and jazz joints during the 1920s people commonly spoke of jazzing something up invigorating it or jazzing around acting youthfully and energetically.
many americans however were not fans of jazz or the sexually suggestive dances it inspired.
dr francis e clark a christian moralist denounced indecent dance as an offense against womanly purity princeton professor 1042 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 henry van dyke dismissed jazz as merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion such criticism however failed to stem the popularity of jazz which swept across europe as well as america.
europeans including modernist painters henri matisse and pablo picasso grew infatuated with the inventive energies of jazz music.
a sexual revolution.
what most shocked old timers during the jazz age was a defiant sexual revolution among young people especially those on college campuses.
none of the victorian mothers and most of the mothers were v ictorian had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to being kissed wrote f scott fitzgerald in this side of paradise 1920.
during the twenties americans learned about the hidden world of flaming youth the title of a popular novel wild petting parties free love speakeasies joyriding and s kinny dipping.
a promotional poster for the 1923 silent film flaming youth asked how far can a girl go other ads duke ellington and his band jazz emerged in the 1920s as a uniquely american expression of the modernist spirit.
african american artists bent musical conventions to give freer rein to improvisation and sensuality.
the jazz age 1043 claimed the movie appealed especially to neckers petters white kisses red kisses p leasure mad daughters and s ensation craving mothers the impact of sigmund freud the increasingly frank treat ment of sex resulted in part from the influence of sigmund freud the austrian founder of modern psychoanalysis.
freud trained as a physician insisted that the human mind was mysteriously conflicted by often unconscious efforts to repress powerful irrational impulses and sexual desires libido.
in 1899 freud had published the interpretation of dreams a pathbreaking book that stressed the crucial role of the subconscious in shaping behavior and moods.
he also highlighted the sigmund freud founder of modern significance of dreams as providing psychoanalysis in 1926 the royal road to the unconscious for dreams revealed repressed sexual yearnings many of which resulted from early childhood experiences.
women and men freud argued are endowed with equal sexual energy and human behavior is driven by a variety of intense sexual desires and efforts to release pent up aggression.
these natural human conflicts cause unhappiness because people desire more pleasures than they can attain.
it did not take long for freuds ideas to penetrate society at large.
books movies and plays included frequent references to freuds ideas and some of the decades most popular m agazines true confessions telling tales and true story focused on romance and sex.
likewise the most popular female movie stars madge bellamy clara bow and joan c rawford projected images of sensual freedom energy and independence.
advertisements for new movies reinforced the self indulgent images of the jazz age brilliant men beautiful jazz babies champagne baths midnight revels petting parties in the purple dawn all ending in one terrific climax that makes you gasp traditionalists were shocked by the behavior of rebellious young women.
one hears it said lamented a baptist magazine that the girls 1044 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 are actually tempting the boys more than the boys do the girls by their dress and conversation psychoanalysis whose purpose is to explain activities in the mind soon became the worlds most c elebrated and controversial technique for helping troubled people come to grips with the demons haunting them by using talk therapy getting patients to tell the story of their lives and inner frustrations and repressed fears and urges.
by 1916 there were some 500 psychoanalysts in new york city alone.
freuds emphasis on unruly sexual desires swirling about in the subconscious fascinated some people and scared others.
for many young americans freud seemed to provide scientific justification for rebelling against social conventions and indulging in sex.
some oversimplified his theories by claiming that sexual pleasure was essential for emotional health that all forms of sexual activity were good and that all inhibitions about sex were bad.
margaret sanger and birth control perhaps the most controversial womens issue of the jazz age was birth control.
christians both protestants and catholics opposed it as a violation of gods law.
other crusaders saw it differently.
margaret sanger a new york nurse and midwife in the working class tenements of manhattan saw many young mothers struggling to provide for their growing families.
born in 1883 one of eleven children born to irish immigrants she herself had experienced the poverty often faced by large immigrant families.
our childhood she remembered was one of longing for things that were always denied as a nurse and midwife sanger witnessed at firsthand the consequences of unwanted pregnancies tragic miscarriages and amateur abortions.
to her the problems had an obvious solution birth control a term she and friends coined in 1914.
in 1912 sanger began to distribute b irth control information to working class women and resolved to spend the rest of her life helping women gain control of their bodies.
to do so she began publishing a magazine called woman rebel in which she promoted womans suffrage workers rights and contraception to frighten the capitalist class in 1916 she was arrested and charged with disseminating obscenity through the mail but months later the case was dropped.
she then opened the nations first birth control clinic in brooklyn.
in 1921 sanger organized the american birth control league which in 1942 changed its name to planned parenthood.
the birth control league distributed information to doctors social workers womens clubs and the scientific community as well as to thousands of women.
in the 1920s however sanger alienated supporters of birth control by endorsing sterilization the jazz age 1045 for the mentally incompetent and for people with certain hereditary conditions.
birth control she stressed was the most constructive and necessary of the means to racial health although sanger did not succeed in legalizing the distribution of contraceptives and contraceptive information through the mail she had laid the foundation for such efforts.
in 1936 a federal court ruled that physicians could prescribe contraceptives a vital step in sangers efforts to realize her slogan every child a wanted child the new women new clothing fashions reflected the rebellion against traditional female roles in an especially powerful way.
the emancipated new women of the twenties the new woman of the 1920s two seized the right to vote while eagerly risk taking flappers dance atop the hotel sherman in chicago 1926 discarding the confining wardrobe of their mothers g eneration pinched in corsets layers of petticoats and fl oor length dresses.
in 1919 skirts were typically six inches above the ground by 1927 they were at the knee.
the utah legislature in 1921 debated a bill that would have jailed women wearing skirts higher than three inches above the ankle the shortest skirts were worn by the so called flappers pleasure seeking young women w ho in defiance of proper prewar standards drove automobiles bobbed their hair cut it short requiring the invention of the bobby pin and wore minimal underclothing gauzy fabrics sheer stockings dangling necklaces and plenty of makeup especially rouge and lipstick.
they often joined young men in smoking cigarettes drinking gambling and dancing to jazz music.
flappers attracted so much attention in part because they were both defiantly independent and desperately seductive.
after interacting with flappers in new york city british novelist elinor glynn asked has the american girl no innate modesty no sub conscious self respect no reserve no dignity the flappers wanted more out of life than marriage and motherhood.
their carefree version of feminism was fun loving defiant self indulgent and often 1046 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 s elf destructive.
f scott fitzgerald claimed that his rebellious wife zelda was the first american flapper the wayward daughter of a strict alabama judge zelda was wild to the point of exhaustion.
stimulated by alcohol she loved doing crazy things dancing in new york city fountains and stripping off her clothes in the middle of grand central station.
the craziness of such flappers shocked and scared observers.
a catholic priest in brooklyn complained that the feminism of the 1920s had provoked a pandemonium of powder a riot of rouge and a moral anarchy of dress not so new women most women in the 1920s were not flappers however.
lillian symes a longtime activist stressed that her generation the beautiful and the damned in an outfit typical of flappers zelda of feminists had little in common fitzgerald poses with her husband with the spike heeled over rouged author f scott fitzgerald on the riviera flapper of today.
we grew up before in 1926 the postwar disillusionment engulfed the youth of the land although more middle class women attended college in the 1920s than ever before a higher percentage of them married soon after graduation than had been the case in the nineteenth century.
the conservative political mood helped to steer women who had worked for the war effort back into their traditional roles as homemakers and college curricula began to shift accordingly.
at vassar college an all womens school outside of new york city students took courses such as husband and wife motherhood and the family as an economic unit at the same time fewer college educated women pursued careers the proportion of physicians who were women fell during the twenties from 6 to 4 percent and similar reductions occurred among dentists architects and chemists.
a student at all female smith college in massachusetts expressed frustration that a woman must choose between a home and her work when a man may have both.
there must be a way out and it is the problem of our generation to find the way the jazz age 1047 as before most women who worked outside the home labored in unskilled low paying jobs.
only 4 percent of working women in the 1920s were salaried professionals.
some women moved into new vocations created by the growing consumer culture such as accounting assistants and department store clerks.
the number of beauty shops soared from 5 000 in 1920 to 40 000 in 1930 creating jobs for hair stylists manicurists and cosmeticians.
but the majority of women were still either full time wives and mothers or household servants.
fortunately the growing availability of electricity and electrical appliances vacuum cleaners toasters stoves refrigerators washing machines irons made housework easier.
likewise supermarkets offered year round access to fruits vegetables and meats which greatly reduced the traditional tasks of food p reparation canning baking bread and plucking chickens.
african american and latino women faced the greatest challenges.
as a new york city newspaper observed they were forced to do work which white women will not do women of color usually worked as maids laundresses or seamstresses or on farms.
the color line in addition to sexism racism also continued to limit the freedom of women during the twenties.
for example in 1919 an interracial couple from ayer massachusetts mabel puffer a wealthy college graduate and arthur hazzard a handyman and leader within the local black community decided to get married in concord new hampshire.
they checked into separate rooms in a hotel then met in the lobby and walked three blocks to the courthouse to apply for a marriage license only to be told that there was a five day waiting period.
so they waited and made preparations for the wedding.
the mayor of concord agreed to perform the service and hazzards siblings and mother made plans to attend.
when news of the interracial couple strolling the streets of concord reached the boston newspapers the first storys headline in the boston traveller read will marry negro in perfect union rich ayer society woman determined to wed servant although hometown is aflame with protest the news had outraged many residents of ayer.
the next day the boston evening globe ran the now provocative story on its front page.
the headline was sensational hope to prevent white woman wedding negro two friends of mabel e puffer have gone to concord n h suddenly the mayor of concord reversed himself and announced he could not perform the wedding.
the betrothed couple after being turned down several times finally found a minister willing to marry them.
the night before the wedding was to occur the ayer police chief arrived arrested hazzard on a charge of enticement and took puffer into custody because she had been 1048 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 deemed insane in reporting the story the concord newspaper concluded that the community gazed after their departing dust with no regrets the nation that woodrow wilson had led into world war i to make the world safe for democracy remained an unsafe place for those bold enough to cross the color line.
african american life the most significant development in african american life during the early twentieth century was the great migration northward from the south.
the mass movement of blacks began at the start of the twentieth century but accelerated in 1915 1916 when rapidly expanding war industries in the northern states needed new workers.
it continued throughout the twenties as poor blacks boarded trains with one way tickets bound for the promised land up north.
between 1920 and 1930 almost a million african americans mostly sharecroppers joined the exodus from the south.
many landed in new york city chicago detroit cleveland washington d c philadelphia and other large cities.
the great migration continued in fits and starts throughout the twentieth century producing dramatic social economic and political changes.
in 1900 only 740 000 african americans lived outside the south just 8 percent of the nations black population.
by 1970 more than 10 6 million african americans lived outside the south 47 percent of the nations total.
the african americans making up the great migration were lured by what writer richard wright called the warmth of other suns better living conditions and better paying jobs.
in the north for the most part they were able to speak more freely and were treated more equally than in the south and educational opportunities for children were much better.
collectively blacks gained more political leverage by settling in populous states like new york pennsylvania ohio and illinois with many electoral votes.
the political effects of the great migration were evident in 1928 when a chicago republican oscar de priest became the first black elected to congress since reconstruction and the first ever from a northern district.
the great migration was fraught with challenges however.
for the black migrants the difficult decision to leave their native south ended one set of troubles only to begin another.
never in history said richard wright has a more utterly unprepared folk wanted to go to the city the refugees arriving in northern cities from the jim crow south were strangers in a strange land where they were not always welcomed.
in densely populated northern cities black newcomers sometimes clashed with local ethnic groups especially irish and italians who feared that the newcomers would take their jobs.
many the jazz age 1049 the migration of the negro panel no.
1 in jacob lawrences series of paintings african americans leave the south behind for the northern industries of cities like new york chicago and st louis.
southern blacks ignorant of city ways were taken advantage of by white landlords realtors and bankers forced into substandard and segregated housing and paid lower wages than whites.
but northern discrimination still paled beside the ferocious injustices faced by african americans in the segregated south.
if all of their dream does not come true a black newspaper in chicago stressed enough will come to pass to justify their actions the missouri born black poet langston hughes spoke for many when he wrote that he was fed up with jim crow laws people who are cruel and afraid who lynch and run who are scared of me and me of them over time the transplanted african americans forged new lives in a strange new land building new churches new communities new families even new cultures while reconstructing new identities.
the naacp the mass migration of southern blacks northward helped spur the creation of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp founded in 1910 by black activists and white progressives.
black naacp members came mainly from the niagara movement a group formed in 1905 to fight racial discrimination nationwide.
du bois became the organizations director of publicity and research and the editor of its journal crisis.
1050 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 politically the naacp focused on legal action to bring the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments back to life.
one early victory came with guinn v united states 1915 in which the supreme court struck down oklahomas efforts to deprive african americans of the vote.
in buchanan v worley 1917 the court invalidated a residential segregation ordinance in louisville kentucky.
in 1919 the naacp launched a national campaign against lynching then a still common form of vigilante racist violence.
an anti lynching bill to make mob murder a federal crime passed the house in 1922 but was defeated by southerners in the senate.
the harlem renaissance so many blacks converged in new york city during the twenties that they inspired the harlem renaissance the nations first black literary and artistic movement.
it started in the fast growing african american community of harlem in northern manhattan.
in 1890 one in seventy people in manhattan had been african american by 1930 it was one in nine.
the great dark city of harlem in poet langston hughess phrase contained more blacks per square mile than any other urban neighborhood in the nation.
such rapid population growth generated a sense of common identity growing power and distinctive self expression that transformed harlem into the cultural capital of african american life.
writer james weldon johnson described a black manhattan as a typically negro community of 175 000 in that it featured movement color gaiety singing dancing boisterous laughter and loud talk dotted with lively taverns lounges supper clubs dance halls and saloons speakeasies that hosted writers and painters talking about literature and art while listening to jazz and drinking illegal booze harlem became what journalists called the nightclub capital of the world alain locke the first black rhodes scholar announced that the harlem renaissance was led by a self confident new negro who no longer felt subservient to white culture.
hughes explained that the harlem writers and artists were at last ready to express our individual d ark skinned selves without fear or shame.
if white people are pleased we are glad.
if they are not it doesnt matter.
we know we are beautiful.
and ugly too in poetry and prose harlem renaissance writers celebrated african american culture including jazz and the blues.
as hughes wrote i am a negro and beautiful.
the night is beautiful.
so are the faces of my people but while hughes loved africa and its cultural heritage his outlook emphatically was not africa.
i was shaped by chicago and kansas city and broadway and harlem the jazz age 1051 women both black and white were active in the harlem renaissance.
in january 1925 a thirty four year old african american woman named zora neale hurston arrived in harlem from eatonville an all black community in rural central florida.
born in alabama in 1891 she was an aspiring writer and inventive storyteller in search of the new negro movement with only 1 50 in her purse no job no friends and a lot of hope she became the first african american to enroll at barnard college the womans college of columbia university on the edge of into bondage this painting by aaron douglas harlem where she majored in cultural exemplifies how black artists in the harlem renaissance used their african roots and anthropology.
collective history as artistic inspiration.
a brassy flamboyant woman hurston had mastered the art of survival by learning to reinvent herself as the need arose.
motherless at nine a runaway at fourteen she became a calculating opportunist blessed with remarkable willpower.
the spirited hurston said she came to harlem to immerse herself in the clang and clamor of city life in a continuing effort to jump at the sun to stretch her ambitions well beyond her resources.
within a few months hurston was behaving in her words as the queen of the harlem renaissance writing short stories and plays about the negro furthest down on the social scale while positioning herself at the center of the communitys raucous social life.
how can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company.
its beyond me she reveled in the black pride and cultural confidence enlivening harlem.
her outspokenness invited controversy as when she claimed that she did not belong to the sobbing school of negrohood who hold that nature somehow has given them a lowdown dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it hurston went on to become a leading anthropologist folklorist and novelist expert at describing the ways in which african americans in the lower south forged cohesive communities in the face of white bigotry and violence.
the harlem renaissance also celebrated the distinctive contributions of poor african americans to american culture.
hurston spoke out on behalf of those who having nothing still refused to be humble so did many other members of the harlem renaissance.
writer james weldon johnson coined 1052 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 the term aframerican to designate americans with african ancestry and to emphasize that blacks were no longer divided by their heritage they were proud to be americans who happened to have an african ancestry.
aframericans he insisted were conscious collaborators in the creation of american society and culture.
the black sculptor augusta savage agreed.
she explained that african americans for three centuries had shared the same cultural background the same system the same standard of beauty as white americans.

essays and films.
a people capable of producing such great art and literature johnson declared should never again be looked upon as inferior garveyism the celebration of black culture found much different expression in what came to be called negro nationalism which promoted black separatism from mainstream american life.
its leading spokesman was marcus garvey who claimed to speak for all 400 million blacks worldwide.
in 1916 garvey brought to harlem the headquarters of the universal negro improvement association unia which he had started in his native jamaica two years before.
garvey insisted that blacks had nothing in common with whites.
in passionate speeches and in editorials in the unias popular newspaper the negro world garvey urged african americans to remove themselves from the surrounding white culture and to cultivate black solidarity and black power the unia quickly became the largest black political organization in the nation.
by 1923 garvey who often wore gaudy military uniforms and f eather plumed hats claimed the unia had as many as 4 million members served by the modernist revolt 1053 800 offices.
his goal was to build an all black empire in africa.
to that end he began calling himself the provisional president of africa raising funds to send americans to africa and expelling any unia member who married a white.
garveys message of black nationalism and racial solidarity appealed especially to poor blacks in northern cities but he also had supporters across the rural south.
garveyism however appalled some black leaders especially those leading the naacp.
du bois labeled garvey the most dangerous enemy of the negro race.
he is either a lunatic or a traitor an african american newspaper pledged to help drive garvey and garveyism in all its sinister viciousness from the american marcus garvey the jamaican soil born founder of the universal negro garveys eccentric crusade col improvement association and leading lapsed in 1923 when he was convicted spokesman for negro nationalism in the 1920s.
of fraud for overselling shares of stock in a steamship corporation the black star line which he founded to transport american blacks to africa.
sentenced to a five year prison term he was pardoned in 1927 by president calvin coolidge on the condition that he be deported to jamaica where he received a heros welcome.
garvey died in obscurity in 1940 but the memory of his movement kept alive an undercurrent that would reemerge in the 1960s under the slogan black power the modernist revolt the dramatic changes in society and the economy during the twenties were spurred by transformations in science and the arts during the p revious two decades.
since the e ighteenth century enlightenment conventional wisdom had held that the universe was governed by basic underlying laws of time 1054 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 and energy light and motion.
this rational world of order and c ertainty disintegrated in the early twentieth century thanks to the discoveries of e uropean physicists.
albert einstein during a century remarkable for its scientific discoveries and technological advances one genius stands out albert einstein a scientific rebel with an unrivaled imagination.
many of his greatest discoveries emerged not from research but from his remarkable ability to picture in his mind the strange effects of natural forces from the infinitesimally small to the infinitely large.
in 1905 einstein a t wenty six year old german born physicist working in switzerland published several research papers that changed science forever while at times defying common sense.
the first paper which would earn him the nobel prize in 1921 revealed that light was not simply a wave of continuous energy but a stream of tiny particles called quanta now called photons.
this breakthrough would provide the theoretical basis for quantum physics and new electronic technologies such as television laser beams and semiconductors used to make computers.
in his second research paper einstein confirmed the existence of molecules and atoms by showing how their random collisions explained the jerky motions of tiny particles in water.
einsteins third paper introduced the special theory of relativity which argues that no matter how fast one is moving toward or away from a source of light the speed of that light beam will appear the same a constant 186 000 miles per second.
but space and time will appear relative to the speed of light.
so if a train were traveling at the speed of light time would slow down from the perspective of an observer and the train itself would albert einstein one of the most get shorter and heavier.
influential scientists of the twentieth in 1916 einstein unveiled his general century einstein was awarded a nobel theory of relativity which maintained that prize in 1921 the fundamental concepts of space time the modernist revolt 1055 matter and energy are not distinct independent things with stable d imensions as sir isaac newton had assumed in the eighteenth century but that they are interacting elements constantly changing one another.
as a beam of light travels through space time gravity causes it to curve.
likewise the hands of a clock traveling at high speeds move more slowly than those of a stationary clock.
nothing is fixed or absolute in einsteins bewildering universe everything is relative to the location and motion of the observer and the distorting effects of gravity which warp space and time.
things are big or little long or short slow or fast light or heavy only by comparison to something else.
einstein also explained that all matter is a special form of energy and that a very small amount of material could yield enormous energy if its atomic structure were disrupted.
by showing that much more was going on in the universe than had long been assumed einsteins discoveries revolutionized the way scientists perceived the natural world.
a british newspaper said the general theory of relativity was one of the most momentous.
pronouncements of human thought in 1919 after astronomers had spent three years testing einsteins theories the new york times announced einsteins theory triumphs einstein was so influential in deciphering the forces of the cosmos that his ideas became impossible to i gnore and almost as difficult to explain.
many of his complex discoveries entered popular culture as people oversimplified his theory of relativity by claiming that there were no absolute standards all was relative during the twenties the idea of relativity emerged in popular discussions of topics such as sexuality the arts and politics there was less faith in absolutes.
notions of relativity shaped many of the intellectual cultural and social currents of the twentieth century.
modernist art and literature the scientific breakthroughs associated with sigmund freud albert einstein and other scientists helped to inspire a modernist cultural revolution.
modernism as a recognizable movement appeared first in the capitals of europe london paris berlin and vienna in the 1890s.
by the second decade of the twentieth century it had spread to the united states especially new york city and chicago.
put most simply modernism was the widespread awareness that new ideas and ways of doing things were making a sharp break with tradition.
the modernist point of view arose out of recognition that new technologies modes of transportation and communication and scientific discoveries were transforming the nature of everyday life as well as the way people saw the world.
the horrors of the great war served to accelerate and expand the appeal of modernism and helped explain why modernists cared little for established 1056 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 standards of good taste or for history.
to be modern was to break free of tradition take chances violate artistic rules and moral restrictions and behave in deliberately shocking ways.
art said a modernist painter is meant to disturb as an experimental cultural movement modernism was loosely based on three unsettling assumptions 1 god did not exist 2 reality was not rational orderly or obvious and in the aftermath of the great war 3 social progress could no longer be taken for granted.
in the arts these modernist premises challenged writers artists musicians and architects to risk poverty and humiliation by rudely rebelling against good taste old fashioned morals and old time religion.
modernists were artistic revolutionaries who delighted in the madness of the unexpected and refused to be conventional.
in its simplest sense modernism was a disrespectful war of new values against old ones.
experimental poet ezra pound provided the slogan for the modernist movement make it new much about modernism provoked perplexed and upset people.
until the twentieth century most writers and artists had taken for granted an accessible real world that could be readily observed scientifically explained and accurately represented in words or paint or even music.
the modernists however applied einsteins ideas about relativity to a world in which reality no longer had an objective or recognizable basis.
they agreed wholeheartedly with freud that reality in fact was an intensely inward and subjective e xperience something deeply personal and even unrecognizable by others something to be imagined and expressed by ones innermost being rather than observed and reproduced.
walter pach an early american champion of modern art explained that modernism resulted from the discovery of the role played by the unconscious in our lives the armory show the crusade to bring e uropean inspired modernism to the united states reached a climax in the armory show of 1913 the most scandalous event in the history of american art.
mabel dodge one of the organizers wrote to gertrude stein that the exhibition would cause a riot and revolution and things will never be the same afterwards to house the 1 200 modernist works collected from more than 300 painters and sculptors in america and europe the two dozen young painters who organized the show leased the vast 69th regiment armory in new york city.
the armory show officially known as the international exhibition of modern art opened on february 17 1913.
it created an immediate sensation.
for many modern art became the thing that they loved to hate.
modernism grumbled a prominent critic is nothing else than the total destruction of the the modernist revolt 1057 russian ballet 1916 jewish american artist max webers painting is a modernist take on a traditional subject.
splicing the scene of the performance into overlapping planes of jarring colors this painting exemplifies the impact of psychoanalysis and the theory of relativity on the arts.
art of painting the new york times warned visitors that they would enter a stark region of abstractions at the lunatic asylum show that was hideous to our unaccustomed eyes the experimentalist avant garde artists whose works were on display including paintings by vincent van gogh paul gauguin and henri matisse as well as cezanne and picasso were in love with science but not with objective reality the times critic complained and had produced paintings revolting in their inhumanity former president theodore roosevelt dismissed the show as repellent from every standpoint yet the show also generated excited praise.
a new world has arisen before our eyes announced an american art magazine.
to miss modern art an art critic stressed is to miss one of the few thrills that life holds from new york the show went on to chicago and boston where it aroused similarly strong responses and attracted more huge crowds.
1058 chapter 23 a clash of cultures 1920 1929 after the armory show modern art became one of the nations favorite topics of debate.
many found a new faith in the disturbing powers of art.
america in its newness predicted walt kuhn a painter who helped organize the exhibition is destined to become the coming center of modernism.
indeed the museum of modern art founded in new york city in 1929 came to house the worlds most celebrated collection of avant garde paintings and sculpture.
pound eliot and stein the leading american champions of modern art and literature lived not in chicago or in new york but in england and europe i daho born ezra pound and st louis born t s eliot in l ondon and californian gertrude stein in paris.
working separately but spreading their influence together they were self conscious revolutionaries deeply concerned with creating strange new and often beautifully difficult forms of modernist expression.
they found more inspiration and more receptive audiences in europe than in the united states.
as the foreign editor of the chicago based poetry magazine pound became the cultural impresario of modernism the conduit through which many experimental american poets gained publication and exposure.
in bitter poems and earnest essays denouncing war and commercialism he displayed an incessant uncompromising urgency to transform the literary landscape.
an english poet called him a solitary volcano t s eliot claimed that pound was single handedly responsible for the modernist movement in poetry.
pound recruited edited published and reviewed the best among the new generation of modernist writers improving their writing bolstering their courage and propelling their careers.
in his own poetry he expressed the feeling of many that the war had wasted a whole generation of young men who died in defense of a botched civilization one of the young american writers pound took under his wing was eliot who had recently graduated from harvard.
within a few years eliot surpassed pound to become the leading american modernist.
eliot declared that traditional poetry was stagnant to a degree difficult for any young poet to imagine eliots epic 433 line poem the waste land 1922 which pound edited became a monument of modernism.
it expressed a sense of postwar disillusionment and melancholy that had a powerful effect on other writers.
as a poet and critic for the criterion which he founded in 1922 eliot became the arbiter of modernist taste in anglo american literature.
gertrude stein was the self appointed champion of the american modernists who chose to live in paris.
long regarded as simply the literary eccentric who wrote rose is a rose is a rose is a rose stein was in fact one of the chief promoters of the triumphant subjectivity undergirding modernist expression.
the modernist revolt 1059 she sought to capture in words the equivalent of abstract painting and its self conscious revolt against portraying recognizable scenes from real life.
stein who declared that literature that tells about what happens in life is of no interest to anybody became famous for hosting a cultural salon in paris that became a gathering place for american and european modernists.
the lost generation along with the shock of modernism the arts and literature of the twenties were also greatly influenced by the horrors of the great war.
f scott fitzgerald wrote in this side of paradise that the sad young men who had fought in europe to make the world safe for democracy had grown up to find all gods dead all wars fought all faiths in man shaken cynicism had displaced idealism in the wake of the wars horrific senselessness.
as fitzgerald asserted theres only one lesson to be learned from life anyway.
that theres no lesson to be learned from life frederic henry a character in ernest hemingways novel a farewell to arms 1929 declares that abstract words such as glory honor courage.
were obscene in the context of the wars colossal casualties.
fitzgerald hemingway and other young modernists were labeled the lost g eneration those who had lost faith in the values and institutions of western civilization and were frantically looking for new gods to worship.
it was gertrude stein who in 1921 told hemingway that he and his friends who had served in the war are a lost generation when hemingway objected she held her ground.
you are lost.
you have no respect for anything.
you drink yourselves to death in his first novel the sun also rises 1926 hemingway used the phrase lost generation in the books opening quotation.
the novel centers on jake barnes a young american journalist castrated by a war injury.
his despairing impotence leads him to wander the cafes and nightclubs of postwar europe with his unhappy friends who acknowledge that they are all wounded and sterile in their own way they have lost their innocence their illusions and their motivation to do anything with their lives.
fitzgerald the earliest chronicler of the lost generation blazed up brilliantly and then quickly flickered out like many of the characters in his novels.
his works centered on s elf indulgent and s elf destructive people who drank and partied too much.
a friend and fellow writer called fitzgerald our darling our genius our fool what gave depth to the best of his work was what a character in the great gatsby 1925 his finest novel called a sense of the fundamental decencies amid all the surface g aiety and a sense of impending doom in a world that had lost its meaning through the disorienting discoveries of modern science and the horrors of world war.
chapter review summary a new era of consumption the american economy grew at its fastest rate in history during the 1920s led by an explosion in mass production and sales of new consumer goods.
innovations in production advertising and financing and a jump in the use of electricity enabled and encouraged millions of americans to purchase automobiles radios and other electrical appliances.
the automobile industry was at the center of these changes as ford motor company pioneered mass production using moving assembly lines a highly efficient method that helped make its cars affordable for a majority of americans.
the new consumer culture valued leisure self expression and self indulgence.
during the twenties consumer debt tripled.
innovations in communications especially the growth in radio ownership transportation finance and advertising also brought about a mass culture as more and more americans purchased national brand name items from retail chain stores listened to the same radio shows watched the same movies and followed the lives and careers of national celebrities and superstars.
the jazz age other new social and cultural trends and movements rapidly challenged the traditional order.
the carefree fads and attitudes of the 1920s perhaps best represented by the frantic rhythms of jazz music led writer f scott fitzgerald to call the decade the jazz age.
a new woman appeared best represented by flappers young women who challenged prewar restrictions with their short hemlines drinking smoking and open discussions of sex.
the majority of women however remained full time housewives and mothers or domestic servants and fewer young women pursued professional careers.
with the great migration continuing african americans in northern cities felt freer to speak out against racial injustice and express pride in their race.
the harlem renaissance movement gave voice to african american literature and music.
racial separatism and black nationalism grew popular under the leadership of marcus garvey while other african americans joined white supporters in the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and supported its efforts to undo racism through education legislation and court challenges.
the modernist revolt many american artists and intellectuals were attracted to modernism a movement that had begun in europe before the great war and reflected new developments in science particularly albert einsteins theory of relativity and sigmund freuds exploration of how the subconscious mind shapes human behavior.
to be modern meant to break free of tradition to violate restrictions to shock the public and to make ones works difficult to explain or interpret.
americans were first exposed to modern art in a substantial way with the armory show of 1913.

they traced the germs of dangerous radicalism to the multiethnic cities teeming with immigrants and foreign ideas such as socialism communism and anarchism.

but newcomers have never been universally welcomed or embraced.
after the end of the great war masses of people emigrated from europe to the united states.
between 1919 and 1924 more than 600 000 people from southern and eastern europe most of them italians entered the united states along with 150 000 poles and 50 000 russians.

988 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 an uneasy neutrality woodrow wilson once declared that he had a fi rst class mind and he was indeed highly intelligent thoughtful principled and courageous.
upon learning of death threats against him for example he refused to change his schedule of public appearances.
the country he explained cannot afford to have a coward for president for all of his accomplishments and abilities however wilson had no experience or expertise in international relations before he was elected president.
he confessed that it would be an irony of fate if my administration had to deal chiefly with foreign affairs a topic he did not even mention in his 1913 inaugural address.
but from the summer of 1914 when war erupted in europe wilson was forced to shift his attention from the new freedoms progressive reforms to foreign affairs.
wilson did have strong beliefs and principles about global issues.
sometimes people call me an idealist he once said.
well that is the way i know im an american he saw himself as being directed by god to help create a new world order governed by morality and ideals rather than by selfish national interests.
both wilson and william jennings bryan his secretary of state believed that america had a duty to promote democracy and christianity around the world.
every nation of the world wilson declared needs to be drawn into the tutelage guidance of america the great war woodrow wilson faced his greatest challenge beginning in the summer of 1914 when a war that few wanted yet no one could stop broke out in europe.
the dreadful conflict erupted suddenly like lightning out of a clear sky a north carolina congressman said.
wilson admitted that he was shocked by this incredible european eruption unfortunately it coincided with a sharp decline in the health of his wife ellen who died on august 6.
god has stricken me the president wrote a friend almost beyond what i can bear wilson would also have trouble bearing the accelerating horrors of the war in europe.
its scope and destruction shocked everyone.
lasting for more than four years from 1914 to 1918 it would become known as the great war because it would involve more nations and cause greater destruction than any previous war 20 million military and civilian deaths and 21 million more wounded.
the great war would topple monarchs destroy empires create new nations and set in motion a series of events that would lead to an even greater war in 1939.
an uneasy neutrality 989 causes the great war resulted from complex and long simmering national rivalries and ethnic conflicts in central europe.
at the core of the tensions was the austro hungarian empire an unstable collection of eleven nationalities that was determined to stop the expansionism of its neighbor and longstanding enemy serbia in the balkan peninsula.
serbia had long hoped to create yugoslavia a nation encompassing all serbs from throughout the a ustro hungarian empire.
at the same time a recklessly militaristic germany led by kaiser emperor wilhelm ii sought to assert its dominance against its old enemies the russian empire and france while expanding its navy to challenge the british empires supremacy on the seas.
fighting erupts war erupted after gavrilo princip a nineteen y ear old serbian nationalist in sarajevo the capital of austrian bosnia shot and killed the heir to the austro hungarian throne 50 year old archduke franz ferdinand and his pregnant wife sophie on june 28 1914.
the killings in sarajevo set europe on fire.
to avenge the murders austria hungary with germanys unconditional approval sought to bully and humiliate serbia by demanding a say in its internal affairs.
serbia gave in to virtually all of the demands but austria hungary declared war anyway.
in turn russia mobilized its army to defend serbia which triggered reactions by a complex set of european military alliances the triple alliance or central powers germany austria hungary and italy and the triple entente or allied powers france great britain and russia.
germany expecting a limited war and quick victory declared war on russia on august 1 1914 and on france two days later.
germany then invaded neutral belgium murdering hundreds of civilians.
events spiraled out of control.
the rape of belgium brought great britain into the war against germany on august 4 on the western front the line of fighting in northern france and belgium.
despite the triple alliance italy at first declared its neutrality before joining the allies in return for a promise of territory taken from a ustria hungary.
on the evening of august 4 as five global empires austria hungary france germany great britain and russia mobilized for war the british foreign minister sir edward grey expressed the fears of many when he observed that the lamps are going out all over europe we shall not see them lit again in our time on the eastern front russian armies began clashing with german and austro hungarian forces as well as those of the turkish ottoman empire.

of the approximately an uneasy neutrality 991 70 million soldiers and sailors who fought on both sides more than half were killed wounded imprisoned or unaccounted for.
new weapons dramatically changed the nature of warfare.
machine guns submarines aerial bombing poison gas flame throwers land mines mortars long range artillery and armored tanks produced appalling casualties and widespread destruction a slaughter on a scale unimaginable to this day.
an average of 900 frenchmen and 1 300 germans died every day on the western front.
the early weeks of the war involved fast moving assaults as german armies swept across belgium and northeastern france.
the casualties were appalling.
on a single day august 22 1914 the french army lost 27 000 men.
trench warfare but the war on the western front soon bogged down into hellish trench warfare in which often inept generals sent masses of brave soldiers german generals referred to the british army as lions led by donkeys out of waterlogged zigzagging trenches some of them 40 feet deep and swarming with r ats that had been dug along the western front from the coast of belgium across northeastern france to the border of switzerland.
on either side the attackers were usually at a disadvantage as they slogged across muddy acres of devastated no man s land between the opposing trench warfare american troops eat amid the reek of death and threat of enemy fire in a frontline trench in france.
992 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 entrenchments where they encountered c orpse filled shell holes webs of barbed wire and constant gunfire and artillery shelling that left the barren landscape pockmarked with craters and whole forests shattered into nothingness.
along the western front not a blade of grass was left only ruin and rubble flooded trenches and thickets of barbed wire.
from 1914 to 1918 the opposing armies in northeastern france attacked and counterattacked but gained hardly any ground while casualties rose into the millions.
by the end of 1914 the germans had captured 19 500 square miles of territory in france and belgium by the end of 1915 the allies had recaptured only 8 of those miles.
words cannot convey the titanic scale of the fighting and its impact on the home front as telegrams arrived telling families that their son would not be returning.
by 1918 the allies france great britain italy russia and the united states among others had suffered 5 4 million killed and 7 million wounded.
the war is everything a british diarist wrote.
it is noble filthy great petty degrading inspiring ridiculous glorious mad bad hopeless yet full of hope heroism was entangled with futility as battles were now determined not so much by skillful maneuvers or courageous leadership but by overwhelming firepower the huge cannons and weighty shells that turned the ritual of close combat into a long distance contest of killing machines.
bayonets gave way to bombardments.
two thirds of the casualties in the great war resulted from l ong distance artillery barrages.
thousands of soldiers on both sides fell victim to shell shock now known as post traumatic stress disorder as they were bombarded into numbness.
trenches shook trees tumbled and the ground trembled under the feet of panicked combatants.
the unprecedented firepower ravaged the landscape obliterated whole villages and turned farmland and forests into cratered wastelands.
the scars of war are still visible 100 years later.
trench warfare gave the great war its lasting character.
soldiers often ate slept lived and died without leaving their crowded underground homes.
a french soldier described life in the trenches as a physical almost animal existence in which the primitive instincts of the race have full sway eating drinking sleeping fighting everything but loving the object in such a war of attrition was not so much to gain ground as to keep inflicting death and destruction on the enemy until its manpower and resources were exhausted.
in one assault against the germans at ypres in belgium the british lost 13 000 men in three hours of fighting during which time they gained 100 meaningless yards.
as the war ground on nations on an uneasy neutrality 993 total ruin german soldiers stand before the french fort souville between the battles of verdun in september 1916.
the constant artillery fire gouged out huge craters and destroyed forests.
both sides found themselves using up their available men resources courage and cash.
amid the senseless killing in the mucky trenches the innocence about the true nature of warfare died too.
never such innocence again wrote the english poet philip larkin.
an american journalist covering the war in europe reported that the massive casualties changed the way men looked at war.
in earlier conflicts soldiers were eager to fight and confident they would return unscathed.
now the new recruits seemed to have left hope behind and were confident that they were going to their death by 1915 the great powers were engaged in a global war with no end in sight.
in 1917 george barnes a british official whose son had been killed in the war went to speak at a military hospital in london where injured soldiers were being fitted with artificial limbs.
at the appointed hour the men in wheelchairs and on crutches all with empty sleeves or pants legs arrived to hear the speaker.
yet when barnes was introduced and rose to talk he found himself speechless literally.
as the minutes passed in awkward silence tears rolled down his cheeks.
finally without having said a word he simply sat down.
what the mutilated soldiers heard was not a war glorifying speech but the muted sound of grief.
the wars mindless horrors had come home.
994 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 initial american reactions disbelief in the united states over the bloodbath in europe mingled with relief that a wide ocean stood between america and the killing fields.
president wilson an avowed pacifist maintained that the united states was too proud to fight in europes war with which we have nothing to do whose causes cannot touch us he repeatedly urged americans to remain neutral in thought as well as in action privately however wilson sought to ensure that the united states could provide great britain and france as much financial assistance and supplies as possible.
that most americans wanted the nation to stay out of the fighting did not keep them from choosing sides.
more than a third of the nations citizens were first or second generation immigrants still loyal to their homelands.
eight million german born americans lived in the united states in 1914 and most of the 4 million irish born americans detested england which had ruled the irish for centuries.
for the most part these groups supported the central powers while other americans largely of british origin supported the allied powers.
supporting the allies by the spring of 1915 the allied powers need for food and supplies had generated an economic windfall for american businesses bankers and farmers.
exports to france and great britain quadrupled from 1914 to 1916.
to finance their record breaking purchases of american supplies the allies especially britain and france needed loans from u s banks and credits from the u s government that would allow them to pay for their purchases later.
early in the war secretary of state william jennings bryan a strict pacifist took advantage of wilsons absence from washington after the death of his wife to tell j pierpont morgan the worlds richest banker that loans to any nations at war were inconsistent with the true spirit of neutrality upon his return an angry wilson reversed bryans policy by removing all restrictions on loans to the warring nations belligerents.
american banks and other investors would eventually send more than 2 billion to the allies before the united states entered the fighting and only 27 million to germany.
what bryan feared and what wilson did not fully realize was that as britain and france borrowed and purchased more from the united states it became harder for america to remain neutral.
despite the disproportionate financial assistance provided to the allies the wilson administration maintained its official neutrality for thirty months.
in particular wilson tried valiantly to defend the age old principle of freedom of the an uneasy neutrality 995 seas as a neutral nation the united states according to international law should have been able to continue to trade with all the nations at war.
on august 6 1914 bryan urged the warring nations to respect the rights of neutral nations to ship goods across the atlantic.
the central powers agreed but the british refused.
in november 1914 the british ordered the ships of neutral nations to submit to searches to discover if cargoes were bound for germany.
a few months later the british announced that they would seize any ships carrying goods to germany.
neutral rights and sub marine attacks with its war the sandwich man to illustrate americas biased brand of neutrality this political cartoon shows uncle sam wearing a sandwich board that advertises the nations conflicting desires.
ships bottled up by a british blockade the german government announced a war zone around the british isles.
all ships in those waters would be attacked by submarines the germans warned and it may not always be possible to save crews and passengers the germans use of submarines or u boats unterseeboot in german violated the long established wartime custom of stopping an enemy vessel and allowing the passengers and crew to board lifeboats before sinking it.
during 1915 german u boats sank 227 british ships in the atlantic ocean and the north sea.
the united states called the submarine attacks an indefensible violation of neutral rights and wilson warned that he would hold germany to strict accountability for the loss of american lives and property.
then on may 7 1915 a german submarine sank the lusitania an unarmed british luxury liner.
of the 1 198 persons on board who died 128 were americans.
the sinking of the lusitania asserted former president theodore roosevelt was mass murder that called for a declaration of war.
wilson at first urged patience there is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight.
there is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right critics scolded wilson for his bloodless response.
roosevelt dismissed it as unmanly called the president a jackass and threatened to skin him alive 996 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 if he doesnt go to war wilson privately admitted that he had misspoken.
the timid language he said had occurred to me while i was speaking and i let it out.
i should have kept it in wilsons earlier threat of strict accountability now required a tough response.
on may 13 secretary of state bryan demanded that the germans stop unrestricted submarine warfare apologize and pay the families of those killed on the lusitania.
the germans countered that the ship was armed which was false and secretly carried rifles and ammunition which was true.
on june 9 wilson dismissed the german claims and reiterated that the united states was contending for nothing less high and sacred than the rights of humanity bryan resigned as secretary of state in protest of wilsons p ro british stance.
upon learning of bryans departure edith bolling galt soon to be wilsons second wife shouted hurrah.
old bryan is out she called the former secretary of state an awful deserter the president confided that he too viewed bryan as a traitor he complimented edith on her vindictiveness what a dear partisan you are.
and how you can hate too bryans successor robert lansing signed the second lusitania note stunned by the global outcry over the lusitania the german government told its u boat captains to quit attacking passenger vessels.
despite the order however a german submarine sank the british liner arabic and two americans on board were killed.
the germans paid a cash penalty to their families and issued what came to be called the arabic pledge on september 1 1915 liners will not be sunk by our submarines without warning and without safety of the lives of n on combatants provided that the liners do not try to escape or offer resistance in early 1916 wilson sent his closest adviser colonel edward m house to london paris and berlin in hopes of stimulating peace talks but the mission failed.
on march 24 1916 a u boat sank the french passenger ferry sussex killing eighty passengers and injuring two americans.
after wilson threatened to end relations with germany its leaders renewed their promise not to sink merchant and passenger ships.
the sussex pledge implied the virtual abandonment of submarine warfare.
colonel house noted in his diary that americans were now beginning to realize that we are on the brink of war and what war means preparing for war the sinking of u s passenger vessels led to efforts to strengthen the army and navy in case the nation was forced into war.
on december 1 1914 a preparedness movement led by theodore roosevelt and henry cabot lodge created the national security league to convince congress and the president to begin preparing for war.
an uneasy neutrality 997 wilson too believed in preparedness.
after the lusitania sinking he directed the war and navy departments to develop plans for a 1 billion military expansion.
his efforts were controversial however.
many americans p acifists progressives and non interventionists opposed the preparedness effort seeing it as simply a propaganda campaign to benefit defense industries war traffickers that made weapons and other military equipment.
despite such opposition congress in 1916 passed the national defense act which provided for the expansion of the u s army from 90 000 to 223 000 men over the next five years.
while bryan and others complained that wilson wanted to drag this nation into war the reverse was actually true.
wilson told an aide that he was determined not to be rushed into war no matter if every damned congressman and senator stands up on his hind legs and proclaims me a coward opponents of preparedness insisted that the expense of military expansion should rest upon the wealthy munitions makers who they believed were promoting it in order to profit from trade with the allies.
the income tax became their weapon.
the revenue act of 1916 doubled the income tax rate from 1 to 2 percent created a 12 5 percent tax on munitions makers and added a new tax on excessive corporate profits.
the new taxes were the culmination of the progressive legislation that wilson approved to strengthen his chances in the upcoming presidential election.
fearing that theodore roosevelt would be the republican presidential candidate challenging wilson colonel house believed that the democratic party must change its historic character and become the progressive party in the future the 1916 election as the 1916 election approached theodore roosevelt hoped to become the republican nominee.
but his decision in 1912 to run as a t hird party candidate had alienated many powerful republicans and his eagerness to enter the european war scared many voters.
so instead the republicans nominated supreme court justice charles evans hughes a progressive who had served as governor of new york from 1907 to 1910.
the democrats staying with wilson adopted a platform centered on social welfare legislation and prudent military preparedness.
the peace theme refined in the slogan he kept us out of war became the campaigns rallying cry although the president now acknowledged that the united states could no longer refuse to play the great part in the world which was providentially cut out for her.
we have got to serve the world colonel house was more blunt.
he told secretary of state robert lansing that they could not permit the allies to go down in defeat for if they did we would follow 998 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 peace with honor woodrow wilsons neutrality policies proved popular in the 1916 campaign.
both wilson and hughes were sons of preachers both were attorneys and former professors both had been progressive governors both were known for their integrity.
hughes called for higher tariffs attacked wilson for being hostile to big business and implied that wilson was not neutral enough in responding to the war.
theodore roosevelt who was devastated that his party did not nominate him called the bearded hughes a whiskered wilson wilson however proved to be the better campaigner barely.
by midnight on election night wilson went to bed assuming that he had lost.
roosevelt was so sure hughes had won that he sent him a congratulatory telegram.
at 4 a m however the results from california were tallied.
wilson had eked out a victory in that state by only 4 000 votes and thus had become the first democrat to win a second consecutive term since andrew jackson in 1832.
his pledge of peace prosperity and progressivism won him the western states ohio and the solid south.
america goes to war after his reelection wilson again urged the warring nations to negotiate a peace settlement but to no avail.
on january 31 1917 desperate german military leaders renewed unrestricted submarine warfare in the atlantic.
all an uneasy neutrality 999 vessels from the united states headed for britain france or italy would be sunk without warning.
this was practically ordering the united states off the atlantic said an angry william mcadoo wilsons secretary of the treasury.
the german decision colonel house wrote in his journal left wilson sad and depressed for the president knew it meant war.
for their part the germans greatly underestimated the american reaction.
the united states the german military newspaper proclaimed not only has no army it has no artillery no means of transportation no airplanes and lacks all other instruments of modern warfare when his advisers warned that german submarines might cause the united states to enter the war kaiser wilhelm scoffed i dont care the zimmermann telegram on february 3 president wilson informed congress that the united states had formally ended diplomatic relations with the german government.
three weeks later on february 25 wilson learned that the british had intercepted a message from a german official arthur zimmermann to the mexican government urging the mexicans to invade the united states.
in exchange germany would give mexico lost territory in texas new mexico and arizona on march 1 newspapers broke the news of the s o called zimmermann telegram.
infuriated americans called for war against the germans whose attacks on american vessels increased.
america enters the war in march 1917 german submarines torpedoed five u s ships in the north atlantic.
for wilson this was the last straw.
on april 2 he called on congress to declare war against germany.
in one of his greatest speeches wilson insisted that the world must be made safe for democracy he warned that waging war in europe would require mobilizing all the material resources of the country and he called for 500 000 men to bolster the armed forces.
the united states he asserted was entering the war to lead a great crusade not simply to defeat germany but to end wars forever.
congress greeted wilsons message with thunderous applause.
on april 4 the senate passed the war resolution by a vote of 82 to 6.
the house followed 373 to 50 and wilson signed the measure on april 6.
jeanette rankin of montana the first woman elected to the house was one of the few members who voted against war.
you can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake she explained.
i want to stand by my country but i cannot vote for war wilson had doubts of his own.
the president feared accurately as it turned o ut that mobilizing the nation for war and stamping out dissent would destroy the ideals and momentum of progressivism every reform we have made will be lost if we go into this war yet he saw no choice.
1000 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 americas long embrace of isolationism was over.
the nation had reached a turning point in its relations with the world that would test all of president wilsons political and diplomatic skills and his stamina.
mobilizing a nation in april 1917 the u s army remained small untested and poorly armed.
with only 107 000 men it was only the seventeenth largest army in the world.
now the wilson administration needed to recruit equip and train an army of millions and transport them across an ocean infested with german submarines.
mobilizing the nation for war led to an unprecedented expansion of federal authority.
the government drafted millions of men between the ages of twenty one and thirty into the armed services forced the conversion of industries and farms to wartime needs took over the railroads and in many other respects assumed control of national life.
soon after the u s declaration of war president wilson called for complete economic mobilization and created new federal agencies to coordinate the effort.
the war industries board wib established in 1917 soon became the most important of all the federal mobilization agencies.
bernard baruch a savvy financier headed the wib which had the authority to ration raw materials construct new factories and set prices.
wilson appointed republican herbert hoover to head the new food administration whose slogan was food will win the war its purpose was to increase agricultural production while reducing civilian food consumpthe immigrant effort this food tion since great britain and france administration poster emphasizes that wheat is.
for the allies an important needed massive amounts of american message to immigrants who hailed corn and wheat.
hoover organized a from central powers nations such as huge group of volunteers who fanned germany and austria.
out across the country to urge house mobilizing a nation 1001 wives and restaurants to participate in wheatless mondays meatless tuesdays and porkless thursdays and saturdays.
fighting in the great war would cost the u s government 30 billion which was more than thirty times the entire federal budget in 1917.
in addition to raising taxes to finance the war effort the wilson administration launched a campaign across the nation to sell liberty bonds government securities in the form of paper certificates that guaranteed the purchaser a fixed rate of return.
the government recruited dozens of celebrities to promote bond purchases arguing that a liberty bond was both a patriotic investment in the nation and a smart investment in ones own financial future.
even the boy scouts and girl scouts sold bonds using advertising posters that said every scout to save a soldier by wars end the government had sold over 20 billion in bonds most of which were purchased by banks and investment houses rather than by individuals.
a new labor force removing 4 million men from the workforce to serve in the armed forces created an acute labor shortage.
to meet it women were encouraged to take jobs previously held mostly by men.
one government poster shouted women.
help americas sons win the war learn to make munitions another said for every fighter a woman worker initially women had supported the war effort mostly in traditional ways.
they helped organize fund raising drives donated canned food and war related materials volunteered for the red cross and joined the army nurse corps.
as the scope of the war widened however women were recruited to work on farms loading docks and railway crews as well as in the armaments industry machine shops steel and lumber mills and chemical plants.
at last after centuries of disabilities and discrimination said a speaker at a womens trade union league meeting in 1917 women are coming into the labor force and festival of life on equal terms with men but the changes in female employment were limited and brief.
about 1 million women participated in war work but most were young and single and already working outside the home and most returned to their previous jobs once the war ended.
in fact after the war m ale dominated unions encouraged women to go back to domestic roles.
the central federated union of new york insisted that the same patriotism which induced women to enter industry during the war should induce them to vacate their positions after the war the great war also generated dramatic changes for many members of minority groups.
hundreds of thousands of african american men enlisted or were drafted into the military where they were required to serve in racially segregated units commanded by white officers as in the civil war half a century earlier.
1002 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 at the munitions factory women on both sides played crucial roles in the war effort from building airplanes to cooking for soldiers overseas.
here american women use welding torches to build bombs.
on the home front northern businesses sent recruiting agents into the southern states which were still largely rural and agricultural to find workers for their factories and mills.
for the first time such efforts were directed at african americans as well as whites.
more than 400 000 southern blacks mostly farmers joined what came to be known as the great migration a mass movement that would continue through the 1920s and change the political and social chemistry of northern cities such as st louis chicago detroit new york and philadelphia.
by 1930 the number of african americans living in the north was triple that of 1910.
recruiting agents and newspaper editors both black and white portrayed the north as the land of promise for southern blacks.
northern factory jobs were plentiful and high paying by southern standards and racism was less obvious and violent at least at first.
a black migrant from mississippi wrote home from chicago in 1917 that he wished he had moved north twenty years earlier.
i just begin to feel like a man here he explained.
its a great deal of mobilizing a nation 1003 pleasure in knowing that you have some privilege.
my children are going to the same school with the whites and i dont have to be humble to no one many mexican americans found similar opportunities to improve their status during the war and after.
some joined the military.
david barkley hernandez had to drop his last name when he enlisted in san antonio texas because the local draft board was not accepting mexicans.
in 1918 just two days before the war ended he died in france while returning from a dan gerous mission behind german lines.
hernandez became the first person of mexican descent in the u s army to win the congressional medal of honor.
even more latinos pursued economic opportunities created by the war effort.
between 1917 and 1920 some 100 000 mexicans crossed the border into the united states.
the economic expansion caused by the war enabled migrant farmworkers already living in states such as texas new mexico arizona and california to take better jobs in factories and mills in rapidly growing cities such as phoenix los angeles and houston where they moved into s panish speaking neighborhoods called barrios.
segregation in the military most african american enlistees served in support units because whites believed them unfit for combat despite evidence of black military contributions since the revolution.
here soldiers in the 92nd infantry division one of the few colored units sent overseas march in verdun france.
1004 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 but the newcomers whether latinos or blacks were often resented rather than welcomed.
j luz saenz a mexican american from texas noted in his diary that it took only three days after he was discharged from the army to have whites throw us out from restaurants and deny us service as human beings in 1917 more than forty african americans and nine whites were killed during a riot in a weapons plant in east st louis illinois.
two years later a chicago race riot left twenty three african americans and fifteen whites dead.
a loss of civil liberties once war was declared americans often equated anything german with disloyalty.
german americans were publicly harassed and discriminated against.
many americans quit drinking beer because most breweries were owned by german americans.
symphonies refused to perform music by bach and beethoven schools canceled german language classes and grocers renamed sauerkraut liberty cabbage president wilson had predicted as much.
once we lead this people into war he said theyll forget there ever was such a thing as tolerance what wilson did not say was that he himself would lead the effort to suppress civil liberties for as he claimed subversive forces in a nation at war must be crushed out under the espionage and sedition acts congress prohibited any criticism of government leaders and war policies.
the espionage act of 1917 called for twenty years in prison for anyone who helped the enemy encouraged insubordination disloyalty or refusal of duty in the armed services or interfered with the war effort in other ways.
during the war 1 055 people were convicted under the espionage act.
most were simply critics of the war.
keep out of it in this 1918 war poster socialist leader eugene v debs a milithe k aiser with his famous moustache tant pacifist was convicted simply for and spiked german helmet is depicted opposing the war and was sentenced to as a spider spinning an invisible web to ten years in prison.
he told the court catch the stray words of allied civilians.
he would always criticize wars imposed the american role in the war 1005 by the master class while there is a lower class i am in it.
while there is a criminal element i am of it.
while there is a soul in prison i am not free the sedition act of 1918 broadened the espionage act to those who tried to impede the sale of war bonds or promoted cutbacks in production it even outlawed saying writing or printing anything disloyal profane scurrilous or abusive about the american form of government the constitution or the army and navy.
the supreme court endorsed the espionage and sedition acts in two rulings issued just after the war ended.
schenck v united states 1919 reaffirmed the conviction of charles t schenck head of the socialist party for circulating leaflets opposing the war among members of the armed forces.
justice oliver wendell holmes wrote the unanimous court opinion that freedom of speech did not apply to words that represented a clear and present danger to the safety of the country in abrams v united states 1919 the court upheld the conviction of a man who had distributed pamphlets opposing military intervention in russia to remove the bolsheviks who had seized power in 1917.
the american role in the war in 1917 americas war strategy focused on helping the struggling french and british armies on the western front.
the allied leaders stressed that they needed at least a million american troops called doughboys to defeat the germans but it would take months to recruit equip and train that many new soldiers.
on december 21 1917 french premier georges clemenceau urged the americans to rush their army called the american expeditionary force to france.
a terrible blow is imminent he told an american journalist about to leave paris.
tell your americans to come quickly clemenceau was referring to the likelihood of a massive german attack made more probable by the end of the fighting on the eastern front following the bolshevik revolution in russia in november 1917 the bolshevik revolution among the many casualties of the great war none was greater in scale than the destruction of the backward russian empire and its monarchy.
it was the first nation to crack under the stress and strain of the great war.
on march 15 1917 bumbling tsar nicholas ii having presided over a war that had ruined the russian economy and the nations transportation system abdicated his throne and turned the nation over to the provisional government of a new russian republic committed to continuing the war.
1006 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 the fall of the tsar gave americans the illusion that all the major allied powers were now fighting for the ideals of constitutional democracy an illusion that was shattered after the germans in april helped exiled radical vladimir i lyich lenin return to russia from switzerland.
the germans hoped that he would cause turmoil in his homeland.
he did much more than that.
as lenin observed power in w ar weary russia was lying in the streets waiting to be picked up.
to do so he mobilized the bolsheviks a group of ruthless communist revolutionaries who were convinced that they were in the vanguard of the irresistible force of history.
during the night of novemvladimir lenin communist ber 6 the bolsheviks seized power revolutionary who led the bolsheviks from the provisional government in overthrowing the russian monarchy established a dictatorship and called and ultimately establishing the soviet union.
for a quick end to the war.
lenin banned political parties and all organized religions atheism became the official belief eliminated civil liberties and the free press and killed or imprisoned opposition leaders including the tsar and his family.
in short he imposed his totalitarian blueprint of the perfect society on the russian people.
in 1918 lenin instructed bolshevik leaders to crack down on peasants who resisted the revolution comrades.
hang hang without fail so that people will see no fewer than one hundred kulaks rich men bloodsuckers.
yours lenin the bolshevik revolution triggered a prolonged civil war throughout russia.
president wilson sent 20 000 american soldiers to siberia to support the anti communist russian forces but they were unsuccessful.
fourteen points woodrow wilson was determined to ensure that the great war would be the last world war.
in september 1917 he asked c olonel edward house to organize a group of 150 experts in politics history geography and foreign policy called the inquiry to draft a peace plan since america according to wilson had no selfish goals it was simply one of the champions of the rights of mankind drawing upon their advice wilson developed what the american role in the war 1007 would come to be called the fourteen points which he presented to congress on january 8 1918 calling it the only possible program for peace.
the first five of the fourteen points endorsed the open conduct of diplomacy rather than secret treaties the recognition of neutral nations right to continue maritime commerce in time of war freedom of the seas the removal of international trade barriers the reduction of armaments and the transformation of colonial empires.
most of the other points dealt with territorial claims.
in redrawing the map of europe wilson demanded that the victors follow the difficult principle of self determination allowing overlapping nationalities and ethnic groups to develop their own independent nations.
point thirteen called for a new nation for poland long dominated by the russians on the east and the germans on the west.
point fourteen the capstone of wilsons postwar scheme called for the creation of a league of nations to preserve global peace.
when the fourteen points were made public african american leaders asked the president to add a fifteenth point an end to racial discrimination.
wilson did not respond.
overall the reaction to the speech was positive.
the headline for the new york times editorial proclaimed the presidents triumph as the war ground on the battling nations grew weary of the costs and shortages of food clothing and gasoline.
but no diplomatic solution was in sight.
in germany food and fuel shortages led to growing discontent.
workers went on strike and servicemen mutinied and deserted.
the monarchy said a german official is lurching toward the edge of the abyss russia surrenders conditions were even worse in russia.
after taking power lenin declared that the world would be freed from war only by a global revolution in which capitalism was replaced by communism.
to that end he wanted russia out of the great war as soon as possible.
on march 3 1918 lenin signed a humiliating peace agreement with germany the treaty of brest litovsk.
the treaty forced russia to transfer vast territories to germany and turkey and to recognize the independence of the ukraine region thereby depriving russia of much of its population coal and wheat production and heavy industry.
in addition russia had to pay 46 million to germany.
lenin was willing to accept such a harsh peace because he needed to concentrate on his internal enemies in the ongoing russian civil war.
with russia out of the war the germans could focus on the western front.
erich ludendorff the german army commander said that the ability to move hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the russian front to france would give him numerical superiority for the first time and enable him to deal an annihilating blow to the british before american aid can become effective 1008 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 meuse argonne offensive american soldiers of the 23rd infantry 2nd division fire machine guns at the germans from what was left of the argonne forest in france.
americans on the western front on march 21 the germans began the first of several offensives in france and belgium designed to win the war before the american soldiers arrived in force.
by may the german armies had advanced within fifty miles of paris and the british fifth army was destroyed.
the massive german offensive nearly defeated the allies.
in early april however the germans suddenly lost their momentum.
on april 5 the german commander called a halt because so many soldiers were exhausted and demoralized convinced as one officer admitted that their hope for victory had been dashed by their inability to sustain the supply lines needed for such a widespread advance.
in may french and british leaders pressed wilson to hurry american troops into the fighting.
by the end of the month some 650 000 american soldiers were in europe.

another 63 000 died of diseases largely casu the politics of peace 1011 armistice night in new york 1918 george luks known for his vivid paintings of urban life captured the unbridled outpouring of patriotism and joy that extended into the night of germanys surrender.

ger manys war dead totaled more than 2 million including civilians france lost nearly 1 4 million combatants great britain 703 000 and russia 1 7 million.
the war also ruined the economies of europe while decimating a whole generation of young men.
the new europe would be very different from the prewar version much poorer more violent more polarized more cynical less sure of itself and less capable of decisive action.
the united states for good or ill emerged from the war as the worlds dominant power.
the politics of peace on june 25 1918 colonel edward house wrote president wilson from france urging him to take charge of the peacemaking process.
it is one of the things with which your name should be linked during the ages house was right.
woodrow wilson and the peace agreement ending the great war would be forever linked but not in a positive light.
in the making of the peace agreement wilson showed himself both at his best and worst.
his fourteen points embodied his vision of a better world governed by fairer principles.
he felt guided by the hand of god his vision of a peacekeeping league of nations was in his view the key element to a secure and lasting peace and was the most essential part of the peace settlement if the diplomats gathering 1012 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 to draft the peace treaty failed to follow his ambitious plans to reshape the world in americas image he warned there will be another world war within a generation.
wilsons key errors whatever the merits of president wilsons peace plan his efforts to implement it proved clumsy.
he made several key decisions that would come back to haunt him.
first against the advice of his staff and of european leaders he decided to attend the peace conference in paris that opened on january 18 1919.
never before had an american president left the nation for such a prolonged period six months.
during his months abroad wilson lost touch with political developments at home.
wilsons second error of judgment involved politics.
in the congressional elections of november 1918 wilson defied his advisers and political tradition by urging voters to elect a democratic congress as a sign of approval of his policies in handling the w ar and the peace.
he begged the public not to repudiate his leadership.
prior to that time presidents had remained neutral during congressional elections and abstained from campaigning.
republicans who for the most part had backed wilsons war measures were not pleased.
theodore roosevelt whose son kermit a pilot had been killed in the war called wilsons s elf serving appeal for votes a cruel insult to every republican father or mother whose sons have entered the army or navy voters were not impressed either.
in the elections the democrats lost control of both houses of congress which was a bad omen for wilsons peacemaking efforts since any treaty to end the war would have to be approved by at least two thirds of the senate now controlled by republicans.
meanwhile wilson had dispatched colonel house and several aides to europe to begin convincing allied leaders to embrace the fourteen points.
the lopsided defeat of wilson and the democrats in the elections said house made his difficulties enormously greater gordon auchincloss houses s on in law who was serving as one of his lieutenants in europe displayed the brash confidence symptomatic of many american diplomats when he boasted from london that before we get through with these fellows over here we will teach them how to do things and to do them quickly it would not be so easy.
wilson further weakened support for his peacemaking efforts when in a deliberate slight he refused to appoint a prominent republican to the american delegation headed to the peace conference.
although house had urged him to appoint theodore roosevelt or senator henry cabot lodge the presidents archenemy and the leading republican in congress wilson refused.
in the end he appointed harry white an obscure republican.
former president william howard taft groused that wilsons real intention in going to paris was to hog the whole show he almost did.
the politics of peace 1013 wilsons participation in the paris peace conference would be the climactic event of his career an opportunity for him to convince europe to follow his impassioned idealism in creating a very different postwar world.
as wilson prepared to board the george washington with 113 staff members bound for europe over a ten day voyage ray stannard baker a muckraking journalist wrote that the president has yet to prove his greatness.
the fate of a drama lies in its last act and wilson is now coming to that wilsons last act would indeed be dramatic tragically so.
initially however his entrance on the european stage was triumphant in december 1918.
the cheering crowds in london paris and rome verged on hysteria.
millions of grateful europeans greeted him as an almost mystical hero even a savior.
an italian mayor described wilsons visit as the second coming of christ the ecstatic welcome led wilson to think he truly was being directed by god to save the world.
in a sign of his growing egotism he claimed that he was now at the apex of my glory in the hearts of these people he was determined to shape a peace treaty and postwar world based on principles of justice fairness and self determination.
fit for a messiah wilson rode down the champs lyses as the crowds showered him with flower petals and cheered vive wilson.
vive lamrique.
vive la libert 1014 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 from such a height there could only be a fall.
although popular with the european people wilson had to negotiate with t ough minded wily european statesmen who shared neither his lofty goals nor his ideals.
in fact they resented his efforts to forge a peace settlement modeled on american values.
that wilson had not bothered to consult them about his fourteen points peace proposal before announcing it to the world did not help.
in the end the european leaders would force him to abandon many of his ideals.
the paris peace conference the paris peace conference lasted from january to june 1919.
the participants had no time to waste.
the german a ustro hungarian and ottoman thrones and empires were in ruins.
across much of europe food was scarce and lawlessness rampant.
the threat of revolution hung over central europe as communists in the defeated nations threatened to take control.
the peace conference dealt with immensely complex and controversial issues including creating new nations and redrawing the maps of europe and the middle east that required both political statesmanship and technical expertise.
the british delegation alone included almost 400 members many of them specialists in political geography or economics.
the peacemakers met daily debating arguing and compromising.
the big four from the start the paris peace conference was controlled by the big four the prime ministers of britain france and italy and the president of the united states.
georges clemenceau the seventy seven year old french premier known as the tiger had little patience with president wilsons preaching.
in response to wilsons declaration that america is the only idealistic nation in the world clemenceau grumbled that talking with wilson was like talking to jesus christ.
god gave us the ten commandments and we broke them the french leader sneered.
wilson gave us the fourteen points we shall see the big four fought in private and in public.
the french and the british led by prime minister david lloyd george insisted that wilson agree to their harsh provisions to weaken germany while vittorio orlando prime minister of italy focused on gaining territories from defeated austria.
the league of nations although suffering from chronic health issues including hypertension and blinding headaches wilson lectured the other statesmen about the need to embrace his beloved league of nations which he insisted must be the keystone of any peace settlement.
he believed that a world peace organization would abolish war by settling international disputes and mobilizing united action against aggressors.
article x of the char the politics of peace 1015 ter which wilson called the heart of the league allowed member nations to impose military and economic sanctions or penalties against military aggressors.
the league wilson predicted would have such moral influence that it would make military action to preserve peace unnecessary.
these unrealistic expectations became for wilson a self defeating crusade.
on february 14 1919 wilson presented the final draft of the league covenant to the allies and left paris for a ten day visit home where he faced growing opposition among republicans.
the league of nations theodore roosevelt complained would revive german militarism and undermine american morale.
to substitute internationalism for nationalism roosevelt argued means to do away with patriotism henry cabot lodge chairman of the senate foreign relations committee also scorned wilson and his idealism.
lodge told roosevelt i never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred i feel toward wilson he dismissed the league of nations because he feared it would involve the u s military in foreign conflicts without senate approval.
the treaty of versailles when wilson returned to paris in the spring of 1919 he had lost his leverage with the british and french because it was increasingly uncertain that the u s senate would approve any treaty he endorsed.
although a skilled debater wilson was forced to concede many controversial issues to ensure that the europeans would approve his league of nations.
wilson yielded to french demands that germany transfer vast territories to france on its west and to poland on its east and north.
in other territorial matters wilson had to abandon his principle of national s elf determination whereby every ethnic group would be allowed to form its own nation.
as secretary of state robert lansing correctly predicted allowing each ethnic group to determine its own fate will raise hopes which can never be realized wilson himself later told the senate that he wished he had never said that all nations have a right to self determination in their efforts to allow for at least some degree of ethnic self determination in multiethnic regions the statesmen at versailles created the independent countries of austria hungary poland yugoslavia and czechoslovakia in central europe and four new nations along the baltic sea finland estonia lithuania and latvia.
the victorious allies however did not create independent nations out of the colonies of the defeated and now defunct european empires.
instead they assigned the former german colonies in africa and the turkish colonies in the middle east to france and great britain to govern while they prepared themselves for independence at some undesignated point in the future.
at the same time japan took control of the former german colonies in east asia.
1016 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 the issue of r eparations payments by the vanquished to the v ictors triggered especially bitter arguments.
the british and the french on whose soil much of the war was fought wanted germany to pay the entire financial cost of the war including their veterans pensions.
on this point wilson made perhaps his most fateful concessions.
although initially opposed to reparations he eventually agreed to a crucial clause in the peace treaty by which germany was forced to accept responsibility for the war and its entire expense.
the war guilt clause written by american john foster dulles a future secretary of state so offended germans that it became a major factor in the rise of the nazi party during the 1920s.
wilson himself privately admitted that if he were a german he would refuse to sign the flawed treaty.
colonel house the presidents closest confidante privately blamed wilson for many problems associated with the treaty.
he found the president so contradictory that it is hard to pass judgment on him he speaks constantly of teamwork but seldom practices it wilson was becoming stubborn and angry and he never was a good negotiator house worried that wilson was too unreasonable about the league of nations which does not make for solutions it was an eerily accurate prediction of what was in store.
on may 7 1919 the victorious powers presented the treaty to the german delegates who returned three weeks later with 443 pages of criticism.
among other things they noted that germany would lose 13 percent of its territory 10 percent of its population and all of its colonies in asia and africa.
a few minor changes were made but when the germans still balked the french threatened to launch a new military attack.
finally on june 28 the germans gave up and signed the treaty in the glittering hall of mirrors at versailles the magnificent palace built by king louis xiv in the late seventeenth century.
thereafter the agreement was called the treaty of versailles.
none of the peacemakers was fully satisfied.
as frances clemenceau observed it was not perfect but it was after all the result of human beings.
we did all we could to work fast and well a british official reversed wilsons claim that it had been a war to end all wars by saying it was a peace to end peace as turned out to be the case.
when adolf hitler a young german soldier who had been wounded in the war learned of the treatys provisions he vowed revenge.
it cannot be that two million germans have fallen in vain he screamed during a speech in munich in 1922.
we demand vengeance the treaty debate on july 8 1919 wilson arrived back in washington d c to begin working for approval of the treaty by the senate where the republicans outnumbered the democrats.
before leaving paris he had assured a french diplomat that he would not allow any changes to the treaty.

how did territorial concessions weaken germany.
wwn64 figure m22 3 first proof i shall consent to nothing he vowed.
the senate must take its medicine thus began one of the most brutally partisan and bitterly personal disputes in american history.
on july 10 wilson became the first president to enter the senate and deliver a treaty to be voted on.
he called upon senators to accept their great duty and ratify the treaty which had been guided by the hand of god wilson then grew needlessly confrontational.
he dismissed critics of the league of nations as blind and little provincial people the world he claimed was relying on the united states to sign the treaty dare we reject it and break the heart of the world yes answered senate republicans who had decided that wilsons commitment to the league was a reckless threat to americas independence.
henry cabot lodge denounced the treatys scheme of making mankind suddenly 1018 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 virtuous by a statute or a written constitution lodges strategy was to stall approval of the treaty in hopes that public opposition would grow.
he took six weeks simply reading aloud the lengthy text to his foreign relations committee.
he then organized a parade of expert witnesses most of them opposed to the treaty to appear at the hearings on ratification.
in the senate a group of irreconcilables fourteen republicans and two democrats refused to support american membership in the league.
they were mainly western and midwestern progressives isolationists who feared that such sweeping foreign commitments would threaten domestic reforms.
lodge himself belonged to a larger group called the reservationists who insisted upon limiting american participation in the league in exchange for approving the treaty.
the only way to get senate approval was for wilson to meet with lodge and others and agree to revisions the most important of which was the requirement that congress authorize any american participation in a l eague approved war.
colonel house urged the president to meet the senate in a conciliatory spirit wilson replied that he had long ago decided that you can never get anything in this life that is worthwhile without fighting for it house courageously disagreed reminding the president that american civilization was built on compromise it was the last time the two men would speak to or see each other.
as republican senator frank b kellogg of minnesota noted the proposed changes were crafted not by enemies of the treaty but by friends who wanted to save it.
republican senator james watson of indiana told wilson that he had no choice but to accept some revisions mr.
president you are licked.
there is only one way you can take the united states into the league of nations but the self righteous president was temperamentally incapable of compromising.
he refused to negotiate declaring that if the treaty is not ratified by the senate the war will have been fought in vain let the people decide in september 1919 after a summer of fruitless debate an exhausted wilson decided to bypass his senate opponents by speaking directly to voters.
on september 2 against his doctors orders and his wifes advice he left washington for a grueling railroad tour through the midwest to the west coast intending to visit t wenty nine cities and deliver forty speeches on behalf of the treaty.
no president had ever made such a strenuous effort to win public support.
in st louis wilson said that he had returned from paris bringing one of the greatest documents of human history which was now in danger of being rejected by the senate.
he pledged to fight for a cause.
greater than the senate.
it is greater than the government.
it is as great as the cause of mankind.
wilson traveled and spoke sometimes as many as four times a day despite suffering from pounding headaches.
it did not help his morale to learn that the politics of peace 1019 his secretary of state robert lansing had said that the league of nations was entirely useless by the time wilsons train reached spokane washington the president was visibly fatigued.
but he kept going through oregon and california.
some 200 000 people greeted him in los angeles.
in all he had covered 10 000 miles in twenty two days and given thirty two major speeches.
then disaster struck.
after delivering an emotional speech on september 25 1919 in pueblo colorado wilson collapsed from headaches so severe that he had to cancel the trip.
on the train heading back as he looked out the window with tears rolling down his cheeks he told his doctor that he had suffered the greatest disappointment of his life a stricken president back in washington d c a week later the president suffered a crushing stroke cerebral hemorrhage that left him paralyzed on his left side he could barely speak or see.
only his secretary his doctor and his wife edith knew his true condition.
for five months at the end of 1919 and in early 1920 wilson lay flat on his back while his doctor issued reassuring medical bulletins.
if a document needed wilsons signature his wife guided his trembling hand.
lansing urged the presidents aides to declare him disabled and appoint vice president thomas marshall in his place they angrily refused.
soon thereafter lansing was replaced.
the stroke made wilson even more arrogant and stubborn and paralyzed his administration as well.
he became emotionally unstable at times crying uncontrollably and displaying signs of paranoia.
for the remaining seventeen months of his term his protective wife along with aides and trusted cabinet members kept him isolated from all but the most essential business.
when a group of republican senators visited the white house one of them said well mr president we have all been praying for you wilson replied which way senator the treaty under attack such presidential humor was rare however.
wilsons hardened arteries seemed to have hardened his political judgment as well.
for his part lodge pushed through the senate fourteen changes the number was not coincidental in the draft of the treaty of versailles.
the exiled colonel house became so concerned that he wrote edith wilson a letter in which he said how vital it was for some form of the treaty to be approved the presidents place in history is in the balance he pleaded for wilson to negotiate a compromise.
the first lady refused to share his concerns with her husband.
in the end wilson rejected any proposed changes to the treaty.
as a result his supporters in the senate were thrown into an unlikely alliance with the irreconcilables who opposed the treaty under any circumstances.
the final senate vote in 1920 on lodges revised treaty was 39 in favor and 55 against.
on the question of approving the original treaty without changes 1020 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 the irreconcilables and the reservationists led by lodge combined to defeat ratification with 38 for and 53 against.
woodrow wilsons grand effort at global peacemaking had failed miserably.
although he did receive the nobel peace prize for his efforts.
when told of the final senate vote he said it would have been better if i had died last fall after refusing to ratify the treaty congress tried to declare an official end to american involvement in the war by a joint resolution on may 20 1920 which wilson vetoed in a fit of spite.
it was not until july 2 1921 four months after he had left office and almost eighteen months after the fighting had stopped that another joint resolution officially ended the state of war with germany and austria hungary.
separate peace treaties with germany austria and hungary were ratified on october 18 1921 but by then warren g harding was president.
the u s failure to ratify the versailles treaty or to exercise strong world leadership would prove to have long range consequences.
with great britain and france too exhausted and too timid to keep germany weak and isolated a dangerous power vacuum would emerge in europe one which adolf hitler and the nazis would fill.
stumbling from war to peace after the war most americans were far more concerned with domestic issues than with the treaty of versailles as celebration over the wars end soon gave way to widespread inflation unemployment labor unrest socialist and communist radicalism race riots terrorist bombings and government tyranny.
with millions of servicemen returning to civilian life w ar related industries shutting down and wartime price controls ending unemployment and prices for consumer goods spiked.
bedridden by his stroke the president became increasingly distant depressed and peevish.
wilson observed david lloyd george the british prime minister was as much a victim of the war as any soldier who died in the trenches his administration was in disarray he had never been so unpopular and the democratic party was floundering along with him.
the spanish flu beginning in 1918 many americans confronted an infectious enemy that produced far more casualties than the war.
it became known as the spanish flu although its origins continue to be debated and its contagion spread around the globe.
the disease appeared suddenly in the spring of 1918.
its initial outbreak lasted a year and killed as many as 100 million people worldwide twice as many as died stumbling from war to peace 1021 influenza epidemic office workers wearing gauze masks during the spanish flu epidemic of 1918 in the war.
in the united states alone it accounted for 675 000 deaths more than ten times the number of u s combat deaths in france.
a fifth of the nations population caught the flu and the public health system was strained to the breaking point.
hospitals ran out of beds and funeral homes ran out of coffins.
by the spring of 1919 the pandemic had run its course ending as s uddenly and as i nexplicably as it had begun.
although another outbreak occurred in the winter of 1920 people had grown more resistant to it.
no disease in human history had killed so many people and no war famine or natural catastrophe had killed so many in such a short time.
suffrage at last as the first outbreak of the spanish flu was ending american women finally gained a constitutional guarantee of their right to vote.
after six months of delay debate and failed votes congress passed the nineteenth amendment in the spring of 1919 and sent it to the states for ratification.
tennessees legislature was the last of thirty six state assemblies to approve the amendment and it did so in dramatic fashion.
the initial vote was 48 48.
then a twenty four year old republican legislator named harry t burn changed his vote to yes at the insistence of his mother.
the nineteenth amendment became official on august 18 1920 making the united states the t wenty second nation to allow womens suffrage.
it was a climactic achievement of the progressive era.
suddenly 9 5 million women were eligible to vote in national elections in the 1920 presidential election they would make up 40 percent of the electorate.
1022 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 their first votes women of new york citys east side vote for the first time in the presidential election of 1920 economic turbulence as consumer prices rose discontented workers released from wartime controls on wages grew more willing to go out on strike.
in 1919 more than 4 million hourly wage workers 20 percent of the u s workforce participated in 3 600 strikes.
most of them wanted nothing more than higher wages and shorter workweeks but their critics linked them with the worldwide communist movement.
charges of a communist conspiracy were greatly exaggerated however.
in 1919 fewer than 70 000 americans nationwide belonged to the communist party.
the most controversial labor dispute was in boston where most of the police went on strike on september 9 1919.
massachusetts governor calvin coolidge mobilized the national guard to maintain order.
after four days the striking policemen offered to return but instead coolidge ordered that they all be fired.
when labor leaders appealed for their reinstatement coolidge responded in words that made him an instant national hero there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere any time race riots the summer of 1919 also brought a wave of deadly race riots.
as more and more african americans including many of the 367 000 who were war veterans moved out of the south to different parts of the c ountry stumbling from war to peace 1023 safe briefly escorted by a police officer an african american family moves its belongings from their home likely destroyed by white rioters and into a protected area of chicago.
eveloped successful careers and asserted their civil rights resentful whites d reacted with an almost hysterical racism.
in 1919 alone s eventy six african americans including nine military veterans were killed by southern whites.
among the victims was sergeant major joe green in birmingham alabama because he had the insolence to ask for his change on a streetcar and private william little in blakely georgia because he had walked around town wearing his army uniform.
what african american leader james weldon johnson called the red summer red signifying blood began in july when a mob of whites invaded the black neighborhood in longview texas angry over rumors of interracial dating.
they burned shops and houses and ran several african americans out of town.
a week later in washington d c exaggerated and false reports of black assaults on white women stirred up white mobs and gangs of white and black rioters waged a race war in the streets until soldiers and driving rains ended the fighting.
the worst was yet to come.
in late july 38 people were killed and 537 injured in five days of race rioting in chicago where some 50 000 blacks mostly from the rural south had moved during the war leading to tensions with local whites 1024 chapter 22 america and the great war 1914 1920 over jobs and housing.
white unionized workers especially resented blacks who were hired as strikebreakers.
altogether twenty five race riots erupted in 1919 and eighty african americans were lynched including eleven war veterans.
the race riots of 1919 were a turning point for many african americans.
we made the supreme sacrifice a black veteran told poet journalist carl sandburg.
now we want to see our country live up to the constitution and the declaration of independence another ex soldier noted how much the war experience had changed the outlook of blacks we were determined not to take it anymore the red scare with so many people convinced that the strikes and riots were inspired by communists and anarchists two very different groups who shared a hatred for capitalism a new york journalist reported that americans were shivering in their boots over bolshevism and they are far more scared of lenin than they ever were of the german kaiser.
we seem to be the most frightened victors the world ever saw fears of revolution were fueled by the violent actions of a few militants.
in early 1919 the secret service discovered a plot by spanish anarchists to kill president wilson and other government officials.
in april 1919 postal workers intercepted nearly forty homemade mail bombs addressed to government officials.
one mail bomb however blew off the hands of a georgia senators maid.
in june another bomb damaged u s attorney general a mitchell palmers house.
palmer who had ambitions to succeed wilson as president concluded that a red menace a communist blaze of revolution was sweeping over every american institution of law and order that august palmer appointed a twenty four year old attorney named j edgar hoover to lead a new government division created to collect information on radicals.
hoover and others in the justice department worked with a network of 250 000 informers in 600 cities all of them members of the american protective league which had been founded during the war to root out traitors and labor radicals.
on november 7 1919 federal agents rounded up 450 alien radicals most of whom were law abiding russian immigrants.
all were deported to russia without a court hearing.
on january 2 1920 police in dozens of cities arrested 5 000 more suspects.
what came to be called the first red scare another would occur in the 1950s represented one of the largest violations of civil liberties in american history.
in 1919 novelist katharine fullerton gerould announced in harpers magazine that as a result of the government crackdown america is no longer a free country in the old sense panic about possible foreign terrorists erupted across the nation as vigilantes took matters into their own hands.
at a patriotic stumbling from war to peace 1025 pageant in washington d c a sailor shot a spectator who refused to rise for the star spangled banner the crowd cheered.
in hammond indiana a jury took only two minutes to acquit a man who had murdered an immigrant for yelling to hell with the u s in waterbury connecticut a salesman was sentenced to six months in jail for saying that vladimir lenin was one of the brainiest of the worlds leaders.
by the summer of 1920 the red scare had begun to subside.
although attorney general palmer kept predicting more foreign inspired terrorism it never came.
but the red scare left a lasting mark by strengthening the c onservative crusade for 100 percent americanism and new restrictions on immigration.
j edgar hoover fresh out of law school hoover joined the justice department and rose the ranks to become the first director of the fbi.
effects of the great war the extraordinary turbulence in 1919 and 1920 was an unmistakable indication of how the great war had changed the shape of modern history it was a turning point after which little was the same.
it had destroyed old europe not only many of its cities people economies and four grand empires but also its self image as the center of civilized western culture.
winston churchill the future british prime minister called postwar europe a crippled broken world peace did not bring stability.
most germans and austrians believed they were the victims of a harsh peace and many wanted revenge.
at the same time the war had hastened the already simmering bolshevik revolution that caused russia to exit the war abandon its western european allies and in 1922 reemerge as the union of soviet socialist republics ussr.
thereafter soviet communism would be one of the most powerful forces shaping the twentieth century.
postwar america was a much different story.
for the first time the united states had decisively intervened in a major european war.
the american economy had emerged from the war largely unscathed and bankers and business executives were eager to fill the vacuum created by the destruction of the major european economies.
the united states was now the worlds dominant power.
what came to be called the american century was at hand.
chapter review summary an uneasy neutrality the wilson administration declared the nation neutral but allowed businesses to extend loans to the warring nations principally the allies britain france and russia to purchase food and military supplies.
americans were outraged by the germans use of submarine u boat warfare especially after the sinking of the lusitania.
in 1917 submarine attacks and the publication of the zimmermann telegram which revealed that germany had tried to encourage mexico to wage war against the united states led america to enter the great war.
mobilizing a nation the wilson administration drafted young men into the army and created new agencies such as the war industries board and the food administration to coordinate industrial production and agricultural consumption.
as white workers left their factory jobs to join the army hundreds of thousands of african americans migrated from the rural south to the urban north as part of the great migration.
many southern whites and mexican americans also migrated to industrial centers.
one million women participated in war work but were encouraged to leave these jobs as soon as the war ended.
the federal government severely curtailed civil liberties and the espionage and sedition acts of 1917 and 1918 criminalized virtually any public opposition to the war.
the american role in fighting the war communists seized power in november 1917 in russia and negotiated a separate peace treaty with germany thus freeing the germans to focus on the western front.
by 1918 however the arrival of millions of american troops turned the tide of the war.
german leaders sued for peace and an armistice was signed on november 11 1918.
woodrow wilson insisted that the united states wanted a new democratic europe.
his fourteen points 1918 speech outlined his ideas for a league of nations to promote peaceful resolutions to future conflicts.
the fight for the peace at the paris peace conference president wilson was only partially successful.
the treaty of versailles 1919 did create a league of nations but included a war guilt clause that forced germany to pay reparations for war damages to france and britain.
in the end wilsons illness following a stroke his refusal to compromise on the terms of the treaty and his alienation of republican senators resulted in the senate voting against ratification.
lurching from war to peace the united states struggled to come to terms with its new status as the leading world power and with changes at home.
as wartime industries shifted to peacetime production wage and price controls ended.
as former soldiers reentered the workforce unemployment rose and consumer prices increased provoking labor unrest in cities across the nation.
many americans believed these problems were part of a bolshevik plot.
several incidents of domestic terrorism provoked what would be known as the first red scare 1919 1920 during which the justice department illegally arrested and deported many suspected radicals most of whom were immigrants.
at the same time race riots broke out as resentful white mobs tried to stop african americans from exercising their civil rights.
the summer of 1919 also brought the ratification of the nineteenth amendment 1919 to the constitution which gave women the right to vote.

a clash of cultures 1920 1929 nightclub 1933 with all its striking sights and sounds the roar of the twenties subsided for some at the heart of it all.
in this painting by american artist guy pne du bois flappers and their dates crowd into a fashionable nightclub yet their loneliness amid the excitement is deafening.
t he decade between the end of the great war and the onset of the great depression at the end of 1929 was perhaps the most dynamic in american history a period of rapid urbanization technological innovation widespread prosperity social rebelliousness cultural upheaval and political conservatism.
women were at last allowed to vote in all states although most african american women and men in the south were prevented from doing so and to experience many freedoms previously limited to men.
at the same time the eighteenth amendment outlawed alcoholic beverages in 1920 prohibition setting off an epidemic of lawbreaking by citizens police and public officials.
cultural conflicts resulted largely from explosive tensions between rural and urban ways of life.
for the first time in the nations history more people lived in cities than in rural areas.
while the urban middle class prospered farmers suffered as the wartime boom in exports of grains and livestock to europe ground to a halt.
four million people moved from farms to cities during the twenties in part because of the better quality of life and in part because of the prolonged agricultural recession.
amid this massive rural urban population shift bitter fights erupted between traditionalists and modernists as old and new values fought a cultural civil war that continues today.
the postwar wave of strikes bombings anti communist hysteria and race riots created a widespread sense of alarm that led many to cling to traditional religious beliefs and moral values and native ways of life.
america during the twenties said one social commentator was the most volcanic of any area on earth it was a period of deep domestic strife as new and old ways of life fought for influence.

how did the modernist movements influence american culture in the early twentieth century.
938 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 is at least some measure of economic equality the growth of new industries like railroading steel coal and oil had attracted waves of poor farm folk and foreign immigrants to cities whose basic social services food water housing education sanitation transportation and medical care could not keep pace with the rate of urban growth.
between 1890 and 1920 armies of progressive reformers attacked the problems created by unregulated industrialization and unplanned urbanization.
most of all they insisted that something must be done to control the large powerful corporations that dominated americas economy and corrupted its political life.
by the beginning of the twentieth century progressivism had become the most dynamic social and political force in the nation.
in 1910 woodrow wilson then president of princeton university told a gathering of clergymen that progressivism had generated an extraordinary awakening in civic consciousness the progressive impulse progressives were liberals not revolutionaries.
they wanted to reform and regulate capitalist society not destroy it.
most were christian moralists who felt that politics had become a contest between good and evil honesty and corruption.
what they all shared was the assumption that g overnments local state and national must take a more active role in addressing the problems created by rapid urban and industrial growth.
progressivism was more a widespread impulse supported by elements of both major political parties than it was a single movement with a common agenda.
republican theodore roosevelt called it the forward movement because it emphasized modernizing old fashioned ways of doing things.
he and other reformers stood for the cause of progress for the cause of the uplift of humanity and the betterment of mankind to make governments more responsive and efficient and businesses more honest and safe progressives drew upon the new social sciences sociology political science psychology public health and economics being developed at research universities.
the progressive approach was to enable experts to investigate educate and legislate florence kelley a tireless activist voiced the eras widespread belief that once people knew the truth about social ills they would act upon it unlike populism whose grassroots appeal was largely confined to poor rural regions in the south and midwest progressivism was a national movement centered in large cities but also popular in rural areas among the varied sources of progressivism 939 what came to be called populist progressives.
progressive activists came in all stripes men and women democrats republicans populists and socialists labor unionists and business executives teachers engineers editors and professors social workers doctors ministers and journalists farmers and homemakers whites and blacks clergymen atheists and agnostics.
whatever their motives and methods their combined efforts led to significant improvements.
yet progressivism also displayed inconsistencies and hypocrisies.
progressives often armed themselves with christian moralism but their do good perspective was often limited by the racial and ethnic prejudices of the day as well as by social and intellectual snobbery.
the goals of u pper class white progressives rarely included racial equality.
many otherwise progressive people including theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson believed in the supremacy of the anglo saxon race and their own superiority to the working poor.
they assumed that the workings of modern society were too complicated for the uninformed masses to understand much less improve without direction by those who knew better.
the varied sources of progressivism during the last quarter of the nineteenth century political progressives at the local and state levels began to attack corrupt political bosses and irresponsible corporate barons.
they sought more honest and more efficient government more effective regulation of big businesses the trusts and better lives for the working poor.
only by expanding the scope of local state and federal governments they believed could these goals be attained.
economic depression and discontent more than any other factor the devastating depression of the 1890s ignited the progressive spirit of reform.
the nations worst economic calamity to that point brought massive layoffs nearly a quarter of the adults in the workforce lost their jobs.
although the united states boasted the highest per capita income in the world it also had some of the highest concentrations of poverty.
in 1900 the u s population numbered 82 million at the turn of the new century an estimated 10 million americans were living in poverty with annual incomes barely adequate to provide the minimum necessities of life.
the devastating effects of the depression prompted many u pper middle class urban people lawyers doctors executives social workers teachers professors journalists and college educated w omen to organize efforts to 940 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 reform society both to help those in need and to keep them from becoming revolutionaries.
populism populism with its roots in the rural south and west was another thread in the fabric of progressivism.
the populist party platforms of 1892 and 1896 included reforms intended to give more power to the people such as the direct election of u s senators by voters rather than by state legislatures.
although william jennings bryans loss in the 1896 presidential campaign ended the populist party as a serious political force many reforms pushed by the populists were implemented by progressives.
honest government the mugwumps gentlemen reformers who had fought the patronage system and insisted that government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit supplied progressivism with another key goal the honest government ideal.
over the years the good government movement expanded beyond ending political corruption to addressing persistent urban issues such as crime access to electricity clean water and municipal sewers mass transit and garbage collection.
socialism another significant progressive force was the growing influence of socialist ideas.
the socialist party of america supported mostly by militant farmers and immigrant germans and jews served as the radical wing of progressivism.
unlike european socialists most american socialists did not call for the government to take ownership of large corporations.
they focused instead on improving working conditions and closing the widening income gap between rich and poor through progressive taxation.
most progressives were capitalist reformers not socialist radicals.
they rejected the extremes of both socialism and laissez faire individualism preferring a new regulated capitalism softened by humanitarianism.
muckraking journalism progressivism depended upon newspapers and magazines to inform the public about political corruption and social problems.
the so called muckrakers were americas first investigative journalists.
their aggressive reporting played a crucial role in educating the upper and middle classes about political and corporate wrongdoing and revealing how the other half lives the title of danish immigrant jacob riiss pioneering 1890 work of photojournalism about life in the sordid slums of new york city where some 1 2 million people mostly immigrants lived in poverty amid killing diseases.
the varied sources of progressivism 941 the muckrakers got their nickname from theodore roosevelt who said that crusading journalists were often indispensable to.
society but only if they know when to stop raking the muck by uncovering political corruption and writing about social ills in newspapers and popular monthly magazines such as mcclures munseys and cosmopolitan the muckrakers changed the face of journalism and gave it a new political role.
roosevelt both as governor of new york and as president frequently used muckrakers to drum up support for his policies he corresponded with them invited them to the white house and used their popularity to help shape public opinion.
the golden age of muckraking is sometimes dated from 1902 when samuel s mcclure the owner of mcclures recruited idealistic journalists to root out the corruption in politics and corporations.
mcclure was determined to make his magazine a power for good the vitality of democracy he insisted depended upon educating the public about complex questions mcclures and other muckraking magazines investigated corporate monopolies and crooked political machines while revealing the miserable conditions in which poor americans lived and worked.
ida tarbell one of the most dedicated muckrakers spent years doggedly investigating the illegal means by which john d rockefeller had built his gigantic standard oil trust.
at the end of her series of nineteen mcclures articles on the topic she asked readers and what are we going to do about it she stressed that it was the people of the united states and nobody else who must cure whatever is wrong in the industrial situation without the muckrakers progressivism would never have achieved widespread popular support.
during the early twentieth century investigative journalism became such a power cover of mcclures magazine 1902 this issue features ida tarbells ful force for change that one editor said muckraking series investigating the that americans now had government standard oil company.
by magazine 942 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 religious activism social justice progressives believed that society had an ethical obligation to help its poorest and most vulnerable members.
others were inspired by the social gospel a newer specifically protestant belief that christians should help the poor to bring about the kingdom of god on earth.
in many respects the progressive movement as a whole represented a new energetic form of public outreach that incorporated religious and nonreligious groups and focused not so much on saving souls as on social action.
more and more christians adopted the mission of social reform.
we believe a social gospel organization said that the age of sheer individualism is past and the age of social responsibility has arrived the social gospel during the last quarter of the nineteenth century a growing number of churches and synagogues began emphasizing community service and the care of the unfortunate.
new organizations made key contributions to the movement.
the young mens christian association ymca and a similar group for women the ywca both entered the united states from england in the 1850s and grew rapidly after 1870.
the salvation army founded in london in 1878 came to the united states a year later.
the ymca and ywca combined nondenominational religious evangelism with social services and fitness training in community centers segregated by race and gender across the country.
intended to provide low cost housing and healthful exercise in a safe christian environment for young men and women from rural areas or foreign countries the ymca ywca centers often included libraries classrooms and kitchens.
hebrew c ounterparts ymhas and ywhas provided many of the same facilities in cities with large jewish populations.
salvation army centers offered soup kitchens to feed the poor and day nurseries for the children of working mothers.
the major forces behind the social gospel movement were protestants and catholics who feared that christianity had become too closely associated with the upper and middle classes and was losing its appeal to the working poor.
in 1875 washington gladden a prominent pastor in springfield massachusetts invited striking shoe factory workers to his church but they refused because the factory owners and managers were members of the congregation.
gladden heartbroken that christianity was dividing along class lines responded by writing working people and their employers 1876 which argued that true christianity was based on the principle that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself gladden rejected the view of social darwinists that the poor deserved the varied sources of progressivism 943 their fate and should not be helped.
he became the first prominent religious leader to support the rights of workers to form unions.
he also spoke out against racial segregation and efforts to discriminate against immigrants.
gladdens efforts helped launch a new era in religious life in which churches engaged with the urgent problems created by a rapidly urbanizing and industrializing society.
he and other social gospelers reached out to the working poor who labored long hours for low wages lived in miserable slum housing had no insurance for o n the job accidents and lacked the legal right to form unions.
walter rauschenbusch a german american baptist minister serving immigrant tenement dwellers in the hells kitchen neighborhood of new york city became the greatest champion of the social gospel.
in 1907 he published a pathbreaking book christianity and the social crisis in which he argued emphatically that whoever uncouples the religious and social life has not understood jesus the christian emphasis on personal salvation he added must be linked with an equally passionate commitment to social justice.
churches must embrace the social aims of jesus he stressed for christianity was intended to be a revolutionary faith.
in rauschenbuschs view religious life needed the social gospel to revitalize it and make it socially relevant we shall never have a perfect social life yet we must seek it with faith like the muckrakers rauschenbusch sought to expose the realities of poverty in america and convince statesmen to deal with the crisis.
his message resonated with theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and many other progressives in both political parties.
years later rev.
martin luther king jr spoke for three generations of radicals and reformers when he said that christianity and the social crisis left an indelible imprint on my thinking rauschenbusch gladden and other social gospelers sought to expand the kingdom of god by following christs example by serving the poor and powerless.
rugged individualism may have been the path to wealth they argued but christian socialism offered hope for unity among all classes.
every religious and political question said george herron a religion professor at grinnell college is fundamentally economic and the solution to economic tensions was social solidarity.
as progressive economist richard ely put it america could only truly thrive when it recognized that our true welfare is not an individual matter purely but likewise a social affair settlement houses among the most visible soldiers in the social gospel movement were those who volunteered in innovative community 944 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 c enters called settlement houses.
at the hull house settlement on halsted street in a working class chicago neighborhood two women from privileged backgrounds jane addams and ellen gates starr addressed the everyday needs of the working poor especially newly arrived european immigrants.
addams and starr were driven by an impulse to share the lives of the poor and to make social service express the spirit of christ their staff of two dozen women served thousands of people each week.
besides a nursery for the infant children of working mothers hull house also sponsored health clinics lectures music lesjane addams by the end of the century sons and art studios mens clubs an thanks to the efforts of jane addams employment bureau job training and others religious groups were a gymnasium a coffeehouse and a joining the settlement house movement.
savings bank.
by the early twentieth century there were hundreds of settlement houses in cities across the united states most of them in the northeast and midwest.
to addams the social gospel driving progressive reformers reflected their yearning sense of justice and compassion she and other settlement house leaders soon realized however that their work in the rapidly spreading immigrant slums was like bailing out the ocean with a teaspoon.
they thus added political reform to their already lengthy agenda and began lobbying for new laws and regulations to improve the living conditions in poor neighborhoods.
as her influence in chicago grew addams was appointed to prominent governmental and community boards where she focused on improving public health and food safety.
she pushed for better street lighting and police protection in poor neighborhoods and sought to reduce the misuse of narcotics.
an ardent pacifist and outspoken advocate for suffrage voting rights for women addams would become the first american woman to win the nobel peace prize.
the varied sources of progressivism 945 the woman suffrage movement from 1880 to 1910 the number of employed women tripled from 2 6 million to 7 8 million.
as women especially college educated women became more involved in the public world of work and wages the womens rights movement grew.
immediately after the civil war women in the movement had hoped that the fifteenth amendment which guaranteed voting rights for african american men would aid their own efforts to gain the vote.
the majority of men however still insisted that women stay out of politics because it would corrupt their moral purity.
in 1869 the wyoming territory became the first place in the united states to extend equal voting rights to women.
in that year the womens rights movement split over the issue of whether to c oncentrate solely on gaining the vote or to adopt a broader agenda.
susan b anthony and elizabeth cady east meets west san francisco suffragists marched across the country in 1915 to deliver a petition calling for a constitutional amendment with more than 500 000 signatures to congress in washington d c.
along the way they were warmly received by other suffragists like those of new jersey pictured here.
946 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 stanton founded the national woman suffrage association nwsa to promote a woman suffrage amendment to the constitution but they considered it only one among many feminist causes to be championed.
for example they also campaigned for new laws requiring higher pay for women workers and making it easier for abused wives to get divorces.
other suffrage activists insisted that pursuing multiple issues hurt their cause.
in 1869 they formed the american woman suffrage association awsa which focused single mindedly on voting rights.
in 1890 the rival groups united as the national american woman suffrage association nawsa.
that same year wyoming was admitted as a state the first with full voting rights for women.
it was in the territories and states west of the mississippi river that the suffrage movement had its earliest successes.
in those areas women were more engaged in grassroots political activities than they were in the east.
between 1890 and 1896 the suffrage cause won three more victories in western states utah colorado and idaho.
the movement then stalled for a time until proposals for voting rights at the state level easily won a washington state referendum in 1910 and carried california by a close majority in 1911.
the following year three more western states arizona kansas and oregon joined in to make a total of nine western states with full suffrage.
in 1913 illinois granted women voting rights in presidential and municipal elections.
yet not until new york acted in 1917 did a state east of the mississippi river allow women to vote in all elections.
many advocates for womens suffrage argued that the right to vote and hold office was a matter of simple justice women were just as capable as men of exercising the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
others insisted that women were morally superior to men and therefore would improve the quality of the political process.
women voters and politicians advocates argued would promote the welfare of society as a whole creating a powerful engine for progressive social change.
one activist explicitly linked womens suffrage with the social gospel declaring that women followed the teachings of christ more faithfully than men.
if they were elected to public office they would far more effectively guard the morals of society and the sanitary conditions of cities yet the womens suffrage movement was not free from social ethnic and racial prejudices.
carrie chapman catt who became president of the national american woman suffrage association in 1900 warned of the danger that lies in the votes possessed by the males in the slums of the cities and the ignorant foreign immigrant vote she added that the nation with ill advised haste had given the foreigner the negro and the indian the vote but still progressives aims and achievements 947 womens suffrage 1869 1914 nh vt wa mt nd mn or id ca co pa ia ne ut il ks ny mi wi sd wy nv oh in wv va ky mo ok nm ar ms tx adopted full womens suffrage from 1869 1896 adopted full womens suffrage from 1910 1914 had not adopted full womens suffrage by 1914 al ma ri ct nj de md nc tn az me sc ga la fl 500 miles 500 kilometers which states first gave women the right to vote.

how was suffrage part of a larger womens reform movement.
withheld it from white women.
throughout the country most suffrage organizations excluded african american women.
progressives aims and achievements the impulses and groups comprising the progressive movement grew out of what theodore roosevelt called the fierce discontent with evil that many americans felt at the turn of the nineteenth century.
progressives focused on many different goals and used many different methods.
they assaulted a wide array of what they saw as social and political evils from corrupt politicians to too powerful corporations from economic distress on small farms and in big cities to the general feeling that the people had lost control of the nation to the special interests businesses and their leaders who were solely interested in money getting at the expense of public welfare.
948 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 political reforms progressivism set in motion the two most important political developments of the twentieth century the rise of direct democracy and the expansion of federal power.
in his monthly articles in mcclures magazine lincoln steffens a leading muckraker regularly asked will the people rule.
is democracy possible steffens and other progressives often answered that the way to improve americas democracy was to make it even more democratic.
to empower citizens to clean up the corrupt political system progressives pushed to make the political process more open and transparent.
one process was the direct primary which would allow all members of a political party to vote on the partys nominees rather than the traditional practice in which an inner circle of party leaders chose the candidates.
in 1896 south carolina became the first state to adopt a statewide primary and within twenty years nearly every state had done so.
progressives also developed other ways to increase public participation in the political process direct democracy so as to curb the power of corporate giants over state legislatures.
in 1898 south dakota became the first state to adopt the initiative and referendum procedures that allowed voters to create laws directly rather than having to wait for legislative action.
citizens could sign petitions to have a proposal put on the ballot the initiative and then vote it up or down the referendum.
still another progressive innovation was the recall whereby corrupt or incompetent elected officials could be removed by a public petition and vote.
by 1920 nearly twenty states had adopted the initiative and referendum and nearly a dozen had sanctioned the recall procedure.
progressives also fought to change the way that u s senators were elected.
under the constitution state legislatures elected senators a process frequently corrupted by lobbyists and vote buying.
in 1900 for example senate investigators revealed that a montana senator had given more than 100 000 in secret bribes to members of the legislature that chose him.
in 1913 thanks to the efforts of progressives the seventeenth amendment providing for the direct election of senators was ratified by enough states to become law.
the efficiency movement a second major theme of progressivism was the gospel of efficiency louis d brandeis a kentucky attorney who became woodrow wilsons progressive adviser and later a justice of the supreme court believed that efficiency is the hope of democracy progressives aims and achievements 949 the champion of progressive efficiency was frederick winslow taylor a philadelphia born industrial engineer who during the 1890s became a celebrated business consultant helping mills and factories implement scientific management the nations first efficiency expert taylor showed employers how to cut waste and improve productivity.
by breaking down work activities filling a wheelbarrow driving a nail shoveling coal into a sequence of mechanical steps and using stopwatches to measure the time it took each worker to perform each step taylor established detailed performance standards and cash rewards for each job classification specifying how fast people should work and when they should rest.
his celebrated book the principles of scientific management 1911 influenced business organizations for decades.
the goal of what came to be called taylorism was to usher in a mental revolution in business management that would improve productivity and profits raise pay for the most efficient workers and reduce the likelihood of worker strikes.
as taylor wrote men will not do an extraordinary days work for an ordinary days pay many workers however resented taylors innovations seeing them as just a tool to make people work faster.
yet his approach to industrial management became one of the most important contributions to capitalist economies in the twentieth century and brought concrete improvements in productivity.
political progressives applied taylorism to the operations of government by calling for the reorganization of state and federal agencies to eliminate duplication the establishment of clear lines of authority and the replacement of political appointees with trained specialists.
by the early twentieth century many complex functions of government had come to require specialists with technical expertise.
as woodrow wilson wrote progressive ideals could be achieved only if government at all levels was informed and administered by experts many cities set up efficiency bureaus to identify government waste and apply more cost effective best practices municipal reform two taylorist ideas for reform of city and county governments emerged in the first decade of the new century.
one the commission system was first adopted in 1901 by the city of galveston texas after the local government collapsed following a devastating hurricane and tidal wave that killed more than 8 000 the greatest natural disaster in american history.
the commission system placed ultimate authority in a board composed of commissioners who combined both legislative and executive powers in heading up city departments sanitation police utilities and so on.
950 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 houston texas created a commission system in 1906.
dallas and des moines iowa followed in 1907 as did memphis in 1909.
even more popular than the commission system was the city manager plan under which an appointed professional administrator ran a city or county government in accordance with policies set by the elected council and mayor.
staunton virginia adopted the first c ity manager plan in 1908.
five years later the inadequate response of municipal officials to a flood led dayton ohio to become the first large city to adopt the plan.
yet the efforts to make local governments more business like and professional had a downside.
shifting control from elected officials representing individual neighborhoods to at large commissioners and nonpartisan specialists separated local government from party politics which for many working class voters had been the main way they could have a voice in how they were governed locally.
in addition running a city like a business led commissioners and managers to focus on reducing expenses rather than expanding services even when such expansion was clearly needed.
the wisconsin idea at the state level the ideal of efficient government run by nonpartisan experts was pursued most notably by progressive republican governor robert m la follette of wisconsin.
fighting bob la follette declared war on vast corporate combinations and political corruption by creating a nonpartisan state government that would become a laboratory for democracy he established a legislative reference bureau which provided elected officials with nonpartisan research advice and help in drafting legislation.
la follette used the bureaus reports to enact such reforms as the direct primary stronger railroad regulation the conservation of natural resources and workmens compensation programs to support people injured on the job.
the wisconsin idea was widely publicized and copied by other progressive governors.
la follette explained that the wisconsin idea was a commitment to use government power to make a happier and better state to live in that its institutions are more democratic that the opportunities of all its people are more equal that social justice more nearly prevails regulation of business of all the problems facing american society at the turn of the century one towered above all the regulation of giant corporations.
the threat of corporate monopolies increased during the depression of the 1890s as struggling companies were gobbled up by larger ones.
between 1895 and 1904 some 157 new holding companies gained control of 1 800 different businesses.
almost fifty of these giant holding companies controlled more than 70 percent of the market in their respective industries.
in progressives aims and achievements 951 friends of the working class left to right american labor leader andrew furuseth governor robert m la follette and muckraker lincoln steffens ca.
1896 fewer than a dozen companies other than railroads were worth 10 million or more.
by 1903 that number had soared to 300.
concerns over the concentration of economic power in trusts and other forms of monopolies had led congress to pass the sherman a nti trust act in 1890 but it proved ineffective.
in addition government agencies responsible for regulating businesses often came under the influence of those they were supposed to regulate.
retired railroad executives for instance were appointed to the interstate commerce commission icc which had been created to regulate railroads.
the issue of regulating the regulators has never been fully resolved.
social justice another important focus of the progressive movement was greater social justice for the working poor the jobless and the homeless.
in addition to their work in settlement houses and other areas many progressives formed advocacy organizations such as the national consumers league which educated consumers about harsh working conditions in factories and mills and the widespread use of child workers.
other organizations such as the general federation of womens clubs insisted that civic life needed the humanizing effect of female leadership.
952 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 womens clubs across the country sought to clean up filthy slums by educating residents about personal and household hygiene municipal housekeeping urging construction of sewer systems and launching public awareness campaigns about the connection between unsanitary conditions and disease.
womens clubs also campaigned for child care centers kindergartens government inspection of food processing plants stricter housing codes laws protecting women in the workplace and more social services for the poor sick disabled and abused.
still others addressed prostitution and alcohol abuse.
the campaign against drinking middle class women reform ers most of them motivated by strong religious convictions were the driving force behind the social justice movement.
among the most powerful campaigns was that of the womens christian temperance union wctu.
founded in 1874 in cleveland ohio by 1900 the wctu had grown into the largest womens group in the nation boasting 300 000 members.
while some of them were motivated by protestant beliefs that consuming any alcohol was a sin most saw excessive drinking especially in saloons as a threat to social progress and family stability.
by attacking drunkenness and closing saloons reformers hoped to 1 improve family life by preventing domestic violence by husbands and fathers 2 reduce crime in the streets and 3 remove one of the worst tools of corruption free beer on election day in an effort to buy votes among the working class.
as a boston sociologist concluded the saloon had become the enemy of society because of the evil results produced upon the individual initially wctu members met in churches to pray and then marched to nearby saloons to try to convince their owners to close.
as its name suggests the womens christian temperance union advocated temperance the reduction of alcohol consumption.

any alcoholic beverages.
progressives aims and achievements 953 under the leadership of frances willard president of the wctu between 1879 and 1898 the organization moved beyond moral persuasion of saloonkeepers and drinkers and began promoting legislation to ban alcohol prohibition.
willard also pushed the wctu to lobby for other progressive reforms important to women including an eight hour workday the regulation of child labor g overnment funded kindergartens the right to vote and federal inspections of the food industry.
more than anything else however the wctu continued to campaign against drinking.
the battle against alcoholic beverages took on new strength in 1893 with the formation of the a nti saloon league an organization based in local churches that pioneered the strategy of the s ingle issue political pressure group.
describing itself as the protestant church in action against the saloon the bipartisan league like the wctu initially focused on closing down saloons rather than abolishing alcohol.
eventually however it decided to force the prohibition issue into the forefront of state and local elections.
at its jubilee convention in 1913 the league endorsed an amendment to the constitution prohibiting the manufacture sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which congress approved in 1917 labor legislation in 1890 almost half of the nations wage orkers toiled up to twelve hours a d w ay sometimes seven days a w eek in unsafe unsanitary and unregulated conditions for extremely low wages.
legislation to ensure better working conditions and limit child labor was perhaps the most significant reform to emerge from the drive for progressive social justice.
at the end of the nineteenth century fewer than half of working families lived solely on the husbands earnings.
many married women engaged in homework making clothes selling flower arrangements preparing food for others and taking in boarders.
parents in poor families also frequently took their children out of school and put them to work in factories shops mines mills and canneries and on farms.
in 1900 some 1 75 million children between the ages of ten and fifteen were working outside the home.
many progressives argued that children too had rights in a democracy.
the national child labor committee campaigned for laws prohibiting the employment of children.
within ten years most states had passed such laws although some were lax in enforcing them.
progressives who focused on childrens issues also demanded that cities build more parks and playgrounds.
further reformers made a concerted effort to regulate the length of the workday for women in part because some of them were pregnant and others had children at home with inadequate supervision.
954 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 child labor child workers shuck oysters in 1913 at the varn platt canning company in bluffton south carolina.
spearheaded by florence kelley the first president of the national consumers league progressives convinced many state governments to ban the hiring of children below a certain age and to limit the hours that both women and children could work.
it took a tragic disaster however to spur meaningful government regulation of dangerous workplaces.
on march 25 1911 a fire broke out at the triangle shirtwaist factory called a sweatshop because of its cramped and unventilated work areas in new york city.
escape routes were limited because the owner kept the stairway door locked to prevent theft and 146 workers trapped on the upper floors of the t en story building died or leaped to their deaths.
the victims were mostly young foreign born women in their teens almost all of them jewish italian or russian immigrants.
in the fires aftermath dozens of new city and state regulations dealing with fire hazards dangerous working conditions and child labor were enacted across the nation.
progressives aims and achievements 955 the supreme court was inconsistent in its rulings on state labor laws.
in lochner v new york 1905 the court ruled that a state law limiting bakers to a sixty hour workweek was unconstitutional because it violated workers right to accept any jobs they wanted no matter how bad the working conditions or how low the pay.
three years later however in muller v oregon 1908 the court changed its mind.
based on evidence that long working hours increased the chances of health problems the court approved an oregon law restricting the workday to no more than ten hours for women.
the progressive income tax progressives also addressed americas growing economic inequality.
one way to redistribute wealth was through a progressive federal income t ax so called because the tax rates progress or rise as income levels rise thus forcing the rich to pay more.
such a graduated or progressive tax system was the climax of the progressive movements commitment to a more equitable distribution of wealth.
the progressive income tax was an old idea.
in 1894 william jennings bryan had persuaded congress to approve a 2 percent tax on annual incomes of more than 4 000.
when millionaires responded by threatening to leave america bryan exclaimed if some of our best people prefer to leave the country rather than pay the tax.
let them depart soon after the tax became law however the supreme court declared it unconstitutional on a technicality.
progressives continued to believe however that a graduated tax would help slow the concentration of wealth in the hands of the richest americans.
in 1907 president theodore roosevelt announced his support.
two years later his successor william howard national consumers league exhibit taft endorsed a constitutional amend to raise awareness about labor ment allowing such a tax and congress reform everyday objects are displayed agreed.
finally in 1913 the sixteenth alongside descriptions of the poor working conditions and exploitation that amendment was ratified by enough went into their manufacture.
states to become law.
956 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 progressivism under roosevelt and taft most progressive legislation originated at the state and local levels.
federal reform efforts began in earnest only when theodore roosevelt became president in 1901.
during his rapid rise to national fame and leadership roosevelt had grown more progressive with each passing year.
a great democracy he said has got to be progressive or it will soon cease to be great or a democracy unlike his predecessor william mckinley who was unwilling to confront business leaders t r thrived on confrontation.
one journalist described him as impetuous impatient and wholly lacking in tact he could not stand indecision or inaction and did everything emphatically at full speed.
for him a life of public service was both an exciting dream and a sobering responsibility.
roosevelt was a boundless force of nature an american original a steam engine in trousers with an oversized intellect and ego.
his exuberance charm and humor however made him an irresistible personality.
even his political opponent woodrow wilson was smitten after meeting roosevelt in person you cant resist the man in the white house roosevelt jumped into his duties with what he called strenuosity he invited guests to wrestle or box with him or to fight with wooden swords or climb trees.
his outsized personality said a friend so crowds the room that the walls are worn thin and threaten to burst outward roosevelt transformed the presidency and the role of the federal government by breaking with the gilded age tradition in which presidents had deferred to congress.
in his view the problems caused by explosive industrial growth required powerful responses and he was unwilling to wait for congress to act.
only an activist president armed with new regulatory agencies and laws could counterbalance the power of the corporations and trusts.
i believe in a strong executive roosevelt asserted.
i believe in power during his administration the white house became the focus of policy making.
like lincoln his hero roosevelt believed that great presidents must take noble risks to address national needs even if it meant stretching the limits of the constitution.
people quickly noticed his expansive view of presidential powers.
joseph joe cannon the powerful republican speaker of the house complained that roosevelt had no more use for the constitution than a tomcat has for a marriage license taming big business roosevelt was the first president to use executive power to rein in big business.
as governor of new york he had pushed progressivism under roosevelt and taft 957 for legislation regulating sweatshops instituting state inspections of factories and slaughterhouses and limiting the workday to eight hours.
roosevelt believed in capitalism and the accumulation of wealth but he was willing to adopt radical methods to ensure that the social unrest caused by the insensitivity of business owners to the rights of workers and the needs of the poor did not mushroom into a revolution.
roosevelt applauded the growth of american industrial capitalism but declared war on corruption and on c ronyism the awarding of political appointments government contracts square deal this 1906 cartoon and other favors to politicians personal likens roosevelt to the greek legend friends.
he endorsed a square deal hercules who as a baby strangled snakes sent from hell to kill him.
here for every man great or small rich or the serpents are pro corporation poor his square deal program fea senator nelson aldrich and standard tured what was called the three cs oils john d rockefeller.
greater government control of corporations enhanced conservation of natural resources and new regulations to protect consumers against contaminated food and medications.
curbing the trusts in december 1901 just a few months after entering the white house roosevelt declared that it was time to deal with the grave evils resulting from huge corporations exercising dominance over their industries and the nations economic life.
in his view the federal government had the right and the obligation to curb the excesses of big business on behalf of the public good.
roosevelts version of progressivism centered on the belief that governments must ensure fairness.
he would wage war against the robber barons who displayed swinish indifference to the public good and the unscrupulous politicians whose votes were regularly bought and sold by corporate lobbyists.
early in 1902 just five months into his presidency roosevelt shocked the business community when he ordered the u s attorney general to break up the northern securities company a vast network of railroads and steamships in the pacific northwest organized by j pierpont morgan.
958 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 morgan could not believe the news.
the worlds most powerful capitalist and wealthiest man rushed from new york city to the white house and told the president if i have done anything wrong send your man to my man and they can fix it up but the attorney general who was also at the meeting told morgan we dont want to fix it up we want to stop it turning to roosevelt morgan then asked if the president planned to attack his other trusts such as u s steel and general electric.
certainly not roosevelt replied unless we find out that.
they have done something wrong after morgan left the president told the attorney general to file the anti trust paperwork.
in 1904 the supreme court would rule in a 5 4 decision that the northern securities company was indeed a monopoly and must be dismantled thereby opening the way for more aggressive enforcement of the sherman anti trust act.
roosevelt fully recognized the benefits of large scale capitalism and he thought that the rise of big business was the inevitable result of the industrial era.
he did not want to destroy the titans of industry and finance but he did insist that they be regulated for the public good.
altogether roosevelt approved about t wenty five anti trust suits against oversized corporations.
he also sought stronger regulation of the railroads.
by their very nature railroads often exercised a monopoly over the communities they served enabling them to charge customers whatever they wanted.
in 1903 congress passed the elkins act making it illegal for railroads to give secret rebates cash refunds on freight charges to high volume business customers.
that same year congress approved roosevelts request that a federal department of commerce and labor be formed within which a bureau of corporations would monitor the activities of big businesses.
the 1902 coal strike in everything he did roosevelt acted forcefully.
on may 12 1902 for example some 150 000 members of the united mine workers umw labor union walked off the job at coal mines in pennsylvania and west virginia.
the miners were seeking a wage increase a shorter work day and official recognition of the union by the mine owners who refused to negotiate.
instead the owners shut down the mines.
the miners many of whom were immigrants from eastern europe were in a bind.
one owner expressed the ethnic prejudices shared by many of his colleagues when he proclaimed the miners dont suffer why they cant even speak english by october the lengthy shutdown had caused the price of coal to soar and hospitals and schools reported empty coal bins as winter approached.
in many northern cities the poor had run out of coal for heating.
the country is on the verge of a vast public calamity warned walter rauschenbusch.
the progressivism under roosevelt and taft 959 reverend washington gladden led a petition drive urging roosevelt to step in to mediate the strike.
the president decided upon a bold move he invited leaders of both sides to a conference in washington d c where he appealed to their patriotism to the spirit that sinks personal considerations and makes individual sacrifices for the public good the mine owners in attendance however refused even to speak to the umw leaders.
roosevelt was so infuriated by what he called the extraordinary stupidity and temper of the wooden headed and arrogant owners that he wanted to grab their spokesman by the seat of his breeches and chuck him out a window.
instead he threatened to declare a national emergency so that he could take control of the mines and use soldiers to run them.
when a congressman questioned the constitutionality of such a move roosevelt roared to hell with the constitution when the people want coal the threat worked the strike ended on october 23.
the miners won a n ine hour workday and a 10 percent wage increase.
roosevelt was the first president to use his authority to referee a dispute between management and labor.
roosevelts reelection roosevelts forceful leadership won him friends and enemies.
as he prepared to run for reelection in 1904 he acknowledged that the whole wall street crowd would do all they could to defeat him.
nevertheless he won the republican nomination.
the democrats having lost twice with william jennings bryan essentially gave the election to roosevelt and the republicans by nominating the virtually unknown alton b parker chief justice of the new york supreme court.
parker was the dullest and most forgettable presidential candidate in history.
one journalist dubbed him the enigma from new york the most interesting item in his official campaign biography was that he had trained pigs to come when called by name.
the democrats suffered their worst election defeat in thirty two years.
after winning the popular vote by 7 6 million to 5 1 million and the electoral vote 336 to 140 roosevelt told his son it was his greatest triumph having succeeded to the presidency after william mckinleys assassination he had now won election on his own and in his view had a popular mandate to do great things.
on the eve of his inauguration in march 1905 he announced tomorrow i shall come into office in my own right.
then watch out for me 960 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 roosevelts duality theodore roosevelt as an apostle of prosperity top and as a roman tyrant bottom.
roosevelts energy self righteousness and impulsiveness elicited conflicting reactions.
progressivism under roosevelt and taft 961 progressive regulation now elected in his own right roosevelt launched his second term with an even stronger commitment to regulating corporations and their corrupt owners the criminal rich who exploited their workers and tried to eliminate competition.
his comments irked many of his corporate contributors and congressional republican leaders.
said the pittsburgh steel baron henry frick we bought the son of a bitch and then he did not stay bought to promote the moral regeneration of business roosevelt first took aim at the railroads.
in 1906 he persuaded congress to pass the hepburn act which for the first time gave the federal interstate commerce commission the power to set maximum freight rates for the railroad industry.
under roosevelts square deal programs the federal government also assumed oversight of key industries affecting public health meat packers food processors and makers of drugs and patent medicines.
muckraking journalists had revealed all sorts of unsanitary and dangerous activities in the preparation of food and drug products by many companies.
perhaps the most bad meat government inspectors closely examine tainted sides of beef at a meatpacking plant.
962 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 powerful blow against these abuses was struck by upton sinclairs novel the jungle 1906 which told the story of a lithuanian immigrant working in a filthy chicago meatpacking plant it was too dark in these storage places to see well but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.
these rats were nuisances and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them they would die and then rats bread and meat would go into the hoppers to be ground up together.
after reading the jungle roosevelt urged congress to pass the meat inspection act of 1906.
it required the department of agriculture to inspect every hog and steer whose carcass crossed state lines both before and after slaughter.
the pure food and drug act 1906 enacted the same day required the makers of prepared food and medicines to host government inspectors too.
environmental conservation theodore roosevelt was the first president passionately committed to environmental conservation.
an avid outdoorsman and naturalist he feared that unregulated logging and mining companies were destroying the nations landscape by their reckless extermination of all useful and beautiful wild things roosevelt c hampioned efforts to p rotect wilderness areas and manage and preserve the nations natural resources for the benefit of future generations.
he created fifty federal wildlife refuges approved five new national parks and fifty one federal bird sanctuaries and designated eighteen national monuments including the grand canyon.
in 1898 roosevelt had endorsed the appointment of his friend gifford pinchot the nations first professionyosemite valley a couple playfully ally trained forest manager as head of poses atop glacier point rock in yosemite national park in 1902 the u s department of agricultures adventurous tourists flocked to national division of forestry.
pinchot like rooparks and monuments in the early sevelt believed in economic growth as twentieth century and still do today.
well as environmental preservation.
progressivism under roosevelt and taft 963 pinchot said that the conservation movement promoted the greatest good for the greatest number for the longest time roosevelt and pinchot used the forest reserve act 1891 to protect 172 million acres of federally owned forests from being logged.
lumber companies were furious but the president held firm declaring i hate a man who skins the land overall roosevelt set aside more than 234 million acres of federal land for conservation purposes and created f orty five national forests in eleven western states.
as pinchot recalled launching the conservation movement was the most significant achievement of the t r.
administration as he himself believed roosevelt and race roosevelts most significant failure as a progressive as it was for so many of his successors was his refusal to confront the movements major blind spot racism.
like populists progressives worked to empower the people for many of them however the people did not include african americans native americans or some immigrant groups.
most white progressives shared the prevailing racist attitudes of the time.
they ignored or even endorsed the passage of jim crow laws in the south that prevented blacks from voting and subjected them to rigid racial separation.
by 1901 nearly every southern state had prevented almost all african americans from voting or holding political office by disqualifying or terrorizing them.
hundreds of african americans were being lynched each year across the south where virtually no blacks were allowed to serve on juries or work as sheriffs or policemen.
a white candidate for governor in mississippi in 1903 announced that he believed in the divine right of the white man to rule to do all the voting and to hold all the offices both state and federal the south wrote w e b.
du bois then a young black sociologist at atlanta university is simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk at the same time few progressives raised objections to the many informal and private patterns of segregation and prejudice in the north and west.
the plain fact is muckraking journalist ray stannard baker admitted in 1909 most of us in the north do not believe in any real democracy between white and colored men roosevelt confided to a friend in 1906 his belief that as a race and in the mass african americans are altogether inferior to whites yet the president made a few exceptions.
on october 16 1901 roosevelt invited booker t washington the nations most prominent black leader to the white house to discuss presidential appointments in the south.
upon learning of the meeting white southerners exploded with fury.
the memphis scimitar screamed that inviting a nigger to dine in the white house was 964 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 theodore roosevelt and booker t washington roosevelt addresses the national negro business league in 1900 with washington seated to his left.
the most damnable outrage that has ever been perpetrated by a citizen of the united states south carolina senator benjamin r tillman threatened that a thousand niggers in the south will have to be killed to teach them their place again a stunned roosevelt insisted that he had done nothing wrong.
in the end however he gave in to the criticism.
never again would he host a black leader.
during a tour of the south in 1905 he pandered to whites by highlighting his own southern ancestry his mother was from georgia and expressing his admiration for the confederacy and robert e lee.
his behavior said a black leader was national treachery to the negro the brownsville riot the following year 1906 brought a violent racial incident in brownsville texas where a dozen or so members of an african american army regiment from a nearby fort got into a shootout with whites who had been harassing them outside a saloon.
one white bartender was killed and a police officer was seriously wounded.
both sides claimed the other started the shooting.
an investigation concluded that the soldiers were at fault but no one could identify any of the shooters and none of the soldiers was willing to talk.
progressivism under roosevelt and taft 965 roosevelt responded by dishonorably discharging the entire regiment of 167 soldiers several of whom had been awarded the congressional medal of honor for their service in cuba during the war of 1898.
critics flooded the white house with angry telegrams.
secretary of war william h taft urged the president to reconsider his decision but roosevelt refused to show any mercy to murderers assassins cowards and comrades of murderers sixty years later the u s army cleared the records of all the black soldiers.
disheartened black leaders predicted that roosevelts harsh language would ignite race hatred and violence against innocent african americans.
taft and retrenchment after his 1904 election victory roosevelt had decided he would not run for president again in part because he did not want to be the first president to serve the equivalent of three terms.
it was a noble gesture but a blunder that would have momentous political consequences.
for now however he urged republicans to nominate his l ong time friend secretary of war william howard taft whom the republican convention endorsed on its first ballot in 1908.
the democrats again chose william jennings bryan who still retained a faithful following especially in the south.
taft promised to continue roosevelts policies and the republican platform endorsed the presidents progressive program.
the democratic platform echoed the republican emphasis on regulation of business but called for a lower tariff.
bryan struggled to attract national support and was defeated for a third time as taft swept the electoral college 321 to 162 a life of public service william howard taft was superbly qualified to be president.
born in cincinnati in 1857 he was the son of a prominent attorney who had served in president grants cabinet.
he had graduated second in his class at yale and gone on to become a leading legal scholar serving on the ohio supreme court.
in 1900 president mckinley had appointed him the first american g overnor general of the philippines and three years later roosevelt named him secretary of war.
until becoming president taft had never held an elected office.
taft was a cautious conservative progressive who embraced a strict construction of the constitution which meant that he believed the founding fathers had intentionally limited the powers of each of the three government branches executive legislative and judicial.
unlike roosevelt who believed that the president to serve the public interest could take any action 966 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 william howard taft speaking at manassas virginia in 1911 not e xplicitly prohibited by the constitution taft insisted that the presidents authority should be limited to what the constitution specified.
taft went so far as to insist that the president had no role in the development of legislation.
that was solely the responsibility of congress.
once elected taft explained that his focus was to complete the programs and policies that roosevelt had initiated.
he vowed to preserve capitalism by protecting the right of private property and the right of liberty in practice this meant that he was even more determined than roosevelt to support the spirit of commercial freedom against monopolistic trusts but he was not interested in pushing for additional reforms or exercising extraordinary presidential power.
taft viewed himself as a judge like administrator not an innovator and was reluctant to exercise presidential authority.
after leaving the white house he got the job he had always wanted chief justice of the u s supreme court.
taft proved neither as energetic nor as w ide ranging as roosevelt in his role as a reformer p resident a difference that would lead to a fateful break between the two men.
taft and the tariff president taft displayed his credentials as a progressive republican by supporting lower tariffs on imports he even called a special session of congress to address the matter.
but he proved less skillful than roosevelt in dealing with congress.
taft also discontinued roosevelts practice of using interviews with journalists to influence congressmen by using his big stick through the press progressivism under roosevelt and taft 967 in the end tafts failure of leadership enabled congress to pass the flawed payne aldrich tariff 1909 which did little to change federal policies.
tariff policies continued to favor the industrial northeast.
tafts failure to gain real reform and his lack of a crusading spirit angered progressive pro roosevelt republicans whom taft called assistant democrats spurned by the progressive members of his party taft gravitated to the old guard republican conservatives.
roosevelt was not happy.
the ballinger pinchot controversy in 1910 the split between the conservative and progressive republican factions was widened by what came to be called the ballinger pinchot controversy.
tafts new secretary of the interior richard a ballinger opened to commercial development millions of acres of federal lands that roosevelt had ordered protected.
as chief of forestry gifford pinchot complained about the giveaway but taft refused to intervene.
when pinchot made his opposition public early in 1910 taft fired him labeling him a fanatic in doing so taft set in motion a feud with roosevelt that would eventually end their friendship and cost him his reelection.
the taft roosevelt feud in 1909 soon after taft became president roosevelt and his son kermit sailed to africa where they would spend nearly a year hunting b ig game animals.
when he heard about the extended safari business tycoon j pierpont morgan expressed the hope that every lion would do its duty roosevelt had left the white house assuming that taft would continue to pursue a progressive agenda.
but by filling the cabinet with corporate lawyers and firing gifford pinchot taft had in roosevelts view failed to carry out my work unbroken roosevelts rebuke of taft was in some ways undeserved.
taft had at least attempted tariff reform which roosevelt had never dared.
although taft had fired pinchot he had replaced him with another conservationist.
tafts administration actually preserved more federal land in four years than roosevelts had in nearly eight and it filed twice as many a nti trust suits including the one that led to the breakup of the standard oil company in 1911.
taft also supported giving women the right to vote and workers the right to join unions.
none of that satisfied roosevelt however.
on august 31 1910 the angry former president eager to return to the political spotlight gave a speech at osawatomie kansas in which he announced his latest progressive principles and p roposals his new nationalism roosevelt explained that he wanted to go beyond ensuring a square deal in which corporations were forced to play by the rules he now promised to change the rules to force large corporations to promote social welfare and to serve the needs of working people.
968 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 political giants a cartoon showing roosevelt charging through the air at taft who is seated on a mountaintop.
to save capitalism from the threat of a w orking class revolution roosevelt called for tighter federal regulation of arrogant corporations that too often tried to control and corrupt politics for a federal income tax the sixteenth amendment had still not become law and for federal laws regulating child labor.
it was a sweeping agenda that would greatly expand the power of the federal government over economic and political life.
what i have advocated he explained is not wild radicalism.
it is the highest and wisest kind of conservatism then on february 24 1912 roosevelt abandoned his earlier pledge and announced his entry into the race for the 1912 republican presidential nomination.
he dismissed the second rate taft as a hopeless fathead who had sold the square deal down the river taft responded by calling roosevelt a dangerous egotist and a demagogue they began a bitter war in which roosevelt had the better weapons not the least of which was his love of a good fight.
elihu root a republican leader described his friend roosevelt as essentially a fighter and when he gets into a fight he is completely dominated by the desire to destroy his opponent.
by 1912 a dozen or so progressive states were letting citizens vote for presidential candidates in party primaries instead of following the traditional practice in which a states party leaders chose the nominee.
roosevelt decided that if he won big in the republican primaries he could claim to be the peo progressivism under roosevelt and taft 969 ples choice but even though he won all but two primaries including the one in tafts home state of ohio his personal popularity was no match for tafts authority as party leader.
in the thirty six states that still chose candidates by conventions dominated by party bosses the taft republicans prevailed.
at the republican national convention taft was easily nominated for reelection.
roosevelt was furious.
he denounced taft and his supporters as thieves and stormed out of the convention along with his d elegates mostly social workers teachers professors journalists and urban reformers along with a few wealthy business executives.
the progressive party six weeks later roosevelt urged the breakaway faction of republicans to reconvene in chicago to create the progressive party.
they enthusiastically nominated him as their candidate.
he assured the delegates that he felt fit as a bull moose leading journalists to nickname the progressives the bull moose party when roosevelt closed his acceptance speech by saying we stand at armageddon the climactic encounter between christ and satan and we battle for the lord the delegates stood and burst into the hymn onward christian soldiers one reporter wrote that the bull moose movement was not so much a party as it was a political religion and roosevelt was its leading evangelist.
progressives loved him because he showed what a government dedicated to the public good might achieve.
and he loved to campaign because it enabled him to engage the people in the democratic process.
the first duty of the american citizen he stressed is that he shall work in politics no man loved being president as much as roosevelt sideshow ted this 1912 cartoon and in 1912 no man worked harder to criticizes the bull moose party for being just a sideshow with suffragists selling be president.

it supported a minimum living wage for hourly w orkers womens suffrage campaign finance reform and a system of social security insurance to protect people against sickness unemployment and disabilities.
it also pledged to end the boss system governing politics and destroy the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics conservative critics called roosevelt a socialist a revolutionist a virtual traitor to american institutions and a monumental egotist once nominated roosevelt repeatedly declared that taft was not a progressive because he had tried to undo efforts at environmental conservation and had failed to fight either for social justice or against the special interests instead the former president charged taft had aligned himself with the privileged political and business leaders who steadfastly opposed the cause of justice for the helpless and the wronged woodrow wilson a progressive southerner the fight between william howard taft and theodore roosevelt gave hope to the democrats whose presidential nominee new jersey governor woodrow wilson had enjoyed remarkable success in his brief political career.
until his nomination and election as governor in 1910 wilson had been a college professor and then president of princeton university he had never run for political office or worked in business.
he was a man of ideas who had a keen intellect an analytical temperament a tireless work ethic an inspiring speaking style and a strong conviction that he knew what was best for the nation.
to serve humanity born in staunton virginia in 1856 the son grandson nephew and s on in law of presbyterian ministers thomas woodrow wilson had grown up in georgia and the carolinas during the civil war and reconstruction.
the south he once said was the only part of the nation where nothing had to be explained to him.
tall and slender with a long chiseled face he developed an unquestioning religious faith.
driven by a consuming sense that god had destined him to serve humanity he often displayed an unbending self righteousness and a fiery temper qualities that would prove to be his undoing as president.
wilson graduated from princeton in 1879.
after law school at the university of virginia he briefly practiced law in atlanta but he found legal woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 971 work dreadful drudgery and soon enrolled at johns hopkins university to study history and political science earning one of the nations first doctoral degrees.
he became an expert in constitutional government and taught at several colleges before being named president of princeton in 1902.
eight years later wilson accepted the support of new jersey democrats for the 1910 gubernatorial nomination.
and he already harbored higher ambitions.
if he could become governor he reflected i stand a very good chance of being the next president of the united states like roosevelt wilson was an intensely ambitious and idealistic man who felt destined to preside woodrow wilson the only president to over americas emergence as the great hold a phd degree.

wilson proved a surprisingly effective campaigner and won a landslide victory.
the professor turned governor then persuaded the state legislature to adopt an array of progressive reforms to curb the power of political party bosses and corporate lobbyists.
after dealing with college politicians wilson joked i find that the men who i am dealing with now seem like amateurs governor wilson soon attracted the attention of national democratic leaders.
at the 1912 democratic convention he faced stiff competition from several veteran party leaders for the presidential nomination.
but with the support of william jennings bryan he won on the f orty sixth ballot.
it was wilson said a political miracle the 1912 election the 1912 presidential campaign was one of the most exciting in history.
it involved four distinguished candidates democrat woodrow wilson republican william howard taft socialist eugene v debs and progressive theodore roosevelt.
for all of their differences in personality and temperament the candidates shared a basic progressive assumption that modern social problems could be resolved only through active governmental intervention.

how did the division between roosevelt and taft give wilson the presidency.
wwn64 why was wilsons victory in 1912 especially significant.
figure m21 2 first proof no sooner did the formal campaign open than roosevelts candidacy almost ended.
while on his way to deliver a speech in milwaukee wisconsin he was shot by john schrank a lunatic who believed that any president seeking a third term should be shot.
the bullet went through roosevelts thick overcoat a steel eyeglass case and fifty page speech then fractured a rib before nestling just below his right lung an inch from his heart.
stand back dont hurt the man roosevelt yelled at the crowd as they mobbed schrank.
refusing medical attention roosevelt demanded that he be driven to the auditorium to deliver an eighty minute speech to 10 000 supporters.
in a dramatic gesture he showed the audience his bloodstained shirt and punctured text and vowed it takes more than this to kill a bull moose woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 973 as the campaign developed taft quickly lost ground.
there are so many people in the country who dont like me he lamented.
the contest settled into a debate over the competing programs touted by the two f ront runners roosevelts new nationalism and wilsons new freedom.
the new freedom designed by louis brandeis aimed to restore economic competition by eliminating all trusts rather than simply regulating them.
where roosevelt admired the power and efficiency of law abiding corporations no matter how large brandeis and wilson were convinced that huge heartless industries needed to be broken up.
on election day wilson won handily collecting 435 electoral votes to 88 for roosevelt and only 8 for taft.
after learning of his election the s elf righteous wilson told the chairman of his campaign committee that i owe you nothing.
god ordained that i should be the next president of the united states.
neither you nor any other mortal could have prevented that had the republicans not divided their votes between taft and roosevelt however wilson would have lost.
his was the victory of a minority candidate over a divided opposition.
since all four candidates called themselves progressives however the president elect expressed his hope that the thoughtful progressive forces of the nation may now at last unite the election of 1912 profoundly altered the character of the republican party.
the defection of the bull moose progressives had weakened its progressive wing.
as a result when republicans returned to power in the 1920s they would be more conservative in tone and temperament.
eugene debs the real surprise of the 1912 election was the strong showing of the socialist party candidate eugene v debs running for the fourth time.
the tall blue eyed idealist had devoted his adult life to fighting against the monstrous system of capitalism on behalf of the working class first as a labor union official then as a socialist promoting government ownership of railroads and the sharing of profits with workers.
although fierce in his commitment to improving the lives of the poor debs was kind and gentle in his interactions with people.
he voiced a brand of socialism that was flexible rather than rigid christian rather than marxist democratic rather than totalitarian.
he believed in political transformation not violent revolution.
as one of his supporters said that old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man.
and thats not the funniest part of it.
as long as hes around i believe it myself debs became the unifying symbol of a diverse movement that united west virginia coal miners oklahoma sharecroppers pacific northwest 974 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 l umberjacks and immigrant workers in new york city sweatshops.
one newspaper described the rising tide of socialism in 1912 as some 1 150 socialists won election to local and state offices across the nation including eighteen mayoral seats.
to many voters the socialists whose 118 000 d ues paying members in 1912 were double the number from the year before offered the only real alternative to a stalemated political system in which the two major parties had few real differences.
a business executive in new york city explained that he had become a socialist because the old parties democrats and republicans were flimflamming us all the time but fear of socialism was also widespread.
theodore roosevelt warned that the rapid growth of the socialist party was far more ominous than any populist or similar movement in the past in 1912 with few campaign funds debs crisscrossed the nation giving fiery speeches.
he dismissed roosevelt as a charlatan mountebank swindler and fraud whose progressive promises were nothing more than the mouthings of a low and utterly unprincipled self seeker and demagogue debss untiring efforts brought him more than 900 000 votes more than twice as many as he had received four years earlier.
a burst of reform bills on march 4 1913 a huge crowd surrounded the capitol in washington d c to watch wilsons inauguration.
the new president with the long nose and spectacles declared that it was not a day of triumph but a day of dedication he promised to lower the stiff and stupid republican tariff create a new national banking system strengthen a nti trust laws and establish an administration more concerned about human rights than about property rights wilson worried about people comparing him to the colorful hyperactive roosevelt he appeals to their imagination i do not.
he is a real vivid person.
i am a vague conjectural philosophical personality more made up of opinions and academic prepossessions than of human traits and red corpuscles roosevelt had been a strong president by force of personality wilson became a strong president by force of conviction.
like roosevelt wilson was an activist president he was the first to speak to the nation over the radio and to host weekly press conferences.
a brilliant intense man the first president with a phd degree wilson was a spellbinding speaker with a fervent sense of destiny.
he frequently spoke to congress and visited legislators in their offices in the capitol.
as a political woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 975 scientist wilson was an expert at the processes of government.
during his first two years he pushed through congress more new bills than any previous president.
like most reformers however wilson had a fierce and unlovely side according to the president of harvard university.
the new president found it hard to understand much less work with people who disagreed with him.
wilsons victory coupled with democratic majorities in the house and senate gave his party effective national power for the first time since the civil war.
it also gave southerners a significant role in national politics for the first time since the war.
five of wilsons ten cabinet members were born in the south.
colonel house wilsons closest adviser was colonel edward m house of texas who held no official government position but was wilsons constant companion a small frail courteous b right eyed man with a gentle voice and winning manners house was one of the most skilled political operators in history working mostly behind the scenes to excite and mobilize others and he and wilson developed the most famous political partnership of the twentieth century.
the president described house as my second personality.
he is my independent self wilson told house that he thanked god every day that i have so generous a friend and adviser.
house told wilson that the theme of his presidency should be a form of christian democracy the strong should help the weak that the fortunate should aid the unfortunate and that business should be conducted upon a higher and more humane plane he helped steer wilsons proposals through a congress in which southerners by virtue of their seniority held the lions share of committee chairmanships.
as a result much of the progressive legislation of the wilson era would bear the names of southern democrats.
the tariff and the income tax like taft wilson pursued tariff reform but with much greater success.
by 1913 the federal tariff included hundreds of taxes on different imported goods from oil to nails.
the president believed that u s corporations were misusing the tariff to keep out foreign competitors and create american monopolies that kept consumer prices artificially high.
to attack high tariff rates wilson took a bold step he summoned congress to a special session that lasted eighteen months the longest in history and he addressed its members in person the first president to do so since john 976 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 adams.
the new tariff bill passed the house easily.
the crunch came in the senate the traditional graveyard of tariff reform where swarms of industry lobbyists grew so thick wilson said that a brick couldnt be thrown without hitting one of them the president finally won approval there by publicly criticizing the industrious and insidious tariff lobby.
the underwood simmons tariff act 1913 lowered tariff rates on almost 1 000 imported products.
to compensate for the reduced tariff revenue the bill created the first income tax allowed under the newly ratified sixteenth amendment the initial tax rates were 1 percent on income more than 3 000 4 000 for married couples up to a top rate of 7 percent on annual income of 50 000 or more.
most americans 99 percent paid no income tax because they earned less than 3 000 a year.
the federal reserve act no sooner had the new tariff passed the senate than the administration proposed the first major banking reform since the civil war.
ever since andrew jackson had killed the second bank of the united states in the 1830s the nation had been without a central bank.
instead the money supply was chaotically managed by thousands of local and state banks.
such a decentralized system was unstable and inefficient because during financial panics fearful depositors who were eager to withdraw their money would create runs that often led to the failure of smaller banks.
the primary reason for a new central bank was to prevent more such panics which had occurred five times since 1873.
wilson believed that the banking system needed a central reserve agency that in a crisis could distribute emergency cash to banks threatened by runs.
but he insisted that any new banking system must be overseen by the government rather than by bankers themselves the money power.
he wanted a central bank that would benefit the entire economy not just the large banks headquartered on wall street in new york city.
after much dickering congress passed the federal reserve act on december 23 1913.
it created a national banking system with twelve regional districts each of which had its own federal reserve bank owned by member banks in the district.
nationally chartered banks which agreed to regulation by a federal reserve bank in exchange for the right to issue money had to be members of the federal reserve system.
state chartered b anks essentially unregulated did not and indeed two thirds of the nations banks chose not to become members of the federal reserve system.
the twelve regional federal reserve banks were supervised by a central board of directors in washington d c woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 977 the overarching purpose of the federal reserve system was to adjust the nations currency supply to promote economic growth and ensure the stability and integrity of member banks.
when banks were short of cash they could borrow from the federal reserve the fed using their loans as collateral.
each of the new regional banks issued federal reserve notes currency to member banks in exchange for their loans.
by doing so the fed as the system came to be called promoted economic growth and helped preserve the stability of banks during panics.
the federal reserve board required member banks to have a certain percentage of their total deposits in cash on hand reserve at all times.
a conservative republican called the federal reserve act populistic socialistic half baked destructive and unworkable the new system soon proved its worth however and the criticism eased.
the federal reserve act was the most significant new program of wilsons presidency.
anti trust actions wilson made trust busting the central focus of his new freedom program.
giant corporations had continued to grow despite the sherman a nti trust act and the bureau of corporations the federal watchdog agency created by theodore roosevelt.
wilson decided to make a strong federal trade commission ftc the cornerstone of his a nti trust program.
created in 1914 the fi ve member ftc replaced the bureau of corporations and assumed new powers to define unfair trade practices and issue cease and desist orders when it found evidence of such practices.
like roosevelt wilson also supported efforts to strengthen and clarify the sherman a nti trust act.
henry d clayton a democrat from alabama drafted an a nti trust bill in 1914.
the clayton anti trust act declared that labor unions were not to be viewed as monopolies in restraint of trade as courts had maintained since 1890.
it also prohibited corporate directors from serving on the boards of competing companies and further clarified the meaning of various monopolistic activities.
wilson declares victory in november 1914 just two years after his election president wilson announced that he had accomplished the major goals of progressivism.
he had fulfilled his promises to lower the tariff create a national banking system and strengthen the anti trust laws.
the new freedom was now complete he wrote.
wilsons victory declaration however bewildered many progressives especially those who had long advocated additional federal s ocial justice 978 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 l egislation that wilson had earlier supported.
herbert croly the influential editor of the new republic magazine wondered how the president could assert that the fundamental wrongs of a modern society can be easily and quickly righted as a consequence of passing a few laws wilsons about face he concluded casts suspicion upon his own sincerity as a progressive or upon his grasp of the realities of modern social and industrial life progressivism for whites only african americans continued to resent the racial conservatism displayed by most progressives.
carter glass the virginia senator who was largely responsible for developing the federal reserve act in 1913 was an enthusiastic supporter of his states efforts to disfranchise black voters.
when questioned by a reporter about being a racist progressive glass embraced the label discrimination.
why that is exactly what we propose.
to remove every negro voter who can be gotten rid of similarly woodrow wilson showed little concern about the discrimination and violence that african americans faced.
in fact he shared many of new freedom old rules woodrow wilson and the first lady ride in a carriage with african american drivers.
woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 979 the racist attitudes common at the time.
as a student at princeton he had expressed his disgust at the fifteenth amendment which had guaranteed voting rights for black men after the civil war arguing that whites must resist domination by an ignorant and inferior race as a politician wilson did court african american voters but he rarely consulted black leaders and largely avoided associating with them.
josephus daniels a north carolina newspaper editor who became wilsons secretary of the navy was a white supremacist who stressed that the subjection of the negro politically and the separation of the negro socially are paramount to all other considerations in the south for daniels and other southern progressives progress was possible only if blacks were kept in their place daniels and other cabinet members racially segregated the employees in their agencies.
wilson endorsed the policy claiming that racial segregation is not humiliating but a benefit to him separate but equal was the best way to resolve racial tensions.
he was the first president since the civil war who openly endorsed discrimination against african americans.
in november 1914 a delegation of african american leaders met with wilson to ask how a progressive president could adopt such regressive racial policies.
wilson responded that both races benefited from the policies because they eliminated the possibility of friction william monroe trotter a harvard educated african american newspaper editor who had helped found the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp scolded the president have you a new freedom for white americans and a new slavery for your afro american fellow citizens a phrase wilson had used in a speech.
god forbid a furious wilson told trotter and the other visitors to leave saying that their unchristian tone offends me the vote for women activists for womens suffrage were also disappointed in president wilson.
despite having two daughters who were suffragists he insisted that the issue of womens voting rights should be left to the states rather than embodied in a constitutional amendment.
wilsons lack of support led some leaders of the suffrage movement to revise their tactics.
in 1910 alice paul a new j ersey born quaker and social worker returned from working with the militant suffragists of england where she had participated in various forms of civil disobedience to generate attention and support.
after paul joined the national american woman suffrage association nawsa she urged activists to use more aggressive tactics picket 980 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 alice paul sewing a suffrage fl ag orange and purple with s tars that she and other suffragists often waved at strikes and protests.
state legislatures target and punish politicians who failed to endorse suffrage chain themselves to public buildings incite police to arrest them and undertake hunger strikes.
in march 1913 paul organized 5 000 suffragists to protest at wilsons inauguration.
four years later having broken with the nawsa and formed the national womans party paul decided that suffragists must do something even more dramatic picket the white house.
beginning on january 11 1917 paul and her followers took turns carrying signs all day five days a week for months until the president ordered their arrest.
some sixty suffragists were jailed.
paul was sentenced to seven months in prison.
she then went on a hunger strike leading prison officials to force feed her raw eggs through a tube inserted in her nose.
she later recalled that it was shocking that a government of men could look with such extreme contempt on a movement that was woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 981 asking nothing except such a simple little thing as the right to vote under an avalanche of negative press coverage and public criticism wilson finally pardoned paul and the other activists.
progressivism renewed by 1916 wilsons determination to win reelection revived his commitment to progressive activism.
the president nominated bostonian louis d brandeis the peoples attorney to the supreme court.
brandeis was not just a famed defender of unions against big businesses he would also be the first jewish member of the supreme court.
progressives viewed the nomination as a landmark in the history of american democracy others disagreed.
f ormer president taft dismissed brandeis as a muckraker an emotionalist for his own purposes a socialist.
who is utterly unscrupulous the senate however confirmed brandeiss appointment.
justice oliver wendell holmes jr the leading figure on the court sent brandeis a o ne word telegram welcome farm legislation president wilson also urged congress to pass the first federal legislation directed at assisting farmers.
he first supported a proposal to set up rural banks to provide l ong term farm loans.
the federal farm loan act became law in 1916.
under the control of the federal farm loan board twelve federal land banks offered loans to farmers for five to forty years at low interest rates.
farmers could borrow up to 50 percent of the value of their land.
at about the same time a dream long advocated by populists federal loans to farmers on the security of their crops stored in warehouses finally came to fruition when congress passed the warehouse act of 1916.
these crop security loans were available to sharecroppers tenant farmers and to farmers who owned the land that they worked.
farmers also benefited from the s mith lever act of 1914 which provided federal programs to educate farmers about new machinery and new ideas related to agricultural efficiency and the s mith hughes act 1917 which funded agricultural and mechanical education in high schools.
farmers with the newfangled automobiles had more than a passing interest as well in the federal highways act of 1916 which helped finance new highways especially in rural areas.
labor legislation one of the l ong standing goals of many progressive democrats was a federal child labor law.
when congress passed the keating owen act in 1916 banning products made by child workers under 982 chapter 21 the progressive era 1890 1920 fourteen from being shipped across state lines wilson expressed doubts about its constitutionality but eventually signed it.
another landmark law was the e ight hour workday for railroad workers.
the adamson act of 1916 resulted from a threatened strike by railroad unions demanding an eight hour day and other concessions.
wilson who objected to some of the unions demands nevertheless asked congress to approve the adamson act.
it required t ime and a half pay for overtime work beyond eight hours and appointed a commission to study working conditions in the railroad industry.
assessing progressivism progressivism reached its peak during woodrow wilsons two terms as president.
after decades of political upheaval and social reform progressivism had shattered the traditional laissez faire notion that government had no role in protecting the public welfare by regulating the economy.
the courage and compassion displayed by progressives demonstrated that people of good will could make a difference in improving the quality of life for all.
progressivism awoke people to the evils and possibilities of modern urban industrial life.
most important progressives established the principle that governments local state and f ederal had a responsibility to ensure that americans were protected from abuse by powerful businesses and corrupt politicians.
yet on several fronts progressivism fell short of its supporters hopes and ideals.
it would take the great depression during the 1930s to lead to the passage of a national minimum wage and the creation of a g overnment administered pension program for retirees and disabled workers social security.
like all great historic movements progressivism produced unexpected consequences.
for all of its efforts to give more power to the people voter participation actually fell off during the progressive era.
probably the main reason for the decline of party loyalty and voter turnout was that by the twentieth century people had more activities to distract them.
new forms of recreation like movies cycling automobiles and spectator sports competed with politics for time and attention.
also people showed less interest in political parties and public issues in part because of the progressive emphasis on government by appointed specialists and experts rather than elected politicians.
woodrow wilson a progressive southerner 983 ultimately progressivism faded as an organized political movement because international issues pushed aside domestic concerns.
by 1916 the optimism of a few years earlier was challenged by the distressing slaughter occurring in europe in the great war.
the twentieth century which had dawned with such bright hopes for social progress held in store episodes of unprecedented brutality that led people to question whether progress was even possible anymore.
chapter review summary the progressive impulse progressives were mostly middle class idealists in both political parties who promoted reform and government regulation to ensure social justice.
many progressives wished to restrict the powers of local political machines and establish honest and efficient government.
they also called for legislation to end child labor promote workplace safety ban the sale of alcoholic beverages regulate or eliminate trusts and other monopolies and grant woman suffrage.
the varied sources of progressivism many religious reformers such as those involved in the social gospel movement urged their fellow protestants to reject social darwinism and do more to promote a better life for the urban poor.
the settlement house movement sprang from this idea and spread through urban america as educated middle class women formed community centers in p overty stricken neighborhoods.
progressives drew inspiration from the womens suffrage movement as more women became involved in social reform efforts and in the workplace.
many progressive ideas arose from the ongoing efforts of reformers to end political corruption.
progressives while not radicals also responded to the growing socialist movement and its calls for economic justice for the working class.
muckrakers investigative journalists who exposed political and corporate corruption further fueled the desire of progressive reformers to address abuses of power in american society.
progressives aims and achievements progressives focused on stopping corruption in politics.
they advanced political reforms such as the direct primary the initiative referendum and recall at the state level and the direct election of u s senators through the passage of the seventeenth amendment.
other progressives focused on incorporating new modes of efficiency and scientific management in business known as taylorism into government.
their efforts inspired many cities and counties to adopt the commission system and the city manager plan.
still other progressives who saw regulation of big business as the overriding issue facing the nation focused on legislation and bureaucratic oversight to control or eliminate trusts and other forms of monopolies.
progressivism under roosevelt and taft the administrations of theodore roosevelt and william h taft increased the power of the presidency and the federal government to regulate corporate power and improve the lives of many americans.
roosevelt promoted his progressive square deal program which included regulating trusts through the creation of the bureau of corporations arbitrating the 1902 coal strike persuading congress to regulate the railroads through the elkins and hepburn acts and to clean up the meat and drug industries with the meat inspection and pure food and drug acts.
roosevelt also initiated an environmental conservation campaign to manage and preserve the nations natural resources.
woodrow wilsons progressivism wilsons new freedom program included a low tariff and anti trust regulation.
he also established a central banking system with the federal reserve act and launched a rigorous anti trust program with the passage of the clayton anti trust act and the creation of the federal trade commission.
but he opposed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing womens suffrage.
a southerner he believed blacks were inferior and he supported increased segregation in the federal workforce.

america and the great war 1914 1920 make american history in this u s navy recruiting poster in new york city a sailor encourages a young man to play an active role in the great war.
t hroughout the nineteenth century the atlantic ocean had protected america from the major land wars on the continent of europe.
during the early twentieth century however the nations century long isolation from european conflicts ended.
ever expanding world trade meant that u s interests were becoming deeply entwined with the global economy.
in addition the development of s team powered ships and submarines meant that foreign navies could directly threaten american security.
at the same time the election of woodrow wilson in 1912 brought to the white house a self righteous moralist determined to impose his standards on what he saw as renegade nations.
this combination of circumstances made the outbreak of the great war in europe in 1914 a profound crisis for the united states.
the war would become the defining event of the early twentieth century.
for almost three years president wilson maintained americas stance of neutrality in the war while providing increasing amounts of food and supplies to great britain and france.
in 1917 however german submarine attacks on u s ships forced congress into declaring war.
the decision would turn the tide in the fighting and reshape americas international role as a d ominant world power.
