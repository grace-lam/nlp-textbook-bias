source destruction of the battleship maine in havana harbor in the spanish american war havana cuba 1898 feb 15 creator kurz allison imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 on february 15 1898 a naval officer awoke president william mckinley in the middle of the night with the stunning news that the american battleship the maine had exploded in havana cuba killing 266 of the 354 crew members.
the explosion turned the battleship into a hunk of molten steel.
this illustration depicted the blast propelling bodies and debris sky high in havana harbor.
americans also read moving first hand accounts in the press including one from survivor james r young.
i was feeling a bit glum young recalled and in fact was so quiet that lieutenant j.
hood came up and asked laughingly if i was asleep.
i said no i am on watch scarcely had i spoken when there came a dull sullen roar.
would to god that i could blot out the sounds and the scenes that followed the united states and spain had long been at odds over the question of independence for cuba then a spanish colony.
mckinley had sent the maine to havana to stop spanish instigated attacks on american held property in cuba.
many americans suspected that spanish saboteurs had blown up the ship to protest the u s incursion into spanish territorial waters.
the shocking images and accounts of the maine explosion fueled public anger against spain for its supposed attack on the u s navy creating a crisis between the two nations.
an official investigation confirmed these widely held views blaming the maine explosion on a spanish mine in the harbor.
the exact cause of the blast however remained a mystery.
some experts now cite a spontaneous combustion from the coal stored alongside ammunition as the most likely culprit a misfortune thirteen american naval vessels shared between 1895 and 1898.
others suggest that cuban revolutionaries may have planted the explosives expecting the united states to blame spain and declare war.
the maine explosion ignited a four month war between the united states and spain in 1898.
this splendid little war as one official called it ended with an overwhelming american victory.
the overseas possessions that the united states gained from spain including puerto rico guam and the philippines gave the nation a new formal colonial empire.
the united states simultaneously constructed an informal economic empire throughout the caribbean and east asia.
as the united states established itself as a budding world power americans offered conflicting visions of how the united states should behave outside its borders.
remember the maine and to hell with spain newspaper slogan urging war with spain in the wake of the maine explosion chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 becoming a world power throughout the nineteenth century the atlantic and pacific oceans provided americans with a sense of security and detachment from world affairs.
by the 1880s however advancements in transportation and communication suddenly made the world seem smaller and more dangerous to americans.
fear alone though did not explain americans growing interest in venturing overseas.
americans looked outside their borders to find markets for u s goods and the raw materials needed to fuel a growing industrial economy.
international recognition as a world power and spreading american values also appealed to the countrys growing sense of national greatness.

canary i dominican republic cuba p in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries britain france and spain had based their world prominence on far flung colonial empires places that they populated with settlers and soldiers to exploit economic resources and protect ocean trade routes.
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries these settler communities launched a slew of successful revolutions that liberated colonies in north and south america from european rule.
with the old colonial empires now defunct european nations and japan sought new ones.
as britain france belgium germany italy portugal spain russia the netherlands and japan discovered vulnerable areas around the globe to colonize they developed a new style of empire building.
imperialism the late nineteenth century term for colonizing foreign nations and lands relied primarily on business political and military structures rather than settlers to rule colonized peoples and exploit their resources.
europes drive to create colonial empires in africa and asia in the late nineteenth century provided a model to either emulate or reject as the united states embarked on its campaign to become a world power.
besides exploiting colonies for economic gain europeans also drew satisfaction from fulfilling a self imposed civilizing mission to spread western culture and values to nonwhite and nonchristian populations throughout africa and asia.
the drawbacks to empires however included the need to defend widely dispersed territories and suppress popular uprisings against colonial rule.
americans therefore developed conflicting visions from the lessons that they drew from the european experience.
some saw it as an inspiration others a cautionary tale.
view the map world colonial empires 1900 port becoming a world power as the map 19 1 indicates the world situation in 1898 affected where the united states could hope to expand its influence.
by the time the united states began exploring opportunities for expansion beyond the north american continent britain france germany and the netherlands had already established colonial empires throughout africa east asia and south asia.
great britain exerted the greatest reach making it the worlds preeminent imperial power.
this left the western hemisphere and china as possibilities for u s colonial expansion.
the impulse for expansion throughout american history territorial expansion played an important role in defining national identity and providing economic opportunity to americans.
in the early nineteenth century manifest destiny or the belief that americans had a divine right to expand across north america fueled expansion.
imbued with a sense of cultural and racial superiority over the indigenous peoples who inhabited these lands americans felt justified in taking away land from indians.
in their 19 1 map of the world 1898 the creation of far flung european empires at the end of the nineteenth century limited opportunities for the united states to establish its own colonies or new overseas markets.

chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 view native americans had failed to make the land productive.
the government relocated many indian tribes onto reservations where officials and missionaries embraced the goal of civilizing indians by teaching them western capitalist and christian values see chapter 15.
the same belief in manifest destiny quest for economic opportunity and ideas of racial superiority spurred interest in expanding american influence and trade overseas.
prominent businessmen commercial farmers and politicians urged the country to seek territory and markets outside the united states.
in the 1890s american companies and farmers sold 90 percent of their goods to other americans.
the time had come these critics argued to develop global markets and even colonies to ensure continued prosperity and economic opportunity at home.
when the country suffered a devastating economic depression from 1893 to 1897 these calls crystallized into a resolve in some quarters to build a commercial and colonial empire overseas.
technological innovations also encouraged americans to look beyond their borders.
the laying of transatlantic telegraph cables increased both the speed and the volume of information sent throughout the world.
the telegraph in many respects served as the internet of the nineteenth century.
telegrams accelerated the exchange of diplomatic notes between governments while dispatches from journalists overseas connected americans on a daily basis to events around the world.
if the telegraph hastened the flow of information the advent of steam powered ships dramatically reduced the time needed to move people and goods throughout the world.
in his seminal 1890 work the influence of sea power upon history 1660 1783 u s navy captain alfred t mahan traced a direct correlation between a strong navy and world power.
in the new age of steampowered battleships the navys outdated wooden sailing ships described by one congressman as floating washtubs were ill suited for advancing u s interests in the world.
from 1890 onward the united states built battleships to match its growing economic power and its expansionist ambitions and it soon boasted the third most powerful navy in the world after great britain and germany.
in 1907 president theodore teddy roosevelt sent the nations 16 battleships and four destroyers on a global tour to show off americas how did technology and ideology fuel the nations expansionist impulses.
world class steam powered navy a trip that took two years to complete.
americans growing pride in their nations economic might and technological prowess encouraged the united states to seek international recognition as a world power.
so did the ideological vision encapsulated by social darwinism an ideology that applied nineteenth century naturalist charles darwins theory of biological evolution to human society through the notion of survival of the fittest at home americans often used social darwinism to justify the dominance of the wealthy and powerful considered the fit over the poor and weak or the unfit these ideas also shaped how americans viewed the world.
in the social darwinist view the racial superiority of northern europeans explained why britain france and germany were world powers that easily colonized nonwhite peoples.
to take its rightful place alongside or even above these world powers the united states needed to demonstrate its fitness by entering the global competition for colonies.
in making a case for expansion the congregational minister josiah strong linked older ideas of manifest destiny with this newer emphasis on survival of the fittest.
it seems to me that god with infinite wisdom and skill is training the anglosaxon race to prevail in the competition to control lands throughout the world strong wrote in his influential book our country its possible future and its present crisis 1885.
in strongs view the united states risked losing its chance for global eminence if it failed to join the scramble for colonies underway worldwide.
driven to perfect democracy at home many progressives found the call to spread american values abroad appealing.
their reform impulse extended beyond u s borders to imagine a world freed from tyranny and injustice.
in many respects the strong activist government that progressives helped construct at the turn of the century made it possible for the united states to extend its imperial reach during the progressive era.
progressives never spoke with one voice on domestic matters and they also offered competing visions on expanding u s influence in the world.
progressives who opposed the nations overseas forays feared strengthening big business at the expense of exploited foreign peoples and american workers.
they also believed that imperial ventures drew attention away from progressive reform projects at home.
read the document josiah strong from our country 1885 the spanish american war the spanish american war the first significant opportunity to expand u s influence overseas came when cuba rose in revolt against spanish rule.
extensive press coverage of spanish atrocities and u s economic interests in cuba prompted the nation to take note of this colonial struggle for independence.
after a mysterious explosion sank the maine and killed hundreds of american sailors many americans accused spain of deliberately attacking the ship.
fearing that congress might declare war on its own a reluctant president william mckinley finally agreed to an armed intervention.
the war with spain was short but the outcome was dramatic.
the peace treaty with spain granted the u s island possessions in the caribbean and pacific that became the territorial foundation for the new u s colonial empire.
the growing conflict with spain in the early nineteenth century when spains other western hemisphere colonies successfully fought for independence cuba and puerto rico remained loyal to spain.
by 1868 however oppressive spanish rule provoked a rebellion in cuba that ended ten years later with spains pledge to grant the island increased autonomy.
failure to fulfill this promise economic hardships inflicted by the 1890s depression and continued agitation by exiled cuban rebels living in the united states fanned the flames of rebellion again in 1895.
by the time the second revolt began the united states and cuba had established strong commercial ties.
cuba sent over 90 percent of its exports to the united states and american investment totaled nearly 50 million in cuban sugar cattle mining and tobacco industries.
spain paid a heavy price to maintain this symbol of its imperial past.
of the 278 000 spanish troops sent to cuba to suppress the revolt nearly 50 000 had died of yellow fever or malaria by 1898 and an equal number lay too sick to fight.
a much smaller force of 20 000 30 000 cuban rebels drew on their knowledge of the terrain and support from civilians to fight a guerrilla war that ravaged tobacco and sugar plantations to deprive the spanish government of revenue.
rebels purposefully steered clear of american owned plantations to avoid antagonizing the united states.
cuban exiles in the united states drew appealing analogies between their struggle for independence and the american revolution highlighting the similar desire of cuban and american colonists to free themselves from an exploitive ruler and establish democratic self rule.
if any uncertainty existed among the american public over which side they supported spanish general valeriano weylers infamous reconcentration policy ended those doubts.
through reconcentration spanish soldiers tried to crush the cuban rebellion by herding peasants off their farms into heavily fortified camps and then systematically destroying the crops that fed the rebel armies.
this policy created a humanitarian crisis in cuba as famine and disease ravaged the civilian population killing nearly 100 000 civilians.
outraged americans denounced reconcentration as uncivilized and illegal warfare.
the yellow press tabloid journalists and newspapers that reported sensationalist stories with a strong emotional component fueled public anger against the spanish.
this unique name for nineteenthcentury tabloid journalism derived from competing yellow kid comic strips in leading new york newspapers that portrayed the antics of a precocious boy living in the citys tenements.
yellow journalism emerged in the 1880s when joseph pulitzer began using melodramatic partly fictionalized stories to bolster sales of his newspaper the new york world.
after william randolph hearst took over the new york journal in 1895 the two newspapers waged daily battles over who could print the most lurid tales.
in the cuban crisis both papers saw a chance to report the kinds of scandal driven stories guaranteed to sell newspapers.
exiled cuban rebels living in the united states provided a steady supply of atrocity stories some fabricated some true to the yellow press and the vivid illustrations accompanying these accounts helped the public visualize spanish brutality.
why did americans take an interest in the cuban rebellion against spain.
chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 the importance of illustrations to the yellow press became clear in a fabled exchange between hearst and the artist frederic remington.
remington already famous for his portraits of the american west went to cuba to draw illustrations for the new york journal.
tiring of the rebellions slow pace remington told hearst he was leaving cuba.
hearst supposedly replied please remain.
you furnish the pictures and ill furnish the war this exchange passed quickly into american folklore as proof of hearsts determination to use shocking images real or staged to provoke a war with spain.
no evidence exists however that hearst ever wrote or sent this reply.
images as history atrocity stories and public opinion examines how yellow press illustrations shaped american public opinion.
next the maine exploded in havana harbor.
after a month of press speculation about the cause of the explosion an official naval investigation erroneously blamed a spanish harbor mine for the disaster rather than the real culprit faulty ship design that caused an internal explosion or perhaps sabotage by cuban rebels who wanted the united states to declare war on spain.
in the weeks immediately following the sinking of the maine mckinley tried unsuccessfully to convince spain to grant cuba independence and to calm calls for war from congress.
i have been through one war mckinley told a friend referring to his service in the civil war.
i have seen the dead piled up and i do not want to see another for many other americans however memories of brutal civil war battles had faded.
they enthusiastically viewed war as a manly adventure that would instill discipline and vigor in american men.
the assistant secretary of the navy theodore roosevelt championed this competing view writing to a friend in 1897 i should welcome almost any war for i think this country needs one with the yellow press clamoring for military action with the democrats championing war repubpresident mckinley turned to diplomacy to end the licans feared that mckinleys resistance to fighting impasse over cuba peacefully and repeatedly asked might hurt the party at the polls.

ence with the implied threat of bombardments to to head off a war spain made one last offer to restore calm to havana.

the president the letter outraged the public.
the decision to intervene in cuba worst insult to the united states in its history why was mckinley unable to avoid war with spain.
watch the video burial of the maine victims the spanish american war images as history atrocity stories and public opinion ever since the yellow press helped raise american ire against spain in the years leading up to the spanish american war americans have pondered the power of the press in the united states.
how much power do atrocity stories and pictures have to shape public opinion.
can the press convince the public to fight a war.
on february 12 1897 the new york journal published a story by richard harding davis about a young cuban woman whom spanish authorities had expelled for carrying secret messages between cuban rebels.
davis reported that spanish officers followed clemencia arango and her companions onto an american ship.
the spanish officers demanded that a cabin should be furnished to them to which the girls might be taken and they were then undressed and searched for messages to exiled cuban rebels living in the united states.
frederic remingtons illustration spaniards search women on american steamers accompanied daviss story.
the paper next took up the cause of evangelina cisneros.
sentenced to 20 years in prison for trying to lure a spanish officer into a rebel death trap cisneros was awaiting deportation to an african penal colony.
according to the new york journal her only crime was calling for help from nearby cuban rebels to stop a spanish officer a beast in uniform from raping her.
on october 10 1897 the paper triumphantly announced that a new york journal reporter had helped cisneros break out of jail and sail to the united states.
the yellow press presented clemencia and evangelina as symbols for the virtuous and victimized cuban people fueling public sympathy for the cuban rebellion.

in fact female prison matrons performed the search.
there are things more dreadful than even war and one of them is dishonor the new york journal editorialized about the clemencia arango incident.
this 1897 illustration of dark skinned men viewing and touching the body of a white woman resonated powerfully with many white americans because it aroused their racial prejudices.
spaniards search women on american steamers new york journal february 12 1897.
press coverage of cisneross escapades generated so much interest that huge crowds gathered to hear of her adventures when she appeared in new york and washington d c where president mckinley received her in the white house.
the headline criticized diplomatic inaction and suggested that only military style action could save cuban rebels.
new york journal accounts exaggerated cisneross lightskinned beauty noble birth and prison sufferings.
nearly 15 000 women including president mckinleys wife signed the newspapers petition to spains queen mara cristina demanding cisneross release.
evangelina cisneros rescued by the journal new york journal october 10 1897.
why did popular media accounts depict the cubans as light skinned and the spanish as dark skinned.
chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 congress complied.
on april 24 1898 however spain declared war on the united states.
the next day congress responded with its own declaration of war dating it retroactively to april 21 1898.
to underscore the nations altruistic motives colorado senator henry m teller added an amendment to the war resolutions that disavowed any intention of annexing cuba.
the teller amendment 1898 promised to leave the government and control of the cuban island to its people at the end of the spanish american war.
congress made no such promise to other colonized peoples under spanish control in the caribbean and pacific.
fighting the war against spain i could not have told where those darned islands were within two thousand miles president mckinley on the location of the philippines before the spanish american war rebellion against spain.

i have studied the constitution of the united states and i find in it no authority for colonies and i have no fear rebel leader emilio aguinaldo told one american general.
time would prove him wrong.
besides securing a foothold in the philippines the mckinley administration also used the war against spain as a pretext for settling the festering question of annexing hawaii that had divided americans for the past six years.
americans had a long history of involvement in hawaiian affairs.

one week after the war began commodore george dewey sailed into manila harbor in the spanish colony of the philippines 19 2 and destroyed the spanish pacific fleet.

responding to popular discontent over the erosion of native hawaiians economic standing and cultural traditions queen liliuokalani promised to curtail u s dominance when she assumed the throne in 1891.
in 1893 however american businessmen and missionaries working on the islands representing 5 percent of the islands population overthrew queen liliuokalani.
u s marines sent ashore from a nearby warship ostensibly to protect american property ensured the revolutions success.
thousands of hawaiians took to the streets to protest the coup to no avail.
the new hawaiian republics immediate request for annexation by the united states proved controversial however.
disavowing the role that u s officials had played in the coup president grover cleveland apologized to the queen and demanded her restoration to the throne.
the new hawaiian government ignored clevelands request choosing instead to renew its appeal when the pro annexation mckinley became president five years later.
mckinley believed that acquiring hawaii would foster u s commercial interests in the pacific.
this time the hawaiian patriotic league blocked a formal u s takeover by presenting the senate with a 556 page anti annexation petition signed by over half of native born hawaiians.
faced with hawaiians overwhelming opposition to annexation the senate voted the measure down in 1897.
a year later however with the spanish american war underway congress reversed course.
supporters of annexation argued that u s ships headed to the philippines needed guaranteed access to the naval base in pearl harbor.
putting its own strategic and economic needs ahead of hawaiians desire to remain independent the united states assumed sovereignty over hawaii on july 7 1898.
without enough votes in the senate to approve a formal annexation treaty mckinley settled for a congressional joint resolution that authorizied annexation with a majority vote.
the president appointed a territorial governor to head the hawaiian government and in 1900 congress granted hawaiians the right to elect a territorial legislature.

imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 meanwhile military planners focused on defeating the spanish in cuba.
the accompanying map spanish american war 1898 19 2 illustrates how the navy immediately blockaded cuba trapping the spanish atlantic fleet in santiago.
americas small peacetime army however was woefully unprepared to train and equip the thousands of volunteers enlisting throughout the country.
theodore roosevelt resigned as assistant secretary of the navy and formed the first u s volunteer calvary by recruiting americans from wildly diverse backgrounds.
many of the recruits had personal connections to colonel roosevelt a result of his eclectic lifestyle that included attending harvard hunting expeditions in the west and a stint as police commissioner in new york city.
dubbed the rough riders this collection of cowboys ivy league athletes policemen and pawnee scouts was one of the few volunteer units that actually fought in the war.
although american forces swelled from 28 000 to 275 000 most never left the united states.
on june 22 17 000 u s troops landed in cuba to join cuban rebels on a slow march through heavy jungle to the port of santiago which sheltered the how accurate were the legends that surrounded the charge up the san juan heights.
bulk of the spanish navy and army.
hidden spanish sharpshooters harassed u s soldiers as they made their way to the san juan heights the hills that encircled santiago.
on july 1 the americans under the command of general william shafter attacked 750 spanish soldiers along the san juan heights.
i have seen many illustrations and pictures of this charge on the san juan hills but none of them seem to show it just as i remember it recalled journalist richard harding davis who watched the battle from the sidelines as the americans walked up the hill.
like most illustrations of the battle seen in newspapers at the time this painting 19 3 erroneously shows waves of eager american soldiers advancing on horseback with the flag flying suggesting an invincible overpowering weight of numbers davis noted.
yet he continued i think the thing which impressed one the most when our men started walking from cover was that they were so few.
it almost seemed as if someone had made an awful and terrible mistake.
ones instinct was to call to them to come back roosevelt led the rough riders to the top of the san juan heights a feat that garnered him and the unit acclaim.
they stood alongside african american watch the video roosevelts rough riders the spanish american war troops from the ninth and tenth calvary who had actually reached the top first which roosevelt and the mainstream media failed to mention when celebrating the victory.
the battle provided another opportunity for the yellow press to whip up war fervor on the home front.
responding to false rumors that spanish soldiers had mutilated the corpses of american servicemen killed during the clash a judge magazine cover 19 4 pictured a spaniard drenched in the blood of american soldiers who lay at his feet.
in one hand the ape like figure holds the bloody knife responsible for the atrocity.
his other hand rests on the gravestone of u s sailors whom he allegedly killed by exploding the maine.
this image of a brute that trampled on the american flag reinforced yellow press portrayals of spain as a beast that the united states needed to subdue.
the caricature also fed into racist notions of white supremacy just like african americans at home and soon the filipinos abroad the dark skinned spanish posed a threat to the civilized world.
in future conflicts american propaganda used strikingly similar images to arouse passionate hatred of the nations german and japanese enemies.
legendary accounts attributed the american success in charging up the san juan heights to heroic frontal charges in fact the americans three gatling machine guns made the decisive difference.
believing his exhausted troops could go no farther after reaching the top general shafter decided to lay siege to santiago instead of attacking the city directly.
while american troops encircled the city atop the surrounding hills u s ships blocked the port thus trapping the bulk of the spanish navy and army in santiago.
when the spanish fleet made a dash to leave on july 3 american ships sank or beached every spanish vessel.
in both manila and santiago the newly modernized u s navy outclassed the decrepit spanish fleet scoring easy one sided victories.
on july 17 the spanish surrendered the city and cuba to the americans.
after defeating the spanish in cuba u s forces landed in puerto rico also a caribbean spanish colony where they encountered only token opposition.
american troops fought one more battle to take manila on august 13 having not yet received word that the war between the united states and spain had ended the day before.
the war concluded on a sour note however.
with limited understanding of how malaria yellow fever and typhoid spread army physicians could not stop these diseases from ravaging view the image our victorious fleet in cuban waters the troops that occupied cuba during the summer of 1898.
victory celebrations among u s troops soon gave way to panic when hundreds of soldiers fell ill and healthy young men became hollow eyed walking skeletons.

in return for 20 million spain also ceded the philippines to the united states.
how this land transfer would affect the political future of the philippines remained in doubt.
did the united states intend to grant the philippines independence or keep it as a colony.
americans soon offered competing visions on how to resolve this question.
despite the idealistic guarantees given in the teller amendment cuba became an independent nation in name only.
the united states linked the withdrawal of american occupation troops to concessions from cuba.
the platt amendment 1901 required cuba to give the united states the right to maintain a naval base at guantnamo bay and to intervene militarily to protect life property and individual liberty besides granting the united states a privileged trading relationship the cuban government also needed permission from the united states before entering into treaties with other nations.
the former spanish colony essentially became a u s protectorate a relationship in which a superior power assumes authority over a weaker country or territory to protect it from invasion and dominate its affairs.
the united states took advantage of these rights and occupied cuba numerous times until congress repealed the platt amendment in 1934.
the united states continues to maintain a naval base at guantnamo bay using it to jail and interrogate prisoners captured during the wars in afghanistan and iraq that began in 2001 and 2003 respectively.
in his successful 1900 reelection bid against democrat william jennings bryan mckinley made a strong connection between events at home and abroad.
one campaign poster 19 5 featured portraits of the president and his war hero running mate theodore roosevelt.
the individual images reminded americans of cuban suffering under spanish rule and blamed the devastating depression of the 1890s on the democrats.
the poster then noted that domestic prosperity returned and social justice prevailed overseas once the united states led by the republicans stepped out into the world.
the claim that american intervention improved life for both u s and world citizens became a powerful argument in favor of constructing an american empire.
bryan focused his campaign on the evils of imperialism but mckinley carried the election with a full dinner pail slogan that emphasized restored prosperity.
19 5 mckinley campaign poster this poster helped voters visualize how expanding the nations global influence created trading opportunities that made the whole country more prosperous.

what steps did the united states take to construct a formal and informal empire after its victory over spain.
read the document the platt amendment 1901 creating an american empire creating an american empire the senates razor thin ratification of the treaty of paris with just two votes to spare ignited a strident internal debate over whether the united states should annex or free the philippines.
in the wake of ratification both imperialists and anti imperialists offered competing economic political and racial arguments about the wisdom of colonizing the philippines.
unwilling to leave their fate in the hands of american politicians filipinos revolted against u s forces.
the rebellion soon evolved into a vicious all out war with high casualties on both sides.
the debate over colonies countries the league asked.
instead of economic gains anti imperialists foresaw decades of expenses to maintain colonial outposts.
debate also centered on the ability of the filipinos to govern themselves.
on the imperialist side mckinley adopted a strong paternalistic stance arguing that we could not leave them to themselves they were unfit for self government and they would soon have anarchy and misrule worse then spains was caricatures helped imperialists in a risky strategic move that divided democrats party leader william jennings bryan had urged anti imperialist democratic senators to support ratification of the treaty of paris so that the united states could grant the philippines independence once spain relinquished control.
but after the senate had ratified the treaty the majority of republicans fought to keep the philippines as a colony.
maps in the popular press helped americans visualize the strategic and commercial importance of the nations new island possessions.
the map of the china seas under the national flags 1898 19 6 published in harpers weekly portrayed key parts of the imperialist argument for building an american empire in east asia.
by showing the proximity of the philippines to european colonial possessions in east asia the map reinforced mckinleys claim that another european power would colonize the islands if the united states withdrew.
the map also illustrated the imperialist slogan trade follows the flag the closeness of the philippines to china for example underscored the usefulness of the colony for developing a strong trading relationship between the united states and china.
a competing economic argument came from the anti imperialist league an organization that attracted a broad cross section of politicians progressive reformers writers industrialists and labor activists who opposed overseas colonial expansion.

publicize their case incorporating popularly accepted notions of americans racial and moral superiority to so called uncivilized peoples.
this political cartoon 19 7 contained strong racial undertones depicting uncle sam as a nurturing white father who protects the wailing savage filipino child from independence pictured as a depraved mammylike figure and from anti imperialists like senator george hoar a republican from massachusetts.
most filipinos had converted to catholicism under three centuries of spanish rule a religion that many americans distrusted.
besides spreading anglosaxon cultural and political values mckinley called upon americans to take control of filipinos spiritual lives by turning them into protestants.
how did white americans racial views influence the debate over colonizing the philippines.
anti imperialists viewed the question of governing the filipinos differently.
they claimed that subjugating the philippines to imperial rule violated the principles of representative government outlined in the constitution.
their slogan the constitution follows the flag conveyed their belief that congress could not withhold constitutional rights including the right to self government from colonial subjects.
in the 1900 1904 insular cases the supreme court affirmed congresss authority to govern the philippines hawaii and puerto rico as colonies.
the court upheld the acquisition of colonies as constitutional and ruled that colonial populations did not become american citizens until the united states incorporated the colonies as territories.
the justices offered a more mixed response on the question of extending constitutional rights to colonial subjects.
in these cases the court denied colonial subjects some constitutional protections such as procedural rights that guaranteed a fair trial but held that congress could not abridge the natural rights of free speech and religion.
recognition of these limited rights did not appease anti imperialists however.
yes as near as i can make out the constitution follows the flag but doesnt quite catch up with it quipped secretary of war elihu root.
in 1900 congress granted inhabitants of hawaii and alaska american citizenship making them eligible for full protection under the bill of rights.
puerto ricans had to wait until 1917 and residents of guam until 1952.
filipinos never held american citizenship.
this 1899 editorial cartoon 19 8 by louis dalrymple school begins.
uncle sam to his new class in civilization encapsulated the debate between imperialists and anti imperialists over whether the united states needed the consent of colonized peoples to govern them.
appearing in puck a magazine that specialized in political satire the cartoon portrays uncle sam as an annoyed teacher pointing sternly at frightened black pupils representing the philippines hawaii puerto rico and cuba.
getting ready to teach from a book entitled u s first lessons in self government the teacher tells the students that they have to learn these lessons read the document platform for the american anti imperialist league 1899 creating an american empire 19 8 school begins.
uncle sam to his new class in civilization before the spanishamerican war images in the popular press depicted cuba as a virginal white woman see images as history atrocity stories and public opinion p 567 to arouse americans sympathies.
afterward editorial cartoons consistently portrayed cuba as a black child in need of instruction to justify ruling cuba as a protectorate.
whether you want to or not he then urges them to take a look at the class ahead of you and remember that in a little while you will feel as glad to be here as they are does he mean the studious white students studying from books bearing the names of recently added states like california and nevada.

the satirical signs on the wall trumpet the imperialist emphasis on precedents in this case the willingness of britain and the union to govern colonies and the former confederacy respectively without their consent.
the debate between imperialists and anti imperialists is explored further in competing visions annexing the philippines page 576.
in 1899 the british poet rudyard kipling entered the american debate over colonizing the philippines when the popular magazine mcclures published his poem the white mans burden the united states and the philippine islands kipling pictured americans embracing the white mans burden the anglo saxon quest to better the lives of so called racially inferior peoples by spreading western economic cultural and spiritual values and institutions.
black newspapers offered a competing vision publishing an array of poems and editorials that detailed the black mans burden of living in a country that accepted jim crow practices in the south.
the philippineamerican war on june 12 1898 the filipino leader emilio aguinaldo declared the philippines independent of spain.
in january 1899 he formed a provisional government that concentrated power in the hands of elites from the main island of luzon to rule the ethnically and religiously diverse societies that inhabited the archipelago.

chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 competing visions annexing the philippines debate over annexing the philippines did not follow party lines as revealed in the differing views of two leading republicans carl schurz a former secretary of the interior and senator from missouri and senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts.
schurz and lodge both evoked the nations previous expansionist drives to strengthen their arguments offering historical analogies between the nations prior success acquiring and absorbing new territories and the present dilemma over the philippines.
did annexing the philippines represent a continuation or break with past expansionist methods and policies.
in this 1899 anti annexation speech carl schurz argued that the past offered no guide to the present crisis.
in 1900 senator henry cabot lodge saw strong continuities between the past and present in urging for annexation of the philippines.
has not the career of the republic almost from its very beginning been one of territorial expansion.
has it not acquired louisiana florida texas the vast countries that came to us through the mexican war and alaska and has it not digested them well.
if the republic could digest the old why not the new.
what is the difference.
it has been stated over and over again that we have done great wrong in taking these islands without the consent of the governed from which according to american principles all just government derives its powers.
the consent of the governed.
it is a fair phrase and runs trippingly upon the tongue but i have observed a great lack of definite meaning in those who use it most what do we mean by the consent of the governed we quote it from the declaration of independence.
what did jefferson mean by the phrase.
the declaration of independence was the announcement of the existence of a new revolutionary government upon american soil.
upon whose consent did it rest.
was it upon that of all the people of the colonies duly expressed.
most assuredly not.
in the first place we must throw out all negroes and persons of african descent who formed about one quarter of the population and who were not consulted at all as to the proposed change of government.
were women included in the word governed they certainly were not permitted by voice or vote to express an opinion on this momentous question.
they must therefore be excluded.
did the revolutionary government rest on the consent of all the white males in the colonies.
most assuredly not.
there was the usual age limitation everywhere the suffrage was limited generally by property qualifications sometimes by other restrictions under the guidance of thomas jefferson we took louisiana without the consent of the governed and ruled it without their consent so long as we saw fit.
who is there to day who will stand up and say that thomas jefferson did not do well and rightly when he bought louisiana.
then came the mexican war and by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo we received a great cession of territory from mexico including all the california coast there were many mexicans living within the ceded territory.
we never asked their consent.
all the former acquisitions were on this continent and excepting alaska contiguous to our borders.
they were situated not in tropical but in the temperate zone where democratic institutions thrive and where our people could migrate in mass.
they were but very thinly peopled in fact without any population that would have been in the way of new settlements.
they could be organized as territories in the usual manner with the expectation that they would presently come into the union as self governing states with populations substantially homogeneous to our own.
they did not require a material increase of our army and navy either for their subjection to our rule or for their defense against any probable foreign attack provoked by their being in our possession.
did schurz and lodge interpret history correctly in their arguments.

emilio aguinaldo was not so fortunate.
in march 1901 a prisoner revealed the location of aguinaldos hideaway 50 miles into the jungle.
to capture aguinaldo general frederick funston assembled a group of macabebe scouts a philippine ethnic group that had traditionally served spain and now aided the united states.
posing as reinforcements the macabebe soldiers entered aguinaldos camp accompanied by five american soldiers pretending to be prisoners.
the group arrived as a birthday celebration for aguinaldo was underway and when the infiltrators reached for their weapons aguinaldos guards assumed they were preparing to fire an honor salute.
instead the macabebe scouts began shooting the signal for the rest of funstons men who were waiting on the perimeter to invade the camp.
aguinaldos guards fled in panic leaving him in the hands of the americans.

when the war ended he expanded efforts to build roads and schools and improve sanitation.
taft also convinced congress to purchase church held land from the vatican which the colonial administration then helped peasants buy with low cost mortgages.
to put the debate over annexing the philippines to rest the government sponsored exhibits at the 1904 st louis worlds fair that championed the imperialist vision of colonization.
in the philippine reservation display visitors walked through six reconstructed filipino villages and watched partially clothed members of remote filipino tribes demonstrate native practices that included feasts of dog and headhunting.
by inviting tribes with the most exotic customs to participate organizers intended to juxtapose the primitiveness of filipino culture with the civilizing influence of u s rule.
photographs captured the u s sponsored effort to provide illiterate nearly naked filipinos with a western education.

other displays at the worlds fair championed americas scientific economic and cultural achievements.
collectively these exhibits suggested that as a leading nation in the civilized world the united states had the duty and right to become a colonial power.

america and east asia america and east asia the united states fought a war of conquest in the philippines to secure an independent trade route to east asia only to discover that the coveted china market was in danger of disappearing.
to prevent the worlds leading powers from carving china up into formal colonies the united states turned to diplomacy convincing these nations to keep chinese trade open to all.
americans also viewed their nations role in negotiating an end to the russo japanese war in 1905 as a sign of americas growing world stature.
not all international conflicts in this period originated outside the united states however.
in 1907 president roosevelt used diplomacy to smooth over the crisis that arose in japanese american relations when california initiated a campaign to segregate and ban japanese immigrants.

when thousands of boxers began roaming the countryside attacking foreigners an international force of ground troops and battleships assembled to crush the insurgency.
tensions escalated dramatically when the boxers besieged foreign diplomats and businessmen in beijing called peking by westerners.
throughout the crisis secretary hay worked frantically to prevent the involved nations from using the boxer rebellion as an excuse to colonize china.
in a second round of open door notes hay asked the same nations that had accepted the first open door notes to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of china.
to avoid negative responses hay did not ask for a formal reply to his request.
to further protect american missionary and economic interests in china pictured in 19 10 mckinley sent 2 500 u s soldiers to join a duties on foreign goods and let chinese officials collect customs fees thereby recognizing chinas continued political control.
by january 1900 hay reported that all nations with a sphere of influence in china had agreed to abide by these terms.

the russojapanese war of 1904 1905 threatened to topple the balance of power that the united states was trying to maintain in china.
concerned that an overwhelming japanese victory may possibly mean a struggle between them and us in the future president roosevelt offered to negotiate a peace settlement.
in august 1905 a financially exhausted japan and a militarily defeated russia came to the peace table in portsmouth new hampshire.
many americans delighted at the sight of their president mediating a conflict between two world powers.
in 1906 roosevelt received the nobel peace prize for his role in ending the russo japanese war.
but roosevelt soon faced the possibility of losing the japanese friendship he had worked so hard to protect.
in 1905 california legislators newspapers and labor leaders mounted a strident campaign to halt japanese immigration.
japanese and korean exclusion leagues urged congress to follow the precedent of the 1882 chinese exclusion act and prohibit asians from entering the nation.
these groups denounced asians as a degenerative element that threatened american culture and unfairly competed for jobs that rightfully belonged to native born white workers.
california legislators lumped all asians together when they spoke about defending the nation from the yellow peril but roosevelt understood the vast difference between a weak humiliated china and a powerful proud japan.
if we show that we regard the japanese as an inferior and alien race and try to treat them as we have treated the chinese and if at the same time we fail to keep our navy at the highest point of efficiency and size then we shall invite disaster roosevelt wrote privately.
in 1906 the san francisco board of education decided to send japanese chinese and korean children to one set of segregated schools.
with japan bristling at the insult of americans lumping japanese together with asian peoples whom they viewed as inferior to themselves roosevelt intervened to control the damage to u s japanese relations.
california agreed to revoke the segregation order in return for an end to japanese immigration but hawaiian sugar planters protested that they needed japanese workers.
as a compromise roosevelt issued an executive order that allowed japanese workers into hawaii.
the president then negotiated a reduction in japanese immigration to the mainland.
in the gentlemens agreement 1907 1908 japan agreed to deny passports to japanese workers intending to immigrate to the united states.
this informal agreement helped japan escape the indignity of joining china as the only other nation legally banned from sending immigrant workers to the united states.
angel island in the gentlemens agreement japan reserved the right to issue passports to professionals and the relatives of japanese migrants or citizens already living in the united states.
until the united states closed this loophole in 1921 japan gave passports to japanese wives so they could join their husbands in the united states.
americans called these women picture brides because couples often exchanged photos of each other through a matchmaker who arranged long distance marriages for japanese men residing in the united states.
the 300 500 japanese picture brides who immigrated annually to the united states met their new husbands for the first time when they arrived.
chinese immigration also surged during this period.
the 1906 earthquake in san francisco destroyed the citys birth records and without any way to prove otherwise hundreds of chinese men successfully claimed that they were american born.
as citizens they asserted their right to bring their families to the united states.
many brought in paper sons boys whose families paid a fee to chinese men already in the united states to fraudulently claim to be their fathers.
in 1910 u s authorities opened up an immigration processing station on angel island in san francisco bay to verify the identities of japanese and chinese immigrants claiming the right to enter the united states.
chinese paper sons endured long periods of detention on angel island while authorities investigated their background.
before leaving china paper sons memorized details about their fathers including descriptions of relatives houses and key events in a familys history.
once these men arrived how did domestic racial prejudices affect diplomatic relations with japan.
chapter 19 19 11 japanese picture brides to rally public support for cutting off the flow of japanese women coming to the united states a delegation of congressmen posed for the cameras as they confronted these shy pretty japanese picture brides whose ethnicity made them unwelcome.
imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 at angel island inspectors quizzed sons and fathers separately and refused entry to those whose answers failed to match.
chinese men detained on angel island sometimes passed the time by etching poetry onto the barrack walls including one anonymous poet who expressed his angst by writing who was to know two streams of tears would flow upon arriving here in 1919 california politicians reignited their campaign against the japanese making it illegal for japanese immigrants to own property.
naturalization laws allowed only people of white or african ancestry to become citizens preventing japanese immigrants from seeking u s citizenship to circumvent these restrictions.
in takao ozawa v united states 1922 the supreme court held that japanese immigrants were indeed ineligible for citizenship because they were not white.
choices and consequences the legal construction of whiteness explores this decision.
the fact that japanese picture what insights does this photo offer into issues of ethnicity and gender in the early twentieth century.
brides bore children who were u s citizens and therefore eligible to own property did not escape the notice of those campaigning for a ban on japanese property ownership.
senator james d phelan a california democrat led the campaign to stop admitting picture brides to the united states ominously predicting that a booming birthrate among japanese immigrants would lead to japanese dominance of california agriculture.
to garner publicity for their anti japanese crusade a congressional delegation traveled to angel island in 1920.
the legislators invited news photographers to take photos 19 11 as they sternly lectured a group of bewildered frightened young women dressed in their best clothes to meet their new husbands.
fearful that rising anti japanese prejudice might lead to a japanese exclusion law japan agreed to stop issuing passports to picture brides in 1921.
congress banned all immigration from asia in 1924 see chapter 21.
america and east asia choices and consequences the legal construction of whiteness takao ozawa was a japanese immigrant who lived in california and hawaii for 28 years before he applied to become a citizen of the united states.
aware that naturalization laws allowed only caucasians and people of african ancestry to become citizens ozawa argued that he was white.
he emphasized his complete assimilation into american society and the lightness of his skin.
when the supreme court heard his case in 1922 the justices faced four options about how to define whiteness choices differing physical features divided the human species into white black and yellow races.
skin color established racial identity.
whiteness was a socially constructed notion with no scientific basis.
assimilating into american culture made one white decision the court rejected ozawas contention that skin pigmentation signified whiteness and his claim of complete assimilation.
in a unanimous decision the justices ruled that the words white person are synonymous with the words a person of caucasian race this decision accepted contemporary anthropologists assertions that measurements of facial features provided scientific evidence to classify the japanese as members of the mongolian race consequences measurement of the head and face 1883 within three months the court unanimously reversed its reasoning deciding instead that whiteness was a socially not scientifically constructed category.
when indian immigrant bhagat singh thind applied for citizenship he argued that anthropologists categorized asian indians as caucasians.
in rejecting thinds claim of whiteness the supreme court now ruled that the words free white persons are words of common speech to be interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the common man deciding who was legally white now depended on the whims of the larger culture not the claims of scientists.
continuing controversies what determines racial identity.
well into the twentieth century many americans continued to believe that biologically based racial differences existed even within the caucasian race.
in the 1920s the united states severely curtailed immigration from eastern and southern europe viewing northern europeans as racially superior see chapter 21.
the fear that light skinned blacks were passing as whites caused many southern states to bar individuals with any african ancestry the so called one drop of blood rule from using whites only facilities.
the view of racial identity as a social construct also drew adherents.
radical black civil rights leaders tried to cultivate a racial identity based on african americans cultural distinctiveness while others sought a color blind society that did away with racial identities completely.
what different methods have americans used to define racial identity.
chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 in americas backyard establishing a u s presence and maintaining favorable relations in east asia became key aims of american foreign policy at the turn of the century.
americans also however explored opportunities to expand closer to home.
the government focused on constructing a canal through central america to facilitate u s trade with china and better protect the nations coastlines.
earlier transportation breakthroughs such as the erie canal national road and transcontinental railroad quickened the movement of people and goods and helped the united states expand across the continent.
the panama canal secured u s dominance of the caribbean and the government resolved to keep foreign powers out of the region.
the panama canal at the end of the nineteenth century american canal advocates emphasized increased trade and better defense as reasons for building the panama canal a manmade waterway through panama completed in 1914 to link the pacific and atlantic oceans.
the canal project received a boost when one of its strongest supporters theodore roosevelt became president in 1901.
roosevelt took up the canal project immediately.
no single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the american people he told congress the first time he addressed the legislators.
roosevelt intended to take up where ferdinand de lesseps the french mastermind who built the 1869 suez canal in egypt that linked the mediterranean and red seas had left off.
in the 1880s de lesseps had begun building a canal through panama then part of colombia.
battling mudslides earthquakes and disease de lesseps eventually abandoned the project and sold his concession from the colombian government to the new panama canal company a french company headed by philippe bunau varilla a longtime engineer on the project.
in 1902 the united states offered the new panama canal company 40 million for its concession and assets a sum that bunau varilla eagerly accepted.
colombia however rejected roosevelts offer of 10 million to secure the rights to maintain a u s controlled canal in panama indefinitely.
the new panama canal companys concession expired in 1904 and by stalling colombia expected to pocket the 40 million earmarked for the company.
those contemptible little creatures in bogot the capital of colombia ought to understand how much they are jeopardizing things and imperiling their how did u s intervention in panama compare with its colonization of the philippines.
own future roosevelt wrote in frustration to secretary of state john hay.
in 1903 panama revolted against colombia.
the timing was not coincidental.
fearing it would lose everything the new panama canal company encouraged and financed the rebellion by panamanian business and political elites who did not want to share revenue from the projected canal with the rest of colombia.
bunau varilla not only set the date for the revolution but also provided its leader manuel guerrero amador with money defense plans a declaration of independence and even a flag.
roosevelt never gave bunau varilla a direct promise of u s support but the president later recalled it was bunau varillas business to find out what he thought our government would do.
in fact he would have been a very dull man had he been unable to make such a guess once the panamanian revolt began roosevelt ensured that events favored the united states.
the mountainous terrain separating the rest of colombia from panama forced colombian troops to move by sea.
when they arrived u s naval ships patrolling both coasts prevented them from landing in panama.
roosevelt claimed that an 1846 agreement with colombia gave the united states the authority to control transit across panama.
the nineteenth century pact however envisioned using u s forces to protect not destroy colombian sovereignty in panama.
in the 1920s congress apologetically sent colombia 25 million for roosevelts transgression.
with americas help the revolution in panama succeeded.
the united states immediately received its reward from bunau varilla the new minister to the united states for the republic of panama.
the hay bunau varilla treaty 1903 gave the united states perpetual control over a strip of land ten miles wide that included the panama canal for 10 million and in americas backyard 19 12 building the panama canal the americans used a system of locks and dams to construct the waterway through a mountainous terrain subject to flooding and mudslides.
an annual rent of 250 000.
these terms remained in effect until december 31 1999 when the united states turned control of the canal over to panama.
when american engineers took over building the panama canal in 1904 they confronted a host of geological challenges.
the chagres river crisscrossed the route selected for the canal.
tropical rains regularly poured down the mountains into the chagres which if not diverted would dump floodwaters and silt into the planned canal.
by damming the chagres u s engineers created the artificial gatun lake that ships reached through a stairway of locks on either side.
this approach used water rather than shovels to create much of the waterway.
the accompanying map 19 12 shows the 164 square miles of rain forest that construction crews flooded to create gatun lake.
the 5 000 american engineers skilled workers and foremen at the construction site relied on thousands of foreign workers mostly blacks from the british west indies to dig the rest of the canal.
president roosevelt shared the publics fascination with the feat of building the canal and visited the site in 1906.
his two week trip made roosevelt the first american president to leave the country while in office.
not content merely to watch the huge steam shovels through the window of the train bringing him to the culebra cut the projects largest excavation site roosevelt tramped through the mud to reach a steam shovel and climbed into the drivers seat.
as photographers snapped away roosevelt learned that the bucyrus steam shovel picked up eight tons of dirt in a single scoop required a crew of ten and dug five times more than older machines.
it is an epic feat and one of immense significance president roosevelt after visiting the panama canal construction site how did u s engineers overcome the geological obstacles to building the panama canal.
chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 you had to pray everyday for god to carry you safe and bring you back a black worker on felling giant trees and surviving mudslides while building the panama canal this photo of roosevelt sitting at the controls of a bucyrus steam shovel 19 13 captured the adventurous spirit of an era dedicated to overseas economic expansion technological innovation and world prominence.
the real builder of the panama canal was theodore roosevelt wrote major george w goethals chief engineer on the project.
americans usually 19 13 theodore roosevelt visits the canal zone instead of observing construction of the panama canal from a safe distance roosevelt climbed into the seat of a steam shovel to work its controls.
what does this photograph convey about roosevelt and the feat of building the panama canal.
saw photos of their formally dressed presidents standing on podiums sitting at desks or posing with dignitaries.
in this photograph roosevelt appears as the larger than life personality he was literally building the canal he played such a large part in securing for the united states.
americans solved more than the engineering riddle of constructing the canal.
they also conquered the disease carrying mosquito.
guided by the recent discovery that mosquitoes transmitted malaria and yellow fever dr william c gorgas undertook a relentless fumigation campaign that saved thousands in americas backyard of lives.
nonetheless poor sanitation in the black workers camps which roosevelt criticized during his visit and the dangers posed by mudslides and working with dynamite exacted a toll.
nearly 4 500 foreign black workers and 500 white americans died during the american phase of construction.
the roosevelt corollary the panama canal was a symbol of u s technological achievement naval power and economic strength.
the canal also increased the importance of the caribbean to u s national security.
americas interests in this hemisphere are greater than those of any european power roosevelt stated.
therefore the united states intended to police and protect the canal alone.
roosevelt had reason to worry about european naval incursions into the region.
anxious about overdue debts britain italy and germany blockaded venezuela in 1902 and two years later european nations threatened to intervene in the dominican republic for the same reason.
to head off a european invasion the dominicans asked roosevelt to accept the nation as a protectorate.
roosevelt privately remarked he had about the same desire to annex it as a gorged boa constrictor might have to swallow a porcupine wrong end to he nonetheless agreed to help but only after deciding to use the incident to establish a new principle in u s foreign policy.
to prevent european military incursions into the western hemisphere roosevelt announced a corollary to the 1823 monroe doctrine see chapter 7 which had declared the western hemisphere off limits to further european colonization.
the roosevelt corollary of 1904 stated that when confronted with flagrant cases of wrongdoing by latin american nations such as not paying their debts to western nations the united states intended to act as an international police power in the region.
view the image his foresight 1901 19 14 theodore roosevelts big stick in this cartoon illustrating the impact of the roosevelt corollary the president pulls a line of naval vessels around the caribbean to keep nearby nations in line and prevent the creation of european colonies too close to u s shores.
in this political cartoon 19 14 a gigantic roosevelt dressed as a rough rider holds a big stick as he pulls u s ships labeled sheriff and debt collector around the caribbean.
americans dubbed the roosevelt corollary the big stick policy in reference to a west african proverb that roosevelt favored speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far the corollary exempted argentina brazil and chile because roosevelt considered them civilized nations capable of meeting their international commitments and running their own domestic affairs.
satisfied that the united states would help europe recoup its loans to central and south american nations european governments reacted positively to the roosevelt corollary.
how did the roosevelt corollary bolster u s stature as a world power.
chapter 19 imperial america the united states in the world 1890 1914 roosevelts successor in the white house william howard taft expanded u s influence over latin america.
not content with ensuring that caribbean nations paid their debts taft initiated a policy of dollar diplomacy that encouraged u s investment in latin america to maintain u s economic dominance over the region.
hoping to substitute dollars for bullets taft shared roosevelts desire to turn the caribbean into an american lake.
in tafts formulation enlarging americas commercial presence required the establishment of american banks english language news bureaus and trained foreign service personnel in latin american countries.
these would provide u s businesses with the credit information and active government support that they needed to penetrate the region.
when democrat woodrow wilson became president in 1912 he followed in roosevelt and tafts footsteps by aggressively protecting u s business interests and curtailing european access to the western hemisphere.
the map american involvement in latin america 1898 1939 19 15 lists the many u s military incursions that occurred in areas where american businessmen had invested heavily in fruit and sugar industries.
like his predecessors wilson denied any intention of seeking one additional foot of territory by conquest he acknowledged that u s intervention protected americas national security and commercial interests but also asserted that the nations main goal was to spread democracy and law and order.

during this period u s troops invaded mexico guatemala honduras nicaragua haiti the dominican republic and cuba for strategic commercial and humanitarian reasons.
american armies often stayed for years and in 1915 haiti joined cuba the dominican republic and panama as a u s protectorate.
by creating protectorates rather than colonies the government avoided re igniting the divisive arguments between imperialists and anti imperialists that had surrounded the decision to annex the philippines.
military intervention also allowed the united states to control all direct approaches to the panama canal and to protect access to raw materials and markets for u s exports 19 16.

on march 25 1911 a fire engulfed the top floors of the building that housed the factory in new york citys lower east side.
as bundles fell to the street onlookers below assumed that workers were throwing their best cloth out the window to save it.
they soon realized their mistake.
female workers were jumping by twos and threes to escape the flames.
in the end 146 women and men perished.
the memories of this horrific scene never left 18 year old victor gatto who stood on the corner and watched as women plunged directly onto the pavement.
in 1944 gatto a self taught artist painted triangle fire march 25 1911.
his painting depicted a woman plunging to her death past unprepared firefighters atop ladders too short to reach the victims above.
on the ground indifferent police officers stand near the neat row of shroud covered corpses that lined the sidewalk.
by the time gatto provided this visual indictment of the governments inability to protect workers americans expectations of their government had radically changed.
this new vision took hold during the progressive era partially in response to events like the triangle shirtwaist factory fire.
in gattos painting the immense stone buildings tower above the lifeless workers the artists way of representing the complete domination of big business over labor at the beginning of the twentieth century.
on the day of the fire employers had locked the workshop doors from the outside to prevent the women from stealing materials or leaving early.
with the doors bolted and flimsy fire escapes collapsing under the weight of fleeing workers the windows offered the only means of escape for the rest.
to many progressive era reformers the triangle shirtwaist factory fire illustrated the tragic consequences of capitalist exploitation and the governments lack of interest in the plight of workers.
middle class activists championed an array of reforms that envisioned using local state and federal governments to protect americans from the greed and indifference of big business.
their agenda aroused considerable criticism but progressives aided by three reform minded presidents theodore roosevelt william howard taft and woodrow wilson found enough common ground to construct cross class alliances that sought to end exploitive business practices and class conflict.
progressive led coalitions also tackled pressing political and social issues.
from the mid1890s to the mid 1900s progressives transformed the role of government in american society and laid the foundation for the liberal reform movements of the twentieth century.
we have reached the point in our history when we realize that the nation has tremendous social economic and industrial problems theodore roosevelt 1912 chapter 18 creating a democratic paradise the progressive era 1895 1915 the progressive impulse the tide of reforms that swept across america at the turn of the twentieth century had its roots in a range of middle class concerns.
middle class dismay over the dismal living and laboring conditions for most workingclass people turned to alarm as strikes and the appeal of socialism increased.
the progressives had unprecedented success building alliances that transcended class and political party affiliation winning the support of three consecutive presidents.
dramatically reshaping the nation within a decade the progressive vision of an activist government that used regulation to safeguard the public challenged the prevailing laissez faire notion that the government should not interfere with market forces.
began to dominate the economy.

tragedies like the triangle shirtwaist factory fire brought these diverse female factions together even winning support from appalled upper class women.
in the wake of the fire this cross class female coalition focused on bolstering city safety regulations but only the labor activists emphasized the need for unions to end employer exploitation.
one particularly effective cross class female alliance lobbied for legislation to ensure that mothers had clean disease free milk for their children.
these women succeeded in their quest for local laws that prevented distributors from using chalk to make dirty milk appear white.
they successfully rallied for mandatory pasteurization to kill germs and for milk to be transported in refrigerated containers.
femaleled reform campaigns also injected new energy into the suffrage movement.
children need pure milk and good food good schools and playgrounds sanitary homes and safe streets a female trade union activist on why women needed the vote many middle class female progressive reformers and working class labor organizers became convinced that without the right to vote women lacked an essential tool they needed to keep themselves and their families safe.
the national woman suffrage association nwsa achieved notable successes between 1910 and 1917 winning the right to vote in washington california arizona kansas oregon and new york.
defeats in other states however convinced the nwsa to seek a constitutional amendment guaranteeing all women the right to vote a campaign that succeeded in 1920 see chapter 20.
in a general sense the progressives wanted to turn america into a middle class paradise where economic security education health and civility flourished.
the tradition of christian charity also helped shape the progressive agenda.
in the 1880s protestant ministers like josiah strong began preaching the social gospel the religious belief that christians had a responsibility to create an ethically sound and morally upright society.
the settlement house movement begun in the spirit of christian charity became the incubator for strategies how did the progressive vision take shape.
progressives developed to attain these goals.
as they confronted the problems of the poor at hull house a settlement house in a chicago immigrant neighborhood jane addams and florence kelley articulated the middle class values that would form the cornerstone of the progressive ethos.
foremost among these was an emphasis on how the environment as well as individual traits shaped the lives of the poor.
progressives argued that poor living and working environments created many of the social problems troubling the nation.
exhibiting a typical progressive faith in the scientific method addams and kelley compiled a statistical portrait of disease over crowding and crime in their chicago neighborhood that helped hull house devise solutions to these problems.
improving sanitation and garbage collection creating playgrounds for children eliminating saloons limiting the hours spent at work reducing workplace accidents these were all ways to improve the environment in working class neighborhoods so that individuals could flourish.
personal responsibility also remained a bedrock principle for addams and kelley.
while offering more respect for immigrant cultures than many past reformers addams and kelley still believed strongly in teaching immigrants the importance of thrift temperance and self discipline lifestyle changes that some immigrants resisted.
finally progressives embraced a new vision of governmental power one that americans from many different walks of life challenged.
their notion that governmental regulation should protect workers and curtail the excesses of big business put them at odds with industrialists and unions.
industrialists embraced the laissez faire ethos that they had the right to control their businesses as they saw fit without government interference.
unions also viewed potential government intervention with unease mindful that during labor conflicts the government usually sided with industrialists.
labor leaders preferred using collective action including strikes to win concessions from industrialists.
to socialists who wanted to nationalize all major industries the progressive emphasis on regulation was too timid.
essentially the progressives sought the middle ground between these competing views.
they wanted to establish a balance that avoided the excesses of unfettered laissez faire economics unending class conflict or complete government control of the economy.

what to do about big business aroused considerable debate within progressive circles.
progressives held competing visions of whether to regulate dismantle or accept the trusts making it hard to rally public opinion around one clear solution.
presidents roosevelt taft and wilson devised differing regulatory and antitrust strategies to reform business practices and openly disagreed on how to tackle the problem.
curtailing big businesss access to the nations environmental riches also provoked debate.
did business have the right to fully exploit the countrys forests and water or should these resources be preserved.
roosevelts trust busting roosevelt enthusiastically supported turning the government into a steward of the public welfare while serving as new york city police commissioner from 1895 to 1897 roosevelt had become friendly with pioneering photojournalist jacob riis see chapter 17.
the midnight trips that riis and i took to the tenements roosevelt later acknowledged showed him what overcrowding means some hot summer night roosevelts feats during the 1898 spanish american war made him a national hero catapulting him into winning the new york governorship.
in 1900 president william mckinley selected roosevelt as his running mate for his successful reelection bid.
on september 5 1901 anarchist leon czolgosz shot mckinley with a pistol wrapped in a handkerchief while the president was shaking hands at the pan american exposition in buffalo new york.
when mckinley died eight days later the 42 year old roosevelt became the youngest president in american history.
a robust man who appeared to be in perpetual motion dictating letters lecturing visitors playing tennis or having pillow fights with his younger children in the white house roosevelt captured the publics affection.
when teddy roosevelt saved a bear cub during a 1902 hunting expedition a toymaker felt inspired to name a new childrens toy after him and so the teddy bear was born.
like many progressives roosevelt believed that the country stood at a crossroads either reform or face the end of democracy.
he established his credentials as a progressive reformer and won public approval by mediating the 1902 coal strike and filing suit against the northern securities and standard oil trusts.
on may 12 1902 140 000 northeastern pennsylvanian miners walked off their jobs.
they demanded an eight hour day a 20 percent wage increase and recognition of their united mine workers umw union.
the mine owners refused to negotiate.
the public be damned appears to be their motto decried one illinois newspaper as coal shortages forced factories to close and the poor began cooking food with oil soaked asbestos.
president roosevelt viewed the miners predicament sympathetically.
i strongly favor labor unions he declared.
if i were a wage worker in a big city i should certainly join one fearing widespread suffering and urban riots roosevelt threatened to use troops to take over the mines unless the owners agreed to let a government commission fashion an agreement.
for the first time a president had stood up publicly against big business winning him accolades in union circles.
the resulting resolution reduced miners hours from ten to nine and awarded them a 10 percent pay hike without forcing the owners to recognize the union.
i wish the capitalists would see the president privately remarked that the government ordered compromise is really in the interest of property for it will save it from the danger of revolution roosevelt also joined the progressive campaign to remove the stranglehold that some trusts had on parts of the economy.
in 1902 journalist ida tarbell began publishing a multipart series the history of the standard oil company in mcclures magazine a popular and influential middle class news periodical.
in her scathing critique tarbell detailed the illicit deals that john d rockefeller had made with railroad companies to build his oil trust.
secret rebate view the image teddy roosevelt as jack the giant killer 1904 why did roosevelts personality and behavior captivate the public.
chapter 18 creating a democratic paradise the progressive era 1895 1915 agreements meant that rockefeller paid considerably less than his competitors to ship oil.
many could not even get the railroads which feared incurring rockefellers wrath to transport their oil.
tarbell had firsthand experience with rockefellers cut throat practices they had bankrupted her fathers oil business.
she was convinced that rockefellers tactics would drive other small producers out of business leaving a handful of industrialists in control of the economy.
the titans of industry offered a competing vision.
there was nothing wonderful about economic competition rockefeller contended.
destructive pricecutting drove down wages over production created depressions and duplication of services wasted valuable resources.
rockefeller defended his railroad agreements as beneficial to all concerned.
standard oil got lower rates while the railroads received guaranteed freight.
preventing too much oil from flooding the market stabilized prices and kept men in all oil related industries profitably employed.
the richest man in america also disputed claims that trusts made economic advancement impossible for average americans noting that he needed intelligent and skilled men to run his subsidiaries.
president roosevelt agreed with much of rockefellers assessment.
the corporation has come to stay he conceded acknowledging that the nation benefited from the economies of scale that good trusts offered.
nonetheless roosevelt maintained the government needed to break up bad trusts when consolidation threatened the public interest.
the president soon singled out the northern securities trust for dissolution earning a reputation for trust busting by taking steps to break up the monopoly.
in 1901 the financier j p morgan had joined with two other powerful trust builders james j hill and e h harriman to form the northern securities trust.
the new transportation conglomerate meant that you can ride from england to china on regular lines of steamships and railroads without once passing from the protecting hollow of mr morgans hand announced journalist ray stannard baker.
with his eye on the 1904 presidential election roosevelt filed an antitrust suit charging the northern securities trust with violating the 1890 sherman anti trust act.
a shocked morgan rushed to the white house to broker a deal with the president.
if we have done anything wrong send your man to my man and they can fix it up suggested morgan an offer for a backroom deal that roosevelt refused.
in 1904 the supreme court upheld a justice what competing visions did roosevelt the supreme court and leading industrialists offer on the trust issue.
department order to dissolve the northern securities trust into independent railroad companies earning roosevelt public acclaim.
after roosevelt easily defeated the lackluster democrat alton b parker to win reelection in 1904 one newspaper called him the most popular man that has come into public life within recent times standard oil was next.
in 1906 the justice department filed suit claiming that the trust had violated the sherman antitrust act.
this political cartoon 18 3 depicts standard oil as a frenzied octopus that has consumed the entire oil industry.
tentacles grasp overweight steel and copper businessmen in suits on one side and steamboats on the other symbolizing how standard oils control of the supply and price of oil strangled transportation and manufacturing industries.
in the caricature state legislatures and congress have succumbed to the monsters strength and a leg now reaches for the white house.
when the supreme court finally ordered standard oil to dissolve in 1911 the justices avoided a blanket ruling that all trusts were illegal.
the court instead invoked a rule of reason stating that only unreasonable restraints of interstate trade violated the law.
the courts ruling aptly described expresident roosevelts own trust busting philosophy.
roosevelt launched highly visible assaults on the northern securities and standard oil trusts.
he did nothing however when morgan bought andrew carnegies steel empire in 1901 to create u s steel a trust that employed nearly one million workers.
roosevelt balanced trust busting with regulation to ensure that big business behaved responsibly.
he strengthened the interstate commerce commission icc created in 1887 to address western farmers criticism of high railroad freight rates and rebates see chapter 17.
by 1900 supreme court rulings read the document louis brandeis from other peoples money and how bankers use it 1913 reining in big business had essentially stripped the icc of real authority.
during his second administration roosevelt reinstated the power of the icc to regulate railroad monopolies convincing a reluctant congress to pass the 1906 hepburn act.
four years later the mann elkins act further bolstered the rate setting powers of the icc and put the telegraph and telephone communication industries under its purview as well.
taft and wilson competing progressive visions having promised not to run again for president in 1908 roosevelt helped his secretary of war william howard taft secure the republican nomination.
view the image john d rockefeller cartoon 1901 roosevelt believed that taft would continue his efforts to create a stronger regulatory federal government.
the democrats countered by nominating the fiery william jennings bryan for a third time see chapter 17 trying to siphon progressive votes away from a tepid taft.
roosevelts tireless campaigning for his chosen successor undercut bryans claim that he was the only real progressive in the race.
the republican campaign slogan vote for taft now you can vote for bryan anytime reminded voters of bryans two previous attempts to win the presidency and portrayed him as a perennial loser.
taft won easily handing bryan his worst electoral defeat.
once taft became president important philosophical differences between roosevelt and taft emerged.

chapter 18 18 4 1912 presidential election results strong third party challenges from the progressive party and socialists split the national vote four ways but democrat wilson prevailed to win the presidency in 1912.
creating a democratic paradise the progressive era 1895 1915 republican party that controlled congress.
roosevelt had sided with the progressive faction while taft gravitated to the conservatives.
unlike roosevelt taft viewed the president as an executor of law and protector of existing social institutions not someone who spearheaded new reforms.
a stickler for the law taft proved less willing than roosevelt to make any distinction between good and bad trusts filing more antitrust cases over four years than roosevelt had in eight.
tafts decision to file charges against u s steel enraged roosevelt who saw it as a personal attack on his earlier choice to leave this good trust alone.
unhappy with his successor roosevelt decided to run for president again in 1912.
when roosevelts bid for the 1912 republican nomination failed the party renominated the incumbent taft republican progressives bolted and formed the short lived progressive bull moose party which nominated roosevelt as their presidential candidate.
the split in republican ranks offered the democrats an opportunity to capture the presidency for the first time since the election of 1892.
they nominated new jersey governor woodrow wilson a virginia born politician with progressive ideals.
in contrast to the divided republican party wilsons candidacy kept the southern base happy and prevented progressively inclined northern democrats from joining the progressive party.

7 5 taft roosevelt and wilson supported different degrees of federal activism competing views that gave voters a clear choice in the election of 1912.
taft was willing to zealously enforce existing progressive reforms but had no intention of initiating new ones.
roosevelt embraced a governing philosophy that he called new nationalism a vision that emphasized increased federal regulation and widespread political reform.
in contrast to roosevelt who wanted to regulate but not destroy big business wilsons new freedom promised to restore a competitive marketplace where small businessmen and farmers thrived.
the 1912 slate also included socialist party candidate eugene v debs a railway trade union leader who had become a socialist after being jailed during the pullman strike of 1894 see chapter 17.
formed in 1905 the socialists had won numerous local elections and grown to over 100 000 dues paying members.
roosevelt taft and wilson believed that with regulations in place although each favored different amounts of regulation capitalism would operate more fairly.
debs offered a competing view.
he proposed transferring ownership of existing railroad oil and steel trusts to the government to ensure fair prices and wages.
government run monopolies would be the first step toward ending the free market system altogether.
most voters agreed that the time had come to reform how the economy operated but they overwhelmingly chose progressivism over socialism.
wilson won the presidency in 1912 18 4 by a landslide in the electoral college while receiving only 41 9 percent of the popular vote.
roosevelt came in second with 27 4 percent of the popular vote followed by tafts 23 2 percent.
over 900 000 americans 6 percent of the electorate voted for debs.
nearly 70 percent of those who voted cast their ballots for wilson or roosevelt a resounding public endorsement of progressive principles and reforms.
once he entered the white house president woodrow wilson went beyond trust busting to weaken monopolies.
he accepted the democratic orthodoxy of cutting the tariff so foreign businesses could market lower priced goods in the united states thereby creating a more competitive marketplace where smaller businesses could thrive.
by 1913 most industrialists had dropped their longstanding opposition to lowering the tariff.
the heads of singer sewing machines eastman kodak and u s steel believed that other nations would reciprocate allowing american captains of industry to conquer foreign markets as well.
wilson offset the lost tariff reining in big business revenue which the government needed to fund its operations with the first federal income taxes now constitutional thanks to the newly ratified sixteenth amendment 1913.
only people making more than 4 000 a year paid federal income taxes less than one percent of the population at a time when many workers felt lucky to make 1 000 a year.
wilson also tried to help small businesses by improving the flow of credit.
most small and big businessmen agreed with wilson that the time had come to reform the countrys chaotic banking system.
they vividly remembered the panic of 1907 when financial giant j p morgan had used his own funds and those of other bankers to shore up the national banking system.
the nations 7 000 banks operated with complete independence issuing all forms of currency some backed by gold and silver others backed by government bonds.
no centralized authority existed to expand or contract the currency supply as the economy demanded or to move money around the country to stave off panics.
conflicting visions soon arose over whether private financiers or the government should control the nations financial institutions.
southern and western populists wanted a federally run banking system that would destroy the wall street money trust eastern bankers likened government oversight to socialism.
after much debate congress passed the federal reserve act 1913 creating a federally run federal reserve to serve as a bankers bank that held a portion of bank funds in reserve to help member banks in time of crisis.
the federal reserve also set rates for business loans and issued a new national paper currency.
wilson beefed up federal regulation of trusts as well.
in 1914 the clayton anti trust act prohibited interlocking directories the practice of setting up shadow companies that appeared to compete but were actually run by the same board of directors.
the law exempted trade unions from prosecution under the 1890 sherman anti trust act eliminating a tactic that businessmen had used to undercut the labor movement.
the federal trade commission 1914 had the power to order companies to cease unfair trading practices although its decisions were subject to court review.
forests water and minerals provoked another set of competing visions within progressive circles.
in 1867 john muir suffered an eye injury that caused temporary blindness while working as a mechanic.
after his eyes healed muir walked 1 000 miles from indianapolis indiana to the gulf of mexico to rejuvenate his spirit.
like muir roosevelt had turned to the revitalizing power of nature while recovering from personal tragedy when he retreated to his north dakota ranch in 1884 after both his mother and 22 year old first wife died on the same day in their new york city home.
in 1903 president roosevelt went camping with muir in yosemite an area of the california sierra nevada mountains filled with spectacular waterfalls massive rock formations and giant sequoia trees nearly 200 feet high and 3 000 years old.
a photo of the pair on glacier point 18 5 before yosemite falls the largest waterfall in north america commemorated the trip.
the two men dominate the frame suggesting the power they had to decide the fate of such national treasures.
this moment of unity was fleeting.
despite their mutual love of unspoiled forests muir and roosevelt became formidable opponents who embraced different environmental visions.
muir was a preservationist who championed preserving nature in its unspoiled state as a refuge for a tired nerve shaken over civilized people he accused businessmen of ravaging forests polluting water and destroying meadows with little regard for the long term social costs of ruining the environment.
muirs condemnation resonated well with members of the middle class who wanted to escape the 18 5 president roosevelt and john muir in yosemite 1903 despite their camaraderie during a camping trip roosevelt and muir embraced competing environmental visions.
preservation versus conservation roosevelt taft and wilson prescribed differing amounts of regulation and federal activism to rein in the trusts.
businesss access to the nations view the map interactive map resources and conflict in the west how did wilsons economic vision and policies differ from those pursued by the roosevelt and taft administrations.
chapter 18 18 6 chief and his staff 1904 this image of crow warriors riding away into the mist captured the prevailing sentiment that indian cultures were on the verge of disappearing.
creating a democratic paradise the progressive era 1895 1915 stress of urban life with holidays in the pristine wilderness.
his influential writings led to the 1890 establishment of yosemite as a national park and the creation in 1892 of the sierra club an environmental group dedicated to preserving wilderness.
muirs antibusiness message fit well with the progressive determination to put the social good ahead of individual self interest.
roosevelt agreed that a few unscrupulous entrepreneurs should not unfairly consume what belonged to the entire nation.
to this end roosevelt created 5 national parks 18 national monuments and bird reserves that placed millions of acres off limits to development.
the president parted company with muir however by choosing to regulate not ban public access to other federally controlled lands waterways and mineral deposits.
roosevelt embraced a conservationist vision that tried to balance two goals meeting present economic needs and conserving natural resources for future generations.
when the u s forestry service director gifford pinchot allowed timber companies to harvest trees in designated areas the new regulations enraged both preservationists who wanted all economic development to cease and western businessmen who demanded unfettered access to federally controlled forests.
taft was sympathetic to western complaints that roosevelt had overstepped his authority.
when how did americans disagree about the environment during the progressive era.
taft fired pinchot in 1910 roosevelt and his progressive followers took it as a sign that taft had abandoned conservation deepening the split between the two former colleagues.
environmentalists expressed great admiration for native americans ecologically friendly farming and hunting practices fueling mainstream curiosity about indian cultures at the turn of the century.
in 1900 photographer edward curtis began a 30 year multivolume ethnographic project entitled the north american indian which recorded images of 80 different indian civilizations.
many indians willingly participated in curtiss photography project proud of the beautiful portraits he took of them in their best festive dress.
curtis wanted to capture the variety and richness of native american cultures before they completely disappeared.
considering himself a friend to the indian curtis believed like most of his generation that to survive native americans needed to assimilate into mainstream american society.
curtis often photographed groups of indians riding off into the distance 18 6 to symbolically convey the notion that as curtis wrote the indians as a race already shorn in their tribal strength and stripped of their primitive dress are passing into the darkness of an unknown future neither preservationists nor conservationists had any interest in reversing official policies of forced assimilation that divided collective reservation lands into individual farms banned native languages and sent indian children to white run boarding schools see chapter 15.
preservationists inadvertently hastened the demise of some indian cultures by enticing americans to visit national forests.
tourism undercut indians access to traditional hunting grounds so that their economic survival increasingly depended on selling crafts to tourists and charging them to see performances of native dances.
view the closer look images as history envisioning a vanishing race competing views on transforming the workplace competing views on transforming the workplace in 1900 the united states earned the questionable distinction of being one of the most strike torn nations in the world.
to end class conflict and introduce more social harmony progressives wanted to transform the workplace into an environment where workers labored a reasonable number of hours in safe conditions for decent wages.
industry and labor each presented a competing view that challenged the progressive vision as they sought the upper hand in their decadeslong class struggle.
capitalist visions of industrial harmony industrialists differed on how to rid the workplace of labor conflicts that interfered with the smooth operation of their businesses.
the national civic federation brought together moderate industrialists and labor union leaders dedicated to seeking industrial peace through compromise.
ohio senator mark hanna who made his fortune in coal argued that industrialists should turn labor into the ally of the capitalist rather than a foe in return for a few minimal concessions factory owners could demand that union leaders discipline their membership and keep workers on the job thus ending the constant strife that permeated the industrial sector.
hannas voice was a decided minority.
most industrialists refused to compromise their authority.
staunchly antiunion they employed a host of methods to undercut unions.
if forced to accept a union they insisted upon an open shop that let workers choose whether to join a union then used intimidation to stop workers from enrolling.
industrialists hired private security forces to spy on workers fired identified union members and put them on blacklists that prevented union members from getting another job.
during strikes factory owners expelled families from company owned housing and hired substitute workers called scabs to replace striking workers.
to protect union members from these discriminatory industrialist policies and build strength labor organizers fought to establish a closed shop which required all workers in the same company to join the union.
other industrialists embraced benevolence to dissuade workers from organizing.
welfare capitalism the notion of using benefits to gain workers loyalty aimed to improve worker morale and weaken interest in unions.
some large firms instituted free medical care pensions kindergartens and even baseball leagues but these services typically evaporated at the first sign of economic downturn.
unions did not want to leave it up to the employer to decide whether to offer benefits.
they preferred using collective bargaining to negotiate a contractual agreement between workers and their employers that established such benefits as a permanent right.
the drive for efficiency a goal that many progressives shared was another way that industrialists undercut workers collective power.
henry fords innovations in automobile manufacturing demonstrated how industrialists could boost profits by reducing manufacturing costs.
the son of a prosperous irish immigrant farmer in dearborn michigan ford built his first car in 1896 in a shed behind his detroit home.
forming the ford motor company ford introduced the model t in 1908 a moment when 515 separate companies were manufacturing automobiles.
ford standardized parts and constantly improved machinery innovations that let him produce more cars for less money.
ford passed these savings on to consumers lowering the price of his car for the great multitudes from 825 in 1908 to 345 in 1916.
by then ford had captured half the market for new cars.
in 1914 ford created headlines by offering male factory workers a five dollar daily wage for nine hours of work extended to female and male office employees two years later.
ford paid twice the standard wage rate because he recognized that the common practice of paying workers subsistence wages limited the markets for many consumer goods.
ford wanted his workers to be able to afford his automobiles.
working nine instead of ten hours a day ford reasoned reduced fatigue induced mistakes and worker what different methods did industrialists use to end labor conflict.

the assembly line also deadened the mind as constant routine movements eliminated the need for decision making.
turnover giving the company a loyal and experienced workforce.
the moving conveyor belt in fords assembly lines 18 7 meant that workers no longer had to lift or move the chassis as they assembled a car.
ford admitted that he could not do the same thing day in and out but he condescendingly believed that the average worker wants a job in which he does not have to think to keep workers focused and productive ford prohibited sitting talking singing or whistling in his factories.
fearful of losing their jobs workers only dared to criticize fords iron control over the production process in private.
how much did fords innovations and paternalism benefit workers.
fords five dollar nine hour day came with strings attached.
ford instituted many reforms that progressives sought because they made business sense but he staunchly resisted government regulation and attempts to organize a union retaining the right to make his own factory rules.
ford also firmly subscribed to industrialists long standing belief that they had the right and the duty to interfere in the private lives of their employees.
for ford this meant offering benefits only to employees who met certain moral criteria.
married men for instance had to live with their families.
thirty investigators working for fords sociological department visited workers homes and sometimes imposed other requirements such as mandatory english classes for immigrants.
gambling excessive drinking or having sexual relations with a prostitute were all grounds for dismissal.
a ford motor company investigator had to verify that a male worker was morally upright and not trying to organize a union before he and his family could move into a spacious two story home built by the company.
read the document frederick winslow taylor a piece rate system from the principles of scientific management 1911 competing views on transforming the workplace progressives valued efficiency and expertise and frederick winslow taylor took the drive for efficiency further than ford by popularizing scientific management the effort to use scientific knowledge to maximize output and profit.
taylor used stopwatches to evaluate how long each part of the manufacturing process should take.
he then outlined the steps laborers should replicate to lay bricks without any wasted energy and determined the perfect shovel size and the exact amount of rest workers needed to lift the maximum amount of pig iron each day.
after establishing the optimal time and method for a specific task taylor argued industrialists could then fine or fire unproductive workers who failed to maintain an acceptable pace.
taylor admitted that his system dubbed taylorism intentionally eliminated workers independence and creativity.
each man he asserted must grow accustomed to receiving and obeying directions covering details large and small which in the past have been left to his individual judgment working class labor activism the working class had long fashioned its own solutions to surviving difficult living and working conditions.
fraternal associations assisted those who lost their jobs or needed to bury a loved one while urban political machines see chapter 17 secured voters loyalty by helping families endure personal tragedies such as fires or illness.
meanwhile unions tried to negotiate better wages and shop floor rules for dues paying members but organizing the working class so it could speak with one voice proved impossible.
ethnic and racial prejudices kept the working class fragmented.
italian strikebreakers for instance had few qualms about walking across a picket line manned by slavic strikers.
the craftbased american federation of labor afl led by samuel gompers organized only skilled mostly white workers refusing to let unskilled laborers women or blacks into its unions.
only a handful of industrial unions like the umw and international longshoremans union adopted a big umbrella approach that organized all workers in one industry into the same union.
middle class progressives supported many union goals but deplored their methods.
strikes continually disrupted normal life by shutting down railroad lines street cars and coal mines.
read the document profiles samuel gompers government regulation they maintained would improve workers lives and ensure that the economy functioned smoothly.
nevertheless many unions remained skeptical about relying on the government to solve their conflicts.
the afl preferred using its collective economic power to force industrialists to negotiate.
its members had unhappy memories of what happened when state or federal officials intervened in labor conflicts as during the 1894 pullman strike.
the roosevelt administration occasionally chose to aid labor but progressive era courts nearly always favored industrialists.
in 1908 the supreme court stopped workers from launching sympathy strikes or boycotts to support fellow workers labeling them restraints of trade barred under the 1890 sherman anti trust act a law originally intended to curtail the creation of business monopolies.
another 1908 decision allowed employers to fire workers who joined unions.
reducing government interference in labor conflicts therefore remained the afls primary goal.
radical trade unionists rejected the afl vision of working within the free market system.
the industrial workers of the world iww formed in 1905 envisioned one big union that welcomed all workers regardless of sex race ethnicity or skill which would one day take over all means of production in the united states.
it is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism declared the founders of the iww whose members were nicknamed wobblies the founding group included 75 year old mother mary jones a tireless white haired organizer for the umw and william d big bill haywood an organizer for the western federation of miners.
their drive to abolish private property and formal government struck many progressives as anarchy.
government harassment of the iww limited its formal membership to around 10 000.
the progressives limited progress employers had traditionally held employees responsible for workplace accidents maintaining that workers knowingly accepted all job associated risks.
carelessness caused most mishaps they argued.
progressive organizations undertook detailed sociological studies to refute these self serving generalizations.
lewis hines photographic investigation into the lives of injured pittsburgh workers what conflicting visions divided working class union activists.
chapter 18 18 8 an injured pittsburgh worker portraits of maimed workers helped generate a groundswell of support for state workers compensation laws.
creating a democratic paradise the progressive era 1895 1915 suggested that few were responsible for their accidents.
this young man 18 8 had his leg crushed when he fell under a coal car in a pittsburgh coal mine.
the company paid the hospital expenses for his amputation but nothing else.
in the image a nicely dressed passerby avoids making eye contact with the injured boy who stands idle on the street suggesting that the well off preferred to ignore the plight of disabled workers.
the boys tidy appearance reveals an effort to maintain personal dignity while relying on private charity to survive.
studies like hines convinced many states to establish worker compensation programs that provided employer funded disability payments and medical care to injured workers.
as a result employers began paying more attention to workplace safety.
the drive to limit hours for male workers was less successful.
employers had traditionally maintained that as property owners they had the sole power to decide the terms of employment.
in the 1874 slaughter house cases the supreme court had ruled that a state could not deny individuals control over their own labor.
industrialists claimed that this decision granted individual workers the constitutionally protected right to negotiate wages hours and workplace rules.
according to this line of reasoning state laws or unions that tried to impose restrictions on individual workers violated their right to control their own labor.
how effective were the different strategies that progressives and unions employed to reform the workplace.
the supreme court however proved willing to abridge this right to protect public health and safety.
in 1898 the court upheld an eight hour day for utah miners deciding that guarding the health of workers engaged in a dangerous occupation served the public interest.
progressives failed in their efforts to extend these protections to the entire workforce.
in lochner v new york 1905 the court ruled that unless long work hours directly jeopardized workers health the government could not abridge an employees freedom to negotiate his own work schedule with his employer.
this decision is explored more fully in choices and consequences regulating workers hours.
miserable and unsafe working conditions also persisted.
the colorado mining town of ludlow sat along the purgatory river a telling name that suitably described what working in a mine was like.
in ludlow the rockefeller owned mining company paid miners 2 a day in company issued currency called scrip redeemable only in the company run store.
the mining company required that workers live in company owned housing and claimed no responsibility for accidents that killed 200 miners between 1904 and 1914.
in 1913 12 000 miners mostly italian greek and serbian immigrants went on strike to protest these conditions and demand company recognition of their umw union.
when the company expelled the strikers and their families from their homes the workers erected tent cities in the nearby hills.
after armed company detectives failed to dislodge the miners the colorado governor sent in state troops whose wages rockefeller agreed to pay.
the ludlow massacre ensued on april 20 1914 when troops set fire to one striking miners camp and thirteen women and children suffocated to death in a shallow underground shelter where they had sought refuge.
throughout the nation outraged laborers temporarily put their ideological divisions aside to stage protest marches in every major city.
the umw issued a call to arms and hundreds of neighboring miners flooded into ludlow to defend their comrades against the state militia.
faced with the prospect of all out class war the governor requested federal troops and president wilson immediately complied.
federal intervention left the union in tatters and rockefeller free to run his mining town as he saw fit.
incidents like these convinced many unions that the progressive proposal to rely solely on the government to solve their problems was not the answer.
throughout the twentieth century union folklore and songs used the memory of ludlow to inspire workers to organize.

bakers worked long hours in hot poorly ventilated kitchens sleeping and washing where they baked bread.
in 1895 new york state passed a law that set sanitary standards and limited bakers to ten hours of work per day 60 hours per week.
joseph lochner a bakery owner in utica challenged the law after new york fined him 50 for making an employee exceed these limits.
the supreme court faced three choices when it heard the case in 1905.
choices a state could use its police powers to protect workers health and safety.
a state could not limit an individuals right to buy or sell labor in nonhazardous occupations such as baking.
states had the right to enact any laws not expressly forbidden by the constitution to promote the general well being of society.
decision the court ruled 5 to 4 that the fourteenth amendment which declared that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of the law prevented states from using their police powers to regulate work that did not imperil the health or safety of the public.
consequences the decision curtailed progressives attempt to use regulation to transform the workplace.

washingtons apparent willingness to accept social segregation as long as blacks and whites worked together toward their common economic goals won him a large white following.
roosevelt even invited him to dine in the white house the first african american to ever receive this honor an invitation that provoked howls of protest throughout the south.
washingtons private behavior however was often at odds with his public persona.
publicly he reassured whites that most blacks had little interest in demanding equality as long as they could prosper economically.
privately washington helped fund court challenges to plessy v ferguson and sent his own children to northern white colleges.
washington believed that american race relations would gradually improve.
methodist bishop henry mcneal turner offered a competing vision telling blacks to immigrate to africa.
black journalist ida b wells barnett also disagreed with washington.
rather than striving to prove their economic worth to whites wells barnett urged african americans to use boycotts to win equal treatment from white owned railroads.
she also advocated armed resistance to lynch mobs.
a winchester rifle should have a place of honour in every black home and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give she declared.
wells barnett began lobbying for a federal anti lynching law after a white mob in memphis tennessee lynched three friends of hers who had opened a grocery store that drew customers away from white businesses.
with her life threatened wells barnett moved to chicago where she worked with jane addams to prevent the segregation of city public schools and continued her anti lynching campaign.
the most powerful challenge to washingtons vision came from the northern born sociologist w e b.
du bois the first african american to attend harvard university.
du bois argued that individuals should receive the education that best suited them regardless of their race.
he emphasized that the african american community needed an educated elite of professionals and teachers the so called talented tenth economic progress was not possible without the right to vote du bois contended pointing out that discriminatory laws made it difficult for black sharecroppers or craftsmen to get ahead.
competing visions seeking racial uplift offers more detail on the debate between washington and du bois.
in 1909 du bois joined with wells barnett and jane addams among others to establish the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp.
this interracial civil rights organization demanded an immediate end to racial discrimination beginning a decades long struggle for racial justice that would eventually overturn jim crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s.
few white progressives followed addamss lead in denouncing racial discrimination.
most northern progressives remained content to let the south handle the race problem as it saw fit.
they essentially chose social peace over racial justice asserting that segregation would quell racial conflict.

in this passage from his 1895 atlanta exposition address washington outlines his plan for racial progress and peaceful race relations.
in this excerpt from his book the souls of black folk 1903 du bois explains why washingtons ideas would not work.
our greatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of our hands and fail to keep in mind that we shall prosper in proportion as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life.
no race can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.
it is at the bottom of life we must begin and not at the top.
in all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.
nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load upward or they will pull against you the load downward.
we shall constitute one third and more of the ignorance and crime of the south or one third its intelligence and progress.
the wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing.
no race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized.
it is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercises of these privileges.
the opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera house.
mr washington distinctly asks that black people give up at least for the present three things first political power second insistence on civil rights third higher education of negro youth and concentrate all their energies on industrial education the accumulation of wealth and the conciliation of the south is it possible and probable that nine millions of men can make effective progress in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights made a servile caste and allowed only the most meager chance for developing their exceptional men.
if history and reason give any distinct answer to these questions it is an emphatic no.
and mr washington thus faces the triple paradox of his career.
he is striving nobly to make negro artisans business men and property owners but it is utterly impossible under modern competitive methods for workingmen and property owners to defend their rights and exist without the right of suffrage.
he insists on thrift and self respect but at the same time counsels a silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to sap the manhood of any race in the long run.
he advocates common school and industrial training and depreciates institutions of higher learning but neither the negro common elementary schools nor tuskegee itself could remain open a day were it not for teachers trained in negro colleges or trained by their graduates.
his doctrine has tended to make the whites north and south shift the burden of the negro problem to the negros shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators when in fact the burden belongs to the nation.

at 6 00 a m on december 7 admiral chuichi nagumo launched two consecutive waves of bombers torpedo planes and dive bombers.
as japanese pilots approached pearl harbor a naval station on oahu they saw american warships parked in a neat row.
moments later those battleships cruisers and destroyers were engulfed in flames.
it took the government nearly a year to release photos like the one here of american ships under attack.
before pearl harbor debate raged in the united states over how to respond to the growing threat of war in the pacific and germanys conquest of europe.
noninterventionists and interventionists offered competing visions of how to protect americas vital interests in a world torn apart by war.
the japanese assault on pearl harbor ended this debate.
questions instead arose over why the united states had given the japanese such an inviting target.
hoping to pressure japan into withdrawing from china president franklin d roosevelt had sent the u s pacific fleet to hawaii.
there he believed the battleships were far enough away from japan to escape attack but close enough to convince japan to end its expansionist drive into east asia.
roosevelt erred on both counts.
instead japan resolved to drive the western powers the united states britain the netherlands and france out of east asia.
in their attack on pearl harbor the japanese sank or damaged 18 ships and killed 2 405 americans.
congress declared war on japan the day after the attack.
on december 11 germany and italy declared war on the united states and germanys allies romania bulgaria and hungary quickly followed suit.
the united states now faced the challenge of fighting resolute and capable enemies in europe and the pacific against whom victory was not certain.
the attack on pearl harbor silenced debate about whether america needed to fight but were all the changes the war caused in american society positive ones.
world war ii thrust the united states into a new position of global leadership.
mobilizing the nations resources to fight also created vast economic and social changes at home.
the united states eventually prevailed against its enemies but the cost of victory was high on the battlefield and on the home front.
yesterday december 7 1941 a date which will live in infamy the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of japan president franklin d roosevelt chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 the approaching war from 1939 to 1945 war engulfed nearly the entire globe as shown on the map 23 1.
huge areas fell under german and japanese control naval battles occurred on vast stretches of sea and colonies provided key materials needed by warring nations.
until 1941 however the united states remained on the sidelines as germany attacked continuously in europe and japan launched steady invasions in east asia.
as long as the fighting remained far from their shores americans disagreed over whether these wars were theirs to fight.
still coping with the social and financial problems created by the great depression non interventionists urged the nation to put america first and stay out of overseas conflicts.
by the late 1930s however interventionists increasingly challenged this view arguing that only direct engagement could prevent the world conflagration from reaching american shores.

the approaching war war i.
senator gerald p nye a republican from north dakota chaired a series of senate investigations in the mid 1930s into the role that american arms manufacturers had played in the nations decision to enter world war i.
although the investigations unearthed little hard evidence of a conspiracy they did reinforce the consensus that the united states had entered that war to continue profitable arms sales and to guarantee that the allies the powers who had fought germany repaid their war loans to private banks.
when these european countries defaulted on their loans during the depression public sentiment hardened against helping foreign nations.
to ensure that trading with belligerent nations did not drag the country into another war congress passed the neutrality acts from 1935 to 1939 which restricted arms sales loans and transport of goods with nations at war see u s countdown to war timeline 23 2.
these popular laws encapsulated the widespread non interventionist vision of avoiding involvement in overseas conflicts that did not directly threaten u s territory.
depending on the official policy pursued the atlantic and pacific oceans could serve as buffers protecting the nation or as pathways to war.
trying to ensure the former the 1935 neutrality act prohibited the sales of arms and ammunition to nations at war.
in 1936 congress barred all loans to warring nations.
the 1937 neutrality act allowed belligerent nations to purchase non war related goods if they paid cash for them and transported them on their own ships a policy known as cash and carry fdr challenged the non interventionist vision with his 1937 quarantine speech which urged peace loving countries to isolate aggressor nations and seek peace.
outraged non interventionists accused him of trying to turn the united states into the worlds policeman.
its a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead and find no one there the president remarked to an aide before he publicly reaffirmed his support for the neutrality acts.
non interventionist sentiment peaked in 1938 when congress debated but did not approve a constitutional amendment that required a national referendum for any declaration of war except in response to an enemy invasion.
the united states was not alone in its desire to remain at peace.
eager to avoid war with germany britain and france recalled how a relatively minor incident the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand had become the catalyst for war in 1914 see chapter 20.
instead of mobilizing their armies when germany violated the versailles treaty by rearming and threatening its neighbors france and britain tried to negotiate.
in 1938 germany annexed austria and then demanded the sudetenland a german speaking province made part of czechoslovakia against its will by the allies when the austro hungarian empire collapsed at the end of world war i.
by the 1930s many europeans felt that the versailles peace treaty had punished germany too severely creating the widespread impression that hitlers actions and demands were reasonable.
taking hitler at his word that he was interested only in reuniting german speaking peoples into one nation britain and france agreed at the munich conference in 1938 to let germany occupy the sudetenland.
instead of dampening hitlers ambitions the munich conference convinced him that the western democracies were too weak to oppose him militarily.
arguing that germany needed living space in the east for its people hitler initiated his master plan to displace what he demeaningly called the inferior slavic races the peoples living in eastern europe and to exterminate the jews.
intent on avoiding the mistakes of world war i when germany had fought a two front war hitler resolved to fight one war at a time.
to accomplish this in august 1939 he signed a non aggression pact with josef stalin the dictator of the soviet union ussr.

germany and italy declare war on the united states what different lessons did america and other world powers draw from world war i.
chapter 23 23 3 hitler in paris hitlers quick subjugation of western europe brought him to paris by june 1940.
he posed in front of the citys most recognizable monument the eiffel tower to underscore frances defeat and his own power.
world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 secretly agreed to partition poland and other parts of eastern europe and the ussr offered hitler supplies for his pending attack on france and britain.
the non aggression pact ensured that germanys eastern border remained peaceful when it attacked western europe and the balkans.
only days after signing the pact hitler invaded poland on september 1 bringing a declaration of war from britain and france.
world war ii had officially begun.
in april 1940 hitler began his massive assault on western europe by invading norway and denmark.
he then marched through luxembourg holland and belgium to invade france in may.
unlike in 1914 when germanys broad attack against french lines ended in a trench stalemate in 1940 germanys blitzkrieg lightning war punched holes in the french defense system and then sent tanks infantry artillery and aircraft through these openings to disrupt communications and threaten the french army from the rear.
when german troops entered paris on june 14 hitler underscored his triumph by visiting the eiffel tower.
in this photograph 23 3 hitler is posing before the landmark transforming a banal tourist excursion into an act that by symbolizing his control of western europe carried sinister and tragic overtones.
with france under nazi domination italy entered the war on the side of germany.
through a combination of alliances and force the axis those nations fighting on the german side quickly took control of the rest of eastern europe and the balkans.
as german troops were rolling toward paris the british army had escaped capture by evacuating its forces from the french port of dunkirk.
for a full year britain fought germany alone surviving a massive bombing campaign known as the battle of britain.
that changed in june 1941 however when hitler invaded the ussr.
frustrated in his efforts to subdue britain hitler decided that with british forces off the continent it was time to conquer russia.
until this point hitler had fought and won a series of isolated wars but he made his first major strategic error when he invaded the soviet union.
instead of advancing quickly to moscow german troops how did hitler rapidly conquer western and eastern europe.
found themselves bogged down by the late autumn in a massive campaign along an eastern front that stretched for thousands of miles from the baltic to the black seas.
the arsenal of democracy as these events developed in europe both president franklin d roosevelt and most of the american people opposed entering the war.
publicly embracing non interventionist measures during his first two terms roosevelt adopted an officially neutral stance as the war spread.
unlike wilson in world war i however fdr did not ask americans to remain impartial in thought.
immigration restrictions had limited the number of first generation immigrants from europe and roosevelt had few concerns that well assimilated americans of german ancestry might retain strong loyalties to germany.
indeed public opinion polls in 1939 revealed that nearly 84 percent of americans supported the allies the powers fighting germany with only two percent expressing pro german views.
despite fdrs public declaration of neutrality in private the interventionist argument that inaction would invite catastrophe increasingly influenced his thinking.
for the time being roosevelt tried to satisfy both non interventionists and interventionists by finding a way to defeat hitler without actually declaring war.
our national policy is not directed toward war roosevelt assured americans.
its sole purpose is to keep war away from our country and our people to help britain and france without risking the direct involvement that non interventionists opposed the neutrality act of 1939 revised the cash and carry policy to include munitions as well as non war related goods.
breaking with the self imposed two term limit set by george washington and respected by every other subsequent president roosevelt made the unprecedented decision to run for a consecutive third term in 1940.
fdr who typically kept even his closest advisers guessing before he reached an important decision surprised everyone even his wife with his the approaching war i t is a matter of most vital concern to us that european and asiatic war makers should not gain control of the oceans which lead to this hemisphere president franklin d roosevelt radio fireside chat december 29 1940 announcement.
he never explained his decision but the shock of france falling to nazi control undoubtedly influenced him to run again.
fdrs candidacy and his selection of a liberal new dealer henry wallace as his vice president caused grumbling among conservative democrats who nonetheless rallied around him in the general election.
the republican challenger wendell willkie and roosevelt each argued that the nation should offer all the help it could to the allies short of entering the war.
willkie tried to paint roosevelt as bent on direct intervention but this charge and willkies anti new deal rhetoric resonated poorly with voters.
roosevelt easily won a third term.
fdr saw his task as satisfying the wish of 70 of americans to keep out of the war and the wish of 70 of americans to do everything to break hitler even if it means war to accommodate the publics conflicting emotions roosevelt proposed turning the nation into a great arsenal of democracy by telephone and telegraph british prime minister winston churchill pressed fdr continually for aid.
stressing americas vulnerability churchill warned that overwhelming sea power would be in hitlers hands if germany defeated britain threatening americas well being.
fdr responded as churchill hoped.
besides selling britain arms fdr agreed to trade 50 old american destroyers for 99 year leases on seven british air and naval bases in the western hemisphere.
britain needed these ships to transport weapons overseas.
fdr also supported a peacetime draft and invited a leading interventionist republican henry stimson to become secretary of war.
by 1941 britain had run out of cash and neutrality laws still prohibited the united states from loaning the british the money they needed to buy munitions.
fdr circumvented these restrictions with a policy called lend lease that loaned rather than sold arms to britain.
the united states would say to england we will give the guns and ships that you need provided that when the war is over you will return to us in kind the guns and ships that we have loaned you roosevelt told secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau.
lend lease fdr explained to the nation was simply one neighbor helping another to put out a fire.
no one would say fdr noted neighbor my garden hose cost me 15 you have to pay me 15 for it i dont want 15 i want my garden hose back after the fire is over congress however prohibited the u s navy from escorting british convoys carrying american goods across the atlantic.
fittingly given the analogy that fdr used to explain lendlease one of the first shipments to britain contained boxes of fire hoses.
when hitler attacked the ussr in 1941 the united states extended lend lease aid to the soviets.
fdr had formally recognized the soviet union in 1933 hoping to find another overseas market for american goods.
trade with the soviets remained minimal during the depression but exploded during the war.
by 1945 the united states had provided 50 billion of materiel to the allies under this program.
no one however expected britain and the soviet union to return loaned ammunition or arms to the united states.
instead the law left it up to the president to decide what form repayment would take.
after the war president harry s truman accepted favorable postwar trade relations as repayment from britain and demanded 2 6 billion from the soviet union for nonmilitary lend lease goods.
russia did not pay its debt until after the fall of communism in 1991.
the debate between non interventionists and interventionists intensified throughout 1941.
noninterventionists embraced the slogan america first and urged americans to remember the debt and death wrought by the last war.
as part of this heated exchange dr seuss the alias used by theodore geisel who was to gain fame in the 1950s as the author illustrator of the cat in the hat and other childrens books drew editorial cartoons for pm a short lived left wing new york magazine that denounced non intervention as folly.
dr seuss depicted non interventionists as ostriches with their heads in the ground anti semites and appeasers.
read the document charles lindbergh radio address 1941 how did the competing visions of non interventionists and interventionists influence fdrs rhetoric and actions.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 this seuss cartoon 23 4 shows a non interventionist wearing an america first hat in a bathtub that is jumping with predatory sea creatures adorned with swastikas the symbol of the nazi party.
his eyes closed tight the man ignores the danger saying with a satisfied smile the old family bath tub is plenty safe for me as he moved closer to the interventionist position fdr voiced similar concerns about the vulnerability of the american coastline.
non interventionists challenged this assertion.
water hazards 23 5 appeared in the chicago tribune a staunchly republican newspaper that criticized both the new deal and intervention.
the cartoon ridicules the notion that germany posed a danger to the united states arguing that since hitler the inept golfer had yet to land his forces the golf ball 22 miles across the english channel in britain the united states had nothing to fear.
the false alarms spread by interventionists the hysterical golf caddy hurt the nation by drawing uncle 23 4 dr seuss lampoons non interventionists in 1941 dr seuss lampooned non interventionists for closing their eyes to the threat that hitlers navy depicted here as swastika marked monsters posed to american shores.
23 5 water hazards 1941 this chicago tribune editorial cartoon accuses interventionists of unduly alarming the country about the possibility of a nazi attack.
what competing visions did these two cartoons offer on the threat that hitler posed to the united states.
sams attention away from addressing the nations domestic problems in this case playing his own golf game.
as non interventionists feared and interventionists hoped lend lease opened the door to further u s involvement in the european war.
securing american guns and ammunition solved only half the problem for britain.
because of the number of german submarines patrolling the atlantic secretary of war henry stimson warned sending arms to britain was like pouring water into a leaky bathtub.
when the american destroyer greer exchanged fire with a german submarine fdr used the incident to invoke his authority as commander in chief by ordering u s naval ships to escort all ships headed to britain as far as iceland which the united states also occupied and shoot on sight any german submarine or ship.
although it remained unclear whether the germans knew that the greer was an american ship fdr denounced the skirmish as a deliberate attack in american waters.
we have sought no shooting war with hitler.
we do not seek it now fdr declared in september 1941.
but when you see a rattlesnake poised to strike you do not wait until he has struck before you crush him.
these nazi submarines and raiders are the rattlesnakes of the atlantic three months before japans attack on pearl harbor the united states was fighting an undeclared naval war with germany.
the approaching war war with japan the catalyst for americas formal entry into the war did not come in the atlantic however but on the other side of the globe when japanese pilots attacked pearl harbor a large naval base in hawaii on december 7 1941.
the attackers discovered a neat line of battleships reproduced in this miniature version of pearl harbor 23 6 that japanese filmmakers constructed for a wartime propaganda film that reminded japanese audiences of their nations great victory against the united states.
the attack on pearl harbor was the culmination of two decades of tension and mistrust between the two nations.
japans desire to establish itself as the major power in the pacific alarmed the united states which maintained an array of island possessions and a strong naval presence in the pacific to support its trade with china.
access to chinese markets had been a cornerstone of american foreign policy since the spanishamerican war.
for the japanese claiming east asia as their proper sphere of influence was no different from the united states declaring the western hemisphere off limits to foreign powers through the 1823 monroe doctrine and 1904 roosevelt corollary.
japan aimed to build the greater east asia co prosperity sphere creating satellite states throughout asia that would free japan from dependence on western controlled resources like oil tin and rubber.
in the 1920s the united states and japan mediated their differences with japan agreeing to reduce the size of its navy and renouncing war as an instrument of foreign policy see chapter 21.
the japanese armys 1931 invasion of chinese held manchuria land long disputed by china russia and japan however signaled the beginning of a direct confrontation between japan and the united states.
claiming that manchuria rightfully belonged to japan the japanese army assumed control of all raw materials and industry to support japans military endeavors.
in july 1937 japan attacked china unleashing a brutal war of conquest.
during the infamous rape of nanking a chinese city over 250 000 chinese perished including 20 000 women who were raped tortured and then executed.
soldiers impaled babies on bayonets and tossed them still alive into pots of boiling water a japanese soldier later admitted.
the japanese killed more than six million chinese over the next eight years.
american sympathy for chinese victims and concern over protecting american economic interests in asia coincided with rising tensions in europe.
by 1940 aiding britain had become fdrs foreign policy priority.
containing japan through escalating economic sanctions and warnings fdr reasoned was the best way to defuse the situation in the pacific 23 6 japanese model of pearl harbor this mock up of pearl harbor constructed for a japanese wartime film of the attack showed american battleships lined up in a row making them easy targets for aerial bombs.
how did the united states respond to increasing japanese aggression.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 so the nation could focus on the war in the atlantic and europe.
hoping that a show of force would convince japan to abandon its imperialist ambitions the united states began building ships and stationed the pacific fleet in pearl harbor 2 500 miles from california see 23 1.
roosevelt also sent aid to china and in july 1940 imposed a limited embargo on scrap iron and high octane aviation fuel to japan.
japan was not deterred.
instead of withdrawing from china japan seized parts of french indochina in present day vietnam.
in response on september 26 1940 the united states announced a total embargo on scrap metal shipments to japan.
the following day tokyo signed the tripartite pact with germany and italy an agreement dedicated to the establishment of a new order in east asia and europe.
aimed at offering mutual aid if the united states attacked the pact did not lead to strategic coordination between the european and asian theaters of war.
japan and germany shared mutual enemies during the war but little else.
when japan strengthened its occupation of french indochina in the summer of 1941 the american government froze japanese assets in the united states and stopped oil shipments which accounted for four fifths of japans oil supply.
diplomatic exchanges continued until the eve of the attack on pearl harbor even though japan decided in september to launch an expansionist war into resource rich southeast asia to push the united states the netherlands and britain out of the region.
the japanese calculation that the united states would withdraw from east asia after a devastating attack on pearl harbor proved as faulty as the american belief that sanctions would prevent a war with japan.
the assault on pearl harbor ended all debate over entering the war.
having agonized over how far to pull the country toward war roosevelt reportedly told an aide that the attack took the matter entirely out of his hands because the japanese had made the decision for him despite catching the americans by surprise the japanese victory at pearl harbor was far from complete.
although the attack prevented the united states from interfering with japans subsequent invasion of southeast asia japan failed to destroy americas pacific fleet.
fearing a counterattack nagumo on the day of the attack called off a third air strike on storage tanks containing millions of gallons of fuel oil and on repair facilities.
most american sailors in hawaii survived the attack and the navy eventually repaired six of the eight damaged battleships.
in another stroke of luck the pacific fleets two aircraft carriers were at sea and escaped the attack.
the navy also had eleven battleships and two aircraft carriers stationed elsewhere to defend the nation from further attack.
nonetheless the short term damage was severe.
over the next 24 hours japan attacked american british and dutch territories throughout southeast asia.
while the attack on pearl harbor horrified americans it brought hope to the british.
churchill knew immediately that the united states would soon be in the war against germany.
after pearl harbor die hard non interventionists questioned whether the japanese attack could have been prevented.
charges of dereliction of duty against the commanders of pearl harbor and suspicions that roosevelt had allowed the attack to take place to enter the war against hitler through the back door surfaced.
by early december american commanders expected a japanese attack against american pacific possessions.
most intelligence data however indicated that the japanese would invade the philippines and mainland southeast asia as they subsequently did.
american officials simply overlooked the few bits of information indicating that hawaii was both a possible and a probable first target.
the united states was in the war up to the neck and in to the death.
i went to bed and slept the sleep of the saved and thankful british prime minister winston churchill upon learning of the 1941 japanese attack on pearl harbor how significant was the attack on pearl harbor in the short and long run.
read the document franklin d roosevelt the four freedoms 1941 on the home front on the home front the u s government made the formal declaration of war but winning it required the active participation of the american people.
americans remember world war ii as the good war not only because it ended the depression but also because it united the nation against its enemies.
while unified in the desire to prevail on the battlefield americans embraced conflicting visions that kept ethnic gender race and class divisions intact.
images of the enemy americans had long exhibited disdain for asian immigrants and americans of asian descent.
before the war discriminatory laws targeted asian immigrants and their american born children.
these laws segregated swimming pools and dance halls denied asians the right to own land prohibited intermarriage with whites and prevented asian immigrants from becoming citizens.
the attack on pearl harbor provoked more virulent expressions of hatred for the japanese leading to even greater discrimination.
in the opening days of the war life and time magazines offered the nation a crash course in how to tell a chinese from a jap understanding the difference was crucial life magazine asserted to protect the chinese americans whose homeland is our staunch ally from unwarranted attacks.
as the chinese embassy prepared to hand out identification buttons for chinese immigrants and chinese americans to wear life and time instructed the nation in distinguishing pseudoscientific stereotypical racial characteristics.
life used photos 23 7 to compare the facial features and expressions of a chinese civil servant with those of general hideki tojo the prime minister who ruled japan until 1944.
the magazine called on readers to note tojos heavy beard and cheekbones and humorless expression all supposedly key traits of japanese physiognomy.
time and life were not alone in feeling a sudden need to distinguish members of the yellow race congress lifted the ban on chinese naturalization and granted china an annual quota of 105 immigrants a year.
this act symbolically differentiated the chinese from the japanese banned as immigrants in 1924 and prohibited from becoming naturalized citizens see chapters 19 and 21 but protected the nation from any substantial increase in chinese immigration.
renewed outrage against japan greeted news of atrocities in the pacific war such as the april 1942 23 7 how to tell japs from the chinese lamenting the american tendency to lump all asians together life magazine analyzed the facial features of chinese and japanese men to instruct readers in the difference between the two groups one an ally the other the enemy.
what distinctions did americans now make between the japanese and chinese.
chapter 23 23 8 plant camouflage before and after this aircraft factory in burbank california camouflaged its facility with a painted tarp and cardboard houses to create the facade of a suburban housing development to deceive japanese pilots on the lookout for military targets.
world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 bataan death march.
when american and filipino soldiers finally surrendered their position on the bataan peninsula in the philippines their japanese captors forced the sick starving troops to walk almost 90 miles through the intense heat and jungle to a prisoner of war camp.
out of 70 000 men who began the trek between 5 000 and 11 000 succumbed to illness starvation and beatings from japanese soldiers.
still these horrors were not enough to explain americans deep seated hatred for the japanese.
in europe we felt that our enemies horrible and deadly as they were were still people ernie pyle wrote in one of his newspaper columns toward the end of the war.
but out here i soon gathered that the japanese were looked upon as something subhuman and repulsive the way some people feel about cockroaches or mice as pyle noted general views toward the germans were decidedly different.
remembering the vigilante attacks against german americans in world what do these photos reveal about american fears of a japanese attack.
war i see chapter 20 government propaganda focused on hitler and nazism as the enemy not the german people.
internment camps in the immediate wake of the attack on pearl harbor americans were eager for explanations.
rumors circulated that japanese american farmers on hawaii had plowed arrows in their fields to show japanese pilots the way to military installations.
yet no evidence of internal spying ever surfaced and suggestions that the government round up and quarantine these hawaiian residents went nowhere.
composing one third of hawaiis population people of japanese descent were too important to the local economy to deport and there were no ships available to transport replacement workers to the islands.
the 110 000 japanese and japanese americans who lived in california oregon and washington where they were less vital to the economy met a different fate.
the day after the attack on pearl harbor air raid sirens wailed in san francisco.
then when a japanese submarine torpedoed an american ship off the california coast americans feared that the west coast would soon be under attack.
frenzied officials instituted blackouts coast guard units patrolled the seas.
throughout the war west coast defense factories camouflaged their plants as illustrated in these plant camouflage before and after photos 23 8.
this aircraft factory in burbank california stretched a tarp over its facilities to make it look like suburban housing from the air.
the camouflagers hoped to fool an attacking japanese pilot seeking a more recognizable military target.
within this atmosphere of heightened anxiety many viewed japanese immigrants and japanese americans on the west coast as potential enemy agents.
increasingly the larger public and the government believed that their presence near vital ports and military bases posed a threat to national security.
on february 19 1942 president roosevelt signed executive order 9066 permitting the military to declare certain areas off limits to any or all persons.
general john l dewitt head of the western defense command immediately declared the entire west coast a military zone closed to all persons of japanese ancestry both alien and non alien his order called for the evacuation of anyone of japanese descent even orphanages had to relocate japanese american babies.
in mid march 1942 roosevelt created the war relocation authority to oversee the forced removal read the document japanese relocation order february 19 1942 on the home front of 38 000 japanese immigrants and 72 000 japaneseamerican citizens to internment camps where they were held under armed guard.
posted instructions to all persons of japanese ancestry informed japanese inhabitants that they had only a few days to sell their belongings and settle their affairs.
it is difficult to describe the feeling of despair and humiliation experienced by all of us one internee later said as we watched the caucasians coming to look over our possessions and offering such nominal amounts knowing we had no recourse but to accept whatever they were offering evacuees could take only what they could carry.
with numbers pinned on their coats they rode trains to recently abandoned stables or stockyards to await transport to one of ten internment camps in remote areas of the interior west.
offering a conflicting vision that emphasized their loyalty to the united states most japanese and japanese americans complied quietly with the evacuation order.
a few however registered their protest against this wholesale violation of their civil rights.
for propaganda purposes the office of war information hired photographer dorothea lange to document that the government was treating evacuees humanely as it contained this suspect population.
sympathetic to the plight of japanese americans lange managed to capture this scene 23 9 of a japanese american veteran reporting to a santa anita assembly center in his old military uniform a silent demonstration of his longstanding loyalty to the country.
in january 1943 the army decided to recruit nisei men the american born children of japanese immigrants.
while their parents remained in the camps these men joined with japanese americans from hawaii to form the 442nd regimental combat team which became the most decorated american unit in the nations history.
these men opted to prove their loyalty by fighting for their country in europe.
other japanese americans sought redress in the courts but the supreme court upheld the governments evacuation policy in 1944.
competing visions civil liberties and national security clash page 696 examines this civil liberties controversy in more detail.
as the tide of the war began to turn in americas favor the justification for interning people of japanese descent weakened.
in 1945 the government let inmates return to the west coast.
in 1948 the government offered some restitution to those who had lost homes or businesses.
it took until 1988 however for congress to offer an apology and a reparation payment of 20 000 to each of the 60 000 surviving internees.
prosperity scarcity and opportunities for women japanese americans were among the few to suffer financially from the war.
for most americans jobs were plentiful and wages high.
during the war the nations gross national product rose 60 percent and 17 million new jobs were created.
to mobilize the economy the government quickly established a slew of agencies to allocate scarce resources help businesses convert factories to a wartime footing and enlist the publics support for the war.
after the difficult years of the depression the war fueled boom was a welcome relief.
people are crazy with money one store owner exclaimed.
they dont care what they buy.
they purchase things just for the fun of spending madison avenue advertising firms assured the public that consumerism was essential to the american way of life.
will you ever own another car asked one ad.
another radio.
another gleaming new refrigerator.
those who live under dictators merely dream of such possessions concerns over unemployment gave way to worries about inflation as the money flowing into the economy sent prices soaring.
the government tried to curb inflation by instituting price and wage controls.
because the nations resources were now being poured into producing military equipment and supplying the troops consumers faced shortages of all kinds.
to deal with the scarcity of resources the government rationed many goods including gas butter and sugar by distributing coupon books that allotted families a set amount of each item.
a japanese american protests internment government officials censored this photograph of a japaneseamerican veteran who reported to the evacuation center in his old uniform.
he gave his name to a japanese american staff member who decided instead to affirm his loyalty by cooperating openly with the authorities.
what competing responses did japanese americans have to internment.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 competing visions civil liberties and national security clash in korematsu v united states 1944 the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of relocating and interning japanese americans as a justifiable military measure.
three justices dissented from the majority opinion concluding that internment violated the constitutional rights of japanese american citizens.
which side made the stronger argument.
how has america resolved a similar dilemma over national security versus civil rights in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks see chapter 29.
justice hugo black wrote the majority opinion that upheld the constitutionality of interning japanese americans.
exclusion of those of japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group most of whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country we are not unmindful of the hardships imposed by it upon a large group of american citizens but hardships are part of war and war is an aggregation of hardships.
all citizens alike both in and out of uniform feel the impact of war in greater or lesser measure.
citizenship has its responsibilities as well as its privileges and in time of war the burden is always heavier.
compulsory exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes except under circumstances of direct emergency and peril is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions.
but when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implies.
korematsu was not excluded from the military area because of hostility to him or his race.
he was excluded because we are at war with the japanese empire because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our west coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures because they decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of japanese ancestry be segregated from the west coast temporarily and finally because congress reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military leaders as inevitably it must determined that they should have the power to do just this.
there was evidence of disloyalty on the part of some the military authorities considered that the need for action was great and time was short.
we cannot by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight now say that at that time these actions were unjustified.
did a legitimate military reason exist to place japanese americans in internment camps.
justice frank murphy dissented arguing that internment was racially motivated.
this exclusion of all persons of japanese ancestry both alien and non alien from the pacific coast area on a plea of military necessity in the absence of martial law ought not to be approved.
such exclusion goes over the very brink of constitutional power and falls into the ugly abyss of racism it is essential that there be definite limits to military discretion especially where martial law has not been declared.
individuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on plea of military necessity that has neither substance nor support no one denies of course that there were some disloyal persons of japanese descent on the pacific coast who did all in their power to aid their ancestral land.
similar disloyal activities have been engaged in by many persons of german italian and even more pioneer stock in our country.
but to infer that examples of individual disloyalty prove group disloyalty and justify discriminatory action against the entire group is to deny that under our system of law individual guilt is the sole basis for deprivation of rights to give constitutional sanction to that inference in this case however well intentioned may have been the military command on the pacific coast is to adopt one of the cruelest of the rationales used by our enemies to destroy the dignity of the individual and to encourage and open the door to discriminatory actions against other minority groups in the passions of tomorrow i dissent therefore from this legalization of racism.
racial discrimination in any form and in japanese american girl any degree has no justifiable part saying the pledge of whatever in our democratic way allegiance of life.

as in world war i the nation used conscription to fill the ranks and enlisted the help of big business to provide the guns tanks ships airplanes and bullets that a modern army needed.
numbers help convey the immensity of the american war effort.
the military grew from 227 000 to 16 million of whom 10 million were conscripted.
american industry produced 77 000 ships 300 000 airplanes 2 5 million trucks and 20 million small arms for the american and allied armed forces.
nearly 15 million civilians relocated during the war to take advantage of opportunities in cities with booming wartime industries such as los angeles new orleans seattle detroit and philadelphia.
the sudden growth of many cities forced hundreds of thousands of recent migrants to live in the backs of stores in public buildings warehouses and garages the bureau of labor reported.
nearly 19 million women held jobs during the war for the moment a record high.
many of these women would have worked anyway.
only three million new female workers entered the wartime workforce.
norman rockwells cover illustration for the saturday evening posts 1943 memorial day edition 23 10 introduced the public to rosie the riveter an iconic figure representing all female defense workers.
rosie is strong and confident containing both masculine and feminine attributes.

the ad also emphasized this womans imminent postwar need for new appliances.
view the closer look images as history we can do it visual myths about womens roles during world war ii what competing visions of working women emerged during the war.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 as expected the overall percentage of women working fell to 28 percent from a wartime high of 36 percent in 1947 as women quit their jobs to raise families or employers fired them to free up positions for returning veterans.
over 350 000 women served in the armed forces including 150 000 in the womens army corps wac.
most women in uniform served as nurses and clerks fulfilling vital communication and record keeping services.
many men and the media mocked these clerical roles.
the press nicknamed the wacs the petticoat army and their quarters fort lipstick the recruiting slogan for the wacs release a man for combat underscored the different risks faced by women and men in the military.
female soldiers also performed more traditionally male tasks serving as gunnery instructors mechanics and truck drivers and 1 000 women even flew combat aircraft from domestic manufacturers to overseas bases.
general douglas macarthur called female troops my best soldiers at least one congressman however offered a competing vision wondering what has become of the manhood of america now that women had a formal place in the armed forces.
after the war only a few thousand women remained in uniform as the military cut slots reserved for female troops.
their position within the armed forces rebounded a bit however in 1948 when congress gave women a permanent though segregated place in the army navy and air force.
the debate over whether to limit female soldiers to support tasks or use them in active operations was only beginning.
even children pitched in to help the war effort.
to encourage childrens active participation the government released photographs of small girls and boys doing their bit 23 12.
this young boy takes care of the family shopping while his parents work in war related jobs handing the familys ration card to the merchant.
at home this little girl carefully saves tin and foil in separate jars for the local scrap drive.
millions participated in these morale building activities but weapons manufacturers discarded most of the poor quality aluminum and rubber collected.
money however was always in short supply.
classrooms across the nation collected pennies and nickels for war bonds which the federal government sold to americans to help finance the war.
the remoteness of the war often made it seem like a great adventure to children.
war games gained popularity on the nations playgrounds and children joined the junior commandos which trained young uniformed recruits only a few years away from qualifying to fight in the army on a rugged obstacle course.
23 12 children and war children helped in the war effort by collecting metal for neighborhood scrap drives and by shopping with a ration card while their parents worked.
how did world war ii affect childhood.
view the image get in the scrap poster on the home front with the economy booming many americans concluded that wars by nature were good for the economy.
however several unique factors made world war ii particularly beneficial for the american economy the war effort withdrew 16 million servicemen and women from the workforce just as millions of new positions were created absorbing all surplus labor and creating a labor shortage.
massive government spending on the war not the war per se ended the depression.
if the government had been willing to spend 323 billion the total cost of the war on new deal programs the economy would likely have rebounded earlier.
the wartime boom years came at the expense of future generations.
taxation paid for less than half of the wars cost.
the government did not pay off its war debts until 1970.
during the war labors clout like that of big companies also expanded.
union rolls swelled from 8 7 to 14 7 million thanks in part to supportive war labor board policies.
industrialists tried to use the wartime rhetoric of sacrifice to rein in these growing unions.
in one advertisement for example the jenkins valve firm linked work slowdowns used to pressure a company to agree to labors demands to the unnecessary deaths of american sailors.
the ad showed a small child staring at a sailors cap that had washed up along the shore the caption asked is a plant slow down worth it unions did not abandon strikes but the war ushered in a less militant era of collective bargaining.
racial discord the war provided many opportunities for racial minorities to assert their claims for equal rights in american social and political life.

at first the wartime boom threatened to leave going to make it to increase the profits of general african americans behind because many essential motors big business profited tremendously from the war.
government contracts with generous profit wartime industries refused to hire blacks.
in 1941 the african american labor leader a philip randolph margins federal loans for factory conversion or exthreatened to assemble 10 000 blacks in front of the pansion and tax write offs went overwhelmingly to lincoln memorial in washington d c to demand the nations 100 largest companies.

when fdr tried to convince randolph to call off the march randolph told him we feel as you have wisely said no people will lose their freedom fighting for it to avoid an embarrassing demonstration that highlighted racial problems at home fdr agreed to issue an executive order that forbade discrimination in the defense industries and government if randolph canceled the march.
roosevelts order also established the fair employment practices committee to handle complaints of discrimination.
for the first time since reconstruction the period following the civil war the federal government was intervening directly to protect the civil rights of african americans.
randolphs aborted demonstration later inspired the 1963 march on washington where black civil rights leader martin luther king jr delivered his i have a dream speech standing before the lincoln memorial see chapter 27.
interest in direct action grew throughout the war.
the fellowship of reconciliations committee on racial justice initiated a wave of sit ins where blacks and whites entered segregated restaurants together and refused to leave when denied service.
in washington d c howard university students picketed segregated restaurants with signs that read we die together.
lets eat together and are you for hitlers way or the american way.
make up your mind nearly one million blacks served in the armed forces during the war including brigadier general benjamin o davis the first african american general in the u s army.
the war department finally agreed to train african american pilots and the tuskegee airmen who received their stateside training at alabamas tuskegee institute amassed an admirable war record in europe.
the military remained segregated however and most black soldiers served in noncombatant units where they cleared beaches in france of mines manned supply lines transporting food and ammunition to front line troops and built roads and railroads for the advancing army.
within the u s black servicemen received daily reminders of their second class status.
when black soldiers entered a whites only restaurant in salina kansas the owner stopped them.
we just stood there inside the door staring at what we had come to see the german prisoners of war who were having lunch at the counter.
this was really happening.
it was no jive talk.

the proper epitaph to mark each black soldiers grave in the pacific african americans how did african americans challenge racial discrimination during the war.
sarcastically said would be here lies a black man killed fighting a yellow man for the protection of a white man the double victory campaign laid the groundwork for the postwar civil rights movement by pioneering new strategies that would later prove extraordinarily successful.
the accelerated migration northward also created new bases of political power that would aid the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.
throughout the war hundreds of thousands of african american civilians hit the road in search of job opportunities in midwestern and western cities.
in 1943 los angeles welcomed 10 000 black migrants a month most from texas and louisiana.
overcrowding and changing demographics created explosive racial situations in many urban areas.
the most serious wartime race riot took place in 1943 in detroit.
home to the nations largest automobile manufacturers detroit became the leading producer of military goods when these companies began manufacturing jeeps and tanks for the military.
plentiful jobs drew thousands of migrants to the city including african americans who had trouble finding adequate lodging in the strictly albeit unofficially segregated city housing market.
white workers resentful of working next to blacks staged slowdowns in the citys wartime defense plants.
to protest racial discrimination some black residents initiated a bumping campaign nudging whites off sidewalks.
the anticipated confrontation finally came on a warm spring afternoon when black and white teenagers tussled at a crowded amusement park on belle isle.
as the violence escalated a mob of 5 000 whites formed to attack blacks as they crossed the bridge back to the mainland.
racial rampaging soon engulfed the city.
hundreds of african americans were injured and 25 were killed before state and federal troops restored order.
nine whites also died in the rioting.

african americans were not the only targets of racial violence however.
the same summer that racial rioting rocked detroit white sailors and soldiers on leave in los angeles began a ten day rampage against mexican american zoot suiters youths who wore baggy pants long oversize coats and broad brimmed hats.
the zoot suit was a fashion trend established by african american men in the 1930s.
by the war years white americans viewed zoot suiters at best as juvenile delinquents who refused to dress and act properly and at worst as criminal gangs bent on robbery and rape.
some pachucos as zoot suiters called themselves engaged in criminal activity but most limited their adolescent rebellion to wearing different clothes from adults.
the explosive growth in the mexicanamerican community coupled with a general intolerance for nonconformity during war set the stage for the conflict in los angeles.
street fights between sailors and mexican american men escalated into full scale rioting when organized groups of servicemen began attacking boys as young as 12 and mexican american businesses.
white civilians joined in the rioting and when a mob came upon a zoot suiter they often beat and stripped him and even burned his clothes.
the casualties included more than 100 seriously injured mexican americans and at least 100 more who refused hospital care.
newspapers in los angeles egged on the white crowds by praising their efforts to rid the city of hoodlums and gangsters federal investigators cited racial prejudice as the cause of the riots but los angeles nonetheless prohibited wearing zoot suits on city streets.
the image of mexican americans as disaffected youths belied the reality that 500 000 latinos served alongside whites in the armed forces during the war playing a significant role in the doomed defense of the philippines and winning many medals of honor.
perceived as natural warriors native americans encountered less hostility within the armed forces than blacks or latinos.
more than 25 000 native americans served including the famed navajo code talkers who transmitted secret messages between units in their native language baffling the japanese who never deciphered it.
military service offered many young native americans their first decent wages and a chance to leave the reservation.
government officials expected military service to hasten assimilation since native american soldiers lived among whites.
yet sending men into combat also gave some tribes a reason to resurrect rituals surrounding battle such as requiring returning soldiers to spend time in a sweat lodge to cleanse themselves of the evils associated with war.
serving in the military therefore both expanded veterans knowledge of the wider world and reinforced their own cultural traditions helping them to see themselves and mainstream society in a different light.

no bombs fell on mainland american cities and no occupying armies marched through the streets but with 16 million men in the armed forces nearly everyone knew someone who might not make it home.
the united states essentially fought two separate wars in world war ii one against germany and its allies in europe the other against japan in the pacific.
the initial news from the battlefront was not good as the american armed forces encountered one setback after another.
defeating japan and germany required time and patience.
victories finally came but the closer the allies got to japan and germany the harder their enemies fought.
initially leery of exposing americans to blood and gore over time magazines and newspapers began to publish photographs that registered the rising death toll at the front.
the public welcomed photographs of enemy destruction as evidence that the nation was nearing victory but reacted strongly to any sign of suffering by american soldiers.
nothing prepared the public however for the shocking details that emerged from liberated nazi concentration camps in 1945.

dresden home to key railroad lines was the site of another devastating incendiary bombing raid in february 1945 which killed approximately 35 000 germans.
although many american bombs failed to hit their precisely designated industrial or military targets in fighting germany the united states never formally adopted terror bombing the strategy of dropping high concentrations of bombs on civilian populations to create panic and misery.
in november 1943 fdr and churchill met with stalin for the first time in tehran the capital of iran to discuss allied strategy for the coming year.
during the conference fdr privately described stalin as altogether quite impressive and the president stayed in the soviet embassy to build a good rapport with the soviet leader.
churchill remained leery of soviet intentions to expand its influence into eastern europe after the war.
the soviet victory at stalingrad january february 1943 a pivotal battle that put the allies on the path to victory buoyed optimism that the tide had turned in russias favor on the eastern front.
within a few months the soviets would how did the tide gradually turn in favor of the allies in europe and the pacific.
also end a 900 day german siege of leningrad that lasted from september 1941 january 1944.
churchill wanted to forestall a soviet takeover of eastern europe by launching an anglo american invasion of the balkans through the adriatic sea.
fdr doubted that americans would support such a campaign when the nations traditional interest lay in defending britain and france.
he was also reluctant to send american troops into a region that the ussr clearly intended to dominate after the war.
the president was wary of antagonizing the soviet union when he still hoped to convince stalin to declare war against japan once the european war ended.
instead the united states persuaded britain to join it in an invasion of france in 1944.
the campaign in the pacific followed a similar strategy of attacking japan in the soft underbelly of its empire in the south pacific.
the americans opened this campaign with successful but difficult attacks on guadalcanal in the solomon islands and on new guinea.
in early 1943 japan accepted its defeat in the south pacific by withdrawing its fleet and aircraft to a new defensive line that extended through southeast asia the philippines and the mariana islands.
to keep up the pressure on japan the americans launched a two pronged attack on japanese forces in the central and south pacific.
from the central pacific the americans hoped to establish a naval blockade that cut japan off from supplies in the south.
the united states quickly took the gilbert and marshall islands.
during the subsequent invasion of the island of saipan in the marianas the americans destroyed so many japanese naval aircraft in the battle of the philippine sea june 19 20 1944 that the battle became known as the great marianas turkey shoot the final capture of the marianas in august 1944 put the united states armed with massive and heavily loaded b 29s that could travel up to 2 000 miles within striking distance of japan.
i shall return general douglas macarthur had proclaimed when fdr ordered him to head to australia and leave his troops on the philippines in 1942.
on october 20 1944 he fulfilled this promise by wading ashore in the leyte gulf four hours after the first american force landed in a carefully choreographed act on the front lines that macarthur insisted on filming several times to get just right.
to build morale and enhance his reputation as a fearless leader macarthur presented himself as part of the invasion force a general who was willing to get his boots wet and resolutely press forward as seen in this photo 23 16.
the battle of leyte gulf october 23 25 1944 the largest naval battle in history ended with an american victory.
it took until july 1945 however to completely liberate the philippines from isolated infantry garrisons.
with the war advancing well in the pacific americans began to feel optimistic about achieving a swift victory.
these hopes faded however when japan switched from fighting a strategic war to waging a war of attrition.
mounting losses japans leaders reasoned would force the united states to the negotiating table.
with conventional weapons like ships guns and planes in short supply japan introduced suicidal battlefield tactics on land and sea in the fall of 1944 intensifying the struggle.
in the western caroline islands japanese soldiers fought to the last man.
forcing the americans to rout out every enemy soldier from an interlocking system of caves and bunkers prolonged the battle and raised american casualties.
during the battle of leyte gulf the first kamikaze pilots plowed their planes into six american ships setting off a cascade of explosions from the ships gasoline and ordnance that damaged five and sank one.
a month later seaman james fahey was on a ship under attack.
the sailors battled for hours shooting down a steady stream of incoming aircraft.
the explosions were terrific as the suicide planes exploded in the water the water looked like it was on fire fahey wrote in his diary.
parts of the destroyed planes fell onto his ship and during a lull in the action the sailors sifted through the debris for souvenirs.
the deck near my mount was covered with blood guts brains tongues scalps hearts arms etc.
from the jap pilots fahey recalled.
he watched men select body parts to preserve in alcohol and send home to relatives.
soldiers involved in the pacific island hopping campaigns exhibited a similar macabre interest in collecting japanese soldiers body parts.
in may 1944 life magazine published a wartime souvenir showing an attractive young woman writing a thank you note to her fianc for sending her a souvenir japanese skull 23 17.
the armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing life noted.
yet the image of this woman calmly contemplating her war trophy elicited no controversy.
instead many americans exorcised their own desire for revenge against japan through such images.
the press had to handle photographs of american war dead more carefully see images as history combat photography page 706.
23 17 a wartime souvenir in 1944 life magazine chose this photo as its picture of the week.
the young womans fianc sent her a japanese skull with an inscription that read this is a good jap a dead one picked up on the new guinea beach collecting enemy body parts as war trophies was common among american troops fighting japan but not in the european theater.
the final push in europe on june 6 1944 the allies launched d day for debarkation day their long anticipated invasion of normandy in northern france under the command of general dwight d eisenhower.
the eyes of the world are upon you the popular leader told his troops.
eisenhower raised in a poor jehovah witness family in kansas became a national hero for his successful planning and execution of the d day invasions and subsequent offensives through france and germany.
his achievements and sunny personality would make him an appealing postwar presidential candidate in 1952 see chapter 24.
although stormy weather made traversing the english channel treacherous and the americans what do media images of the japanese suggest about american wartime culture.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 images as history combat photography war photography brings the realities of combat into the homes of ordinary citizens.
how do pictures of combat force viewers to think about the overall meaning and worthiness of the conflict.
for the first year and a half of american involvement when there was little good news to report the military believed that photographs of dead american soldiers would weaken morale on the home front.
in 1943 allied victories in the south pacific and north africa raised spirits at home perhaps a bit too much for some officials.
aware of the long road ahead and the need for continued civilian sacrifice the war department approved the dissemination of bloody battlefield photographs.
in september 1943 life published a photograph of three american soldiers lying partially buried in the sand in new guinea.
in the accompanying editorial life anticipated the publics shock at seeing the first photograph of american war dead.
why print this picture anyway of three american boys dead upon an alien shore.
is it to hurt people.
to be morbid life editors wrote.
those are not the answers.
the reason is that words are never enough magazine editors chose their images from an ever increasing supply of casualty pictures.
twothirds of the 291 557 american troops killed in battle during the war died in 1944 1945.
photographer joe rosenthals old glory goes up on mt.
suribachi iwo jima a candid shot of five marines and one navy corpsman raising a flag on the pacific island of iwo jima on february 23 1945 remains the most famous image from world war ii.
rosenthals pulitzer prize winning photograph would inspire a marine corps statue erected in washington d c in 1954.
military censors forbade publication of photographs containing identifiable war dead or badly mutilated corpses worried that such pictures might depress morale on the home front.
publication of photos showing some of our boys killed in action had a sobering effect on people and brought the realities of war closer to home a satisfied war department official noted.
here lie three americans 1943.
the image of six men working together to push the flag upright conveyed the teamwork necessary to defeat japan and that the uphill struggle to victory was not over.
three of the marines in rosenthals photograph died in the ensuing battle.
the others returned home and toured the country in an overwhelmingly successful war bond campaign.
how did the political and military situation influence the way americans viewed these photographs.
critics later accused rosenthal of staging this photo a charge he denied.

view the closer look images as history combat photography on the front lines faced fierce german resistance on omaha beach one of five landing points the d day invasion was an overwhelming success.
the heavy buildup for the attack involving 175 000 troops 6 000 aircraft and 6 000 naval vessels made complete surprise impossible.
but the allies had increased the invasions chances of success by deceiving the germans into expecting the attack to come elsewhere.
diversionary bombing false agent reports and misleading radio communications convinced the germans to station most of their first rate infantry divisions farther north.
hitler continued to hold these units and his crack tank formations in reserve even after the d day invasion began certain that the normandy landings were just a diversion.
the german delay in responding gave the allies the time they needed to establish a beachhead that stretched for 55 miles by the end of the first day.
life photographer robert capa hit the beaches with the troops living up to his famous statement if your pictures arent good enough you arent close enough anxious to see capas photographs a rushing darkroom technician used too much heat to dry the film and inadvertently melted nearly all his images.
the excessive heat blurred the remaining few creating a surreal aura to this instantly iconic image 23 18 of an american soldier struggling through the turbulent surf to reach the shore.
capa put down his camera long enough to pull this soldier to safety after a bullet struck him in the right shoulder.
it was still a long way from normandy to berlin however.
after two more months of hard fighting the allies finally began to push forward.
on august 15 1944 the americans launched a second invasion through the south of france.
within a month these troops had joined with the normandy invasion forces to establish a continuous allied front from the english channel to the german frontier.
but hitler had no intention of going down without a fight.
in december 1944 the germans launched a massive counteroffensive.
the battle of the bulge so named for the germans pocket of penetration into allied lines was the most massive battle fought by the american army in europe.
fighting in the snow and bitter cold the allies suffered 77 000 casualties before halting the german counterattack a month later.

the republican candidate thomas dewey a popular new york state governor had attacked roosevelt as a tired old man no longer up to the challenge of running the war.
roosevelt solidified support within the democratic party by replacing the controversial liberal henry wallace with harry s truman a straight talking moderate senator from missouri as his vice presidential candidate.
the selection of an acceptable vice presidential candidate was important to democratic party bosses who feared that the ill roosevelt might not live to complete a fourth term in office.
suffering from advancing heart disease and the strain of war roosevelt nevertheless displayed renewed energy during the campaign convincing americans not to change horses in mid stream he won 432 to 99 votes in the electoral college receiving 54 percent of the popular vote.
23 18 d day invasion 1944 robert capas grainy photograph conveyed the chaos and danger american soldiers faced when they hit the beaches in normandy france.
why did the allies prevail on d day.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 at yalta the larger question of how to defeat germany was behind the allies.
the issues now on the table included governing postwar germany ensuring victory over japan and maintaining peace in the postwar world.
at the conference fdr secured a soviet promise to enter the war against japan three months after germany capitulated.
in return stalin wanted the united states and britain to grant the soviet union territorial concessions in japan china and eastern poland.
for the moment fdr acceded to soviet control of eastern europe but secured a pledge from stalin never honored to hold free elections in a liberated poland.
the decision at yalta to name the united states britain france china and the ussr as permanent members of the proposed united nations security council each with the power to veto any resolution cleared the way to officially create a united nations un to replace the defunct league of nations.
delegates from 50 nations met in san francisco between april 25 and june 26 1945 to found the un an international organization that offered nations a place to discuss their differences and collectively promote economic development and peace throughout the world.
to ensure that the united states joined the un its creators made participation in un peacekeeping missions voluntary.
the security council veto also gave the united states and the other major powers a way to control un activities.
in contrast to world war i when it failed to join the league of nations the united states was one of the first countries to join the un which built its headquarters in new york city.
now unstoppable in europe the allies crossed the rhine river into germany in march.
on april 30 1945 hitler committed suicide in a bunker 55 feet underground in berlin.
after dictating his will and marrying his longtime companion eva braun hitler bit into a cyanide capsule and shot himself in the head.
two days later russian soldiers entered the bunker and took hitlers burned remains so an autopsy could confirm he was dead.
germany surrendered unconditionally on may 7 1945.
americas response to the holocaust in spring 1945 allied troops began liberating the concentration camps holding jews poles prisoners of war and other groups that the nazis considered enemies or racially inferior.
news of the final solution hitlers plan to systematically murder the jews and other lesser peoples first reached the west in august 1942.
along with ten other nations the united states condemned in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold blooded extermination during the war mainstream american newspapers fearful of reporting falsified atrocity stories amid a glut of war news had published little about the holocaust the term used to describe this naziengineered extermination.
the united states did little initially to aid european jews.
in january 1944 however secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau who was jewish protested to fdr that antisemitism within the state department had thwarted a plan to ransom 70 000 romanian jews with private funds leaving the united states open to charges that it was acquiescing in the murder of the jews fdr immediately issued an executive order establishing the war refugee board wrb.
over the next year the wrb saved approximately 200 000 lives by convincing romania and hungary to stop deporting jews and by helping jews and other victims of nazi persecution escape or survive in hiding.
envisioning evidence deciphering the holocaust depicts both the response of the united states to the holocaust and the scope of german atrocities.
pressed by jewish groups to undertake a dramatic rescue of europes jews by bombing either the concentration camps or the railroads leading to them roosevelt demurred.
he argued that any diversion of military resources from the ultimate goal of winning the war would only prolong the jews suffering.
in february 1944 the war department decided not to send armed forces to rescue victims of enemy oppression unless such rescues are the direct result of military operations conducted with the objective of defeating the armed forces of the enemy bombing auschwitz the main nazi extermination camp in poland became a real possibility only in the summer of 1944.
in august allied planes dropped more than 1 000 bombs on synthetic oil plants less than 5 miles from auschwitz.
whether the allies should have also bombed the gas chambers has provoked heated debate since the war.
advocates argue that destroying the railroad lines leading to auschwitz or its gas chambers would have slowed down the killing as liberating allied troops approached the camps perhaps saving as many as 100 000 jews.
these would have included anne frank a 13 year old german refugee who was sent to auschwitz after her familys capture in amsterdam and whose journal of her experience in hiding the diary of anne frank became a postwar literary classic.
detractors note the nazi what significant decisions were reached at the 1945 yalta conference.
on the front lines envisioning evidence deciphering the holocaust over simplifications about the holocaust depict german jews as the main victims of hitlers final solution and the united states primarily as liberators.
as the graph shows most of the six million jews who died in the holocaust were poles.
the germans also killed over three million soviet prisoners of war two million nonjewish poles nearly 200 000 disabled individuals 10 000 jehovah witnesses and an undetermined number of homosexuals and roma or gypsies.
the timeline reveals that during the depression plagued 1930s the united states reacted cautiously to hitlers persecution of the jews.
nonetheless of all nations the united states still accepted the largest number of jewish refugees fleeing nazi persecution.
the map marks the major concentration camps that american ground troops liberated in western europe including buchenwald dachau and mauthausen forced labor camps and detention centers where thousands were worked to death starved executed and subjected to medical experiments.
the soviet army liberated the extermination camps including auschwitz all located in eastern europe.

american military commanders forced german civilians who professed ignorance about the atrocities to view and bury the dead.
determination to use any means possible to slaughter the jews including mass executions by firing squads and forced marches until the very end of the war.
as the camps were liberated reporters tried through words and pictures to convey how six million jews had met their deaths.
even though americans had grown accustomed to seeing photos of war dead nothing prepared them for images from the concentration camps.
american commanders invited the press into the camps to head off denials over the scope of the holocaust and nazi atrocities.
photographs of concentration camps were one reporter wrote so horrible that no newspaper normally would use them but they were less horrible than the reality soldiers set themselves up as witnesses a term used to describe both survivors how did images instruct americans about the meaning of the holocaust and their role as liberators.
and liberators who could personally vouch for the extent of the horrors by posing in photographs before piles of corpses and skeletal survivors.
you can photograph results of suffering but never suffering itself observed one british politician.
by documenting the act of discovering nazi atrocities witness photographs helped americans share the horror that soldiers felt.
the american military also posted photographs of concentration camp atrocities in german towns and villages for civilians to see but many american commanders went further.
in the photo shown here 23 19 american soldiers assembled german civilians before a truckload of corpses to listen to a lecture on the barbarity.
forcing german civilians to view the carnage with their own eyes and in some cases to bury the bodies was part of a deliberate allied campaign to make all germans accept responsibility for their nations war crimes.
after the war the allies jointly tried 22 nazi leaders in the nuremberg war crimes trials.
in these trials individual germans were charged with starting the war authorizing the killing of prisoners of war and orchestrating the wartime genocide against victims who mostly came from nations occupied by germany see the jews in the holocaust chart page 709.
the united states independently tried thousands of other german officials as well.
these trials were not enough to calm the fears of survivors.
many left europe to resettle elsewhere.

roosevelts firm grip on power had kept vice president harry truman in the dark about the four year 20 billion manhattan project the code named secret government research program to produce the atomic bomb.
thrust into the presidency truman faced critical strategic decisions in europe and the pacific none more important than what to do with the new atomic bomb.
in mid july 1945 the united states exploded its first atomic bomb in the new mexico desert.
choices and consequences how to use the atomic bomb traces trumans options and the consequences of his decision to use the bomb against japan.
on august 6 1945 a b 29 bomber christened the enola gay dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima.
as pilot captain paul tibbets turned the enola gay away from hiroshima sergeant george caron snapped seven photographs giving americans their first look at the telltale mushroom cloud that came to signify nuclear annihilation.
three days later acting on a standing order to use the atomic bomb as made ready a second atomic bomb was dropped on nagasaki.
how did the war against japan finally end.
saved from firebomb attacks because of their minimal military value hiroshima and nagasaki presented virgin ground for a clear demonstration of the bombs force.
the united states wanted to make a profound impression on the japanese.
secretary of war stimson believed the atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction it was a psychological weapon the firebombed ruins of cities like tokyo therefore presented a much less appealing target for demonstrating the full power of a nuclear bomb.
american soldiers scheduled to take part in the planned invasion gave little thought to civilian victims.
when we learned to our astonishment that we would not be obliged in a few months to rush up the beaches near tokyo assault firing while being machine gunned mortared and shelled for all the practiced phlegm of our tough facades we broke down and cried with relief and joy.
we were going to live.
we were going to grow to adulthood after all recalled literary critic paul fussell in a 1988 essay thank god for the atom bomb the final surrender truman and his advisers recognized that american possession of the atomic bomb would reshape postwar relations between the united states and the soviet union.
to key presidential advisers americas nuclear monopoly increased the chances of limiting soviet influence over eastern europe and ending the pacific war without soviet help.
spies in the manhattan project had already alerted moscow of the bombs existence before truman finally told stalin in july 1945 at the potsdam conference held near berlin that the united states had developed a potent new weapon.
when the first bomb destroyed hiroshima the soviets quickly invaded manchuria on august 8 to seize their planned territorial objectives before the war ended.
by august 10 the combination of two atomic bomb blasts and the soviet entry into the war caused japanese emperor hirohito to take the unprecedented step of imposing his own views on official policy.
traditionally the emperor simply approved decisions taken by his cabinet.
with the peace and militarist factions within his government still divided over whether to make a last stand against the allies hirohito decided for peace.
after key military leaders accepted the emperors wishes japan sued for peace with the condition that the imperial institution remain ending the pacific war choices and consequences how to use the atomic bomb president harry truman considered the bomb a legitimate weapon to use alongside the more conventional tactics of terror bombing an economic blockade and a planned invasion of japan.
he did however face four choices over how to exploit this new weapon to meet his goals of securing an unconditional surrender from japan saving american lives and establishing american postwar supremacy over the soviet union.
choices demonstrate the bombs destructive power in a trial blast on an uninhabited area to convince japan to surrender.
drop one atomic bomb and give japan time to react.
drop the two atomic bombs america had developed.
inform the soviet union about the bomb before dropping it.
decision truman chose to drop both atomic bombs on virgin sites in japan to magnify the psychological shock of one bomb causing so much destruction.
senior advisers rejected a test demonstration of the bomb as impractical.
truman vaguely informed stalin of a new weapon of unusual destructive force unaware that spies in the manhattan project had already alerted stalin of the bombs existence.
consequences on august 6 1945 little boy the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima destroyed three fourths of the city and killed 80 000 people instantly.
fat man destroyed two fifths of nagasaki and killed 35 000 people on august 9.
the emperor announced japans surrender on august 14.
trumans attempted secrecy increased soviet distrust of the united states and unleashed a nuclear arms race between the two nations.
continuing controversies should the united states have dropped the bomb.
supporters of trumans decision claim that dropping the bomb ended the war.
it saved one million american lives by making an invasion of japan unnecessary and convinced the japanese government to end the war.
not all supporters however agree that the second bomb on nagasaki was militarily necessary.
critics counter that the bomb was not needed to end the war.
traditional bombing the blockade and the soviet invasion of manchuria would have ended the war without the planned invasion they claim.
because the united states accepted a modified surrender that allowed japan to retain the emperor abandoning the demand for unconditional surrender earlier may have convinced japan to surrender sooner.
finally some detractors accuse truman of using the bomb mainly to curtail soviet territorial ambitions in postwar europe and asia.
bomb over nagasaki 1945 watch the video atomic bomb at hiroshima why does so much controversy surround the dropping the atomic bomb and not conventional weapons.
chapter 23 world war ii fighting the good war 1939 1945 intact.
truman agreed thereby modifying the original goal of unconditional surrender.
could a japanese surrender have come sooner if the united states had guaranteed the emperors office earlier.
before august 6 truman likened keeping hirohito to allowing hitler to remain in power and he believed that the american people would never accept these terms for peace.
in mid august however truman concluded that letting hirohito tell the japanese people to lay down their arms would facilitate the occupation of japan.
hirohito paved the way for a peaceful surrender when he addressed the japanese people on the radio for the first time ever calling on them to accept his decision.
many of his subjects did not understand hirohitos formal court language illustrating the social distance 23 21 the human cost of global war worldwide wartime casualties those killed and wounded numbered in the millions.
maintained between the emperor and his subjects.
the formal surrender took place on september 2 aboard the battleship missouri in tokyo bay attended by delegates from japan and the allied nations.
the deadliest war in human history whose death toll is charted in the human cost of global war 23 21 had finally ended.
when news of the japanese surrender hit the united states americans swarmed into the streets to celebrate the good news.
every female was grabbed and kissed by men in uniform recalled one woman who joined the crowd in times square new york city.
the celebrants included a sailor whose impromptu kiss with a passing nurse was captured by life photographer alfred eisenstaedt.

eisenstaedt never revealed the identity of the kissing couple preferring to let their shielded faces symbolize the exuberance of young men and women who had survived the war.
three nurses and eleven sailors later claimed that they were the individuals in the photograph.
hirohito was not tried as a war criminal but the allies intended to punish other japanese leaders.
in the few weeks between the japanese surrender and the allied occupation of japan more than 1 000 officials and officers committed suicide and others destroyed thousands of documents concerning japanese mistreatment of prisoners of war and massacres of civilians in occupied countries.
nonetheless the allies convicted thousands of japanese in war crimes trials throughout east asia including 28 major japanese leaders in tokyo.

when franklin d roosevelt fdr accepted the democratic nomination for president in 1932 he promised to remember the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid fdr won the election and took office in the throes of the great depression the most devastating and longest economic crisis in american history.
four years later the photographer walker evans traveled to alabama to document the hardships of three struggling sharecropping families.
while there he photographed floyd burroughs who spent his days toiling in the cotton fields alongside his wife and children.
for seven years through the worst of the depression crisis burroughs had struggled to provide the minimal basic needs for his family without government help.
to gain public support for new government programs designed to help sharecroppers the farm security administration had commissioned this and photos like it to show americans the faces of poverty stricken farmers.
evanss portrait of the forgotten man aroused more than sympathy however.
americans had different visions of how the government should respond to the crisis and throughout the 1930s political debate centered on whether and how much the government should intervene.
presidents herbert hoover and franklin d roosevelt both championed initiative freedom and opportunity.
they disagreed however over what government action preserved or destroyed these values.
in the early thirties hoover who preferred minimal government intervention in the economy took a few historic steps by lending money to banks and businesses and helping farmers.
more attuned to the public mood roosevelt initiated a broad array of public works programs and social reforms to satisfy the demand for direct government intervention in the economy.
taken together policy initiatives by hoover and roosevelt paved the way for a complete transformation of the federal governments role in american society.
the new deal did not end the depression that honor belonged to world war ii.
it was however one of the most important periods of legislative activity in american history.
farmers migrants and industrial workers did not just passively wait for help during these hard times.
they demanded a new deal from the federal government that alleviated the sufferings of common people.
organized labor and charismatic populist politicians on the left helped create a groundswell of support for active government intervention in the economy.
the great depression therefore was not just the story of unrelenting hardship.
the era also had moments of triumph for ordinary americans like burroughs who found their political voice.
i pledge you i pledge myself to a new deal for the american people franklin d roosevelt 1932 chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 the early days of the depression in 1928 the future looked rosy to most americans and even president herbert hoover believed that permanent prosperity was at hand.
americans venerated hoover as the great humanitarian when he began his term.
he left four years later amid bitter denunciations that he cared more for banks than for people earning him the new nickname of the great scrooge the causes of the depression were complex giving rise to competing visions over what action if any the government should take and how far it should go to engineer an economic recovery.
hoover went further than any other president to date in offering federal assistance to businesses and farmers but by 1932 his awkward manner along with his refusal to approve direct governmental relief made him appear uncaring to most americans.
stepped in too often to manage the economy individuals and businesses lost their initiative.
for herbert hoovers personal story was a classic ragshoover individualism meant more than individuals to riches tale that reaffirmed faith in the american selfishly pursuing their own well being.
he felt that dream.
orphaned at the age of nine he later reamericans and american business also had a recalled that my boyhood ambition was to be able to sponsibility to serve the community like progressive earn my own living without the help of anybody reformers he believed that self interest often caused anywhere this personal ethos shaped his lifelong great harm to others see chapter 18.

a ballot in 1928 he won by a landslide becoming president of the united states.
hoover was a poor public speaker lacked charisma and closely guarded his private life.
but when he became president he enjoyed immense popularity.
after all hoover was a success in business he had fed starving people he the economic downturn in 1929 took the country had been a dynamic secretary of commerce under by surprise.
however a hard look at the twenties represidents harding and coolidge and he believed veals that problems in the nations economy existed that people would do the right thing once the goveven during the boom years both in large scale inernment showed them the way.
dustries and on family farms.
like most americans hoover believed that ablesome industries especially textiles and minbodied individuals should make their own way in ing suffered throughout the twenties from overthe world.
he maintained that if the government production and falling demand.
by 1929 even the herbert hoover just making money isnt enough economic weaknesses in a time of prosperity what qualities made hoover a popular president when he was first elected.
watch the video prosperity of the 1920s and the great depression the early days of the depression automobile construction and appliance industries found it difficult to turn a profit.
cooling demand for automobiles soon rippled outward to industries such as steel and rubber.
some of the reasons for the slump lay in the unequal distribution of income in american society.
from 1923 to 1929 corporate profits rose 62 percent while workers hourly wages increased by only eight percent.
with economic growth now linked to consumer spending the limited purchasing power of working class americans contributed to the growing financial crisis.
high tariffs taxes levied against imported products kept foreign made goods expensive protecting american companies from overseas competition.
foreign countries responded by levying high tariffs against american goods reducing overseas markets for u s companies.
when demand for americanmade goods declined at home american companies were slow to lower prices.
by the time they did demand had fallen so dramatically that massive layoffs were inevitable.
as the chances for making money in manufacturing lessened investors stopped buying industrial stocks.
this loss of capital further dampened manufacturers efforts to recover their earlier momentum.
together these problems revealed an ailing industrial sector.
more evident problems existed in agriculture.
farmers boom times had come during world war i when high demand generous prices and easy access to credit induced many to expand their crop production.
when the war ended and demand fell farmers were left with debts larger farms and falling crop prices.
the long term trend toward mechanized farming also contributed to the countrys looming agricultural crisis.
with tractors farmers could plow and harvest more land on a daily basis.
the ability to grow more crops more easily paradoxically hurt farmers because overproduction drove prices down even further.
even before the depression officially began hoover had devised a plan to help farmers escape the vicious cycle of over production and low prices that kept them from sharing in the prosperity of the twenties.
the agricultural marketing act 1929 created a farm board with the power to buy and store crops to reduce the harvest time market glut which lowered crop prices.
in keeping with his ethos of self help hoover expected farmers to do their part to keep agricultural prices high by growing less.
these measures however were too little too late.
unsure about what his neighbors would do no farmer wanted to be the only one to reduce his crop and then suffer both low prices and a small harvest.
the nations farmers continued to plant crops in record numbers.
in the 93 years of my life depressions have come and gone.
prosperity has always returned and will again oil magnate j d rockefeller doubting the need for government action the stock market crash of 1929 these underlying problems all laid the foundation for an economic downturn but by themselves did not predict a worldwide depression.
any chances for a mild recession disappeared in the stock market crash of 1929 a ten day period beginning on october 20 1929 when the value of stocks plummeted as panicked investors sold off their stock in droves.
this is usually considered the official start of the depression.
before the crash the stock market promised investors easy profits.
when investors buy stock they own pieces of the company and receive dividends their share of the profits.
normally the price of a share fluctuates in relation to the expected profitability of the company.
by the late 1920s however speculators who did not care about holding on to their share purchases to earn dividends had taken over the stock market.
instead they sold their shares as soon as the share price rose.
the epidemic of speculation created three key financial problems 1.
the influx of money into the stock market inflated share prices to such an extent that a stocks price soon bore little relation to the actual worth of a company.
many speculators bought on margin the name given to the short term loans used to purchase stock and planned to cover these loans by quickly reselling their shares at a higher price.
when stock prices began to fall too many investors could not pay these debts.
many investors were speculating with other peoples money funds from ordinary americans savings accounts that banks used to finance speculative stock market purchases.
that explains why although only 10 percent of americans actually owned stock the life savings of millions disappeared in october 1929.
why did farmers not prosper in the 1920s.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 on monday october 20 1929 the downward spiral began.
stock prices plummeted three days later on black thursday when a record 12 9 million shares changed hands.
on black tuesday the following week october 29 1929 16 million shares were traded and losses totaled 14 billion.

22 1 oct 29 dies irae day of wrath 1929 to convey the panic that swept wall street after the stock market crashed james rosenberg employed apocalyptic biblical imagery traditionally used to depict gods wrath as the world comes to an end.
the photo shows investors racing to the new york stock exchange.
what factors led to the stock market crash in 1929.
the early days of the depression hoovers response to the depression when the stock market crashed no one knew that this was the beginning of a ten year ordeal.
the great depression lasted from 1929 to 1939 the most devastating and longest economic crisis in american history.
in the 1920s the federal government played a relatively minor role in the economy and conservative businessmen urged hoover to keep it that way.
do nothing the laissez faire capitalists told the president setting in motion a political debate over government intervention that would dominate the depression era.
rejecting the laissez faire suggestion hoover envisioned the government fostering a spirit of teamwork that encouraged americans to work together as the nation weathered the economic downturn.
in keeping with his ideas of service minded individualism he brought the leaders of banking industry and labor to the white house and urged them to do their bit to keep the economy afloat.
responding to hoovers plea industry agreed not to lay off workers or cut wages and labor leaders accepted a shorter workday to create more jobs.
hoover asked state governments to accelerate their road and public building projects to add jobs in their communities.
hoover also stepped up hiring for long planned federal construction projects including the hoover dam in the west and asked congress to extend the tariff on manufactured goods to agricultural imports.
congress complied in 1930 raising tariffs to their highest level ever.
when other nations retaliated with their own high tariffs american companies and farmers lost overseas markets.
as a result the world and the united states plunged deeper into economic depression.
in orchestrating this unprecedented federal response to an economic depression hoover stayed within limits acceptable to conservatives.
most fiscal conservatives wanted government built roads and a high protective tariff and preferred non governmental solutions to economic problems.
when it came to helping needy citizens directly hoover went no further than asking local governments and charities to assume their traditional role of distributing food and clothing to the poor.
this stance surprised hoovers progressive supporters given his previous triumph organizing massive international relief efforts to feed hungry europeans during and after world war i.
it was not a question of helping people hoover asserted.
it is solely a question of the best method by which hunger and cold shall be prevented he explained.
to hoover the american tradition of self help made relief the responsibility of local governments and charities.
when the crisis entered its second year u s steel announced a ten percent wage cut.
other companies followed suit and within ten days american business had slashed millions of workers wages and begun massive layoffs.
the nations deepening financial woes convinced hoover to lend federal money to businesses and states.
this decision was a dramatic break from past practice.
in previous financial panics and depressions private bankers had put up the money needed for recovery and presidents had cut federal spending to ensure a balanced budget.
in 1932 by proposing a direct economic role for the government in ending the depression herbert hoover the man who wanted to decrease how did hoover respond to the initial economic crisis.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 22 2 bread line no one has starved 1932 breadlines became an iconic symbol of depression era suffering when private charities began providing free meals to the unemployed.
rather than forming bonds with one another over their shared plight the men in this drawing remain isolated islands of desperation.
americans reliance on the government to solve their problems went further than any previous peacetime president in similar circumstances.
by providing money to banks insurance companies farm mortgage associations and railroads through the reconstruction finance corporation rfc act of 1932 hoover helped institutions that were vital to the prosperity of any community.
in its first year the government loaned more than 1 5 billion to these businesses but little relief trickled down to workers.
when critics pressured the president to provide direct help to those without work or food hoover responded with the emergency relief act 1932 which lent money to the states for public works programs.
although his farm program the rfc and state loans failed to bring about recovery hoover had unknowingly set a precedent for direct governmental management of the economy that franklin d roosevelt would expand.
we didnt admit it at the time but practically the whole new deal was extrapolated from programs that hoover started rexford tugwell a key advisor to fdr later acknowledged.
reginald marshs bread line no one has starved 22 2 depicts a group of downtrodden men waiting for a free meal visual evidence of the growing crisis.
the hunched posture of these former wage earners symbolizes the shame associated with accepting charity.
the men stand close together to keep their place in line but do not converse or even look at each other.
keeping their hands in their pockets they have been paralyzed by poverty.
marsh based his title on hoovers remark that no one is what innovative solutions did hoover propose as the economic crisis continued.
actually starving the president had hoped to boost morale but marshs satire portrayed hoover as out of touch with reality.
with unemployment hovering around 20 percent in 1932 hoovers popularity declined steadily.
shantytowns constructed by the homeless became known as hoovervilles and people waved hooverflags empty pockets turned inside out in street protests.
a well circulated joke began with hoover asking an aide for a nickel to call a friend from a public telephone.
here said the man tossing him a dime call them both in the 1932 presidential campaign hoover faced off against fdr a fifth cousin of theodore roosevelt.
in sharp contrast to how he would govern franklin d roosevelt ran a fairly conservative campaign and let hoovers missteps win him the election.
one of those mistakes was the violent eviction of war veterans from the nations capital.
throughout the summer of 1932 the bonus march a two month long demonstration by 40 000 impoverished world war i veterans and their families in washington d c transfixed the nation.
the veterans demanded early payment of a bonus promised them by congress.
the bonus march ended violently when the army expelled the protesters using tanks cavalry and troops with fixed bayonets further damaging hoovers popularity at a key moment during the presidential campaign.
choices and consequences evicting the bonus marchers explores how hoover lost control of the decision to evict the bonus marchers from the city and paid the consequences.
view the image children with hoovers poor farm sign the early days of the depression choices and consequences evicting the bonus marchers in 1924 world war i veterans had received a federal bond certificate worth an average of 1 500 set to mature in 1945.
in may 1932 veterans and their families arrived en masse in the nations capital to demand immediate payment of this bonus.
they set up a huge hooverville of makeshift shacks and tents and staged continuous demonstrations on the capitol steps.
hoover faced three choices about how to deal with the demonstration depending on what interpretation of the protest he embraced.
choices accept the veterans argument that the government should pay the bonus immediately to alleviate their depressioncaused suffering.
accept his advisers view that the bonus march was a communist inspired plot to incite revolution and use force to suppress it.
reject their claim but treat the veterans as essentially harmless if misguided citizens in desperate financial straits.
decision while many in the general public and press viewed the bonus marchers as down on their luck citizens hoover grew convinced that they were a dangerous radical force.
after a skirmish between veterans and the police in august hoover opted to send in troops with instructions to restore order.
consequences once the troops were deployed chief of staff general douglas macarthur exceeded hoovers orders and decided to drive the veterans out of the city using tear gas tanks and bayonets.
hoover never publicly revealed macarthurs insubordination.
when franklin d roosevelt heard of the violent eviction he reportedly told an adviser well felix this will elect me continuing controversies was the government right to use force to evict the bonus marchers.
to justify the eviction the white house mounted a furious public relations campaign that included false accusations of discovering dynamite in the main veterans encampment.
some upper class americans applauded the governments actions hoping to dampen any revolutionary impulse among the poor.
but many working and middle class americans saw their own destroyed lives in the smoldering ruins of the veterans shantytown and turned against hoover for refusing to aid men who had served the nation loyally.
the ruins of a bonus army encampment 1932 why was hoovers choice to evict the bonus marchers significant.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 a new president and a new deal fdr became president in 1933 during the lowest moment of the depression with 25 percent of the workforce unemployed.
half of those with home mortgages had defaulted on their loans and the entire banking system appeared ready to collapse.
empathy for the common people encouraged fdr to act but so did fear that a social revolution might result if washington did nothing for them.
i pledge you i pledge myself to a new deal for the american people fdr had proclaimed during his campaign.
he entered office dedicated to protecting america as a capitalist society and his vision of government activism came under severe scrutiny from both sides of the political spectrum.
fdr the politician only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment noted fdr upon taking office in 1933.
if roosevelt had a mandate for anything it was for bold action.
he met that expectation with 22 3 key new deal legislation reconstruction finance corporation businesses and banks receive federal loans national industrial recovery act allows business to set price wage and production codes agricultural adjustment act pays farmers to plant less to raise crop prices civilian conservation corps employs young men in reforestation and construction public works administration construction projects provide work relief to poor glass steagall act of 1933 insures bank deposits separates commercial and investment banking tennessee valley authority brings electricity to rural areas stops devastating floods social security act guarantees eligible workers a pension and unemployment insurance aid to disabled and married women with dependent children wagner act offers government protection to unions works progress administration extensive public works program employs 8 million ranging from artists to construction workers fair labor standards act establishes federal minimum wage and maximum working hours per week how did the competing social philosophies of hoover and fdr differ.
the new deal an avalanche of legislation from 1933 to 1938 intended to promote economic recovery reform american capitalism and offer security to ordinary americans.
the chart key new deal legislation 22 3 shows the most significant laws passed under roosevelts watch.
having campaigned as a fiscal conservative who would balance the budget fdr did not have a blueprint for ending the depression when he came into office.
he did however have a fairly well shaped social philosophy.
he had a profound feeling for the underdog a very keen awareness that political democracy could not exist side by side with economic plutocracy according to a key adviser.
we are going to make a country the president told a cabinet member in which no one is left out fdr sought advice for specific programs and regulations from the brain trust leading academics who served as presidential advisers in the early years of the new deal.
the brain trust wanted to revive the progressive era practice of using government regulation to solve economic problems and protect the common good see chapter 18.
brain trust members raymond moley rexford tugwell and adolf berle diagnosed under consumption as the main cause of the depression blaming the unequal distribution of income the farm crisis rigid prices and low wages as the key culprits.
this cartoon 22 4 depicts the conservative complaint that the brain trust hurt the country with new deal programs intended to correct these economic problems.
posing as doctors these professors have anesthetized the country with propaganda.
now the patient lies on an operating table oblivious to the knives and drills about to destroy his body.
besides attacking the new deal as a set of unwise experiments the cartoon touches on conservatives concern that too much government involvement in the economy view the image john baer we demand a new deal 1931 a new president and a new deal if it fails admit it frankly and try another.
but above all try something fdrs approach to shaping the new deal 22 4 conservatives attack the new deal this 1934 cartoon mocks the brain trust for experimenting with the nations well being implying that new deal policy initiatives did more harm than good.
like too many pointless operations would do more harm than good.
in formulating his policies fdr leaned on another critical adviser his wife.
eleanor roosevelt served as the presidents eyes and ears by traveling around the country and reporting to him what she observed.
in 1933 first lady eleanor roosevelt traveled 30 000 miles visiting americans where they worked and lived.
two years later the washington star felt it newsworthy to print the headline mrs.
roosevelt spends the night at the white house over time eleanor roosevelt became more outspoken in advancing causes dear to her heart concerning racial injustice and poverty.
she invited prominent african americans to the white house to talk directly to the president about civil rights.
eleanor roosevelts visible participation in political affairs set her apart from former first ladies who had mainly served as official hostesses at white house functions.
her activism opened up political opportunities for other women.
there were many firsts for women in the thirties first ambassador first judge on the court of appeals and first cabinet secretary secretary of labor frances perkins.
hear the audio file fdrs first inaugural address americans differed in their reactions to eleanor roosevelts left leaning political activities.
conservative detractors advised her to stay at home and make a home for your husband her civil rights activism particularly upset southern democrats in congress.
she had equally ardent supporters and consistently won a two thirds approval rating in gallup polls often bettering her husband.
thousands of americans wrote to her each week to ask for financial help or to praise her work.
like his wife fdr connected well with the public.
throughout his presidency fdr used weekly radio addresses that he called fireside chats to speak directly to the nation.
after the presidents death in 1945 people stopped eleanor on the street to tell her how much they missed the way the president used to talk to them.
theyd say he used to talk to me about my government she recalled.
fdr was often photographed smiling and smoking from an elegant looking cigarette holder 22 5 and the public found his visible cheerfulness refreshing.
fdr infused hope into a time of trouble and confusion.
yet little in his background suggested that he would understand the plight of common people.
the only son of doting wealthy parents who imbued him with tremendous self confidence the athletic charming and brilliant fdr attended harvard and passed the new york state bar exam after just one year at columbia law school.
in 1929 he became governor of new york.
a personal tragedy in his life however convinced the public that fdr understood what it meant to overcome adversity.
in 1921 at the age of 39 polio left him partially paralyzed for the rest of his life and in pain much of the time.
his disability made it possible for the common people to trust him to understand what it is to be handicapped by poverty and ignorance as well as by physical misfortune secretary of labor frances perkins noted.
22 5 fdrs trademark cigarette holder and smile most americans found fdrs cheerfulness reassuring and he inspired confidence in americas security and future prosperity.
what role did eleanor roosevelt play during her husbands administrations.

although fdr benefited from people knowing that he had overcome a misfortune he also believed that visual images of his handicap would convey the impression that he was weak and physically unfit for his responsibilities.
he made a personal and political decision to conceal his paralysis.
to hide his heavy leg braces fdr wore extra long pants and had the visible portion of the braces painted black to blend with his shoes.
he learned to stand upright by holding onto a cane with one hand and the arm of an aide usually his son with the other 22 6.
he would then use his hips to swing his legs forward in a semi arch to give the illusion of walking.
all of this required tremendous physical exertion.
james roosevelt later noted that he often had bruises on his arms from the force of his fathers grip.
father and son disguised their physical effort by smiling and joking as they walked together before audiences.
away from the crowds aides carried fdr up stairs or from the car to a wheelchair.
in public he often used his automobile as a prop to hide his disability and by holding a bar installed in the backseat of an open touring car he could pull himself up to address crowds.
at one stadium rally a ramp was constructed so that the presidents car could be driven onto the stage in the center of the field.
fdr gave his speech without leaving the car.
the press obeyed white house rules that prohibited taking photos of the president in a wheelchair or being carried.
as a result there are only two known photographs of fdr in a wheelchair.
this fdr running political cartoons never showed the presidents physical disabilities.
self censorship even extended to political cartoons which never once depicted the president as incapacitated.
instead these caricatures usually portrayed an energetic fdr running or jumping like this 1936 caricature from the kansas city star 22 7 in which a sprinting fdr replicates benjamin franklins kite flying experiment to bring electricity to the rural poor.
the temper of the poor passivity and anger hoover kept his distance from common people and paid the price.
fdr was a more astute politician.
but what was the temper of the people he needed there is something about the first anniversary of your layoff which makes you feel more hopeless a worker during the great depression how and why did fdr manage his political image.
a new president and a new deal to help.
two competing images of the poor soon emerged.
one emphasized their helplessness and suffering the other saw them as teetering on the brink of revolt.
countless government investigators detailed the plight of hardworking family men suddenly without jobs.
i find them all in the same shape fear fear driving them into a state of semi collapse cracking nerves and an overpowering terror of the future reported one social worker.
many americans chose to suffer silently making their own decisions about how to cope sometimes blaming themselves rather than the depression for their troubles.
this portrait by dorothea lange 22 8 conveys this quiet desperation of the poor.
in langes image an unemployed man grasps his empty tin cup and leans over the rail as if he is kneeling at a church altar praying for salvation.
the mans plight is moving but his passivity is also vaguely reassuring to those who feared angry demonstrations or social revolution.
as the bonus march revealed however not all americans were waiting patiently for conditions to improve.
federal investigator lorena hickok feared that a social revolution was brewing i still feel that vast numbers of unemployed in pennsylvania are right on the edge so to speak that it wouldnt take much to make communists out of them the communist party hoped that she was right.
unlike roosevelt and his conservative critics communists had no interest in saving capitalism.
they hoped that the crisis would provoke a social revolt that abolished private property.
the 1930s were the heyday of american communism as the party grew from 7 000 members in 1930 to 100 000 in 1939.
across the country communists organized unemployed councils that blocked evictions from city apartments mounted hunger marches and reconnected gas and electricity lines for workers who could not pay their bills.
grocery store robberies were also common although newspapers rarely reported these crimes.
when the manager of a grocery store in detroit denied a group of men credit they ransacked his store.
witnessing the food riot the novelist john dos passos wondered why the manager did not call the police.
if more people heard about affairs like this there would be more trouble the manager replied.
while the urban poor stole food farmers demonstrated to demand higher prices for their crops.
across the midwest farmers disrupted food shipments by blocking highways with logs and pouring milk onto roads.
when banks seized land cattle or farm machinery from farmers who defaulted on their loans they needed help from the police to ensure that public sales of the confiscated property went smoothly.
at some farm auctions farmers devised an effective strategy to help their neighbors by offering only a penny for the property on sale.
nooses hung on barn doors at penny auctions warned prospective buyers that bidding on a farm familys possessions would not be wise.
if anyone in the farmyard might be so ignorant of what was going on as to put in a serious bid a suitably burly man would be likely to step up and put a hand on his shoulder with the words that bids a little high aint it one farmer recalled.
22 8 breadline san francisco the mans empty cup symbolized his pervasive hunger.
his unthreatening pose created sympathy for his plight while the militant poor provoked fears of social revolution.
what competing responses did the poor offer to the ongoing depression.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 recovering from the depression first of all fdr stated in his first inaugural address let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself these courageous words inspired confidence in the countrys new leader at a time when financial institutions were on the brink of collapse.
jump starting the economy involved restoring confidence in the banking system putting people to work and keeping businesses afloat.
following hoovers lead fdr established a cooperative relationship between the government and business and provided federal money for banks and businesses.
but unlike hoover he was willing to provide jobs through extensive public works programs and to fund temporary direct relief for average citizens.
revamping banking and financial institutions by the time fdr took office americans had lost nearly 2 5 billion in 9 000 bank failures.
the new president declared an immediate bank holiday on march 6 1933 that closed the nations banks for a week.
an obedient congress quickly passed emergency banking legislation that allowed only banks with the federal reserves stamp of approval to reopen.
i can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress fdr told the public in his first fireside address.
when the holiday ended millions of americans demonstrated their faith in the president by depositing more money than they withdrew in the weeks that followed.
capitalism a fdr adviser said later was saved in those eight days it was the governments job to straighten out this situation fdr told radio listeners.
his administration soon proposed more reform measures to inspire public confidence in the nations banks.
the glass steagall act of 1933 created the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insuring the accounts of small depositors in member banks.
the fdic still exists.
the same legislation protected the deposits of ordinary americans by separating investment and commercial banking so bank officials could no longer make speculative loans or stock purchases with depositors money.
this provision was repealed in 1999.
finally the new deal tackled the problems caused by an unregulated stock market that had contributed to the crash of 1929.
laws established the securities and exchange commission sec and reformed the practices of buying and selling stock.
the sec required companies to disclose financial how did fdr reform the nations banking and financial institutions.
details to potential investors so they could make an informed stock purchase.
the sec also regulated the practice of buying stocks on margin.
reforms in home mortgage lending practices probably had a more immediate impact on the lives of ordinary americans than stock market reform.
in 1933 40 percent of homeowners were on the brink of losing their homes to bank foreclosures.
in response fdr created a program that refinanced one out of every ten home mortgages and spread the payments over 20 years instead of the usual five.
designed to encourage americans to purchase homes and thereby boost the construction industry the federal housing authority fha founded in 1934 offered insurance to private lenders who financed home mortgages for new homes.
fha backing allowed creditors to reduce the down payment required lower interest rates and lengthen the life of the loan.
these government supported initiatives helped form the modern mortgage lending practices that enabled the percentage of americans who owned their own homes to increase by one third over the next 40 years.
father charles coughlin many businessmen and bankers supported these reforms because they renewed public faith in the basic structures of capitalism.
with internal squabbles dividing its members the communist party never effectively challenged the new deal.
instead the most influential challenger on the left to new deal banking reforms was father charles coughlin.
a popular radio priest from detroit who spoke with an irish brogue father coughlin gave sermons on a weekly radio program that drew audiences of 30 to 40 million.
in 1934 he received more mail read the document franklin d roosevelt radio address 1933 recovering from the depression helping industry and people besides shoring up banks fdr also immediately sought to get people back to work.
as the graph 22 9 reveals fdr faced the most severe jobs crisis in american history.
at first he followed in hoovers footsteps.
the reconstruction finance corporation continued to make loans and began buying bank stocks to help banks acquire the liquid capital unemployed persons as a percentage of the civilian labor force 25 great depression 20 15 10 5 2000 4 1 vietnam war 0 1900 5 world war ii world war i than anyone in the united states including roosevelt most of it from adoring fans making donations to coughlins cause.
coughlin singled out financiers and international bankers as the culprits who caused the depression.
the popularity of his relentless attacks on the elite helped push fdr increasingly to the left during his first administration.
following the lead of the populists of the nineteenth century see chapter 17 coughlin focused on how existing currency and banking arrangements helped bankers but hurt the common people.
with currency in short supply average citizens had to work harder to pay off their debts.
putting more money into circulation made sense in the midst of a depression.
bankers however held firm to their orthodoxy that all sound economies were based on the gold standard which required that money be redeemable in gold thereby limiting the amount of money that the government could print or coin.
coughlin proposed a revaluation of the price of gold and the monetization of silver letting people also redeem paper money in silver which was cheaper and more plentiful than gold to allow the government to put more dollars into circulation.
finally he wanted to nationalize the banks to take money lending out of the hands of private bankers.
coughlin initially supported the new deal in sermons like the new deal is christs deal and praised the president when he took the country off the gold standard in 1933.
fdr welcomed coughlins support at first but eventually grew tired of the priests impromptu visits to the white house.
as their relationship soured coughlin began criticizing the administration for doing too little to rein in powerful banking and capitalist interests.
many of his followers begged him to reconsider his break with fdr before they withdrew from the short lived third party that he headed.
by 1938 coughlins star was in decline.
his broadcasts became increasingly strident filled for the first time with anti semitic diatribes against an imagined international jewish banking conspiracy.
he stayed on the air until 1942 when his bishop ordered him to cease all political activities.
needed to stay open.
the national recovery administration nra established by the 1933 national industrial recovery act was the cornerstone of fdrs efforts to devise a hoover like cooperative solution to the crisis.
suspending antitrust laws the nra established industrial boards for each sector of the economy that brought competitors together to set prices production quotas and wages.
architects of the nra believed these industrial codes would stop manufacturers from cutting wages to subsidize lower prices a practice that reduced the purchasing power of workers contributing to overproduction and under consumption.
when prices rose without a corresponding increase in wages however many americans became unhappy with the nra.
even the larger corporations that benefited from the price codes remained leery of it fearful that the agency might force them to negotiate with labor unions.
to everyones relief the supreme court declared the nra unconstitutional in 1935 ruling that it delegated too much read the document father charles e coughlin a third party 1936 22 9 soaring unemployment this graph reveals the historically high unemployment rate during the great depression.
in the 2008 2011 recession unemployment figures also climbed dramatically amid fears of another depression.
why did new deal banking reforms and relief programs generate criticism.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 power from the legislative to the executive branch and regulated more than interstate commerce.
fdrs reading of the public mood encouraged him to depart from hoovers policies and offer direct financial relief to individuals out of work.
fdr encouraged americans to write to him and in their correspondence destitute americans bared painful details of their poverty and often asked for specific items such as a coat or shoes.
attuned to the widespread misery fdr created the federal emergency relief administration fera which worked with state governments to distribute direct relief to the unemployed.
although many americans were grateful for this help applying for relief or a dole was humiliating for previously self sufficient working people.
even at the height of the depression accepting relief carried the stigma of personal failure.
although they envisioned the roots of poverty differently both conservatives and progressives viewed relief with suspicion.
conservatives felt that laziness alcoholism lack of ambition and a poor work ethic created a class of indigent poor undeserving of help.
progressives thought that dismal living and working conditions caused the poor to turn to drink or succumb to apathy but believed that handouts would further discourage workers from trying to support themselves.
one could feel sympathy for the poor therefore and still worry about the negative consequences of distributing charity or relief.
like many of his contemporaries fdr disliked using federal monies to fund direct relief.
he always preferred federal programs that employed the poor to those that simply handed out food or money.
in 1935 he decided to stop providing direct cash grants to the needy.
to dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic a subtle destroyer of the human spirit fdr told congress.
from this point on the states handled relief while the federal government tackled the problem of putting employable persons to work.
putting people to work to the dismay of conservatives and the gratitude of the unemployed the new deal created a variety of programs each administered by a different agency that provided 15 million jobs during the depression.
the civil works administration cwa civilian conservation corps ccc and public works administration pwa were all founded in 1933.
during its four month existence the cwa provided jobs that helped more than four million workers survive the winter of 1933 1934 and stemmed growing unrest among the unemployed.
the ccc which lasted until world war ii focused on giving economically disadvantaged young men a chance to gain work experience.
it undertook major reforestation projects constructed campgrounds restored historic battlefields and stocked rivers and lakes with fish.
the pwa run by harold ickes funded public works projects especially roads and buildings to help revive the construction industry.
after deciding in 1935 to fund only work relief programs roosevelt created the works progress administration.
the wpa managed by harry hopkins was a major public works program that from 1935 to 1943 employed more than eight million workers one fifth of the workforce.
during its existence the wpa constructed 200 000 buildings and bridges along with 600 000 miles of roads.
it also funded the arts subsidizing painters and writers.
thanks to massive new deal government spending on work relief and the subsequent strengthening of consumer spending power the economy began gradually recovering in the mid thirties.
i gave the best part of my life to the american country and i spent every cent i made here.

view the image ccc worker 1938 recovering from the depression 22 10 turning a corner like most depression era post office murals this one celebrated workers as the backbone of the nation.
my interest artist joe jones noted was in portraying man at work his job before him and how he goes about it with his tools man creating even permanent government agencies put americans to work during the depression.
the treasury department for instance hired artists to decorate post offices throughout the nation.
edward bruce who directed the program wanted to enrich the lives of all our people by making beauty part of their daily lives when they visited the post office.
post office murals celebrated working americans and their communities but eschewed controversial themes like class conflict.
in rural areas these murals projected images of prosperous farmers running family farms.
joe jones painted turning a corner 22 10 for the anthony kansas post office a mural that showed a farmer using a tractor to harvest a field of golden wheat before an approaching storm damaged his crops.
the mural made no reference to the drought or dust storms that ravaged farms during the thirties nor criticized farmers for overproducing and causing crop prices to fall.
instead jones celebrated farmers for growing the food that fed the nation and romanticized their relationship with the land.
americans disagreed over whether work relief was ruining or saving the country.
for critics of work relief the sight of wpa construction crew workers standing around talking instead of working led to jokes that wpa stood for we piddle around farmers looking for day laborers also complained bitterly that federal work relief often paid more than working in the fields.
many wpa employees however saw government provided jobs as a right that they had earned.
in a 1935 fortune magazine survey nearly 90 percent of lower middle class and working class respondents answered yes when asked do you believe that the government should see to it that every man who wants to work has a job roosevelt agreed to a point.
he consistently tried to terminate these programs at the slightest sign of recovery to rein in deficit spending remaining true to his conservative fiscal values.
the government reduced funds to the wpa when unemployment dropped in 1937 to 7 7 million from a high of 12 8 million in 1933.
however the sharp reduction in government spending combined with new taxes and higher interest rates caused the fledgling recovery to grind to a halt.
during the subsequent 1937 recession automobile production declined by 50 percent steel by 70 percent rubber by 40 percent and the unemployment rate rose to 9 5 million 17 percent of the working population.
with no federal funds for new relief projects available new jersey issued licenses to beg on the streets.
the next year fdr restored public works funding.

reforms in the agricultural sector also outlived the immediate crisis part of fdrs commitment to save american capitalism and create greater security for the average man than he has ever known before in the history of america americans from all walks of life however questioned the governments desire to help displaced farm workers.
handling the farm crisis 22 11 approaching dust storm ominous clouds of dirt descend on a small town in colorado during one of the dust storms that plagued the plains states and the southwest in the thirties.
the storms killed livestock and kept people inside for days.
assisting farmers protected an american way of life that had strong mythic connections to the nations beginnings as a land of opportunity.
farmers received more direct aid than any other group during the depression.
the agricultural adjustment act aaa of 1933 tried to ensure that farmers earned an adequate income by paying them to take land out of cultivation which the administration hoped would cause crop prices to rise.
when reducing acreage failed to sufficiently lower output fdr approved laws that established marketing quotas for each commodity.
if farmers tried to sell more than their allotted quota they were hit with a heavy fine.
the administration departed temporarily from this approach when the supreme court ruled the aaa unconstitutional in 1936.
the court decided that the tax on food processing plants used to how did fdr tackle the problems of rural america.
finance the acreage reduction program violated the tenth amendment by usurping regulatory rights reserved for the states.
congress passed a second aaa in 1938 but by the mid 1930s the problems facing farmers in parts of the country had changed.
in the dust bowl drought and soil erosion caused massive dust storms across southern and plains states throughout the thirties.
during one storm in may 1934 experts estimated that the winds transported 350 million tons of soil from the west to the east.
dust fell like snow on chicago the sun was obscured in washington d c and ships 300 miles out to sea reported dirt settling on their decks.

each storm left piles of dead cattle and wildlife view the map interactive map the great depression a new deal for farmers in its wake as residents barricaded themselves inside their houses with damp towels over their mouths to avoid suffocation or wore red cross provided gas masks.
but even these precautions did not completely prevent deaths from occurring when a duster hit.
to encourage better farming practices the government began paying farmers in the dust bowl to plant soil improving crops like legumes instead of traditional cash crops such as wheat cotton and tobacco that exhausted the soil.
in one innovative program the government planted 220 million trees in a 100 mile wide swath from childress texas to the canadian border.
these trees stopped western dust from traveling east by cooling the air and reducing the wind velocity of dust storms.
bringing electricity to rural areas was another way the new deal improved daily life for the rural poor.
most of the urban population had electricity to ease the daily tasks of pumping water and washing clothes advantages available to only one in ten rural families in 1930.
begun in 1933 the tennessee valley authority tva was a government owned utility company that provided thousands of jobs as it built dams that generated power provided flood relief and created recreational lakes throughout the seven states tennessee alabama mississippi kentucky virginia north carolina and georgia serviced by the tennessee river.
these areas soon enjoyed good fishing cheap electricity and relief from debilitating floods.
government sponsored low interest loans enabled rural cooperatives to string electrical lines and manufacture power.
the women went around turning the switches on and off noted an observer after one home received its hookup.
the light and wonder in their eyes was brighter than that from the lamps by 1941 almost half of all american farms had access to electricity a figure that rose to 90 percent by 1950.
native americans were another rural population aided by new deal policies.
commissioner for indian affairs john collier pressed successfully for passage of the 1934 indian reorganization act that ended the land allotment policies sanctioned under the 1887 dawes act see chapter 15 and returned some self government to indian reservations.
the stage was set for a gradual rebirth of native american cultures in the twentieth century.
overall new deal subsidies improved farm owners lives.
farm income doubled from 2 billion in 1929 to 4 6 billion in 1939.
although farmers still made only 37 5 percent of what nonfarm workers earned farming had become a much more profitable business.
these agricultural policies created unexpected problems however by helping landowners at the expense of tenant farmers and farm laborers whose services were no longer needed once the government began paying farm owners to take land out of cultivation.
the farm security administration helped a few tenants purchase land offering share croppers a way to break out of the traditional cycle of debt that bound them to landowners.
but millions of tenant farmers and farm laborers white and black had to find their own way out of the crisis.
hitting the road over 2 5 million farmers hit the road in search of work in the thirties.
besides families traveling together in cars nearly 250 000 teenagers usually young men rode the rails by hopping into empty freight cars.
constantly on the move these youths found companionship in hobo jungles homeless encampments as they looked for jobs lived off handouts and sometimes stole to get by.
nearly 400 000 americans left farming areas in the middle of the country and headed to california.

the united states was the only nation in the history of the world that ever went to the poorhouse in an automobile quipped the cowboy humorist will rogers.
california state officials tried to discourage migrants.
near tulsa oklahoma a billboard on route 66 the main highway that migrants took west proclaimed no jobs in california if you are looking for work keep out 6 men for every job no state relief available for non residents the signs did little to discourage families from heading to california.
most new california arrivals settled into the nomadic life of the migrant worker traveling an average of 516 miles during the six month harvest season.

when the government tried to create camps that offered migrants better and cleaner facilities some californians objected.
growers worried that concentrating migrant workers in government run camps would make it easier for them to organize unions and strikes.
other californians believed that improving living conditions would draw even more displaced farmers to their state.
in 1935 california based photographer dorothea lange began taking photographs for the resettlement administration to document migrant workers suffering and arouse the publics sympathy.
this photo 22 12 shows a father from arkansas changing the tire on his truck as he and his seven reducing competition from immigrants seeking work was another way the government tried to help native born farm workers.
in 1929 the government effectively ended legal immigration from mexico for the duration of the depression to protect jobs for american citizens.
foreshadowing todays debate over the benefits and drawbacks of immigration california officials argued that alien workers held jobs that should go to native born americans.
owners of large farms disagreed predicting that they would face a serious labor shortage if they lost their traditional workforce since few americans wanted these jobs.
anti immigration forces prevailed.
faced with the offer of a free trip back to their original homes financed by the united states and mexico or the option of staying in a country where employment options had dwindled thousands of mexican workers accepted repatriation.
local and federal officials arrested and then deported others who had entered the country illegally.
with the advent of the new deal immigrants interest in voluntary repatriation dwindled.
new deal regulations made legal aliens eligible for food relief although most public works programs gave jobs only to citizens.
overall approximately 415 000 mexicans left the united states during the 1930s both voluntarily and involuntarily.

chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 reforms to ensure social justice in 1935 the new deal moved beyond measures intended to help the nation recover from the depression to policies designed to correct basic inequities in american society and provide security to ordinary americans.
reforms protected unions guaranteed many elderly a government pension established a minimum wage for factory workers and abolished child labor.
the momentum for these new deal reforms came from the growing strength of left leaning politicians unions and senior citizens who were unafraid to press fdr to adopt their vision of a more just society.
the challenge from huey long share our wealth roosevelts move to the left toward the end of his first administration was partially a response to the popularity of father coughlin and senator huey long of louisiana.
before he became a senator long was an adored although corrupt governor of louisiana who provided free school textbooks built roads and hospitals and curbed the power of the states oil industry.
they do not merely vote for him a reporter wrote of louisianans in 1935 they worship the ground he walks on long supported the new deal at first but his dissatisfaction with the pace of change and his own political ambitions caused a break with fdr.
as an alternative to the new deal long proposed his share our wealth plan to redistribute money from the rich to the poor.
long wanted to limit every person to 1 million in income and 8 million in capital investments each year.
the government would confiscate all other personal income and corporate profits and redistribute 2 000 annually to every american family.
besides offering americans a guaranteed income long also championed oldage pensions expanded veterans benefits a shorter working day and government support for education.
he created a share our wealth society and claimed a membership of five million promising to make every man a king long argued that under his plan the rich would still enjoy a life of luxury and even published a budget for a family of four on 1 million a year to show that they could easily afford 10 000 of jewelry each season and a new 100 suit a day.
yet even the great fortunes amassed by the richest americans were too small to support the kind of program long proposed.
despite the flaws in his plan long tapped into public anger how did critics from the left shape the social justice programs of fdrs second administration.
at the rich whom many blamed for causing the depression and long standing resentments about the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.
long never had a chance to challenge fdr as a third party candidate however because a disgruntled man who detested long assassinated him on the steps of the louisiana state capitol in the fall of 1935.
i wonder why he shot me long asked before he died a question the assassin killed on the spot by longs bodyguards could never answer.
competing visions sharing the wealth explores the depression era debate over redistributing income.
social security alongside the larger than life personas of huey long and father coughlin stood dr francis townsend an unassuming sixty six year old physician who organized a campaign for old age pensions in 1933 after seeing three old women outside his house in long beach california rummaging through the trash.
the combined activism of these three men and the support each enjoyed convinced fdr in 1935 to create a comprehensive social welfare system that protected the aged the unemployed and those unable to care for themselves.
townsends call for government pensions for the elderly set in motion a powerful grassroots it is hard to be old and not have anything a woman from north dakota writing to roosevelt reforms to ensure social justice competing visions sharing the wealth should money be redistributed from the haves to the have nots.
during the depression many americans answered a resounding yes below are two views reflecting different visions of how income redistribution might affect american capitalism and democracy.
what justification or objection does each give for redistributing wealth throughout the population.
in this 1935 radio address senator huey long outlines his proposal to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor.
we find not only the people going further into debt but that the united states is going further into debt.
and with it all there stalks a slimy specter of want hunger destitution and pestilence all because of the fact that in the land of too much and of too much to wear our president has failed in his promise to have these necessities of life distributed into the hands of the people who have need of them.
but we have been about our work to correct this situation.
that is why the share our wealth societies are forming in every nook and corner of america here is what we stand for in a nutshell number one we propose that every family in america should have a home and the comforts of a home up to a value of not less than around 5 000 or a little more than that.
number two we propose that no family shall own more than three hundred times the average family wealth which means that no family shall possess more than a wealth of approximately 5 million none to own less than 5 000 none to own more than 5 million.
number three we propose that no family will have an earning of less than around 2 000 to 2 500 and that none will have more than three hundred times the average less the ordinary income taxes which means that a million dollars would be the limit on the highest income.
we also propose to give the old age pensions to the old people not by taxing them or their children but by levying the taxes upon the excess fortunes to whittle them down and on the excess incomes and excess inheritances so that the people who reach the age of sixty can be retired from the active labor of life we also propose the care for the veterans including the cash payment of the soldiers bonus.
we likewise propose that there should be an education for every youth in this land and that no youth would be dependent upon the financial means of his parents in order to have a college education.
view the closer look competing visions sharing the wealth in the following letter to eleanor roosevelt a woman from columbus indiana protests that governmentdistributed relief robbed hardworking honest men to help good for nothing loafers dec 14 1937 mrs roosevelt we have always had a shiftless never do well class of people whose one and only aim in life is to live without work.
i have been rubbing elbows with this class for nearly sixty years and have tried to help some of the most promising and have seen others try to help them but it cant be done.
we cannot help those who will not try to help themselves and if they do try a square deal is all they need and by the way that is all this country needs or ever has needed a square deal for all and then let each one paddle their own canoe or sink.
as for the old people on beggars allowances the taxpayers have provided homes for all the old people who never liked to work where they will be neither cold nor hungry much better homes than most of them have ever tried to provide for themselves.
they have lived many years through the most prosperous times of our country and had an opportunity to prepare for old age but they spent their lives in idleness or worse and now they expect those who have worked like slaves to provide a living for them and all their worthless descendants.
there is many a little child doing without butter on its bread so that some old sot can have his booze and tobacco some old sot who spent his working years loafing around pool rooms and saloons boasting that the world owed him a living during the worst of the depression many of the farmers had to deny their families butter eggs meat etc.
and sell it to pay their taxes and then had to stand by and see the dead beats who qualified for relief carry it home to their families by the arm load and they knew their tax money was helping pay for it.
is it any wonder the taxpayers are discouraged by all this penalizing of thrift and industry to reward shiftlessness or that the whole country is on the brink of chaos.
what competing images of the poor do long and this indiana woman offer.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 22 13 three steps to security this 1936 poster deliberately emphasized the monthly check workers would receive during retirement not the payroll deductions that would reduce their take home pay to help finance immediate pensions for the elderly.
for many working class americans their final years had always been a steady decline into poverty.
unable to work due to age illness or the unwillingness of employers to hire them most relied on family members or charities to survive.
the plight of the aged assumed crisis proportions when depression era bank failures swept away much of their savings.
townsend clubs formed to promote government pensions for the elderly barraged congress with petitions signed by ten million supporters sending a clear message to the president and legislators in washington d c sensing an opportunity to enact other reforms long championed by the left roosevelt attached some controversial measures to the bill that provided pensions for the elderly.
unwilling to risk voting against the extremely popular pension proposal conservative congressmen grudgingly voted for a law that also provided unemployment benefits assistance to the disabled and aid for dependent children.
fdr wanted to help the deserving poor needy americans legitimately entitled to public support a category open to differing interpretations.
what made someone deserving of aid in the new social security system.
this poster 22 13 urging americans to apply for their old age benefits clearly noted that only industrial workers working for a salary or wage were eligible for the new pension program.
the system did not cover agricultural and domestic workers until 1950 a concession to southern and agricultural business interests who claimed they could not afford the mandatory employers contribution to their employees social security accounts employers paid half.
the social security act of 1935 also set the following criteria for its other categories of aid being laid off not fired for cause from an industrial job being physically disabled or a widow not an unwed mother with children to raise.
the social security pension system operated along the same lines as private insurance by collecting premiums from individual subscribers in the form of payroll taxes.
the public embraced social security as a system that simply returned these earlier deposits to retirees.
retired workers however began receiving checks in 1940 clearly too soon for them to have paid enough to cover the costs of their pension benefits.
ida may fuller a retired legal secretary received the nations first social security check for 22 54 after paying a total of 24 75 in payroll taxes.
she collected more than 22 000 in social security checks before she died at age 100 in 1975.
supporting unions political pressures from the left and empathy for the poor had encouraged roosevelt to create the social security system.
these same forces influenced the president as he faced a different set of choices concerning the standoff between business and labor.
his desire to curtail political challenges from the left and solidify his voter base by building a new coalition that included unions encouraged roosevelt to choose the side of labor in this simmering industrial dispute.
business leaders open hostility to new deal who was considered part of the deserving poor in the new social security system.
reforms to ensure social justice relief and public works programs also prompted fdr to ally himself with labor in 1935.
when he proposed a heavy tax on the rich again inspired by long the business elite denounced the wealthy president as a traitor to his class fdr openly mocked his opponents when running for reelection in 1936.
i should like to have it said of my first administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match.
i should like to have it said of my second administration that in it these forces met their master declared roosevelt in his last campaign speech before defeating the republican candidate kansas governor alf landon.
the general publics antipathy to the rich was captured perfectly in this photo 22 14 by dorothea lange of a gas station in kern county california which displayed a sign declaring this is your country dont let the big men take it away from you next to the free air pump.
roosevelts actions matched his rhetoric.
throughout the great strikes of the nineteenth century the federal government had usually sided openly with industrialists to break workers movements.
thanks to legislation passed during the new deal the federal government suddenly became labors friend.
the national industrial recovery act 1933 the same law that created the nra provided the first hint of things to come by declaring that workers had the right to organize and bargain collectively.
labor officials often referred to this section of the law 7 a as the magna carta of organized labor because it recognized a right that many industrialists still refused to acknowledge.
issued in 1215 the real magna carta established the basic liberties of englishmen.
when the supreme court declared the national industrial recovery act unconstitutional fdr signed the wagner act 1935 a law sponsored by senator robert wagner d ny to increase the purchasing power of workers by giving them the power to negotiate for higher wages.
the wagner act created the national labor relations board nlrb to supervise unions elections for their collective bargaining agents.
the law prevented employers from firing or blacklisting workers who joined a union or from infiltrating unions with spies.
with this government protection the union movement exploded.
between 1933 and 1941 union membership rose from 2 9 million to 8 7 million workers.
in 1938 fdr went even further with the fair labor standards act which established a national minimum hourly wage set initially at 25 cents rising gradually to 40 cents set maximum hours for the workweek 44 hours and outlawed labor by children under 16 with some exemptions such as newspaper carriers.
aimed at industrial workers the act excluded agricultural and domestic workers.
fdr again demonstrated political savvy in maneuvering the bill through congress.
he attached the controversial wage and hours measures to a bill prohibiting child labor knowing that few congressmen would vote against such a popular measure.
22 14 this is your country this sign reflected the general resentment toward the rich that encouraged roosevelt to attack business and support unions in 1935.
how did government support of unions change during the 1930s.
chapter 22 a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 the resurgence of labor government regulation gave crucial support to unions but the task of building a successful labor movement lay with workers.
overcoming workers fears that they would lose their jobs if they joined a union posed a significant hurdle for all organizers.
when the united auto workers uaw took on henry ford a strident opponent of unions organizers passed out handbills assuring workers that the wagner bill is behind you.
now get behind yourselves ford had offered the best terms of employment with his 5 a day wages and eighthour workdays in the 1910s and revolutionized american industry with his introduction of the assembly line see chapter 18.
by the thirties however workers in unionized auto plants had much higher wages and guaranteed benefits.
ford ruled his plants with an iron fist and in 1937 when five labor organizers tried to pass out handbills to workers entering the ford motor plant in dearborn michigan 40 members of the companys private security force attacked them.
as seen in this photo 22 15 the guards unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks throwing each man face first onto the pavement before tossing him down a set of stairs.
one mans back was broken and another recounted how two men held his legs apart while the security guards kicked him repeatedly in the groin.
a few news photographers managed to smuggle out photographs of the attacks thwarting the attempt by fords security force to confiscate their film.
the shocking images caused a public outcry.
the nlrb ordered ford to stop interfering with union organizing but securing industry wide recognition of the uaw required more dramatic action at ford motor company and elsewhere.
fords antiunion intimidation had worked in the past but by the mid 1930s many workers were ready to fight back.
in 1934 alone 1 5 million workers participated in 1 800 strikes.
support from the government helped the labor movement grow but so did a new vision of who could join a union.
the american federation of labor afl was a craft based union that accepted only skilled workers like carpenters or cigar makers who practiced a trade.
excluding unskilled workers from the labor movement made little sense once assembly line mass production began to dominate the manufacturing process.
john l lewis head of the united mine workers argued that to become truly powerful unions needed to find room for unskilled workers no matter their race or ethnicity.
when the afl expelled lewis for trying to organize these groups he formed the congress of industrial organizations cio a new type of labor union that organized workers within an entire industry rather than by their trade orientation.
within two years of its founding the cio boasted 3 7 million members as compared to 22 15 ford security guards attack labor organizers fords guards pull a labor organizers jacket over his head to immobilize his arms as they pummel him.
signaling new support for the labor movement the federal government intervened after this photo was published.
why were the cios innovative organizing and strike tactics effective.
read the document investigation of strikebreaking 1939 reforms to ensure social justice the 3 4 million workers who belonged to the afl.
cio organizers warned the diverse ranks of unskilled workers not to fall for their employers old tricks.
the man working beside you be he negro jew or pollock polish is a working man like yourself you work together fight together one cio labor organizer told steelworkers.
we were making a religion of racial unity noted another cio official.
in sharp contrast to its enlightened racial views the cio joined with the afl in urging women to voluntarily leave their jobs so men could have them.
the cio did however reverse the labor movements indifference to electoral politics.
now that the government was actively supporting unions keeping sympathetic officials in public office became a major cio goal.
recruiting members became easier when the cio devised new methods of collective action that bore results.
automobile workers seized the spotlight when they pioneered a new and effective tactic the sit down strike.
during a sit down strike workers occupied a factory to paralyze production lines and prevent strikebreakers or management from entering the building.
because sit down strikes caused the employer as well as his striking employees to lose money this tactic brought employers to the negotiating table more quickly than traditional picket lines.
nearly 400 000 workers participated in sit down strikes in 1937 alone causing time magazine to comment that sitting down has replaced baseball as the national pastime when the uaw took over the main general motors plant in flint michigan in 1937 the governor of michigan and fdr who had just received 84 percent of the votes cast by organized labor and 81 percent from low income voters in the 1936 presidential election refused to authorize the use of troops to retake the plant.
by standing with the strikers fdr solidified his support among the working class.
within six weeks general motors capitulated and recognized the union.
ford finally recognized the uaw in 1941.
having lost the battle on the ground the automobile companies fought back through the courts.
in 1939 the supreme court ruled that sit down strikes were illegal seizures of property.
the union movements successes in the automobile steel and textile industries markedly improved the daily lives of workers but even with these gains workers had few material comforts compared to laborers today.
by 1941 factory workers earned an average of 1 449 a year enough watch the video video lecture responding to the great depression whose new deal.

a new deal for african americans as late as 1932 most black northern voters few african americans could vote in the south remained loyal to the republican party and herbert hoover.
four years later gallup polls estimated that 76 percent of northern blacks had voted for fdr.
what had fdr done to deserve this newfound loyalty among black voters.
little it seemed at first glance.
during his first administration powerful southern democrats in congress prevented fdr from proposing any civil rights legislation or guaranteeing equal treatment by new deal agencies.
still new deal programs offered african americans more federal and state aid than they had ever received before.
southern blacks usually received smaller relief payments than whites but before 1933 most state agencies had given them nothing.
in the 1936 presidential election democrats emphasized the benefits that the new deal had brought to the african american community proclaiming on billboards do not bite the hand that feeds you eleanor roosevelts well known interest in civil rights also helped draw black voters to fdr.
when black voters abandoned the republicans for the democratic party they joined the new deal coalition a political partnership formed in the mid1930s among liberals trade unionists catholics and northern blacks that redrew the nations political map.
the strength of the new deal coalition increased fdrs freedom to pursue his legislative agenda.
in the newly elected 75th congress he did not need a single southern or republican vote to pass new deal legislation.
as the black vote gained new importance to the democratic party the administration became more responsive to african american demands.
during fdrs second term public works projects hired more black workers.
fdr also appointed the first black federal judge and convened an unofficial black cabinet to investigate civil rights abuses and advise him on racial matters.
nonetheless racial discrimination continued to plague the lives of african americans in why did many african americans switch from the republican to the democratic party in the 1930s.
chapter 22 22 16 theres no way like the american way in 1937 this photo captured the irony of trumpeting america as the land of opportunity for whites while needy black citizens stood in line at a soup kitchen.
a new deal for america the great depression 1929 1940 the thirties.
in margaret bourke whites 1937 photo 22 16 black residents wait for emergency relief during the louisville kentucky flood while above them a billboard poster shows a carefree well dressed white family driving a car.
the image symbolically showcased the racial divide that remained intact throughout the decade.
the fate of the scottsboro nine nine black teenagers accused of rape by two young white women while riding on a freight train through alabama in 1931 underscored the persistence of racial prejudice.
the naacp and the communist party took up their defense in well publicized court cases while the nine struggled to survive inmate violence chain gangs and guard abuse.
the last of the scottsboro nine was not freed until 1950.
the supreme court weighs in in 1936 fdr won reelection with 61 percent of the popular vote carrying every state except maine and vermont.
by the late 1930s gallup public opinion polls offered another way besides elections to measure support for the president and his policies.
envisioning evidence interpreting public opinion polls indicates strong faith in fdr among the working class.
the same could not be said of the supreme court.
of the nine justices four consistently opposed new deal what role did the supreme court play during the new deal.
legislation and two remained unpredictable.
by 1937 the court had declared two major pieces of early new deal legislation the nra and aaa unconstitutional.
with lawsuits against the wagner act and social security act on the courts docket roosevelt decided to act.
suggesting that advanced age rather than conservative ideology was hampering the work of the court fdr proposed increasing the number of justices to a maximum of 15 by adding one new justice for every one over age 70 who had served more than ten years on the court.
with the conservative bloc all over age 70 roosevelts plan would either increase the size of the court or force the older justices to retire.
either way he would have a chance to appoint judges who were sympathetic to the new deal.
dubbed the court packing scheme by detractors the clash consumed a whole session of congress and ended with a resounding defeat for fdr.
he always maintained that though he lost the battle he won the larger war with the court.
as congress debated his proposal to add more justices the supreme court surprised everyone by upholding the constitutionality of the wagner act and the social security act.
over the next few years death and retirement gave fdr the chance to appoint seven justices.
the fallout from the court struggle had negative repercussions for the president however.
although the court began upholding new deal legislation the battle alienated progressive republicans who had previously supported the president and pushed conservative democrats into an alliance with likeminded republicans.
in 1938 republicans narrowed the democratic majority in congress.
the bipartisan conservative coalition was now strong enough to thwart new reform initiatives and begin cutting expenditures for new deal recovery programs.
the new deal thus ground to a halt in 1938 after five years of public policy initiatives experiments and reforms.
the federal government was now an active presence in the lives of millions provoking a debate that continues into the twenty first century over the proper role of the government in the economy and who is deserving of help.

previous polls had based their accuracy on collecting as many responses as possible.
relying on new statistical sampling theories gallup instead interviewed small 3 000 4 000 demographically representative groups in person and through mail questionnaires.
gallup viewed popular opinion polls as a way for the plain people of the united states to communicate directly to their elected representatives but gallup played a critical role in that conversation.

looking into the water cowper suddenly felt a stab of terror when he spotted a german torpedo just seconds before it hit the ship.
peering through the periscope the german submarine captain watched hundreds of people jumping into the water in a desperate attempt to reach empty lifeboats.
the ship sank within 18 minutes killing 1 198 passengers including 128 americans.
cowper a toronto newsman whose vivid recollections soon appeared in american newspapers was one of the lucky survivors.
the sinking of the lusitania was a defining moment for the united states during world war i often also called the great war.
the nation had remained neutral when the war began nine months earlier in august 1914 refusing to chose sides among the european powers involved led by great britain france and russia the allies on one side and germany and austria hungary the central powers on the other.
when however the war spread to the high seas and american business initiated a lucrative arms trade with britain and france americans increasingly found themselves in the line of fire.
american newspapers highlighted the tragic deaths of innocent women and children on the lusitania stirring outrage against germany.
one u s news report described the corpse of a mother embracing her three month old baby noting that her face wears a half smile.
her babys head rests against her breast.
no one has tried to separate them this description inspired the first american war era propaganda poster pictured here.
the image by fred spear showed a mother and her baby sinking into the depths of the sea accompanied by one word enlist not all americans however blamed germany for the attack.
german americans claimed that the lusitania was secretly transporting munitions from new york to britain.
rural americans castigated northeast business interests for trading primarily with the allies fearful that favoring britain and its allies would draw america into the war.
president woodrow wilson offered a competing vision of the lusitanias importance.
through increasingly strident diplomacy wilson decided to defend the rights of neutrals to travel wherever they liked.
this stance put the united states on a collision course with germany that resulted in america entering the war two years later.
once america declared war wilson gave the country a larger purpose than defeating germany.
introducing a new and controversial vision of american global leadership he promised to achieve a lasting peace by spreading democracy worldwide.
to mobilize the nations resources to fight the grim trench warfare underway along the western front the government unfurled a far reaching propaganda campaign offered unprecedented support to labor unions and raised a mass army through conscription.
americans suffered severe casualties in a short time and their war effort helped the allies defeat germany by november 1918.
the nation expected a peace treaty that embodied wilsons promise to make this conflict the war to end all wars americans held conflicting visions however over how to achieve this goal.
the world must be made safe for democracy president woodrow wilson 1917 war address chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 the decision for war in the summer of 1914 europe ignited as war swept across the continent 20 1.
instead of the easy victory that many europeans expected the war turned into a prolonged global struggle that took the lives of millions of men.
world war i pitted the allies initially composed of britain france belgium serbia and russia and eventually totaling 18 nations including japan italy and the united states against the central powers of germany and austria hungary who were joined by the ottoman empire and bulgaria.
most europeans rushed into battle without considering what a general war would mean.
americans however followed a completely different road to war openly debating whether this was their war to fight.
it took two and a half years for the united states to enter the war.
by then few illusions remained about the horror of modern warfare.
unlike europeans in 1914 americans knew they were committing to total war and that winning would require the complete economic and psychological mobilization of the home front.
the war in europe on june 28 1914 a 19 year old bosnian serb named gavrilo princip arrived in sarajevo the capital of bosnia as part of a terrorist band that intended to assassinate the heir to the austrohungarian throne archduke franz ferdinand who was also visiting the city.
princip belonged to the black hand a slavic nationalist group based in the neighboring kingdom of serbia that longed to unite bosnia then part of the austro hungarian empire with serbia.
the groups first attempt to assassinate the archduke failed when the bomb that one of princips coconspirators threw at the archdukes motorcade bounced off the side of his car injuring two austrian officers instead.
eluding the police princip disappeared into the crowd.
later in the day the archduke made a fateful decision to visit his injured staff members.
on the way to the hospital the driver made a wrong turn down a narrow street and slowed down to put the car in reverse.
standing at the end of the street was princip who could barely believe his good fortune as he saw the archduke and his wife coming toward him.
seizing the opportunity he stepped forward pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired killing them both.
world war i began with these two deaths and ended four years later with over nine million more.
in responding to the assassination austria hungary russia and germany tried to leverage the crisis to fulfill longstanding territorial ambitions.
these events are summarized on the timeline countdown to war 1914 20 2.
what role did nationalism and imperialism play in bringing about world war i.
mayor it is perfectly outrageous.
we have come to sarajevo on a visit and have had a bomb thrown at us archduke franz ferdinand after surviving the black hands first assassination attempt austria hungary and russia vied for control of the balkans which offered ready access to the mediterranean and the middle east.
germany hoped to become the dominant power in europe and had recently challenged the world dominance of france and britain by building a strong navy acquiring colonies and defeating france in the 1870 1871 franco prussian war.
austria hungary held serbia responsible for the assassination and demanded that the serbian government make amends.
in response serbia chose appeasement over confrontation.
serbia accepted all of austria hungarys demands except the one insisting that austro hungarian judges and police participate in the investigation and trials of any black hand terrorists captured in serbia.

why did the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand spark a global world war.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 is removed his comments came too late.
an hour later on july 28 1914 austria hungary declared war on serbia.
as austro hungarian warships on the danube river bombarded belgrade serbias capital city russia resolved to stand by serbia and defend its own interests in the balkans.
tsar nicolas ii ordered a general mobilization of his army on july 30 1914.
it was a momentous decision.
germany viewed russias mobilization as a direct threat.
ever since the 1894 alliance between russia and france germany had worried about fighting a two front war.
in 1905 the german chief of staff alfred von schlieffen developed a plan that called for germany in the event of war to attack and quickly defeat france in the west while the cumbersome russian army mobilized in the east.
the schlieffen plan avoided the well defended border between france and germany and instead sent german troops on a northward arc.
passing quickly through belgium german troops would enter france through its unfortified northern border and capture paris within six weeks.
germany could then turn its full forces against the much larger russian army.
for the schlieffen plan to work germany needed to strike first.
with russia refusing to halt its mobilization germany declared war on russia on august 1 1914 and put a modified version of the schlieffen plan into motion.
two days later germany declared war on france.
when german troops crossed into belgium on august 4 britain declared war on germany fulfilling its 1839 pledge to guarantee belgium independence and neutrality.
the schlieffen plan quickly unraveled.
the germans encountered unexpected resistance from the belgians and had difficulty resupplying a mass army on the move giving the french and british time to mobilize.
in the east russia attacked with its partly mobilized army sooner than germany expected prompting german chief of staff helmuth von moltke to divert troops from france to defend east prussia.
at the marne river 35 miles northeast of paris the french and british successfully stopped the german drive toward paris.
instead of defeating france quickly germanys attack ignited a general european war.
as each army dug defensive trenches in france and belgium the trench deadlock of the western front took shape.
for nearly four years men would live and die in the complex system of earthworks that ran for 460 miles from the north sea to switzerland.
to bolster their forces britain what miscalculations stymied german expectations of a short war.
france and germany began immediately enlisting men and resources from their colonies.
when the ottoman empire which ruled turkey and most of the middle east joined the central powers and japan and italy joined the allies the conflict became a true world war.
american society contained many first and second generation immigrants from both the central powers and the allied nations who disagreed over which nation had started the war.
in 1914 president woodrow wilson believed that all belligerents shared collective responsibility for the war.
wanting both to stay out of the war and prevent bitter divisions from ripping america apart wilson proclaimed the united states neutral.
the perils of neutrality as war engulfed europe wilson advised americans to avoid passionately taking sides and to remain impartial in thought as well as action neutrality however turned out to be a difficult concept for americans to define and maintain.
did it mean trading with both sides selectively or with no one.
did americans have the right as members of a neutral nation to travel wherever they liked without coming under attack.
the conflicting visions that emerged as americans confronted these questions created strident debate as the war wore on.
the dilemma was how to remain neutral without inflicting serious damage on the american economy.
since the 1890s american foreign policy had focused on protecting american business interests abroad see chapter 19.
cutting off trade completely with europe would have had severe consequences for americans.
at first wilson tried to limit americas financial involvement in the war by banning private american bank loans to the belligerent nations.
secretary of state william jennings bryan believed the ban would hasten a conclusion to the war by making it impossible for the warring countries to buy what they needed to continue fighting.
wilson however lifted the ban in 1915.
the allies were running short of cash and wilson feared a widespread u s recession if these nations stopped buying american goods.
trading with or loaning money to both sides was another possible way to stay neutral.
in theory american manufacturers and banks were free to do business with both the allies and germany.
in practice however the chart of u s exports to europe 1914 1917 20 3 reveals that they chose primarily to help the allies.
by 1917 american banks were loaning the decision for war u s trade with nations at war 1916 figure as a percentage of 1914 figure britain 594 271 863 911 794 954 1 526 685 102 257 france 159 818 924 369 397 170 628 851 988 393 italy 74 235 012 184 819 688 269 246 105 364 germany 344 794 276 28 863 354 288 899 0 08 u s exports to europe 1914 1917 the nations robust trade with britain france and italy allied nations fighting germany provoked debate among americans holding conflicting visions of neutrality.
italy joined the allies in april 1915.
britain an average of 10 million a day.
in contrast american trade with germany had dropped to less than one percent of what it had been in 1914.
even if american manufacturers and banks had wanted to help germany trade became nearly impossible when britain used its navy to blockade germany and cut the international cable between the united states and germany.
americas financial elite however had no desire to trade with both sides.
many upper class americans revered british culture and had warm feelings toward the french.
widespread publicity of german atrocities against belgian civilians also fanned anti german sentiment.
newspapers published vivid accounts of german soldiers burning homes ransacking museums and executing belgian civilians in retaliation for guerilla attacks against the german army.
the press embellished these stories with fabricated tales of german soldiers cutting off womens breasts and childrens hands.
some americans saw such reports as little more than british propaganda.
americas disproportionate aid to the allies alarmed the sizable german american and irish american communities the latter hated british rule of ireland.
midwesterners and southerners accused eastern banks of violating the principle of neutrality thereby pulling the nation slowly into a war most americans did not want to fight.
these critics embraced a strict vision of neutrality and wanted the government to announce an arms embargo that would prevent american companies from trading with nations at war.
when the war spread to the high seas these conflicting visions provoked heated debate over americas role in the war.
facing a trench stalemate on the western front britain used its superior navy to establish a blockade around the central powers that included mining the north sea.
the blockade immediately affected american trade.
american ships could not sail through the north sea to germany without first allowing the british to search their cargo for contraband merchandise such as guns or ammunition that britain wanted to stop from entering germany.
britain soon violated international law by adding cotton and food to the contraband list.
in march 1915 wilson formally protested british blockading practices.
the british eventually agreed to buy enough american cotton to offset the loss of the german market.
the president proved less accommodating when germany declared the waters around britain a war zone and threatened to attack any ship that entered the area.
to combat the british blockade germany turned to a new weapon its u boat or submarine to launch surprise torpedo attacks against allied merchant and naval ships.
international law recognized a naval blockade as a legal weapon of war but required that the attacking ship give the merchant vessels crew time to evacuate and if necessary take them aboard before sinking the ship and cargo.
these prewar rules rendered the u boat useless removing the element of surprise that made it so effective.
once spotted armed merchant vessels did not hesitate to attack fragile u boats.
on may 7 1915 a german u boat sunk the lusitania a british passenger ship sailing off the coast of ireland.
calls for war swept through the press.
germany must surely have gone mad surmised one richmond newspaper.
wilson sent a what competing visions did americans offer on the question of trading with warring european nations.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 the american people do not want to go to war to vindicate the right of a few people to travel or work on armed vessels missouri senator william j.
stone to president wilson 1916 20 4 german warning to travelers in the war zone when wilson criticized germany for sinking the lusitania german americans pointed out that the german government had published warnings like this ahead of time urging americans to stay off ships headed to the war zone.
series of notes demanding that germany pay reparations and accept the right of americans to travel on any ship they wished.
the germans defended the sinking pointing out that they had published warnings to passengers in american newspapers 20 4 and claiming that the lusitania was carrying munitions as part of its cargo.
the lusitania sinking was an ideological turning point for the united states.
in reaction to the crisis wilson redefined the meaning of neutrality thus putting the united states on a collision course with germany.
the president moved away from his initial definition of neutrality as remaining impartial in thought as well as action he now embraced neutrality as a concept that first and foremost gave neutral nations the indisputable right to trade and travel wherever they liked.
secretary of state bryan urged wilson to ban americans from traveling on ships headed to the u boat patrolled waters around great britain.
wilson refused.
convinced that the presidents preoccupation with the rights of neutrals would lead to war bryan resigned in protest.
why was the sinking of the lusitania a turning point in the neutrality debate.
i cannot consent to any abridgement of the rights of american citizens in any respect.
the honor and self respect of the nation is involved wilsons reply as the united states and germany argued over the lusitania a german u boat sunk another british passenger ship the arabic in august 1915 leaving two americans among the dead.
worried about further provoking the united states on september 1 1915 germany issued the arabic pledge promising not to sink passenger ships without warning.
germany renounced surprise attacks on merchant ships in may 1916 following another controversial torpedoing.
for the moment these pledges averted war with the united states.
the debate deepened when prominent pro ally political business and financial leaders formed the national security league and began lobbying for universal military training to instruct all men of fighting age in drilling and marksmanship.
in response progressive reformers formed the american union against militarism to denounce preparations for war.
the appeal of the pacifist vision made the 1916 song i didnt raise my son to be a soldier a hit.
taking stock of the preparedness versus peace debate congress authorized only a modest but still controversial expansion of the peacetime army.
recognizing the potency of antiwar sentiment wilson ran for reelection in 1916 on the slogan he kept us out of war the banners covering a wilson reelection campaign truck 20 5 revealed the strong connections that he drew between domestic and foreign issues.
wilson reminded voters of his progressive reform agenda which included a federal reserve system that broke the money trust and passage of an eight hour day for railroad workers see chapter 18.
the slogan peace with honor referred to his success in securing pledges from germany that respected americas right to trade with the allies.
this overseas commerce created the prosperity that democrats boasted about on the same sign.
during the campaign wilson noted that twice he had sent his trusted advisor view the closer look choices and consequences defining neutrality americas path into world war i the decision for war colonel edward house to europe to negotiate a peace settlement lamenting that house had returned empty handed each time.
wilson also campaigned on the slogan of preparedness to underscore his commitment to defending the country if necessary.
in contrast wilsons republican challenger former supreme court justice charles evan hughes never developed an effective slogan or theme.
the hughes campaign believed that woodrow wilson had won the presidency in 1912 because progressive republicans had supported theodore roosevelts run as a thirdparty progressive candidate over the incumbent republican president william howard taft see chapter 18.
with the conservative and progressive factions of the republican party now reunited hughes tried to avoid controversy with vague calls for law and liberty and undiluted americanism on election night with returns from california still uncounted wilson went to bed certain that he had lost.
he awoke to discover that he had carried california and won reelection by only 23 electoral votes 277 254.
foreign affairs now dominated wilsons thoughts.
throughout 1914 1917 german spies spent nearly 12 million to support rebel factions in mexico who resented the u s governments intervention in mexican domestic politics.
in 1916 francisco pancho villa raided american border towns hoping to draw u s troops into mexico and destabilize the new u s backed constitutional government headed by venustiano carranza.
much as villa anticipated wilson sent a 12 000 troop punitive expedition under the command of brigadier general john j pershing into mexico to arrest villa.
carranza denounced the american expedition as an invasion of mexico.
tensions between the two countries escalated dramatically after a deadly clash in carrizal on june 21 1916.
wilson began planning for war with mexico until he learned that american watch the video video lecture american entry into world war i 20 5 wilson campaign slogans in a tight race for reelection in 1916 woodrow wilson emphasized his progressive legislative agenda and championed his success at keeping the nation out of the war without sacrificing national honor or economic prosperity.
troops had attacked first at carrizal.
after months of talks between u s and mexican negotiators american troops left mexico in january 1917.
that same month wilson tried again to negotiate a european peace settlement.
on january 22 1917 he outlined a plan for peace without victory based on american principles american policies democracy freedom of the seas no entangling alliances and equality of rights among nations were wilson asserted the principles and policies of forward looking men and women everywhere of every modern nation of every enlightened community wilsons desire to export democracy overseas while simultaneously protecting american access to foreign markets promised to greatly expand americas imperial reach.
no longer limiting american intervention to its pacific colonies or nearby latin american countries see chapter 19 wilson proposed remaking europe in the image of america.
his words had little effect on european leaders.
unbeknownst to the president germany had how did wilson link domestic and foreign issues during the 1916 presidential campaign.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 already decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare.
having staked everything on germanys willingness to let americans travel unmolested in the war zone wilsons neutrality policy collapsed.

america enters the war it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war 20 6 lincolns birthday this cartoon suggests that wilson like lincoln faced a difficult decision of leading the country into war to defend higher principles.
why did the united states finally decide to fight germany.
read the document the zimmermann telegram the decision for war contradictions in wilsonian idealism.
like other world leaders wilson advanced principles that protected the interests of his own country.
yet he also demanded sacrifices from americans to make wilson claimed that the united states had no this the war to end all wars once they joined the selfish ends to serve by going to war.
skeptical global association of nations that wilson proposed voices from revolutionary russia soon prompted americans would have to modify their traditional wilson to defend this claim.

chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 the war at home america could not mobilize supply and feed an army without granting new powers to the federal government.
the federal government used a mix of incentives threats and patriotic appeals to negotiate the preexisting class gender and racial conflicts that threatened to make wartime cooperation difficult.
official propaganda urged unity but americans retained conflicting visions about regulating big business unionizing female suffrage and racial equality.
gearing up for war 20 7 little americans do your bit this propaganda poster showing a three year old saluting a bowl of corn based porridge underscored the total mobilization of american society.
wilsons democratic rhetoric convinced many progressive reformers that they could count on the president to use his wartime powers to rein in big business see chapter 18.
the president however feared that the war would make corporations more powerful than ever.
we shall be dependent upon the steel oil and financial magnates wilson privately worried.
they will run the nation his concerns were well founded.
increased wages and federal protections for unions improved the lives of many workers but the resurgent power of big business prevented progressives from making these wartime reforms permanent.
in the winter of 1917 gridlock paralyzed the railroad system.
blizzards fuel shortages and poor coordination among private railway companies prevented trains from delivering tons of war related freight.
labor unrest also created havoc as skilled railway workers left in droves for better paying factory jobs and railway unions prepared to strike.
to sort out this mess the federal government took over management of the railroads for the duration of the war.
the railroad administration met union demands for high wages standardized equipment and coordinated the use of tracks.
to improve the flow of needed materials the new war industries board wib ranked industries so that those most critical to the war effort received raw materials ahead of nonessential wartime businesses.
steel for example went first to manufacturers producing guns and ships while factories making civilian cars freezers and corsets they needed steel for the inner stays had to wait.
the government paid railroad companies handsomely for wartime use of their trains and track to mute their objections to government management of the railroads.
when private companies regained control of railroad lines in 1920 the nations railroad network lay in shambles a victim of heavy wartime traffic and the governments failure to maintain the lines.
food administration director herbert hoover chose a different path to ensure that the country produced enough to feed civilians at home soldiers and refugees overseas.
congress had given the president near dictatorial powers to regulate the food and fuel industries in the 1917 lever food and fuel act.
hoover however opted to use high prices and patriotic appeals to control the nations food supply rather than rationing.
to stimulate production he had the american and allied governments pay high prices for agricultural goods.
to curb civilian demand hoover organized a massive propaganda campaign around the slogan food will win the war citizens signed pledge cards vowing to observe wheatless mondays meatless tuesdays and porkless saturdays.
urging americans to conserve wheat for shipment overseas the food administration plastered the country with posters that tried to popularize cornmeal which did not transport well as a tasty substitute for wheat flour.
the agency offered housewives cornmeal recipes and cooking classes and even tried to enlist the cooperation of finicky toddlers 20 7 by urging them to eat cornmeal instead of oatmeal.
what varying strategies did the government use to mobilize economic resources.
the war at home americans responded well to hoovers patriotic appeals to conserve food but whether the government could quell labor unrest for the duration of the war remained questionable.
wilson quieted industrial class conflict by throwing money at the problem.
the steel copper petroleum and meatpacking industries enjoyed a healthy increase in profits once they began selling their products to the government.
wilson also offered industrialists still bristling over progressive era laws that curtailed monopolies and regulated working conditions see chapter 18 an olive branch by giving them a role in setting the governments wartime price wage and production codes.
labor also benefited during the war.
the government built high wages and union protection into its wartime contracts in exchange for a no strike pledge from labor.
the national war labor board made up of representatives from government business and labor required industries that accepted government contracts to honor the eight hour day and fortyhour week.
these companies also had to pay a living wage maintain high safety standards and recognize a unions right to recruit members at work.
not all labor groups benefited equally from the sudden government attention.
official support for collective bargaining helped the more moderate unions that formed the american federation of labor.
radical labor groups that continued to oppose the war suffered when the government arrested their leaders and members for sedition.
even the gains for moderate labor unions proved fleeting however.
workers received higher wages but after adjusting for wartime inflation real wages only increased four percent.
when the war ended and the government canceled its contracts workers lost federal protection for organizing unions.
without the government stopping them many manufacturers quickly returned to their old union busting ways see chapter 21.
black migration immigrants had long provided american industry with inexpensive labor.
the war disrupted the flow of immigrants to the united states just when the demand for industrial goods exploded.
in 1914 1 2 million immigrants entered the country.
in 1917 only 110 618 arrived.
labor recruiting agents soon turned to white and black southerners to fill the void.
during the war over 500 000 african americans migrated from southern farms and cities to the north lured by high paying industrial jobs.
the african american painter jacob lawrence celebrated this mass exodus in a series of paintings he completed in the 1940s.
his first painting showed brightly dressed streams of families preparing to board trains through doors marked chicago new york and st.
louis 20 8.
many migrants exalted at their newfound freedom in the north.
i can quit any time i want one noted without forfeiting a years pay as in the sharecropping system.
another man realized that in chicago he was no longer afraid to rub up against a white person accidentally on the street or sit down next to one on a streetcar.
in the south he had constantly feared the consequences of an unintended breach of southern racial etiquette.
migrants also discovered however that despite the absence of overt segregation or intimidation racial prejudice existed in the north.
20 8 the first wave of the great migration 1916 1919 around the time of wwi many african americans from the south left home and traveled to cities in the north in search of a better life wrote artist jacob lawrence to explain this 1940 painting.
view the map atlas map african american migration how did workers and unions fare during the war.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 the migration of southern blacks northward also unveiled regional and class tensions within the black community.
working through organizations like the urban league and the young mens christian association paternalistic northern middle class blacks tried to help southern migrants adjust to the rhythms of industrial jobs and urban life.
besides wanting to genuinely assist recent arrivals middle class blacks worried that migrants rural customs might harm the reputation of the entire northern black community.
a list of dos and donts published by the chicago defender a newspaper serving the african american community entreated migrants to watch their language mind their manners respect the law keep their houses clean and send their children to school.
the urban league had reason to fear that racial rioting might accompany the arrival of black workers from the south.
the explosive combination of economic competition housing shortages and latent racial hostility triggered racial riots in northern cities during the war.
the most deadly one occurred in east st louis illinois in july 1917.
in east st louis companies recruited immigrants and southern blacks to undermine union activism.
company owners knew that racial and ethnic prejudices would prevent native born whites from allowing these new workers to join their unions which in turn undermined the unions ability to mount a strike.
viewing black migrants as potential strikebreakers white workers initiated minor attacks on black workers that escalated into a full fledged racial riot on july 2 1917.
the antilynching black crusader ida b wells barnett interviewed over 50 black eyewitnesses for a report that she submitted to congress.
one witness recalled seeing black men exit homes with their hands raised.
as they pled for their lives mobs stoned them to death.
overall the riot left nine whites and 39 blacks dead and hundreds wounded on both sides.
the subsequent congressional investigation held white employers labor leaders and politicians responsible but 6 000 african americans left the city anyway.
female suffrage the war inadvertently provided an opportunity for women to gain suffrage and for the temperance reform movement see chapter 21 where women held leading roles to build momentum.
mobilizing the home front meant securing the active cooperation of women.
during the war savvy female leaders successfully parlayed their newly recognized economic clout into a demand for political power.
women did the shopping and cooking in most homes so the food administration needed their full support for its food conservation efforts to succeed.
will you have a part in victory queried one propaganda poster above the image of a young woman in a stars and stripes gown scattering seeds in a victory garden to provide vegetables for her family.
over eight million women volunteered for red cross work producing surgical dressings sweaters socks and mittens for soldiers and refugees.
with workers in short supply companies increasingly recruited women to fill positions in factories and the government hired many as clerks.
in desperate need of laborers companies in bridgeport connecticut even hired airplanes to scatter leaflets throughout residential neighborhoods that urged housewives to apply for jobs in munitions factories.
overall however few homemakers entered the workforce.
instead the eight million women already at work shifted positions taking advantage of new albeit temporary opportunities to work at better paying and higher skilled jobs.
suffragists wanted the nation to thank women for their war work by giving them the right to vote.
the vision of an engaged female citizenry working to defend the nation reduced the appeal of longstanding arguments against votes for women.
in the past the close ties between female suffragists and the temperance movement had led some urban and midwestern males to resist enfranchising women because so many women supported prohibition.
the south feared that female suffrage meant extending the right to vote to black women.
other opponents argued that the male head of the household adequately represented his familys interests in the public domain holding fast to a vision of women as primarily domestic not public figures.
in the 1910s the middle and upper class women leading the suffragist movement had divided into radical and conservative factions see chapter 18 and each offered a competing vision of how to obtain the vote for women.
for months members of the militant national womans party stood outside the white house with banners asking how long must women wait for liberty once the united states entered the war militant suffragists turned wilsons democratic rhetoric against what class and regional tensions existed in the african american community.

wilson hoped to convince the delegates to keep russia in the war so democracy could triumph over autocracy in europe.
the suffragists instead focused on the recent introduction of female suffrage in russia urging the envoys to help us make this nation really free by convincing wilson to support female suffrage.
daily scuffles broke out between outraged war supporters and the picketing suffragists whom the press vilified as unpatriotic.
after the police arrested the suffragists the women initiated a hunger strike to protest their poor treatment in prison.
when accounts of prison guards forcing feeding tubes down the throats of suffragists leaked out wilson pardoned them.
unbowed the female militants burned him in effigy at the white house gates.
the more moderate national american woman suffrage association nawsa followed a different tack.
it presented the vote not as a question of equality or democracy but as a way to reinforce the traditional desire of women to protect their families see chapter 18.
the nawsa also seized on wartime prejudices against german americans whose loyalty many americans increasingly questioned.
it is a risk a danger to a country like ours to send 1 000 000 men out of the country who are loyal and not replace those men by the loyal votes of the women they have left at home nawsa president carrie chapman catt proclaimed.
all these arguments eventually swayed wilson.
in september 1918 he became the first president to endorse national female suffrage convinced that womens supposedly pacifist nature could help secure his postwar goals for a lasting peace.
congress sent the nineteenth amendment which granted women the right to vote to the states on june 4 1919 seven months after the war ended.
final ratification came on august 26 1920.
rallying the public to control the flow of information and shape public opinion about the war wilson formed the committee on public information cpi.
headed by george creel a progressive muckraking journalist the cpi disseminated propaganda posters press releases and films.
it translated its pamphlets into multiple languages to reach the nations huge immigrant population.
the agency also recruited socalled four minute men to speak before audiences in movie halls markets fairs and churches.
the cpi limited each speech to four minutes to fill the time that it took to change the reels for silent films in movie theatres.
creel estimated that 75 000 fourminute men gave nearly seven million impassioned speeches during the war on topics such as german submarine warfare and german espionage.
hollywood helped the propaganda effort by making movies like to hell with the kaiser which depicted the german leader as a depraved lunatic who receives a much deserved punch in the mouth from the american soldier who captures him.
the government also used war bond campaigns to win over hearts and minds.
rather than read the document the struggle for womens suffrage 20 9 suffragists picket the white house the radical wing of the suffragist movement criticized wilson who claimed that an allied victory would spread democracy for refusing to support female suffrage.

wartime propaganda also questioned the patriotism and masculinity of men who refused to serve.
what made these wartime posters effective propaganda.
in his war address wilson told the american people that we have no quarrel with the german people but he also privately predicted that a nation couldnt put its strength into a war and keep its head level it had never been done the government soon plastered the country with propaganda posters that relied on negative images of germany and germans to rally support for the war.

chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 20 10 tarring and feathering a german american german american farmer john meints from luverne minnesota sued the members of the mob that tarred and feathered him and they eventually paid him 6 000 in 1922 to settle the case.
some americans took matters into their own hands attacking german americans and their businesses.
in the wars most infamous incident of vigilante justice a mob murdered robert prager in collinsville illinois after he challenged the local mining union for expelling him because of his german descent.
when the first attempt to hang prager failed the assailants granted his request to write a letter expecting him to detail a plot to dynamite a mine.
instead prager wrote to his mother and father who still lived in germany.
dear parents he wrote in german i must on this fourth day of april 1918 die.
please pray for me my dear parents the murder went unpunished.
to protect themselves from similar assaults many german american families changed their names stopped teaching german to their children and purchased war bonds.
germans americans occasionally fought back.
responding to rumors that german american farmer john meints would not buy war bonds 75 of his luverne minnesota neighbors abducted him one summer evening in 1918.
driving meints to the south dakota border the mob beat whipped and finally tarred and feathered him.
ignoring warnings to leave the state forever a defiant meints sued his assailants for 100 000 in 1919.
he used these photos as evidence of the assault 20 10.
after the presiding judge told the jury what challenges did german americans and anti war activists face during the war.
that the evidence was overwhelming in support of the contention that meintz sic was disloyal the jury acquitted the defendants even though they admitted taking part in the attack.
meints appealed and won a new trial in 1921.
rather than risk public censure now that the war was over his assailants paid him an out of court settlement of 6 000 in 1922.
besides routing out suspected spies the espionage and sedition acts also helped the federal government suppress pacifists who refused to give up opposing the war and radical political groups like the socialist party and industrial workers of the world that had long opposed capitalism.
the master class has always declared the wars the subject class has always fought the battles declared eugene debs the leader of the socialist party.
during the debate over declaring war before passage of the espionage act members of congress had uttered similar denunciations of the rich and powerful.
but as punishment for uttering these words in 1918 a federal judge sentenced debs to ten years in prison.
debs became a hero in some quarters for his steadfast opposition to the war.
in 1920 two years after the war ended debs made his fifth and final bid for the presidency from his jail cell and received one million votes.
president warren harding pardoned him in 1921.
hear the audio the speech that sent debs to jail fighting the war fighting the war germany had good reason to assume that it would take time for the united states to pose a threat on the western front.
the country confronted significant challenges raising and training an army quickly.
in 1917 the american armed forces numbered just over 300 000.
over the next 19 months however the military grew to more than four million and arrived overseas in time to prevent a german victory.
raising an army when the nation entered the war the government faced the choice of raising its armed forces with volunteers instituting conscription immediately or waiting until enlistments began to flag before turning to a draft.
in previous wars the government had selected the third option.
wilson however chose to implement conscription immediately.
he knew that the united states needed to supply the allies with troops munitions and food.
the draft gave the government the power to decide who worked in essential wartime industries and who went into the army.
letting individuals decide might deprive industry of its best workers or leave the military understrength once the initial enthusiasm for enlisting subsided.
to combat the impression that conscription forced reluctant men to fight the government renamed the draft selective service selective service the government repeatedly told the american public placed men where they could best serve the war effort.
to offer the public a visible demonstration of male patriotism all men registered publicly for selective service on the same day.
on june 5 1917 ship horns church bells and factory whistles rang out and crowds gathered to cheer for men filling out their draft registration cards.
three million men or 11 percent of the draft eligible population refused either to register or serve.
some went to jail others eluded authorities by changing jobs often.
the selective service act allowed conscientious objectors from recognized pacifist religious sects like the quakers to apply for noncombatant duty.
those who opposed fighting for philosophical or political reasons had no legal way to stay out of fighting units.
the most famous conscientious objector of the war was sergeant alvin c york who like 80 percent of drafted conscientious objectors eventually agreed to fight.
choices and consequences alvin c york deciding to serve page 610 explores yorks decision to serve in the army.
conscripts ultimately accounted for 72 percent hear the audio over there of the four million men in the wartime army.
overall 20 percent of draft eligible males ages 18 45 served in the wartime military 15 percent of the total adult male population.
youre in the army now in makeshift training camps across the country soldiers trained sometimes with wooden rifles and spoke eagerly of getting to france before the big show ended.
the army reflected the diversity of the american population.
approximately 18 percent of the entire force or one in five were foreign born.
nearly 12 000 native americans served composing only a small fraction of the total military force but representing nearly 25 percent of the native american male population.
sixteen thousand women went overseas as nurses telephone operators or welfare workers working in army canteens.
african americans made up 13 percent of the military though they were only 10 percent of the countrys population.
the army remained strictly segregated.
black soldiers received few chances to demonstrate bravery or leadership since 89 percent served as labor troops under mostly white officers.
although they received little recognition from white authorities these troops built the roads and bridges required to keep a modern army in the field.
in france many black troops discovered a more racially tolerant environment where white french had no qualms socializing with african american soldiers.
you now know that the mean contemptible spirit of race prejudice that curses this land is not the spirit of other lands noted the african american minister francis j grimk to a group of returning black soldiers.
the fear that black servicemen intended to bring the fight for democracy home provoked postwar riots and lynchings that often targeted black veterans in uniform.
determined to fight back against white supremacists black veterans helped forge a more militant postwar civil rights movement see chapter 21.
why did the government choose to draft the wartime army.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 choices and consequences alvin c york deciding to serve alvin c york grew up poor in the tennessee appalachian mountains where he became an expert marksman hunting wild turkeys in the forests.
he spent his youth carousing gambling and drinking.
as an adult he underwent a religious conversion and joined the church of christ in christian union a pacifist christian sect.
drafted six months before his thirtieth birthday york faced an agonizing decision on whether to fight.
i believed in my bible he said.
and it distinctly said thou shalt not kill but york acknowledged i wanted to be a good christian and a good american too choices request noncombatant duty as a conscientious objector.
refuse to perform any military duty.
agree to serve and fight.
decision like many men claiming conscientious objector status york faced intense pressure to fight once he entered a training camp.
after conversations about the bible with his commanding officers york decided that the biblical injunction blessed are the peacemakers overrode the sixth commandment prohibiting killing because the war promised to be the war to end all wars york agreed to fight.
consequences york became the most celebrated american hero of the war for his feats on the battlefield in france.
on october 8 1918 york was credited with killing 24 germans silencing 35 machine guns and capturing 132 enemy soldiers during the meuse argonne offensive.
surviving combat without a scratch reaffirmed yorks faith in god but on his deathbed he still wondered whether god would punish him for killing men in battle.
continuing controversies what is the ultimate meaning of yorks experience.
some historians note that yorks transformation from pacifist to warrior demonstrated that wilsonian ideals inspired many americans to fight in world war i.
with americans divided in 1941 before the japanese attacked the american naval base at pearl harbor hawaii over the merits of entering world war ii the hollywood film sergeant york sent the message that fighting to defend the country was a citizens christian and patriotic duty.
others note that york personified the poorly educated and underprivileged conscript who did the bulk of the fighting along the western front.
some believe that the army exaggerated yorks feats to boost morale.
rather than a what factors influenced yorks choice to serve.
cause for celebration his experience reveals the difficulty of becoming a conscientious objector during the war an experience repeated in future conflicts especially the vietnam war.
sergeant alvin c york with his mother in front of his home in tennessee fighting the war to help the army turn this polyglot force into a functioning military force civilian psychologists administered intelligence tests to soldiers in the training camps.
quickly assessing a recruits intelligence could help the army immediately identify whether a man was officer material or better suited for unloading boxes of supplies off ships in france.
to the psychologists surprise 25 percent of the soldiers had to take the test designed for illiterates.
most native born white soldiers had completed only seven years of school.
foreignborn men averaged 4 7 years and southern black men 2 6 years of schooling.
psychologists claimed their exams measured native intelligence but the questions suggest the tests primarily assessed level of education economic background and familiarity with mainstream american culture 20 11.
tabulated results claimed that the white american soldiers had a mental age of 13 while the average for russians was 11 34 for italians 11 01 for poles 10 74 and for american born blacks 10 41.
critics argued that the tests only showed that immigrants and blacks needed more comprehensive schooling.
social darwinists who used charles darwins ideas of survival of the fittest to establish a hierarchy of superior and inferior human races believed these figures validated their ideas about white northern european superiority.
after the war public schools began administering intelligence tests to determine the aptitude of their pupils a trend that continues today.
on the western front the united states entered the war at a critical moment.
the peace with russia gave germany a clear numerical advantage on the battlefield.
as u boats began sinking allied shipping indiscriminately the germans transferred over one million men from the eastern front with russia to the western front in france.
in march 1918 the germans accomplished what many had thought impossible they broke through the trench stalemate and began marching once again toward paris.

in july american soldiers fought with the french in what was it like to fight in the trenches along the western front.
a six week counteroffensive that pushed the german army back to where it had begun the spring offensives.
these campaigns initiated american soldiers to the reality of fighting along the western front.
men collapsed from the strain of continuous artillery bombardments and the sight of bodies blown to bits.
soldiers diagnosed with shell shock suffered from panic attacks and some could not sleep or speak.
private duncan kemerer arrived at a military hospital in such poor condition that the sound of a spoon dropping sent him frantically searching for cover under his bed.
american soldiers soon settled into the predictable routine of trench warfare.
the three dimensional trench shown in the feature envisioning evidence understanding the battlefield portrays the components of a working trench.
a strip of territory known as no mans land separated the allied and german trench systems.
the actual distance between the two lines averaged 250 yards.
scores of barbed wire entanglements covered this barren area which was filled with huge craters formed by artillery shells.
the u s army rotated soldiers putting them in the trenches for 21 days with a week to recuperate in the rear before their next rotation.
each day just before sunrise the men assembled and went on alert.
if dawn passed with no enemy attack then the men spent the day trying to stay out of sight from snipers and airplanes that strafed troops with machine gun fire.
by feasting on corpses rats grew to gigantic proportions and multiplied by the thousands.
troops became infested with lice and fleas.
adding to the misery of trench life the constant rain in northern france created a thick gooey mud in which troops had to stand and often sleep.

chapter 20 20 13 masked mailman during the 1918 influenza epidemic.
wearing protective masks did little to stem the spread of the microscopic influenza virus.
quarantining the sick at home or in hospitals proved more effective.
the great war world war i 1914 1918 every four shells fired on the western front contained poison gas.
troops especially feared mustard gas which caused painful burns on exposed skin and was deadly if inhaled.
slow moving tanks also made their first appearance on the battlefield but the war ended before either side could exploit their full offensive potential.
flu epidemic 20 14 antispitting campaign 1918.
trying to stem the influenza epidemic employers cooperated with public health officials by posting reminders that spitting spread germs.
in 1918 in the midst of mounting battlefield casualties the world suddenly encountered a new vicious killer.
without warning a lethal strain of influenza traversed the globe.
the virus became known as spanish influenza because the spanish press first reported its outbreak.
biologists speculate that the influenza germ began as a mutated version of avian bird flu in the american midwest in march 1918.
american soldiers carried the germ to france and the virus spread rapidly from europe to africa asia and central america.
nearly 25 million americans fell ill a quarter of the entire population and 675 000 died.
the virus also sickened over one million american soldiers hampering the overseas military campaign.
general pershing assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt and what impact did the flu epidemic have at home and worldwide.
president wilson all suffered from the flu but survived.
anecdotes of people who went to work healthy in the morning only to die before dinnertime illustrated how suddenly the lethal virus could strike.
influenza was usually most severe for children and the elderly segments of the population with weak immune systems.
this flu virus however attacked young adults especially hard making it particularly terrifying.
when the flu struck victims first felt pain in their muscles.
within hours high fevers made them delirious.
most victims recovered after weeks of bed rest but 25 percent developed influenza related pneumonia.
already weakened half of these patients suffocated to death when their lungs filled with fluid turning healthy pink tissue into blue sodden masses almost overnight.
influenza was an airborne virus that could easily penetrate masks or screens but scientists did not identify disease causing viruses until the 1940s.
instead medical experts incorrectly believed that droplets spread the disease reasoning that sneezes coughs or touching contaminated objects transmitted flu germs from person to person.
physicians consequently devised useless precautionary measures to prevent transmission such as spraying public areas with a topical disinfectant.
public officials closed movie houses schools churches and office buildings in an effort to contain the epidemic.
masked mailmen 20 13 and police became familiar sights on city streets and masked conductors refused to let unmasked passengers board streetcars.
posters like this one in a naval aircraft factory in philadelphia alerted people to the dangers of spitting 20 14.
in mid 1919 as suddenly as it had come the virus disappeared having run out of susceptible human beings to infect.
the spanish influenza pandemic had a catastrophic effect worldwide.
from 1918 to 1919 the disease killed 30 million people.
nine million men died in battle from 1914 1918.
the bloodiest war to date thus coincided with the deadliest influenza epidemic yet recorded.
view the image warning of influenza epidemic 1918 fighting the war the final campaigns in september 1918 the aef attacked at st mihiel see 20 12.
the battle reduced a bulge in the lines called a salient thereby weakening german defenses.
two weeks later the allies began a massive coordinated assault along the entire western front.
the americans hit the germans hard in the meuse argonne region while the british and french struck farther north and west.
advancing in heavily wooded and hilly terrain against dense german fortifications the american effort stalled.
regrouping the americans began pushing the germans back in october.
battle casualties averaged 2 550 a day with 6 000 americans dying each week of the 47 day meuse argonne offensive making it the most costly battle in u s history.
it was most assuredly the americans who bore the heaviest brunt of the fighting on the whole battle front during the last few months of the war the german general erich ludendorff later recalled.
besides making headway on the battlefield allied convoys also stymied the german unrestricted submarine warfare campaign.
instead of letting individual ships take their chances at sea british and american naval vessels began escorting groups of allied merchant vessels through u boat infested waters in convoys.
in november the german government requested an armistice.
on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918 the armistice went into effect and guns fell silent along the western front.
what overall contribution did american troops make to the final victory.
during the victory celebrations american enthusiasts wildly claimed that the united states had single handedly won the war.
allied critics contended that the british and french had dealt the final devastating blow on the battlefield.
the truth lay somewhere in between.
the americans may not have won the war for the allies but they certainly kept them from losing it.
at key moments in the german spring offensives in 1918 american soldiers helped stop the germans from taking paris.
american divisions provided key strength for the french led counteroffensives over the summer and in the meuse argonne campaign american soldiers leveled a devastating blow to the german army that helped make british and french advances to the north possible.
also important the prospect of fighting a million more fresh american recruits in 1919 convinced germany to seek a negotiated peace.
the allies bore a heavy cost for their victory.
the numbers of war dead france 1 3 million britain 722 000 and germany 1 8 million.
by comparison the 116 516 american deaths seem slight.
other figures tell a different story.
in the last six months of the war the american death rate jumped to 820 a day as u s troops experienced their share of brutal fighting fewer than the 900 frenchmen but more than the 457 british who died each day.
the america at war chart 20 15 suggests yet another way to assess the impact of the war on the united states revealing that more americans died on the battlefield in world war i than in korea or vietnam both much longer wars.

what role did the united states play in the allied victory.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 peace the armistice ended active fighting in western europe but the peace settlement took months to negotiate.
twenty seven nations and four british dominions sent delegates to the paris peace conference.
germany expected to join the negotiations but instead the terms of peace were determined in secret by the big four wilson french premier georges clemenceau the british prime minister lloyd george and the italian premier vittorio orlando.
the versailles peace treaty named after the palace outside paris where the treaty was signed required germany to pay reparations and disarm.
germany signed the treaty under protest on june 28 1919 the fifth anniversary of archduke franz ferdinands assassination.
in the end the flawed and controversial versailles peace treaty laid the groundwork for future conflict in europe and raised questions at home about the role america wanted to play in the world.
the paris peace conference woodrow wilson enjoyed worldwide popularity on armistice day.
throughout the united states and europe his idealistic pronouncements had raised hopes that the slaughter might pave the way for a lasting peace.
wilson broke with tradition and decided to travel overseas to negotiate the peace treaty himself rather than sending representatives to hash out the details.
as he toured paris london rome and milan newspapers greeted him as the savior of humanity british and french leaders however knew that four years of suffering had created a deep seated desire for revenge against germany within their nations.
the war had also hardened wilsons view of germany and he agreed to weaken postwar germany by eliminating its navy and colonies.
he disagreed however with the french insistence on eviscerating the german economy and military permanently.
certain that america had played a vital role in winning the war wilson felt confident asserting his right along with britain and france to shape the terms of peace.
british and french leaders however publicly downplayed americas contribution to defeating germany hoping to limit wilsons say in the peace treaty.
at the request of allied leaders the british and french press began printing disparaging reports about the american armys inexperience and leadership.
resentful over the allies apparent ingratitude for their wartime sacrifices americans postwar disillusionment grew as the treaty making process got underway.
wilsons domestic political problems weakened his negotiating position.
in november 1918 the republicans won control of congress despite wilsons plea to voters to return a democratic majority as a vote of confidence for his peace proposals.
the reasons for the republican victory were complex a result of unease with conditions at home and concern about wilsons ideals.
the democrats loss energized opponents of the league of nations a wilson supported collective security organization whose member nations agreed to mediate future international disputes to prevent wars and work together to improve global conditions.
domestic opponents of the league worried that by joining the international organization america would lose control over its own foreign policy and invite international meddling in the western hemisphere.
they also doubted that the league could maintain world peace.
league critics divided into two camps each offering conflicting visions of americas role in the postwar world.
isolationists led by republican senator william e borah from idaho preferred adopting an official policy of neutrality.
the isolationists believed that if the united states kept out of all foreign disagreements the country could avoid going to war in the future.
by contrast the faction headed by massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge the republican majority leader and chairman of the senate foreign affairs committee favored a return to the former balance of power system in europe.
lodge wanted the united states to help rebuild and perhaps join a strong alliance among democratic european nations that could contain germany indefinitely.
eager to shore up support for the league of nations at home wilson briefly sailed home to what opposition to his peace plan did wilson face overseas and at home.
peace confer with republican leaders who were still upset that he had not invited any leading republicans to join his negotiating team.
the possibility of compromise appeared slim.
lodge detested wilson whom he regarded as sanctimonious.
wilson returned the distain viewing lodge as narrow minded.
discussion soon stalled.
on the day before wilson returned to paris lodge handed the president a pledge signed by 39 senators who vowed to reject the league covenant in its present form.
hoping to appease his republican critics wilson managed to incorporate key republican demands in the final league covenant.
the covenant now stated that the league of nations would respect the monroe doctrine the 1823 american pronouncement that the western hemisphere was off limits to other world powers and allow nations to withdraw from the league.
wilson also tried outmaneuvering his domestic critics.
he opted against creating two international agreements a peace treaty and a covenant creating the league of nations that would each require a separate senate ratification.
instead wilson decided to incorporate the league covenant into the peace treaty.
the senate he gambled would never refuse to ratify the peace treaty even one that contained a controversial league of nations.
with his mouth open and his eyes shut i predict that he will make a senator when he grows up wilsons joke about his infant grandson touched upon his political troubles with republican senators allied leaders also pressured wilson to compromise.
to get them to accept the league wilson gave up his idea of peace without victory.
when supreme commander of allied armies marshal ferdinand foch read the harsh demands of the peace treaty he accurately predicted this isnt a peace its a twenty year truce the treaty required that germany pay reparations to french and belgian civilians for the mines factories and fields its troops had destroyed during the war imposed upon them by the aggression of germany this war guilt clause held germany alone responsible for starting world war i.
the treaty also forced germany to disarm.
the reparations committee set germanys initial bill at 33 billion in gold although commissions in the 1920s significantly reduced this amount.
the united states accepted no reparation payments and in the 1920s even loaned germany money to help it pay this debt.
the war guilt clause and the reparations bill created tremendous resentment in germany.
in the 1930s adolf hitler cultivated this anger to fuel a resurgent national fervor dedicated to restoring german economic and military strength.
other nations also left the conference feeling slighted.
italy resented the allies for denying it more austrian territory along the adriatic sea a humiliation that the fascist leader benito mussolini vowed to avenge when he took power in 1922.
japan protested the failure to incorporate into the league covenant a statement protecting the rights of nonwhite nations helping breed japanese resentment against the west.
in the middle east africa and asia the peace treaty transferred colonial possessions from the losers the ottoman and german empires to the victors britain france belgium and japan under a mandate system.
in theory the mandate system named a western nation as a league of nation trustee for territories in need of political instruction before they assumed the responsibilities of self government.
in reality the mandate system simply cloaked old style imperialism in the new rhetoric of self determination.
by redrawing the map of the middle east to expand their global influence britain and france set in motion political religious and cultural conflicts in the region that created tremendous strife throughout the twentieth century and beyond.
denying arab nationalist demands for independence france took control of lebanon and syria.
britain ruled transjordan present day jordan and brought together three distinct groups the kurds and sunni and shiite arabs who had previously lived in semi autonomous regions under the ottomans to form the kingdom of iraq under a puppet monarch.
when the british took over palestine they kept wartime promises to open up part of it to jewish immigration angering its arab inhabitants.
competing claims to this territory continue to this day.
the versailles treaty settled old territorial disputes in europe but the dismemberment of the russian german and austro hungarian empires created new sources of tension.
the map of eastern europe was redrawn to reflect what complaints did critics make about the versailles peace treaty.

what competing views do these political cartoons offer on the question of ratifying the versailles treaty.
chapter 20 the great war world war i 1914 1918 competing visions joining the league of nations in 1919 president woodrow wilson and republican senator henry cabot lodge debated the wisdom and value of joining the league of nations.
consider the exact wording of article x and then the differing interpretations of it offered by lodge and wilson.
what changes in american foreign policy does each foresee arising from the league.
are there any points of agreement between the two about the future world role of the united states.
article x of the league covenant ignited tremendous controversy over whether the united states should join the league of nations.
the members of the league undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the members of the league.
in case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.
lodge contended that the league covenant stripped congress of its power to declare war in this august 12 1919 congressional address.
we should never permit the united states to be involved in the internal conflict in another country except by the will of her people expressed through the congress which represents them.
with regard to wars of external aggression on a member of the league the case is perfectly clear.
there can be no genuine dispute whatever about the meaning of the first clause of article 10.
in the first place it differs from every other obligation in being individual and placed upon each nation without the intervention of the league.
each nation for itself promises to respect and preserve as against external aggression the boundaries and the political independence of every member of the league.
it is i repeat an individual obligation.
it requires no action on the part of the league except that in the second sentence the authorities of the league are to have the power to advise as to the means to be employed in order to fulfill the purpose of the first sentence.
we may set aside all this empty talk about isolation.
nobody expects to isolate the united states or to make it a hermit nation which is a sheer absurdity.
but there is a wide difference between taking a suitable part and bearing a due responsibility in world affairs and plunging the united states into every controversy and conflict on the face of the globe.
who has the more compelling argument regarding the league of nations wilson or lodge.
wilson defended the league in a speech on september 25 1919 in pueblo colorado that recalled the sacrifices of soldiers during the war bringing many in the audience to tears.
but you will say what is the second sentence of article 10.
that is what gives very disturbing thoughts the second sentence is that the council of the league shall advise what steps if any are necessary to carry out the guaranty of the first sentence namely that the members will respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of the other members.
i do not know of any other meaning for the word advise except advise the council advises and it can not advise without the vote of the united states as a member of the council.
whether we use it wisely or unwisely we can use the vote of the united states to make impossible drawing the united states into any enterprise that she does not care to be drawn into my friends on last decoration day i went to a beautiful hillside near paris where was located the cemetery of suresnes a cemetery given over to the burial of the american dead.
i wish some men in public life who are now opposing the settlement for which these men died could visit such a spot as that.
i wish that the thought that comes out of those graves could penetrate their consciousness.
i wish that they could feel the moral obligation that rests upon us not to go back on those boys but to see the thing through to see it through to the end and make good their redemption of the world.
for nothing less depends upon this decision nothing less than the liberation and salvation of the world.

permanently paralyzed on his left side he spent the rest of his presidency hidden in the white house.
wilson the british prime minister lloyd george remarked was as much a victim of the war as any soldier who died in the trenches the white house kept the presidents illness a secret issuing a vague statement that he was recovering from exhaustion.
for weeks however wilson only spent three hours a day out of bed and saw no one except his physician and his family.
his wife edith wilson controlled all correspondence reaching the president and helped compose his replies.
critics later accused her of serving as a shadow president during wilsons convalescence but she maintained that the president made every decision himself.
wilson rejected all private suggestions that he resign and still refused to accept any reservations to the versailles treaty.
with wilson absent from the public stage opposition to the league of nations spread.
his refusal to compromise doomed the treaty.
the senate rejected both the original treaty and one with lodges reservations attached.
the senate therefore never ratified the versailles treaty.
it also refused to accept armenia as a mandate despite wilsons plea to become the friends and advisors of a people ravaged by wartime turkish massacres and deportations.
it took two more years for the war to end officially for the united states.
in october 1921 the senate finally ratified separate peace treaties with germany austria and hungary the united states had never been at war with the ottoman empire or bulgaria.
nations that ratified the versailles peace treaty also agreed to join the league with the exception of germany which was not allowed to join until 1926.
the league remained headquartered in geneva switzerland from 1920 until 1946 when the united nations took its place.
wilson won the nobel peace prize in 1919 for his efforts to establish the league of nations but without american membership the league became little more than a place to air grievances.
wilson never regained his health and he died in february 1924.

novelists and journalists referred to these women as flappers an old slang term for young girls.
now it was used to describe independent young women who smoked drank danced to jazz and flaunted their sexual liberation by wearing revealing clothes.
rebellious postwar writers made flappers a cultural icon.
their youthful exuberance and daring behavior excited some americans and created a sense of moral outrage in others.

in return for this official protection the government demanded a no strike pledge from unions.
when the war ended in 1918 the government abruptly canceled its orders and withdrew from managing worker industrial relations.
the governments handsoff attitude emboldened many industrialists to reinstate low wages long hours and blacklists for union members.
to protect their war time gains unions orchestrated the greatest wave of strikes in american history in 1919.
although they rallied millions of workers to the picket lines out matched unions lost this battle.
industrialists accused unions of following in the footsteps of the recent russian revolution and trying to spread communism in the united states.
these accusations won industrialists the support of local governments who again forcefully broke up many picket lines.

in the early 1920s union ranks grew to five million the largest to date.
when faced with the dismal vision of unending labor strife progressives had crafted government regulation to rein in business and improve working conditions see chapter 18.
in the 1920s industrialists used the guarantee of government noninterference to pursue a different vision.
throughout the decade the harding and coolidge administrations left industrialists free to fashion their own solutions to such labor troubles adopting an openly pro business stance.
the wall street journal exulted that never before here or anywhere else has a government been so completely fused with business referring to commerce department workshops that helped businesses how did welfare capitalism promise to help industrialists run their factories more efficiently.
eliminate wasteful practices a justice department that largely stopped enforcing anti trust laws and a high protective tariff that made imported goods more expensive than american industrial products.
the progressive era effort to improve industrial efficiency however remained popular.
envisioning evidence scientific management in action shows how industrialists tried to standardize hiring practices by relying on the scientific insights of social darwinism.
innovative industrialists also tried to put aside the prevailing idea that the interests of capitalists and workers inevitably clashed.
rather than driving their workers relentlessly to secure a profit advocates of welfare capitalism suggested that industrialists offer a wide range of benefits such as medical insurance pensions and stock ownership plans to create a loyal workforce.
as the vogue for welfare capitalism spread many industrialists began to change their management practices.
to develop a stable well trained workforce industrialists introduced fringe benefits including paid vacations and sick pay created industrial committees where workers could air grievances and offered bonuses for workers who exceeded production quotas.
a worker usually needed at least 25 years with one company to qualify for a pension so this policy alone could potentially keep workers from leaving to pursue other job opportunities.
industrialists also experimented with offering employees stock options hoping to dilute class antagonism by making each worker an investor who would share in the companys profits.
despite workers enthusiasm for welfare capitalism the reality rarely matched the rhetoric.
seasonal layoffs continued wage rates fluctuated constantly and long hours in unhealthy factories persisted.

the new profession of psychology accepted pseudoscientific social darwinian ideas that race determined aptitude and the factory owner devised his own scientific chart to organize and run his business more efficiently.
rather than assessing the experience or capabilities of an individual an employment agent only had to consult this chart to match the right man with the right job.

americans instead increasingly relied on credit to buy cars radios and household appliances.
radio played a key role in forging a national mass culture.
over 60 percent of american homes acquired radios in the twenties which until 1924 required headphones.
americans from all walks of life now simultaneously gathered around their radios to learn election results.
baseball fans throughout the nation listened to the play by play of the world series radio broadcasts that made new york yankee player babe ruth a national hero.
farmers closely followed weather reports and bankers digested the days financial news.
there is radio music in the air every night everywhere one newspaper observed.
big companies like walgreen drugs and palmolive soap started sponsoring nationally syndicated radio shows to boost sales of their products.
these weekly comedies and dramas filled with plugs for the sponsors merchandise cultivated shared tastes in entertainment and products.
americans increasingly bought the same brand name toothpaste at a chain store like woolworths.
big business was not alone in recognizing the power of radio however.
local radio shows designed specifically for union members religious groups immigrant communities or african americans helped strengthen bonds within these subcultures as well.
movie stars and athletes enjoyed nationwide adulation in the twenties.
silent film actors like the comedian charlie chaplin the sex symbol rudolph valentino and americas sweetheart mary pickford became household names among a movie going public that avidly purchased fan magazines filled with glossy photos of their favorite stars.
by the end of the decade hollywood was producing films with sound a novelty highlighted in this 1929 poster 21 3 for the marx brothers first film.
the verbal repartee of the comedy trio delighted audiences.
as silent films disappeared so did the careers of many silent film stars whose artistic talents lay in physical not vocal expression.
meanwhile professional sports gave rise to a slew of national sports heroes such as the boxer jack dempsey.
in an era dominated by cultural heroes none rose to greater prominence than the pilot charles a lindbergh.
the age of flight charles a lindbergh the feats of pilot charles a lindbergh ushered the nation into the age of flight.
commentators called the sky the new frontier a label loaded with potent historical significance for americans.
by the late twenties a time when machines seemed to matter more than people the image of the lone pilot against the vast blue sky recalled the pioneer spirit of the nineteenth century.
lindbergh piloted his plane the spirit of st louis on the first ever nonstop solo flight from new york to paris on may 21 1927.

had we searched all america we could not have found a better type than young lindbergh to represent the spirit and high purpose of our people the jubilant american ambassador wired president coolidge amid the celebrations that followed lindberghs landing in paris.
lindberghs triumph assured americans that individual initiative still mattered and that technological advancement benefited humankind at a time when the recent industrialized slaughter on the western front see chapter 20 suggested otherwise.
the vision of planes serving a peaceful purpose by transporting mail and tourists replaced wartime images of aerial dogfights.
lindbergh toured the nation tirelessly to promote commercial air travel and in 1931 also flew flood relief missions in china with his wife the author anne morrow lindbergh to demonstrate the humanitarian good that planes made possible.
in exalting lindberghs achievement americans channeled their own conflicting visions of the modern age.
some praised lindbergh for exhibiting the same adventurous spirit that had propelled american pioneers across the west in the nineteenth century values that seemed increasingly at risk in a machine dominated age.
charles lindbergh is the heir of all that we like to think is best in america opined outlook magazine.
others including lindbergh rejected the idea that his flight epitomized a return to the past.
lindbergh asserted that his flight illustrated the nations industrial march forward the culmination he said of all that was practicable and best in american aviation although differing on whether the flight represented the revival of traditional values or the modern ethos of industrial might americans agreed that his flight renewed faith in the benefits of technology.
lindbergh suffered however in the public spotlight.
the 1933 kidnapping and murder of his firstborn son became the most reported tabloid story of the day.
later in the decade lindbergh tarnished his image by expressing anti semitism and admiration for nazi germany and joining with those who argued against american intervention in world war ii.
after japans bombing of pearl harbor in 1941 lindbergh changed his position.
he flew combat missions against the japanese and his reputation recovered among many when he took a strong anticommunist stand during the cold war in the 1950s.

why did americans celebrate lindberghs solo flight to paris.
chapter 21 a turbulent decade the twenties cultural unrest celebrating lindberghs achievement was a unique moment of national unity in a decade dominated by cultural turbulence and strife.
during the 1920s societal wide debates reflected competing visions over what values the nation should embrace as it entered the modern age.
cultural conflict turned political in the twenties as americans debated the need for legislation to protect the nations morals ethnic purity and capitalist economy.
the lost generation ive kissed dozens of men.
i suppose ill kiss dozens more declared the flapper heroine of f scott fitzgeralds novel this side of paradise 1920 announcing a new attitude of living for the moment that defined the eras youth culture.
with his wife zelda by his side fitzgerald put this philosophy into practice moving from party to party in his fast paced life as an expatriate in europe.
the parisbased american writer gertrude stein coined the term the lost generation to describe white intellectuals and artists like fitzgerald who rebelled against victorian values in the twenties and lived primarily overseas.
lost generation writers used austrian psychologist sigmund freuds theories to justify their revolt against repressive codes of conduct.
freud believed that subconscious sexual impulses drove human behavior and that repressed desires sometimes found expression in dreams.
fitzgerald was one of a host of writers including ernest hemingway e e cummings and john dos passos who championed sexual liberation as one way to escape the sterile and deadly confines of modern life.
men and women spend their lives going in and out of doors and factories they live their lives and find themselves at last facing death and the end of life without having lived at all asserts a character in sherwood andersons many marriages 1923 who in the throes of a passionate extramarital affair is preparing to end his marriage and leave his job.
the hedonistic lifestyles depicted in many lost generation novels while rarely bestowing lasting happiness on the protagonists still rankled more traditionally minded americans.
agreeing that modern culture was flawed these americans wanted to bolster rather than reject traditional values.
these clashing cultural visions had strong political overtones.
alcohol remained central to what critique did the lost generation offer of american society.
the lost generation ethos of pleasure seeking an indulgence that became illegal in the twenties thanks to temperance reformers who felt that drinking threatened the moral fabric of american society.
prohibition temperance one of the nations longest lasting reform movements see chapters 17 and 18 took on a new life during world war i wartime temperance propaganda claimed that german brewers in this country have rendered thousands of men inefficient organized wet opposition to the dry campaign materialized slowly partly because critics of the temperance movement could not easily counter its emphasis on health thrift and morals.
some wets focused on personal freedom.
senator james wadsworth contended that it seemed unfair to tell exhausted workers at the end of the day you shall not have a glass of beer other critics felt uneasy about increasing the power of the federal government so it could enforce prohibition.
they argued that a proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting alcohol would violate states rights.
the middle class antisaloon leagues highly structured propaganda and lobbying campaign however easily overpowered this disjointed wet response on the local state and national level.
evangelical preacher billy sunday converted many churchgoers to the temperance cause delivering impassioned sermons on the evils of alcohol.
sunday a former professional baseball player littered his sermons with slang winning a large following among the rural poor and urban working class who flocked to his revival meetings throughout the midwest.
the political elite also embraced the preacher.
sunday often dined at the white house and considered the oil tycoon john d rockefeller a friend.
in his most famous watch the video video lecture post war disillusionment in the 1920s cultural unrest temperance speech sunday urged his listeners in 1908 to get on the water wagon get on for the sake of your wife and babies and hit the booze a blow on december 18 1917 congress approved the eighteenth amendment which banned the sale manufacture and transportation of intoxicating liquors.
by january 16 1919 the required 36 states had ratified it.
by the time every state had voted only rhode island and connecticut had rejected it.
when prohibition went into effect in 1920 congress clarified what constituted an intoxicating beverage in the volstead act 1919 which defined any beverage with more than 0 5 percent alcohol as intoxicating liquor and established criminal penalties for manufacturing transporting or possessing alcohol.
congress never appropriated enough money for wide scale enforcement hampering justice department efforts to curb illegal drinking.
the police raided working class neighborhoods to shut down illegal distilleries but the well to do drank their bathtub gin or homebrewed beer without interference.
many reform goals of the temperance movement remained unmet.
belying the expectation that it would create a more virtuous law abiding society prohibition gave birth to a much more insidious form of crime.
organized crime syndicates ran profitable bootlegging operations that financed beer breweries and liquor distilleries bribed cops and stocked the shelves of illegal bars throughout major metropolitan areas.
trafficking in forbidden alcohol the publicity crazed gangster al capone became a powerful figure in the chicago underworld a position he maintained with unprecedented violence.
in the 1929 st valentines day massacre capones men posing as cops pretended to arrest rival gang members and then lined them up against a wall and mowed them down with machine guns.
tabloid papers vividly recounted every detail of capones new technique of wholesale murder to a shocked public.
suffering from syphilis that he contracted from a prostitute in one of his own brothels capone became increasingly unstable and violent before he went to prison for tax evasion in 1931.
secret bars called speakeasies proliferated.
to demonstrate americans widespread disrespect for prohibition federal agent izzy einstein timed how long it took him to find alcohol in most major cities.
it took him 21 minutes in chicago and only 31 seconds in new orleans when he asked a taxi driver where he could get a drink and the man replied right here as he pulled out a bottle.
einstein hear the audio prohibition is a failure personally shut down over 4 000 speak easies nationwide prompting bartenders to post his picture with the caption watch for this man illicit drinking became fashionable among the young urban elite whose escapades lost generation writers helped glamorize.
this image of a welldressed woman barhopping with her male companions 21 5 revealed new social acceptance for public drinking by respectable middle and upper class women.
americans had previously viewed saloons as male establishments that only women of low moral character like prostitutes dared to enter.
the competing visions of whether illegal drinking was harmless fun or a vice that destroyed families kept the political debate over prohibition alive throughout the 1920s.
drys credited prohibition for the prosperous economy.
by putting alcohol aside they claimed workers had become more productive could afford to buy cars and furniture and had more savings.
wets argued that the amendment generated 21 5 well dressed trio entering a speakeasy frequenting speakeasies which patrons entered by giving a secret password to the doorman became fashionable for women during prohibition.
gone was the stigma that had stopped respectable women from drinking in public.
why did americans eventually conclude that national prohibition was a failed experiment.
chapter 21 a turbulent decade the twenties disrespect for the law as it became socially acceptable for americans to commit a crime by purchasing alcohol.
states rights advocates increasingly resented the arrival of federal officials trying to track down bootleggers.
picking up the anti saloon leagues longstanding emphasis on protecting women and children the wet lobby emphasized the dangers of teenagers drinking contaminated moonshine a slang term for illicitly manufactured alcohol in speakeasies run by the mob.
better to have them drink safely in public cafes they argued.
the beginning of the great depression in 1929 which thrust the nation into an unprecedented financial crisis undermined the dry claim that prohibition brought prosperity.
wets made headway with the argument that enforcing the law drained the federal treasury.
when democrat franklin d roosevelt entered the white house in 1933 he immediately asked congress to repeal prohibition.
with lightening speed the states ratified the twenty first amendment 1933 which repealed the eighteenth amendment.
the temperance vision remained regionally popular however especially in the rural south and midwest which continued to enforce local prohibition statutes.
a few states also passed minimum age drinking laws in the 1930s but most states did not enact such laws until the 1980s.
the first red scare and immigration restrictions the vision of america as the land of opportunity for peoples worldwide came under attack in the 1920s.
debates over immigration were not new but for the first time the nativist vision prevailed.
in the early twenties the united states underwent a historic shift changing from a nation that admitted over one million immigrants a year in the decade leading up to world war i to one that grudgingly allowed fewer than 200 000 to enter the country annually.
world war i was the catalyst that turned longstanding nativist attacks against immigrants into a mandate for dramatic change.
alarm over german americans continued ties to germany linked concerns about assimilation to the more potent political question of national security.
the 1921 emergency immigration act temporarily allowed 350 000 european immigrants to enter the country each year and set limits on how many immigrants could come from each european nation.
three years why did the nation enact strict immigration restrictions in the twenties.
later congress made these quotas permanent.
the immigration act of 1924 allowed unrestricted immigration from the western hemisphere curtailed all asian immigration and used quotas to control how many immigrants emigrated from individual european nations.
the law authorized a total of 165 000 immigrants from europe a figure that congress reduced to 150 000 in 1929 at the start of the great depression.
assumptions about the racial superiority of northern europeans strongly influenced the new national quotas portrayed in the immigration act of 1924 chart 21 6.
in this new quota system germany received the highest quota.
if americans no longer feared german immigrants then why did the country feel compelled to adopt immigration restrictions.
the answer the communist inspired russian revolution of 1917 a critical event that some americans envisioned immigrants from russia and eastern europe recreating in the united states.
to meet this threat the justice department arrested and deported alien anarchists and communists suspected of trying to destroy american democracy and capitalism during the first red scare 1919 1920.
like communists anarchists believed that capitalist exploitation of the working class created widespread social suffering.
while communists wanted to create a workers government that controlled property anarchists viewed all governments as corrupt.
the anarchist movements most famous spokesperson was emma goldman an eloquent speaker who had emigrated from russia as a young girl.
anarchism she wrote stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property liberation from the shackles and restraint of government some anarchists felt justified using violence to advance their cause one had assassinated president william mckinley in 1901.
goldman however disavowed armed conflict and instead tried to popularize the anarchist philosophy through lectures and the magazine that she founded mother earth.
in 1919 post office clerk charles kaplan helped avert disaster.
reading a newspaper account as he rode the subway home of two anarchist mailbomb attacks one against the mayor of seattle and another against a senator from georgia.

the 1924 law contained two key provisions that have remained staples of american immigration legislation the principle of family reunification which let resident immigrants bring in members of their immediate families and the desirability of certain skills.
the law for example established exemptions for trades facing worker shortages in the united states such as domestic service.
other savvy european immigrants simply entered the country illegally often by way of mexico or canada two nations that still enjoyed unrestricted immigration to the united states.
fundamentalism the cultural debates surrounding prohibition and immigration restrictions assumed a decidedly political edge in the 1920s.
christian fundamentalists added to the decades cultural turbulence when they initiated a campaign to stop the teaching of biologist charles darwins views on evolution.
religious conservatives felt that darwins theories contradicted the bibles depiction of god creating the world and humankind in seven days.
they instead subscribed to the tenets of fundamentalism an evangelical christian theology that viewed the bible as an authentic literal recounting of historical events and the absolute moral word of god.
by critiquing darwin fundamentalists offered a conservative alternative to modernism a liberal christian theology embraced in many urban areas that emphasized the ongoing revelation of divine truth.
offering competing religious visions fundamentalists accepted the bible as errorless while modernists reinterpreted the bible when confronted with new scientific knowledge such as fossil evidence of evolution.
believing that monkey men mean monkey morals the world christian fundamentals association lobbied for state laws that prohibited teaching evolution in public schools.
in 1925 tennessee made it a crime to teach any theory that denies the story of the divine creation as taught in the bible and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals passed why did fundamentalists object to teaching evolution in public schools.
mostly to make sweeping school reforms more palatable to fundamentalist voters the state made no effort to enforce the law and even adopted a biology textbook that included an extended discussion of darwins ideas.
the aclu viewed the law as a violation of the first amendments guarantee of free speech.
hoping to test its constitutionality the aclu offered to help any teacher in tennessee who wanted to challenge the law in court.
civic boosters in dayton tennessee responded to the offer.
a trial highlighting the clash between science and religion was bound to attract huge crowds they reasoned and by hosting this national extravaganza dayton expected to draw an influx of visitors with cash to spend.
john scopes a 24 year old science teacher and part time football coach agreed to step forward so officials in dayton could arrest him.
the infamous scopes trial was underway.
interest in scopes the aclu and dayton faded once william jennings bryan agreed to prosecute the case and clarence darrow arrived to defend scopes.
bryan was the former leader of the democratic party who had unsuccessfully run for president three times and resigned as secretary of state when president woodrow wilson abandoned complete neutrality during world war i.
the devout bryan blamed germanys embrace of evolutionary notions like survival of the fittest for causing the brutal global war.
darrow was an agnostic famous for defending both radical labor leaders such as the socialist eugene debs and wealthy murderers.
hundreds of journalists descended on the town to observe the courtroom confrontation between bryan and darrow.
their dispatches helped build publicity for the monkey trial a reference to evolutionists claim that humans had descended from apes.
urban based reporters billed the case as a conclusive struggle between modern america and the ignorant rural masses few of whom shared in the general prosperity of the 1920s whose alleged backward thinking threatened to impede the countrys progress.
in his widely read reports nationally syndicated columnist h l mencken regularly referred to fundamentalists as hillbillies and yokels.
fundamentalists fought back.
the carnival like atmosphere outside the courtroom soon included fundamentalist revival meetings and performances by trained chimpanzees that mocked evolutionists.
vendors did a brisk business selling view the closer look immigration quotas cultural unrest dueling newspaper headlines during the scopes trial they call us bigots when we refuse to throw away our bibles bryan says we say keep your bible but keep it where it belongs in the world of your conscience monkey dolls like the one held by lena ruffner 21 7 who announced her support of bryan by pinning a sign they cant make a monkey out of me to her dress.
both bryan and darrow argued that they were protecting american democratic institutions.
bryan maintained that the tennessee legislature had the right to pass any law that the majority wanted darrow contended the state had violated the constitution by establishing christianity as an official religion and limiting freedom of expression.
the mainstream press viewed the trial as a showdown between science and religion with science winning a decisive victory.
in their account the climatic moment came when darrow called bryan to the witness stand and trapped him into confessing he did not accept the entire bible as the literal truth.
we have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the united states darrow declared in court expressing modernists view of fundamentalism.
the national press labeled bryan a broken man when he died in his sleep five days after scopes was found guilty and fined.
the courtroom however had burst into applause when during his crossexamination bryan had thundered i am simply trying to protect the word of god against the greatest atheist or agnostic in the united states southern folk songs popularized this competing heroic image of bryan as someone who fought for what was righteous and the battle it was won then the lord called him to heaven for his work on earth was done after scopess conviction the aclu appealed to the tennessee supreme court which upheld the laws constitutionality and then overturned the verdict because the judge rather than the jury had imposed the fine.
scopess acquittal meant that the aclu had to find a new case to take before the u s supreme court.
after the ridicule heaped on dayton however no town or teacher was willing to help the aclu try again.
tennessee did not repeal the law until 1967.
a year later the u s supreme court declared anti evolution laws unconstitutional.
although soon forgotten by mainstream america throughout the twentieth century fundamentalists created a thriving minority subculture of churches schools universities publishers radio ministries and missionary societies.
fundamentalists rejoined the cultural and political mainstream in the 1970s and are generating headlines again with their challenges to teaching evolution in public schools.
in one striking break from the past fundamentalists now use darrows line of reasoning to argue that keeping the biblical theory of creation out of high school biology classes violates the constitutional guarantee to freedom of expression.

african americans were also active employing new strategies to advance racial equality.
a new generation of black political activists emerged determined to fight back when whites attacked.
the harlem renaissance an outpouring of african american artistic expression in the 1920s and 1930s also stirred debate within the african american community over the best way to improve the lives of african americans.

the photographer sold thousands of copies for 50 cents each.
lynching racial rioting and the ku klux klan lynch mobs tortured and killed nearly 5 000 victims between 1880 and 1930 roughly two per week.
the souvenir postcard 21 8 by studio photographer lawrence beitler depicted the lynching of thomas shipp and abram smith a disturbing relic from this grisly past.
professional photographers often attended lynchings and sold hundreds of picture postcards what does this souvenir postcard reveal about the ritual of lynching.
to perpetrators and witnesses who put them in family scrapbooks or sent them to friends and relatives.
besides buying souvenir postcards whites sometimes took other relics from the victim including hair clothing fingers and ears.
both the existence of this postcard and the scene it depicts raise chilling questions about the ritual of lynching.
rather than viewing their murderous act as shameful or believing that they needed to conceal their identities to avoid prosecution these participants smile openly for the camera.
police rarely arrested anyone for a lynching preferring to claim that the victims died at the hands of persons unknown trumped up accusations that the victim had raped or murdered a white person usually fueled a lynching frenzy.
police had arrested shipp and abram for robbery murder and rape.
the purpose of lynching however went beyond administering extralegal justice.
lynching also created a climate of terror that helped whites maintain social control over all blacks not just thosee killed.
james weldon johnson a well regarded poet who served as director of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp in the twenties racial violence and civil rights coined the term the red summer of 1919 to describe the wave of vicious assaults against black communities that left at least 43 african americans dead.
some whites also used organized violence to prevent blacks from competing with whites economically.
mobs attacked thriving black business centers and middle class homes in tulsa oklahoma in 1921 and in rosewood florida in 1923.
a headline in a tulsa newspaper even helped mobilize whites by issuing the call to lynch a negro tonight in both the tulsa and rosewood race riots african americans fought back but enraged white crowds still burned both communities to the ground.
officials in tulsa declared martial law and imprisoned one half of the citys black population in internment camps.
after gaining their freedom a few weeks later 1 000 families spent the winter in tents before beginning the huge task of rebuilding their community.
in 1994 florida awarded survivors of the rosewood race riot 150 000 each in reparations.
for the first time african americans received compensation for past racial injustices raising the question of whether victims of other racially motivated attacks deserved financial settlements.
with the states unwilling to prosecute the members of lynch mobs the naacp lobbied to make lynching a federal crime.
hoping to shock the nation into supporting an anti lynching law the naacp used graphic images of lynchings in their pamphlets parades and posters.
southern congressmen however blocked passage of a federal anti lynching bill by claiming that it violated the constitutional right of states to police themselves.
this photograph of shipp and smith haunted me for days recalled abel meeropol a jewish schoolteacher from new york active in leftist politics.
it inspired him to compose strange fruit a song denouncing lynching that billie holiday recorded in 1939.
meeropols stanzas painted a gruesome picture southern trees bear strange fruit blood on the leaves and blood at the root black body swinging in the southern breeze strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees the lyrics also partly misinterpreted the image.
although most lynchings took place in the south the attack pictured here occurred in marion indiana.
indiana was home to the largest chapter of the ku klux klan in the 1920s enrolling nearly one half of the read the document the creed of klanswomen 1924 states white male population even though only three percent of the states population was black.
the federal government had suppressed the original ku klux klan during reconstruction see chapter 15.
the klan revived in the 1910s and became a national organization that drew members from all parts of the country with membership fluctuating between three and six million throughout the twenties.
the new klan organized their call for white protestant supremacy under the banner of 100 percent americanism and their list of enemies included any group that threatened the traditional order.
anxieties aroused by blacks wartime migration to northern and midwestern industrial centers the red scare womens suffrage mass immigration prohibition and postwar strikes caused many conservative whites to listen sympathetically to klan outbursts against blacks jews catholics immigrants radicals feminists and bootleggers.
the 1925 klan march in washington d c 21 9 exposed the groups national appeal.
city officials required the 40 000 assembled klan members to march from the white house to the capitol without their masks.
like lynch mobs these klan members were unafraid to reveal their identities as they proudly unfurled an american flag that championed the klans patriotic slogan of native white protestant supremacy the march represented the high tide of klan power in the twenties.
as fears of social upheaval diminished klan membership also decreased.

why did membership in the ku klux klan surge in the twenties.
chapter 21 a turbulent decade the twenties marcus garvey 21 10 marcus garvey the leader of the unia often appeared in full military dress to project an image of strength and racial pride.
he challenged prevailing racial stereotypes of black subservience by adopting regalia usually worn by kings.
the african american community had long debated how to end racial attacks and segregation.
in the 1890s booker t washington squared off against w e b.
du bois over whether blacks should focus first on improving their economic position or demanding political rights see chapter 18.
washington died in 1915 and in the 1920s jamaican immigrant marcus garvey took up his idea of empowering blacks economically.
garvey founded the universal negro improvement association unia to encourage economic self sufficiency by creating black owned businesses.
the unia organized the black star line a short lived capitalist venture that sold 5 stock certificates to finance the worlds only black owned and staffed fleet of steamships.
garveys working class followers native born african americans and recently arrived immigrants from the west indies purchased stock enthusiastically.
poor management however forced the black star line to dissolve in 1922.
despite their shared message of economic empowerment the black nationalist garvey was much more militant than washington.
there was nothing shameful in being black garvey told his audiences criticizing african americans who used skin lighteners and hair straighteners to make themselves appear more white.
god garvey said made no mistake when he made us black with kinky hair.
we have outgrown slavery but our minds are still enslaved to the thinking of the master race.
now take these kinks out of your mind instead of out of your hair like washington garvey rejected the political goal of dismantling jim crow that dominated other civil rights organizations.
but unlike washington who wanted to improve life for blacks within the united states garvey spoke often of acquiring enough economic power to establish an independent african nation that could reunite the worlds dispersed black peoples.
pageantry was a hallmark of the unia.
its meetings often included a uniformed male african legion dressed in blue and female black cross nurses in white.
to give these gatherings an official air participants waved tri color flags that garvey described as black for our race red for our blood and green for our hope black middleclass detractors ridiculed garveys tendency to appear as pictured here 21 10 wearing a plumed hat and military regalia.
these critics called him a clown in a gaudy uniform who led big parades of ignorant people down the street selling pie in the sky garvey however believed that seeing a black man dressed as an aristocrat inspired confidence among his followers and challenged the stereotype of black subservience perpetuated by white america.
the justice department took note of garveys theatrics.
worried that his movement was sowing the seeds of a violent black rebellion government spies monitored his activities.
competing visions debating garveyism explores garveys vision for black america and the criticism of w e b.
du bois a leader in the naacp who supported immediate integration.
some of garveys black critics organized a garvey must go campaign and helped the government convict him of fraudulent use of the mails in 1923.
he served four years in prison and was then deported.
without garvey the unia collapsed.
garveyism however offered african americans an alternative to the integrationist vision of the naacp and introduced separatist ideas that black power advocates would resurrect in the 1960s see chapter 27.
why did garvey elicit such strong emotions among both followers and critics.
racial violence and civil rights competing visions debating garveyism many of the traditional civil rights elite despised marcus garvey whom they accused of swindling the poor of their hard earned money and stirring up racial animosity within the united states.
garvey in turn accused lightskinned african american leaders of racial prejudice arguing that they could not accept the dark skinned garvey as their equal.
in the following excerpts garvey lays out his reasons for urging black americans to go back to africa while w e b.
du bois one of the light skinned elites garvey attacked criticizes garveys vision.
how does garvey propose to stop crimes against the race.
what portrait does du bois offer of garvey.
in the true solution of the negro problem 1922 marcus garvey argued that creating a homeland in africa could solve the problem of racial violence in the united states.
in this 1923 biographical sketch marcus garvey w e b.
du bois views garvey as misguided and inept.
garvey soon developed in america a definite and in many respects original and alluring program.
he proposed to establish the black star line of steamships under we cannot allow a continuation of these crimes lynching negro ownership and with negro money to trade between and disenfranchisement against our race.

he proposed million men women and children worthy of the existence to establish a factories corporation which was going to given us by the divine creator we are determined to solve build factories and manufacture goods both for local our own problem by redeeming our motherland africa consumption of negroes and for export when from the hands of alien exploiters and found there mr garvey brought his cohorts to madison a government a nation of our own strong square garden and when ducking his dark enough to lend protection to the members of head at the audience he yelled we are our race scattered all over the world and going to africa to tell england france and to compel the respect of the nations and belgium to get out of there america sat races of the earth.

now i was eight and very small and he was no whit bigger and so i smiled but he poked out his tongue and called me nigger i saw the whole of baltimore from may until december of all the things that happened there thats all that i remember.
in these poems how do responses to racism vary.
garvey based the unia in harlem a thriving african american neighborhood in new york city that became the hub of black politics and culture in the 1920s.
african american artists photographers musicians and writers celebrated the distinctiveness of black culture.
many writers published their works in black magazines such as the crisis and the messenger.
white literary figures like carl van vechten also helped black writers publish their works with commercial presses exposing white america to black artistic endeavors.
the african american philosopher alain locke captured the creative impulse of the harlem renaissance in 1925 when he published the new negro an anthology of essays and poems by emerging literary voices.
according to locke the new negro embodied a spirit of black racial pride and militancy that set a younger generation of african american artists and civil rights leaders apart from their predecessors who had emphasized assimilating into white culture.
harlem renaissance writers took up themes previously absent from serious works of literature.
poet langston hughes discussed black americans aspirations jean toomers novel cane explored the rhythms of working class life in the countryside and city zora neale huston exposed the power of female sexuality in her novel their eyes were watching god poet countee cullen confronted the psychological impact of racism and claude mckay celebrated manly violence in his poems and novels.
the poems displayed here show how mckay cullen and hughes protested racial discrimination.
the harlem renaissance also included the jazz music innovations of trumpeter louis armstrong pianist and arranger fletcher henderson and pianist and composer ferdinand jelly roll morton.
jazz was an original american musical style that melded african american and european musical traditions.
white and black patrons flocked to harlem to listen to black bands at venues like the cotton club and the savoy while white musicians nationwide formed jazz bands of their own.
thanks to new commercial radio stations and the growing record industry jazz became so popular that americans began calling the twenties the jazz age jazz music the white conductor leopold stokowski rejoiced was an expression of the times of the breathless energetic superactive times in which we are living james weldon johnsons poem the prodigal son highlighted the dangers awaiting recent southern migrants unschooled in big city ways hear the audio if we must die poem and reading by claude mckay racial violence and civil rights who flocked to harlems jazz clubs.

the fragments of a dollar playing card and gin label evoke the temptations confronting this young man.
johnsons poem echoed the rhythms of sermons that folk preachers delivered to their rural southern congregations about the evils of city life with the sweet sinning women of babylon and they stripped him of his money and they stripped him of his clothes and they left him broke and ragged in the streets of babylon as johnsons poem suggested african americans expressed conflicting views about jazz.
many artists celebrated the musics originality and exuberance.
like southern preachers however the urban black middle class viewed jazz as the devils music believing that its syncopated rhythms aroused sexual impulses and encouraged lewd behavior.
jazz clubs often served illegal alcohol purchased from organized crime rings linking jazz music to the immoral lifestyle that many black middle class prohibition i too sing america.
langston hughes i too sing america 1925 i am the darker brother.

nobodyll dare say to me eat in the kitchen then.
besides theyll see how beautiful i am and be ashamed i too am america.
advocates wanted to eradicate.
the middle class preferred religious spirituals a distinctive african american musical tradition that they felt projected a more respectable image of black culture to mainstream america.
the literature of the harlem renaissance also drew fire.
du bois criticized claude mckay for depicting black working class culture as a collection of pimps criminals drunks and whores in his 1928 novel home to harlem.
du bois lambasted mckay for reinforcing the negative stereotypes that white america held of african american culture thereby undermining the possibility of using art to challenge the racial status quo.
defending new negro aesthetics and the principle of artistic freedom langston hughes countered we younger negro artists who create now intend to express our dark skinned selves without fear or shame.
if white people are pleased we are glad.
if they are not it doesnt matter.
we know we are beautiful 21 11 prodigal son 1927 aaron douglass innovative angular style evoked the fast pace of modern life in an illustration that both portrayed and epitomized the artistic innovations of the harlem renaissance.

chapter 21 a turbulent decade the twenties the new woman women began the decade with a significant political victory when the nineteenth amendment gave them to right to vote in 1920.
female reformers expected newly enfranchised women to care deeply about issues affecting their gender but the much anticipated womens vote never materialized.
throughout the twenties americans offered competing visions of womens proper place in american society.
former suffragists envisioned modern women playing an active role in politics.
popular culture however consistently defined the new woman as someone who kept herself thin pretty and lively for her husband.
women in the twenties when women got the right to vote nationwide an aging generation of feminists tried immediately to organize the female vote behind causes that particularly affected women.
black women had supported suffrage as a step toward politically empowering the african american community.
southern authorities however used poll taxes literacy tests and intimidation to stop black women from registering to vote.
the league of women voters created by the national american women suffrage association in 1920 drew up a list of issues that it expected to resonate among female voters including child labor protective legislation for female workers and cleaning up city politics.
this list did not include demanding that the nineteenth amendment be enforced for black and white women alike.
responding to studies that revealed high rates of infant and mother mortality in childbirth the league of women voters lobbied congress for the nations first major social welfare measure to help impoverished women and children.
the sheppardtowner act 1921 offered eight years of matching funds to states for classes that taught poor mothers about nutrition hygiene and prenatal care.
it also provided visiting nurses for low income pregnant women and new mothers.
by 1929 however it became clear that women did not vote as a bloc.
therefore despite the laws success congress did not renew the program.
rather than rallying to gender specific causes the best predictor of how a woman would vote was how her husband voted.
feminists also failed to amend the constitution by adding an equal rights amendment era which stated that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex the radical what strategies did women develop to improve their lives in the twenties.
national womens party chaired by alice paul argued that such an amendment would eradicate in one fell swoop all the legal barriers that a dizzying array of archaic state legislation created for women.
these laws elsie hill noted denied a woman control of her children equal to the fathers they deny her if married the right to control her earnings they punish her for offenses for which men go unpunished such as adultery.
moderate progressive reformers who dominated the league of women voters like future first lady eleanor roosevelt worried that the era might endanger the protective legislation for women that they had so carefully crafted in recent years such as the maximum hour laws designed to shield mothers from overwork see chapter 18.
they opposed the amendment arguing that it was better to remove troubling laws individually like those that prevented women from serving on juries or inheriting property.
in the twenties younger women displayed little interest in the social movements championed by their elders.
instead many women in their twenties and thirties focused on their economic prospects.
women made up 23 6 percent of the work force by 1920 although they remained restricted to professions considered appropriate for their gender.
during the decade women were primarily employed as secretaries and telephone operators.
rapid expansion of corporate bureaucracies created a new need for office workers a demand that the growing numbers of white female high school graduates filled.
women earned less than men but companies were certain that married women made most of the purchasing decisions in american households.
product advertising in the 1920s therefore targeted female consumers.
images as history advertising the new woman explores how advertisements in the popular media also helped define the feminine ideal in the twenties.
view the image feminine tipplers ankle flask 1922 the new woman images as history advertising the new woman popular advertising characterized the new woman as an efficient homemaker devoted mother high fashion sophisticate and engaging spouse with the time and energy for a dizzying circle of friends and club activities.
manufacturing discontent about a womans lifestyle and insecurity about her looks was another advertising strategy designed to get women to purchase products.
advertisements that featured attractive women to entice potential customers as in the fisher car ad pictured here reflected changing ideas about the slim fisher girl appeared liberated from the confines of the home and the physical incapacity caused by too much weight.
she seemed to be a modern woman on the move.
the ideal female body type.
in the nineteenth century upper class women proudly displayed their corpulence as evidence of their wealth and health.
in the twenties the popular media depicted the vigorous alert modern woman as thin and tall.
but according to a 1928 study only 17 percent of american women were both slender and over 5 feet 3 inches tall.
how does this fisher car ad both celebrate the new freedoms that women enjoyed in the twenties and perpetuate traditional stereotypes about women.
these tall elongated figurines depicted an ideal female body that was slim and youthful with legs that formed a straight line from toe to thigh pointed toes and a giraffe like neck.
these proportions suggested the women were nearly 9 feet tall.
this female silhouette more closely resembled the body of an adolescent girl than a mature woman encouraging a female preoccupation with dieting and self denial that continues today.
most ads of the time displayed men with both feet firmly on the ground.
this womans offbalance pose with one knee bent suggested tentativeness and instability putting limits on her independence and strength.
the presence of the maid behind the fisher girl indicates that she is rich as well as thin an enviable combination to many women.
her sleek body like that of the car being advertised served mostly as a commodity or decorative object suitable for a modern man.

chapter 21 a turbulent decade the twenties margaret sanger and the fight for birth control advertisers promised that modern electrical appliances would give women more time to spend with their children and womens popular magazines offered a plethora of articles on how to use this no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body birth control advocate margaret sanger 21 12 margaret sanger protests when officials in boston refused to let sanger speak publicly about birth control she appeared before a crowd with her mouth bandaged to protest their censorship.
her ploy garnered headlines across the nation giving the birth control cause a boost.
additional time to raise children properly.
birth control advocate and trained nurse margaret sanger viewed the mothers plight differently.
too many children sanger argued ruined womens health and relegated them to the ranks of the poor.
in her view providing women with information on safe and reliable contraception was more important than dispensing advice on how to raise children.
in 1916 sanger opened the nations first birth control clinic in brooklyn new york where she passed out flyers to advertise the benefits of contraception over illegal and dangerous back alley abortions.
for nine days sanger dispensed information on diaphragms condoms douches and withdrawal to women who waited in long lines to enter the clinic.
the police then shut the clinic down and arrested sanger for distributing information about birth control.
since 1873 the comstock act had prohibited sending information about contraception abortion or pornography through the mails and by 1878 every state except new mexico banned all means of circulating material about contraception.
sanger served 30 days in jail one of many unsuccessful attempts to silence her.
in 1929 after she spoke on birth control before the harvard liberal club in boston the mayor threatened to revoke the license of any hall that allowed her what arguments did sanger make to support her campaign for legal contraception.
to speak again.
in response sanger appeared with her mouth bandaged before an audience in bostons ford hall forum 21 12.
her silent protest won headlines across the nation helping sanger publicize her cause even more widely.
by openly discussing birth control sanger made public the private contraception practices of middle class couples.
poor mothers she said pleaded for her to share the secret the rich have studies suggested that at least twice in their lifetimes women living in poverty pulled their shawls over their heads to visit the five dollar abortionist down the street.
sanger often told the story of sadie sachs whose authenticity was never verified a woman whom sanger as a young nurse met when she accompanied a physician into the tenements to care for sadie after she fell ill from a botched self induced abortion.
when sadie begged the middle class doctor to give her the information she needed to avoid another pregnancy he replied tell jake to sleep on the roof the next time sanger saw sadie she lay in a coma dying from another abortion.
sanger used the story to personalize the extent of the abortion problem nearly one million abortions that resulted in 50 000 female deaths each year and to dispel the misguided belief that no decent woman needed information about contraception.
rather than counseling women to avoid sex sanger asserted that women had as much right as men to enjoy sexual intercourse without fearing for their lives.
contraception would not make women more promiscuous she predicted.
once freed from the constant strain of childbearing women would become more interesting spouses by developing their intellectual political and cultural interests much as popular advertising encouraged them to do.
through her arrests clinics and public lectures sanger gradually helped change attitudes toward birth control.
although laws censoring information about birth control remained part of the legal code until the 1970s enforcement became rarer and rarer.
by the late 1920s 30 birth control clinics operated nationwide.
eugenicists who wanted to improve the human race by controlling its hereditary qualities also developed an interest in birth control.
for eugenicists contraception could prevent those they viewed as unfit from reproducing.
under their influence many states authorized compulsory sterilization of the institutionalized mentally handicapped criminals and epileptics until the 1960s.

although the nation focused mostly on domestic concerns international issues sometimes dominated the headlines.
in 1920 the senate refused to ratify the versailles treaty which officially ended the war with germany or to join the league of nations which president woodrow wilson had championed to protect world peace.
rejection of wilsons vision of collective security through the league did not signal a withdrawal from world affairs.
presidents warren harding and calvin coolidge tried instead to use disarmament and dollars to prevent armed conflict.
disarmament the high point of the disarmament movement came when republican president warren harding convened the washington conference 1921 1922 in washington d c to negotiate agreements that would limit warships.
the conference also reaffirmed americas open door policy see chapter 19 that kept chinese trade open to all and secured pledges of cooperation among the worlds leading military powers including britain japan italy and france.
the white house and press referred to the meetings in washington as a peace conference to cultivate the image that the negotiations would d correct wilsons blundering in paris during the versailles treaty proceedings.
the opening ceremonies underscored the symbolic comparisons that the harding administration wanted to draw between the two international conferences by inviting delegates to the solemn burial of an unidentified american soldier who had fallen on the he battlefields of france.
the tomb of the unknown soldier 21 13 memorialized all deceased soldiers who went missss ing or unidentified during the war.
on the morning ing of november 11 1921 the third anniversary of the th he armistice that ended the war thousands of americans lined the streets as a horse drawn carriage carried a flag draped coffin from the u s s capitol to arlington national cemetery.
harding ng the entire congress and supreme court along with witth foreign dignitaries followed the procession.
after the unknown soldier was laid to rest millions of americans across the nation observed two minutes of silence to honor the fallen warrior and pray for a peaceful future.
the nation subsequently buried unknown soldiers in the same tomb after world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars.
in 1999 dna genetic testing determined the identity of the vietnam serviceman and it is unlikely that the nation will ever have another unknown soldier.
21 13 the tomb of the unknown soldier the allegorical figures of peace valor and victory on the tomb of the unknown soldier encapsulated the harding and coolidge administrations diplomatic goals in the early 1920s.
how did hardings foreign policy vision differ from wilsons.
chapter 21 21 14 looking into the black hole of ruin this 1927 political cartoon forecast disaster if the world powers failed to reach a second naval disarmament agreement.
in the cartoon the world is in disarray after a naval gun had showered it with gun powder.
a turbulent decade the twenties through the washington conference harding reshaped the political vision of his democratic predecessor woodrow wilson.
harding rejected wilsons idea of using an open ended commitment to the league of nations to ensure world peace.
he agreed with other republicans who felt membership in this world body would restrict americas ability to set its own foreign policy.
harding instead sought to prevent another war by convincing all major powers to disarm and agree to mediation when disputes arose.
harding knew that congresss pennypinching mood meant certain rejection of any administration proposal to maintain a large military or embark on a major shipbuilding campaign.
what better way to balance this domestic reality with the need to protect american shores from heavily armed naval competitors than by negotiating multinational disarmament treaties.
to contain japan in the pacific and britain which still controlled the worlds largest navy secretary of state charles evans hughes proposed scrapping 30 american 23 british and 17 japanese battleships.
one thrilled observer noted that hughes had single handedly sunk more british battleships than all the admirals of the world had destroyed in a cycle of centuries japans 1905 victory in the russo japanese war had signaled its emergence as the premier military power in east asia.
the japanese who unlike the british and americans had only one ocean to patrol accepted a naval tonnage ratio of 5 5 3 among the united states britain and japan.
this meant that for every five tons of naval shipping that america and britain maintained japan retained three.
besides arms limitation negotiations focused on settling potentially explosive issues in the pacific.
what benefits and drawbacks did the washington conference agreements offer the united states.
there american objectives included curtailing japanese expansion in east asia and preserving the open door in china.
the american delegation met these goals but at some cost.
japan accepted a smaller navy in return for a pledge that the others would refrain from improving their naval bases or fortifications in the western pacific.
experts warned that this concession would leave american pacific possessions vulnerable to a japanese attack.
hughes who doubted that congress would approve funds to improve naval defenses accepted the deal.
the resulting five power treaty which included smaller tonnage limits for france and italy set a ten year moratorium on battleship construction and limited the guns that ships could carry.
the treaty however did not set limits for submarines light cruisers aircraft or land forces.
in an accompanying four power treaty france the united states britain and japan agreed to respect one anothers pacific possessions and consult if any dispute arose.
the nine power treaty was the conferences final achievement.
in this agreement the above five nations and portugal the netherlands belgium and china all agreed to respect the open door in china a policy advocated by the united states since the turn of the century see chapter 19.
the resulting agreements essentially protected the united states britain and japan from an aggressive naval attack.
they left britain in control of the european seas gave the united states charge of the americas and recognized japanese predominance in east asia.
for the time being avoiding an arms race and maintaining the status quo served the interests of the worlds major powers.
calvin coolidge hardings successor in the white house continued the republican effort to find alternative ways to maintain world peace.
leading powers met again in geneva in 1927 to broker another disarmament pact.
this 1927 political cartoon 21 14 offered support for the proceedings by showing a disheveled world covered with gunpowder from a naval gun.
this time however the leading powers failed to reach an agreement.
secretary of state frank kellogg had more success negotiating the kellogg briand pact 1928 whose signatories renounced aggressive war as an instrument of national policy and agreed to resolve their disagreements through peaceful means.

wartime debts world war i revealed the importance of european trade to american prosperity but in the twenties the politically sensitive question of securing repayment from allied nations for american wartime loans threatened to undermine europes economic recovery.
from 1914 to 1925 the united states had loaned the allies nearly 10 billion to finance war time purchases of american goods and rebuild war torn europe 21 15.
in the 1920s the allied governments urged the united states to cancel the loans.
how they asked could america insist on repayment when the allies had sacrificed a whole generation of men to the joint cause of defeating germany.

president coolidge faced four choices on how to respond.
americans had conflicting visions of the best way to avoid another war and vocal supporters backed each option.
choices adopt a noninterventionist policy that kept the united states out of european affairs.
sign a nonaggression pact with france as the first step toward creating a formal defensive alliance that would recreate the pre world war i balance of power system in europe.
reject bilateral agreements and join the league of nations.
negotiate a multinational nonaggression pact.
decision coolidge refused to join the league of nations but knew that outlawing war had strong appeal at home.
consequently he agreed to let secretary of state frank kellogg meet with french foreign minister aristide briand to fashion a multinational nonaggression pact.
by opening the treaty up to other nations coolidge avoided the impression that the united states was allying itself with france.
the resulting kelloggbriand pact was eventually signed by 62 nations including germany and japan.
consequences the kellogg briand pact proved popular with americans because its vagueness allowed it to be all things to all people.
non interventionists saw the pact as insulating the country from ever fighting another war overseas.
they liked the u s resolution to stay peaceful yet make no binding commitments to defend other nations.
internationalists who wanted the united states to play a more active role in maintaining world peace saw the treaty as the first step toward creating an american presence in international arbitration bodies like the world court and the league of nations.
