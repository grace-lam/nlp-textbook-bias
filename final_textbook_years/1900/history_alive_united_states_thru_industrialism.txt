chapter 26 the great wave of immigration what was life like for immigrants in the early 1900s.
26 1 introduction in the early 1880s a young american jew named emma lazarus saw a boatload of jewish immigrants who had just arrived in new york city.
the jews on the boat were fleeing a religious massacre in russia.
inspired by their suffering lazarus wrote a poem in which the statue of liberty welcomes immigrants.
the poem begins give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
in 1903 a plaque inscribed with lazaruss poem was attached to the base of the statue.
her words expressed the hopes of millions of people who made their way to the united states during a great wave of immigration between 1880 and 1920.
over those 40 years more than 23 million immigrants arrived in the united states.
many were escaping poverty political violence and religious persecution.
others came seeking economic opportunity in a land of seemingly boundless promise.
most of the newcomers flocked to cities where industry was booming and jobs were plentiful.
the sheer number of immigrants changed the face of the nation.
the newcomers often clustered in rapidly growing ethnic neighborhoods.
in both new york and san francisco for example little italy districts grew up alongside chinatowns the new arrivals spurred the growth of the nation s cities and industries.
their languages customs music and food made cities like new york chicago and san francisco more diverse and exciting places.
yet many native born americans responded to the new arrivals with suspicion and prejudice.
for immigrants these attitudes added to the challenge of starting life in a new country.
in this chapter you will learn about the experiences and contributions of immigrant groups from around the world.
you will also discover how americans attitudes toward immigration changed by the 1920s.
immigrants arriving in new york city first landed at ellis island where they went through an examination process to enter the country.
this portrait of a young jewish immigrant was taken at ellis island in 1905.
immigrants arriving by ship to new york city in 1915 gaze atthe statue of liberty.
the great wave of immigration refugee a person who flees his or her home or country to escape war persecution or other dangers assimilation the process by which immigrants or other newcomers acquire the attitudes behaviors and cultural patterns of the society around them 26 2 immigration from around the globe patterns of immigration to the united states changed in the 1880s.
before this time most immigrants came from northern europe particularly ireland and germany.
by 1890 most were coming from countries in southern and eastern europe such as italy greece russia and poland.
other people came from china japan korea and the philippines.
still others crossed the borders from canada and mexico.
many of these newcomers were refugees escaping violence or poverty in their homelands.
compared to earlier arrivals they tended to be poorer less well educated and less likely to speak english.
among these refugees were many jews and catholics as well as buddhists and confucianists a major change for a country that had always been largely protestant.
the struggle for acceptance americans wondered how the throngs of immigrants would affect the country.
most favored the assimilation of foreign born people into the culture of their new homeland.
they expected immigrants to become americanized to talk dress and act like their native born neighbors.
others believed that the new immigrants especially nonwhites were too different to be assimilated.
their prejudices were reinforced when ethnic groups clustered in their own towns or neighborhoods in part for mutual support and in part because they were not accepted elsewhere.
many immigrants were eager to adopt american ways.
others had little choice.
public schools taught in english and most stores sold only american style clothes food and other goods.
many employers demanded that their workers speak english on the job.

this graph shows immigration to the united states from different regions of the world.
each region s period of peak immigration is labeled.
for example between 1901 and 1910 more than 2 million people came to the united states from southern europe.
some immigrants did cling to their own languages and ways of life.
but even those who tried hardest to assimilate often met with abuse and discrimination.
immigrants also faced resentment from workers who saw them as competing for jobs.
contributions of immigrants the new immigrants made vital contributions to the nations rapidly industrializing society.
as you know immigrants helped to build the railroad.
they worked in oilfields in gold silver and coal mines and in rubber and steel mills.
they labored in meat packing plants manufacturing plants and clothing factories.
without the immigrants skills and labor the nations cities and industries would not have grown nearly as fast as they did.
immigrants also brought a vibrant diversity to their adopted land.
the united states became a society enriched by the customs foods languages and faiths of people from around the globe.
26 3 italian immigrants when pascal dangelo heard that his father was leaving their poor italian village to work overseas he was angry.
america was stealing nay father from me he later said.
his mother tried to soothe him saying that soon papa would return laden with riches.
but pascal begged his father to take him along.
his father agreed.
the two of them boarded a steamship bound for the united states.
the great wave of immigration 51 millions of italian immigrants traveled by ship to the united states between 1890 and 1900.
during the voyage they endured crowded conditions and poor quality food.
from italy to america like millions of other italians pascal and his father came to the united states to escape poverty.
in the late 1800s much of italy and especially southern italy could not support the countrys rapidly growing population.
farmers struggled to make a living on worn out eroded land where crops too often failed.
there were few factories to provide other jobs.
poor immigrants like pascal and his father usually made the ocean passage in steerage steerage was a deck deep in the ship that was reserved for the passengers who paid the lowest fares.
these passengers were given narrow beds in crowded compartments that smelled of spoiled food human waste and sweating people who had nowhere to bathe.
steerage passengers were allowed on deck only once a day.
the rest of the time they tried to amuse themselves by playing games singing and making music with accordions mandolins and other instruments.
after almost two weeks the travelers arrived at the immigration station on ellis island in new york harbor.
there they had to pass medical examinations and answer questions about how they planned to support themselves in the united states.
people who did not pass these inspections could be sent home even if other family members were allowed to enter.
so many families were forced to separate that italians started calling ellis island the island of tears u judged healthy and ready to work pascal and his father arrived in new york city.
a fellow italian a work agent called a padrone puh droh nee helped them to find jobs build m i padrones helped many italian immigrants get unskilled wor ui mg sewers subways and roads cleaning streets and t 8 t s r newtenementbuildings.
by 1890 italians made up p rcen o ew yorks public works employees and 99 percent of chicago s street workers.

when several co italy as well w wrk accident pascats father decided to return to italy as well.
we are not better off than when we started he said.
514 chapter 26 pascal however decided to stay in his new country.
he settled in an italian neighborhood in new york one of the many little italys that sprang up in u s cities.
these mostly italian neighborhoods bulged with residents who could afford only the cheapest tenement housing.
crowded together in tiny apartments most families had no privacy.
fortunately italian neighborhoods also offered opportunities for fun.
most italians were catholics who celebrated saints days as they had in italy.
they strung colored lights flags and streamers along the shops and streets.
families strolled among booths that offered food and games.
fireworks music and dancing reminded everyone of life back home.
above everything else italians valued family closeness.
some italian parents didnt send their children to school because they feared that learning english would separate their children from the family.
besides a child in school wasnt earning money to help the family.
as a result many immigrant children never learned the skills they needed for better jobs.
because many italian newcomers were poor and uneducated americans tended to look down on them.
when a few italians turned to crime and became notorious gangsters some people started thinking of all italians as criminals.
as a group however italian immigrants were generally more law abiding than average americans.
some americans feared that immigrants from italy would always be poor and illiterate.
pascal dangelo was one of many who proved them wrong.
after coming to the united states pascal bought himself a dictionary and learned to read and write english.
in time he became a well known poet whose work was published in national magazines.
italian immigrants often moved to little italys such as mulberry street in new york city shown in this photograph.
here rents were cheap and living conditions crowded.
pogrom an organized and violent persecution of a minority group 26 4 jewish immigrants from eastern europe maryusha antonovksy was no more.
in her place stood mary antin the same immigrant jewish girl but with a new american name.
mary had also bought real american machine made garments to replace her hateful homemade european style clothes.
i long to forget she said.
it is painful to be conscious of two worlds when immigrants arrived at ellis island they faced the dreaded medical inspection.
medical examinations were quick but thorough.
here a new arrival undergoes an exam to checkfor eye disease.
fleeing persecution mary antins first world had been a jewish village in russia.
for centuries russians had discriminated against jews who dressed worshiped and ate differently from their christian neighbors.
by the 1800s russia had hundreds of anti jewish laws.
jews could live only in certain areas.
they couldnt live in big cities or own land.
in 1881 assassins killed the russian monarch czar alexander ii.
nervous government leaders blamed jews for his murder even though the assassin was not jewish.
angry russians raged through jewish villages burning looting and killing.
these attacks called pogroms happened repeatedly for more than 30 years.
the word pogrom comes from russian words meaning like thunder many jews fled such persecution hoping to find refuge in america.
between 1881 and 1924 some 2 4 million jews came to the united states from russia and other countries in eastern europe.
mary antins father was one of them.
marys father left for america in 1891 hoping to earn enough money to send for his family.
in his first letter home mary sensed an elation joy a hint of triumph.
my father was inspired by a vision.
he saw something he promised us something.
it was this america when her father sent a steamship ticket for his family to join him the people in marys village gathered together filled with longing.
they wanted to handle the ticket mary remembered and mother must read them what is written on it after long rides in overcrowded trains and weeks of delay her family finally boarded a ship in hamburg germany although richer immigrants enjoyed comfortable cabins the antins were crowded together with hundreds of other passengers deep down in the ship.
seasick at first they frequently came up on deck for fresh air where sailors and girls had a good many dances 516 chapter 26 like most european immigrants the antins entered the united states by way of new york harbor.
wealthier passengers in first class and second class cabins were questioned briefly before being admitted to their new country.
but the majority of arrivals were taken on crowded barges to the immigration station on ellis island.
offen they had to wait for hours while inspectors and doctors examined each person.
fortunately most new arrivals spent less than a day on the island before proceeding to shore and the beginning of their new life in america.
jewish life in america from ellis island jews headed for new york citys lower east side neighborhood.
there they established shops newspapers religious schools and synagogues community centers and places of worship.
the lower east side became the most densely populated neighborhood in the city.
people lived packed into cheap tenements often sleeping three or four to a room.
some jews worked as street vendors using pushcarts to sell everything from coal to secondhand clothes.
pushcart vendors saved their money to buy horse drawn carts and then small stores.
although most jews were poor they arrived in the united states with a wide range of skills.
jews worked as cobblers butchers carpenters and watchmakers.
almost half found jobs in the citys garment factories.
jewish immigrants did whatever they could to keep their children in school.
in europe jews had honored educated people but schooling had cost money.
as a result many jews had never learned to read and write.
in america mary antin wrote education was free.
it was the one thing that my father was able to promise us when he sent for us surer safer than bread or shelter parents who made a little money often sent their sons and sometimes their daughters to the citys inexpensive public colleges.
by 1910 more jewish youths over the age of 16 were still in school than were young people of any other ethnic group.
like other immigrant groups jews faced prejudice and discrimination.
most private schools and clubs refused to accept jews.
hospitals would not hire jewish doctors.
the new york bar association would not admit jews as lawyers.
many ads for jobs stated simply christians only.
still eastern european jews were grateful to be in their new country.
one immigrant recalled there were markets groaning with food and clothes.
there was no military on horseback and no whips immigrants took work into their own homes or labored in differenttypes of factories.
here garment workers sew clothes in a tenement apartment.
the great wave of immigration chinese immigrants were sometimes detained for several months on angel island before they were allowed to enter the united states.
some carved poems on the wooden walls of the crowded barracks.
26 5 chinese immigrants the first chinese immigrants came to the united states to seek gold in california.
later many helped to build the countrys first transcontinental railroad.
some of these immigrants returned to china with money they had earned.
their good fortune inspired 16 year old lee chew to leave his poor village for the united states in 1880.
traveling to california lee paid 50 dollars for a bunk on a crowded steamship to make the month long voyage to san francisco california.
on the ship he got his first taste of foreign food and marveled at machinery he had never seen before.
the engines that moved the ship were wonderful monsters he wrote strong enough to lift mountains lee arrived just in time.
in the united states discrimination against the chinese had been growing ever since whites had pushed chinese off their mining claims.
as the number of chinese immigrants increased u s labor leaders warned of chinese workers who would work for less pay than whites and take away their jobs.
in 1882 congress passed the chinese exclusion act which banned chinese laborers from immigrating to the united states.
the law also denied chinese immigrants the right to become citizens.
as a result of the chinese exclusion act chinese immigration slowed to almost nothing.
then in 1906 an earthquake and fire destroyed much of san francisco including most birth records.
suddenly many chinese men could claim to be native born citizens.
as citizens they were allowed to bring their wives and children to the united states.
chinese claiming american birth started arranging for people in c ma to immigrate to the united states as their relatives.
on the long i if the newcmers studied hundreds of pages describing amilies.
when they reached san francisco bay they threw the papers overboard.
these paper relatives landed at angel island in san francisco bay.
me immigration officials locked us up like criminals in com p ii e ca8es 1 zoos said one chinese immigrant.
chinese usua y remained on the island for three to four weeks but sometimes noernf tyiont ls or even years there.
to pass the time they carved halls.

tsp0k mypar s wait at the door in vain for with lonenn themselves w their stshins 518 chapter 26 before being allowed to leave angel island each immigrant faced detailed questioning by officials.
how many steps are there in your house where do you sleep in your house who lives next door then they asked a family witness from san francisco the same questions.
if the answers didnt match officials could deport the newcomer.
nearly one in ten chinese who came to the united states was sent back to china.
chinese life in the united states when lee chew arrived in san francisco he worked first as a servant and then set up his own laundry.
many chinese started laundries because as lee explained it requires little capital and is one of the few opportunities that are open.
men of other nationalities who are jealous of the chinese have shut him out of working on farms or in factories or building railroads like lee most chinese settled in city neighborhoods like san franciscos bustling chinatown.
here they could find work at chinese laundries restaurants and stores.
chinese newspapers herbal medicines foods and festivals provided familiarity comfort and support.
for many years most chinese immigrants were men.
in 1900 only about 1 in 20 chinese on the u s mainland was female.
with so few women and families the chinese population began to decline.
in 1880 about 105 000 chinese lived in the united states.
by 1920 there were 61 600.
gradually more women and children arrived especially in san francisco.
housing was closed to chinese in most areas so chinatown became more and more crowded.
chinese immigrants settled in chinatowns like this one in san francisco.
there they preserved the culture they had left behind.
the great wave of immigr passport a document issued by a citizens home government that identifies a person and permits travel to other countries 26 6 mexican immigrants soldiers were shooting all around.
a flying bullet almost hit him.
that was when pablo mares pah blow mahr ess decided he had to get out of mexico.
i had to come to the united states he said later because it was impossible to live down there with so many revolutions mares had been caught in the middle of a bloody civil war.
the conflict began when mexicos president allowed wealthy landowners to take over the lands of 6 million indians and 8 million poor farmers.
in 1910 landless farmers rebelled breaking up large landholdings and giving the land to poor families.
in response soldiers attacked villages killing thousands of peasants.
by 1900 railroad lines linked the united states and mexico.
trains provided convenient transportation for mexicans who were free to enterthe united states without passports.
crossing the border the mexican revolution dragged on for ten years.
between 1910 and 1920 about 500 000 mexicans entered the united states.
they entered freely without passports or money.
many mexicans walked hundreds of miles to reach the border carrying all they owned on their backs.
in just one day a texas reporter saw hundreds of mexicans all journeying northward on foot on burroback and in primitive two wheel carts others traveled north by rail.
by 1900 railroad lines connected american and mexican cities.
railroads provided both transportation and jobs for mexican immigrants.
one mexican newspaper reported there is not a day in which passenger trains do not leave for the border full of mexican men who are going in gangs to work on railroad lines in the united states i i 520 chapter 26 mexicans in america many american employers welcomed the mexicans.
expanding railroads and large scale farms and ranches in the southwest depended on laborers who were willing to work hard for little pay after congress banned chinese immigration in 1882 these employers looked to mexico for new workers.
where i came from said one mexican construction worker i used to work ten hours for 1 25 then i came here and they paid 1 25 for eight hours it was good some mexican immigrants found jobs with railroads mines factories and canneries.
but most found work in agriculture.
mexican farmworkers moved from region to region harvesting crops as they ripened.
they picked oranges in southern california almonds in central california and then apples in oregon.
they harvested cotton in texas and arizona and then moved on to sugar beets in colorado.
farmwork paid very little.
one texas farmer paid pan cho and his whole family 60 cents a day.
he worked from some mexicans such as those in this photograph found jobs in mines.
most however were employed as agricultural workers.
sun to sun children worked in the fields with their parents to help support their families.
few of them had a chance to attend school.
farmworkers often lived in camps that they built near the fields.
shelters were made of almost every conceivable thing burlap canvas palm branches said one visitor.
some farms and ranches provided housing for their workers.
either way these temporary homes usually lacked running water and basic sanitation.
after harvest season farmworkers sometimes moved to nearby towns.
barrios or mexican neighborhoods sprang up on the edges of cities near such farming areas as los angeles california and san antonio texas.
food stands and grocery stores in the barrio offered familiar tastes and smells.
residents helped each other take care of the sick and find jobs.
on mexican religious holidays catholic churches held special ceremonies.
on those days the barrio was filled with singing dancing and fireworks.
many mexican immigrants originally planned to return to mexico once the revolution was over.
whites who believed that mexicans were taking their jobs encouraged such returns.
one wrote i wish the mexicans could be put back in their country.
mexicans who remained in the united states often faced strong prejudice.
compared to whites they earned very low wages and they had little say in their working conditions.
in schools white children were sometimes taught to boss their mexican classmates as they were expected to do when they grew up.
despite these problems many mexican immigrants chose to stay.
like isidro osorio a farm and railroad worker they hoped for a better future in their new homeland.
i have worked very hard to earn my 4 00 a day reported osorio.
that is why i want to give a little schooling to my children so that they won t stay like i am.

the crowd was frustrated by a mining strike and angered by bank robberies that italian criminals were rumored to have committed.
for three days mobs beat up italian immigrants and burned their homes.
this attack reflected a surge of nativism or anti immigrant feeling it that peaked in the united states around this time.
the tide turns against immigrants the united states has always been a nation of immigrants yet time and again nativism has sparked actions and policies directed against newer arrivals.
sometimes nativism is rooted in economic competition.
sometimes it stems from ethnic religious and other differences.
in the 1830s for example protestant nativists charged that catholic immigrants were enemies of democracy.
they feared that catholics had more loyalty to the pope in rome who was the head of their church than to the u s government.
the surge in immigration that began in the 1880s fueled another rise in nativism.
some native born americans blamed immigrants for everything from slums and crime to hard times.
fearing competition for jobs many labor leaders discriminated against nonwhites.
in 1909 for example the president of the united mine workers wrote of asians that as a race their standard of living is extremely low and their assimilation by americans impossible restricting immigration politicians responded to the growing prejudice against immigrants.
as you have read in 1882 congress passed the chinese exclusion act banning further immigration by chinese laborers.
in 1907 japanese immigrants were forbidden entry to the united states.
in 1917 congress required immigrants to prove they could read and write in at least one langauge before they were allowed into the united states.
to further limit immigration congress established a quota system in 1921 and refined it in 1924.
under this system by 1927 only 150 000 immigrants were allowed to enter the united states each year.
people from east asia were completed excluded.
in addition quotas limited immigration from any one country to 2 percent of the number of people from that country who lived in the united states in 1890.
most eastern and southern europeans had arrived after that year.
as a result most of the quota spaces were reserved for immigrants from england ireland and germany.
this 1871 cartoon shows columbia a symbol of the united states protecting a chinese immigrantfacing discrimination.
in 1882 a federal law banned immigration from china.
nativism an attitude of resentment and superiority toward foreign born people quota a limit based on numbers or proportions such as the proportion of a countrys population allowed to immigrate to the united states 522 chapter 26 ihe new laws did not limit mexican immigration.
however mexicans now needed passports and visas to enter the united states.
visas allow people from other nations to stay in the united states for a limited period of time.
for the first time the nation was closing its doors.
chapter summary in this chapter you read about the great wave of immigration to the united states between 1880 and 1920.
immigrants from around the globe the immigrants of this period were far more diverse than earlier arrivals.
many were refugees escaping poverty wars or persecution.
others were drawn by the promise of economic opportunity.
with their skills and labor these new immigrants helped build the nations booming cities and industries.
but they also faced many challenges including the tension between assimilation and preserving their way of life.
italian immigrants millions of italians came to the united states to escape poverty.
many settled in cities where they lived in mostly italian neighborhoods.
jewish immigrants from eastern europe between 1881 and 1924 some 2 4 million jews came to the united states from russia and other countries.
many came to escape persecution in their home countries.
chinese immigrants people from china had come to the united states since the late 1860s.
as the number of chinese immigrants increased so too did discrimination against them.
in 1882 congress passed the chinese exclusion act.
mexican immigrants many mexicans came to the united states between 1910 and 1920 during the years of the mexican revolution.
most found work in agriculture although the work paid very little.
closing the door on immigration in the 1920s nativism led congress to limit the number of foreigners who would be allowed into the united states.
quotas brought an end to the great wave of immigration.
by then the united states had become a far more diverse country.
the great wave of immigration during the late 19th century created a nation of rich diverse cultures.
people from many backgrounds came together and became americans.
in this photograph a mix of immigrants are in class together learning english.
ihe great wave of immigration j reading further more than a million immigrants settle in the united states every year.
they come from countries around the world a large percentage of them are young people like carmen and fidinarivo who proudly hold their newly acquired certificates of u s citizenship.
young immigrants today throughout its history the united states has been a nation of immigrants.
immigrants continue to come here for the same reasons they always have.
some are fleeing oppression or war.
others are simply seeking a better life with more opportunities and greater freedom.
many of these immigrants are young people.
manyang came to the united states in 2001 at the age of 18.
he was a refugee from the african country of sudan.
for manyang coming to this country was an escape from the violence of war.
manyang was just six years old when gunmen raided his village in southern sudan.
civil war had been raging in sudan for years.
now the fighting had come to manyangs village.
hearing gunshots he ran out of his house looking for his parents.
in that moment he saw his father shot dead.
manyang escaped his village unharmed.
he could not find his mother or his brothers and sisters but he did find his uncle malic.
together they joined other refugees on a long trek to neighboring ethiopia.
after two months of walking starving and exhausted they arrived at a united nations refugee camp.
there they received food clothing and shelter.
several years later however civil war broke out in ethiopia.
pursued by rebel soldiers the refugees fled back to sudan.
at one point manyang had to cross a river teeming with crocodiles.
he pulled himself across the river on a rope but his uncle was killed by the rebels.
eventually manyang arrived at another un camp this time in kenya.
he stayed there for nine years.
life was hard in the camp.
foot was scarce and the refugees got just one meal a day.
but manyang wa able to go to school.
he began to study english and math.
he realized that education could be his route to a better life.
one day manyang learned that the united states was allowing some boys like him to immigrate.
americans called them the lost boys because they had lost their families and their country.
manyang told his story to immigration officials.
finally his application was accepted.
in may 2001 he came to the united states to begin a new life.
manyang was adopted by a church in connecticut.
with the support of church members he continued his schooling.
but it was not easy.
although manyang had studied hard in kenya his schooling there was very different from an american education.
once again manyang worked hard to be successful.
at the graduation ceremony after he passed his courses manyang spoke about the importance of education in his life.
i 524 chapter 26 since then manyang has entered college and become an american citizen.
one day he hopes to become a lawyer and to help his people in sudan.
but he will always appreciate what life in the united states has given him and other lost boys.
lots of people opened their hearts and homes to us he says.
i will never forget modern immigration manyang is one of millions of immigrants who have come to this country in recent decades.
since 1970 the immigrant population in the united states has more than tripled.
by 2008 about 38 million immigrants lived here.
that is the largest number in the nation s history.
this new wave of immigration differs from the last great wave in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
then most immigrants came from southern and eastern europe.
today most come from latin america and asia with smaller numbers from africa and the middle east.
despite high levels of immigration immigrants still make up a smaller share of the u s population than they did in 1900.
at that time around 15 percent of all u s residents were foreign born.
today that figure is approximately 12 percent.
many of the new immigrants are young.
a survey taken in the 1990s showed that 45 percent were under the age of 30.
in general the immigrant population is younger than the american population as a whole.
after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the united states tightened immigration controls.
more immigrants were detained and deported.
many people felt that discrimination against immigrants was on the rise.
in a 2009 survey of immigrants however most said they were glad they had come to the united states.
they said their lives had improved as a result.
most of them hoped to make this country their permanent home.
when manyang came to the united states he said from the first our aim was to get an education.
holding his high school diploma after graduation he knew he had succeeded in his dream.
inayet s story inayet is an afghan muslim who came to this country in 1991.
he tells his story in the book kids like me voices of the immigrant experience by judith m blohm and terri lapinsky.
inayets parents are from afghanistan.
they fled to pakistan in the 1980s after the soviet union invaded their country.
inayet was born in a refugee camp where he spent the first eight years of his life before coming to the united states.
although he attended school in the camp it was a terrible experience.
the teachers seemed to care little about education and often beat the students.
the great wave of immigration 52.
the united nations and other relief agencies operate refugee camps around the world.
these camps help millions of people displaced by war.
manyang inayet and pang houa all spent years in camps like this one.
i when inayet started school here he was surprised that his teachers did not hit him.
he soon realized that education could help him succeed in life.
like manyang he graduated from high school and went on to college.
everything did not go easily for inayet however.
some students were mean to him.
they did not understand his culture and customs and told him to go back to his own country some also asked him if he was a terrorist.
despite these difficulties inayet grew to appreciate the advantages of life in the united states.
here he says people have economic opportunities and freedom of religion.
here he believes people have the freedom to live i i i i i.
iik i iuu j oiory pang houa a hmong mung from southeast asia was also born in a refugee camp.
in her case the camp was in thailand.
her parents fled there from laos just after the vietnam war.
she came to the united states in 1984 when she was four years old.
in kids like me pang houa described how she and her family set tied in minnesota where many hmong immigrants now live.
she went to school first with other hmong children and then with americans.
she did well in school and was happy.
she said she never felt discrimination from her classmates.
in fact when she later went to college she said that other students found her background fascinating.
iw wanted to know more about hmong culture and customs.
526 chapter 26 she got a surprise when she went to france to study for a while however.
even though she tried to blend in she realized that she spoke and acted like any other american.
she had arrived in the united states as an immigrant but she no longer felt like one.
she had become an american.
yulia s story yulia came to the united states from russia when she was 16 years old.
her parents wanted to give her and her siblings a better future.
two years later she told her story to author marina budhos for the bookrem x conversations with immigrant teenagers.
in many ways yulia adapted quickly to life in this country.
she went to school made friends and learned english.
in fact she adapted much faster than her parents.

in this unit you will learn about american expansion overseas and reforms at home that resulted in part because of that growth.
the map below shows the places that came under u s control following the civil war.
by the late 1800s american companies were seeking new markets for their products and new sources of raw materials.
that quest was connected to the pacific islands highlighted on the map.
it was also related to a massive engineering project that took place far from the united states the digging of the panama canal in the central american country of panama.

chapter 27 the progressive era did the progressives improve life in the united states.
27 1 introduction the men who start the great new movements in the world said samuel mcclure at his college graduation are enthusiasts whose eyes are fixed upon the end they wish to bring about some of his fellow students may have brushed off mcclures words as mere speech making.
they shouldnt have.
this immigrant from ireland was serious about starting what he called great new movements in 1893 mcclure began publishing a journal called mcclures magazine.
mcclure prided himself on knowing what people wanted to read about.
if i like a thing he said then i know that millions will like it in 1900 mcclure decided that americans wanted to know the truth about trusts gigantic business monopolies that worked to reduce competition.
he hired a reporter named ida tarbell to write a history of standard oil one of the biggest trusts in the country.
starting in 1902 mcclure ran tarbells report as a serial printing one part at a time in issue after issue.
the report told about unfair pricing that was putting standard oils competitors out of business.
mcclure began hiring more journalists for his magazine.
some people called his journalists muckrakers because they raked up or exposed corruption in business and society.
writers like tarbell adopted this name with pride.
samuel mcclure and ida tarbell were part of a larger reform effort known as the progressive movement.
progressives did not work as a single group.
some fought railroad monopolies while others focused on the problem of child labor.
some worked for equal rights for african americans and others worked to protect forests.
whatever their cause most progressives wanted government to play a larger role in helping to cure the nation s ills.
they believed that ordinary people could start great new movements that would improve life in the united states.
by the early 1900s many children worked in factories mills and mines.
these breaker boys were photographed at a coal mine in 1911.
samuel mcclure top published articles by progressive era writers such as ida tarbell bottom.
both were part of a movement that focused on social and economic problems created by industrialization.

this cartoon shows wealthy rail barons carving up the country for their own profit.
27 2 sowing the seeds of reform the progressive movement of the early 20th century focused on economic and social injustice the power of big business and political corruption.
but progressives were not the first to criticize these conditions and to propose far reaching reforms.
industrialization began remaking american society shortly after the civil war.
to some the rise of big industry meant endless progress and prosperity.
other people however felt left behind.
as early as the 1870s some of these have nots began organizing mass movements to work for political and social change.
the national grange organized protests against the power of big business began on the farms of the midwest.
after the civil war many midwestern farmers were caught between rising costs and falling prices for their crops.
farmers felt victimized.
banks made it hard for people to get cash loans to keep their farms going in lean times.
grain storage companies and railroads charged high rates to store and transport crops.
and merchants paid too little for what farmers produced.
in 1867 oliver kelley a clerk at the u s department of agriculture began organizing self help clubs for farmers called the national grange of the patrons of husbandry.
the movement spread rapidly through the midwest.
by the mid 1870s the national grange had grown into a political force.
farmers used the national grange to protest unfair practices by the railroads.
grangers banded together to negotiate better prices and to start their own banks.
they campaigned for political candidates and worked for such reforms as an income tax and laws against trusts.
pressure from the national grange led some states to pass laws that limited railroad shipping rates and prices for grain storage.
big businesses protested this interference.
in 1877 the supreme court sided with the grangers.
in a series of cases the court said that states have the right to regulate private property when it is used in the public interest.
the national grange had won a key victory for the idea that government has a responsibility to help protect the common good.
membership in the national grange dropped in the 1880s as conditions improved for midwestern farmers.
the farmers revolt continued however in the south and west where organizations called farmers alliances took up the cause of reform.
the farmers alliances angrily challenged the influence of eastern bankers and industrialists.
a favorite target was wall street in new york city the nations financial capital.
mary elizabeth lease of kansas charged it is no longer a government of the people by the people and for the people but a government of wall street by wall street and for wall street.
the great common people of this country are slaves and monopoly is the master.
the populist party in 1892 leaders of the farmers alliances founded a new organization that came to be called the populist party.
the organization worked to build an alliance between farmers and industrial workers.
such a mass movement they believed could break the power of big business to dictate government policy.
that same year the populist party adopted a platform calling for such reforms as an eight hour workday and government ownership of railroads.
that fall populist candidates won election to hundreds of state and local offices.
the populist candidate for president james b weaver of iowa received over a million votes winning six of the mountain and plains states.
but that was the high point for the populist party.
four years later the democratic party adopted some populist ideas as part of its platform.
the populists decided to support the democratic presidential candidate william jennings bryan.
the republican candidate william mckinley drew heavy support from business and financial interests.
the battle lines were drawn between eastern capitalists and reform minded farmers of the south and west.
mckinley won the election handily.
his victory was a triumph for those who were opposed to radical change.
the populist party which had lost its identity after fusing with the democrats soon dissolved.
for the moment big business and its allies reigned supreme.
it would be up to other reformers to continue the fight begun by the grangers and the populists.
at wealthy industrialists gave huge sums of money to help elect republican william mckinley to the presidency in 1896.
populist party apolitical party organized in 1892 by leaders of the farmers alliances that supported such reforms as an eight hour workday and government owned railroads platform a statement of the policies favored by a political party or candidate the progressive era 53 27 3 andrew carnegie and john d rockefeller captains of industry when business leaders like andrew carnegie and john d rockefeller looked at the united states in 1900 they saw progress everywhere.
railroads linked towns and cities across the nation.
the increased ease of delivering goods by rail had nourished countless new industries including their own.
both men were proud to be captains of industry leading the way in this growth.
mere money making has never been my goal wrote rockefeller.
i had an ambition to build andrew carnegie made a huge fortune in the steel industry.
when he retired he began to give away most of his money.
this illustration shows him carrying libraries like gifts symbolizing the money he gave to thousands of communities for libraries.
industry brings progress new industries meant more jobs fora growing nation.
with immigrants pouring into the country the population of the united states tripled between 1850 and 1900.
every new factory or mill created jobs for the newcomers.
carnegie steel alone employed more than 20 000 workers many of them immigrants.
the nations new industries turned out a wealth of new products at prices ordinary americans could afford.
the home of the laboring man of our day boasts luxuries which even in the palaces of monarchs as recent as queen elizabeth were unknown wrote carnegie.
what were the luxuries he noted have become the necessaries of life the benefits of bigness according to business leaders the growth of big business made progress possible.
only big business enterprises could deliver quality goods at prices everyone could afford.
as carnegie explained in an article defending big business to its critics the cheapness of goods is in proportion to the scale of production.
the larger the scale of operation the cheaper the product.
instead of attempting to restrict growth we should hail every increase as something to be gained not for the few rich but for the millions of poor.
in carnegies view the growth of big business was the expected result of competition.
according to this view when many small companies compete in the same industry some are more likely to do well than others.
those that are run most efficiently will grow larger.
those that are not well run will perish.
the law of competition carnegie argued maybe sometimes hard for the individual but it is best for the race because it ensures the survival of the fittest in every department 538 chapter 27 when carnegie wrote about the law of competition in business he was borrowing an idea from the british naturalist charles darwin.
darwin had observed that in nature animals and plants compete for food and living space.
those that are best adapted to their environments are the most likely to survive.
this idea was popularized as survival of the fittest before long some people began to apply darwins idea to human society.
the result was social darwinism.
according to this theory people and societies compete for survival just as plants and animals do.
the most fit become wealthy and successful.
the least fit struggle just to survive.
social darwinism seemed to provide a scientific justification for huge differences in peoples wealth and power.
it also lent support to the economic concept of laissez faire the idea that businesses should operate with a minimum of government interference.
the best possible economy will then emerge naturally.
by this line of thinking it is misguided for government to try to correct such problems as child labor poor working conditions and unfair business practices.
social darwinism the theory that people and societies compete for survival with the fit becoming wealthy and successful while the weak struggle to survive john d rockefeller s standard oil company controlled 90 percent of the oil refined in the united states atthe start of the 20th century.
his business methods were considered ruthless by his critics and brilliant by his supporters.
giving away wealth in 1901 andrew carnegie sold his steel company for 250 million.
then he retired to devote his life to philanthropy or generosity to charities.
carnegie believed that rich people have a responsibility to use their wealth to help others.
he who dies rich he wrote dies disgraced carnegie used his wealth to build concert halls universities and hospitals.
most of all however he loved building libraries.
a library he said outranks any other one thing that a community can do to benefit its people before 1880 few americans had access to free public libraries.
just one generation later 35 million people a day were using libraries that carnegie had helped to build.
your example will bear fruits john d rockefeller wrote to carnegie.
the time will come when men of wealth will more generally be willing to use it for the good of others.
rockefeller used his own fortune to fund universities medical research the arts and education for all.
during his lifetime he contributed about 182 million to the rockefeller foundation a charitable organization he established to promote the well being of mankind throughout the world.
ihe progressive era the granger collection newyork teddy roosevelt is shown here vigorously shaking the railroad trust.
roosevelt tried to break up monopolistic trusts to make american business fair for all.
regulation the enforcement of laws that control conduct or practices for example government regulations control the way goods food and drugs are produced and sold to the public 27 4 theodore roosevelt trust busting president not everyone admired big business the way rockefeller and carnegie did.
many thought big businesses took unfair advantage of workers and consumers.
in 1890 congress passed the sherman antitrust act to prohibit any form of business monopoly.
the law was so vague and big business so powerful however that for years the law was not enforced.
the sherman antitrust act got its first real test only after theodore roosevelt became president in 1901.
breaking a railroad trust roosevelt came into the white house with a reputation as a reformer.
as president he attacked business monopolies with great energy.
we do not want to destroy corporations he assured the public but we do wish to make them serve the public good roosevelt s first target was a railroad monopoly called the northern securities company.
this company controlled nearly every rail line between chicago and the pacific northwest.
roosevelt had the justice department sue northern securities for violating the sherman antitrust act.
the supreme court ordered the monopoly to be broken up into smaller railroad companies.
trust busting expands just after roosevelt filed suit against northern securities mcclures magazine began publishing ida tar bells history of the standard oil trust.
in her report tarbell documented how rockefeller had driven his competitors out of business.
she told about secret deals he had made with railroads to ship his oil at lower prices than other oil companies paid.
she explained how rockefeller had cut his oil prices below what the oil cost to produce.
this attracted customers away from other oil companies.
after his o petitors went ut of business rockefeller raised prices again s ocked public demanded action.
roosevelt filed suit against n but a8ainst 44 other trusts as well.
in 1911 i was busted broken up into five major oil companies and several smaller ones.
ent rosevelt thought that government regulation or behtcem tk aws was a 8d lonterm solution to bad business that tt1 c skeat develpment of industrialism he said means governm mcrease ln the supervision exercised by the government over business enterprise 540 chapter 27 27 5 robert la follette fighter for political reform in 1890 robert la follette of wisconsin ran for reelection to congress and lost.
still a young man he returned to his work as a lawyer.
then in 1891 senator philetus sawyer a powerful republican party boss reportedly offered la follette a bribe to fix a court case.
sawyer thought that he could pay la follette to guarantee that he would win the case.
an insulted la follette reported the bribery attempt to the newspapers.
an equally insulted sawyer decided to crush la follette.
but battling bob was not an easy man to put down.
sawyer had made him so mad that la follette decided to run for governor of wisconsin.
as governor he could work to put the party bosses out of business.
in wisconsin and other states political machines or groups run by party bosses controlled local and state governments.
to make sure their candidates were elected corrupt bosses were known to bribe voters and stuff ballot boxes with fake votes.
thus the bosses not the people chose each partys candidates for office.
the candidates men like lumber millionaire sawyer usually represented powerful business interests.
without the partys support upstart reformers like la follette had little chance of reaching voters.
la follette was defeated twice by wisconsins powerful republican machine but finally won election as governor in 1900.
once he took office la follette pushed reforms that put the people in charge of politics.
wisconsin became the first state to adopt the direct primary.
this election system allowed party members not bosses to choose party candidates.
by 1916 more than half the states had adopted the wisconsin idea with the people choosing their leaders in primary elections reform governors were swept into office across the nation.
oregon introduced three other reforms that put political power into the hands of the people.
the initiative allowed citizens to enact laws by a popular vote.
the referendum allowed voters to overturn an existing law.
the recall allowed voters to remove an elected official from office.
what all these reforms had in common wrote la follette was a belief that each state could become a place where the opportunities of all its people are more equal.
and human life is safer and sweeter.
robert la follette bui party bosses controlled the u s political system through a corrupt system of bribery.
reformers like robert la follette soughtto take power out of the hands of the bosses and return it to the people.
ipail in is ai the progressive era i mother jones 27 6 mother jones champion of workers rights in 1903 labor leader mary harris jones known as mother jones went to pennsylvania to support a strike by 75 000 textile workers.
about 10 000 of the strikers were children.
jones wrote of these young workers every day little children came into union headquarters some with their hands off some with the thumb missing some with their fingers off at the knuckle.
they were stooped little things round shouldered and skinny.
many of them were not over ten years of age.
child labor laws the situation mother jones found in pennsylvania was not unusual.
in the early 1900s more than 1 million children under the age of 16 worked in mines and factories for up to 13 hours a day.
to publicize their plight jones led a march of the mill children from pennsylvania all the way to oyster bay new york to petition president roosevelt to support child labor laws.
ihe childrens march prompted stories and photographs of child workers in newspapers and magazines.
across the country reformers demanded an end to child labor.
employers claimed that abolishing child labor would produce a nation of sissies by 1909 however 43 states had passed laws that outlawed the hiring of children.
atthe turn of the century school age children worked long hours for meager wages in america s mines and factories.
improving work conditions progressive reformers also worked to improve the lives of adult workers.
in 1903 for example oregon passed a law that limited women workers to a ten hour workday.
maryland set up a program to assist workers who had been injured on the job.
new york responded to the tragic 1911 triangle shirtwaist factory fire by setting up a state committee to investigate conditions in factories.
based on the committees work the state legislature passed 56 worker protection laws.
many of these laws called for improvements in factory safety.
one permitted women workers to take pregnancy leaves.
a leave is time away from work.
another required employers to provide garment workers with chairs that had backs rather than simple stools.
mother jones saw progress for the worker in such reforms.
slowly his hours are shortened giving him leisure to read and to think she wrote.
slowly the cause of his children becomes the cause of all 542 chapter 27 277 john muir protector of the environment john muir was so clever with machines that he might have been a great inventor.
but one day in 1867 a file slipped from his hand and hit him in the eye.
this accident sent muirs life down a different path.
after recovering from his injury muir decided to spend his life roaming wild places.
i might have become a millionaire he said.
i chose to become a tramp muir found his wilderness home in yosemite valley a place of great natural beauty in californias sierra nevada.
god himself seems to be always doing his best here he wrote of yosemite.
humans in contrast seemed to be doing their worst.
loggers were cutting down yosemites ancient redwood trees.
herds of sheep were stripping its meadows and hillsides bare.
to let sheep trample so divinely fine a place seems barbarous wrote muir.
yosemite was not the only wild place threatened by human activity.
rapid industrial growth and urbanization were causing massive environmental changes.
loggers were felling the nations forests at an alarming rate.
miners were scarring mountains and polluting rivers.
many species of birds and animals were near extinction or already lost forever.
concerns over such changes had given birth to a small but growing conservation movement.
some conservationists worried most about dwindling natural resources.
they advocated careful development of the wilderness.
others like muir wanted to preserve wonders like yosemite in their natural state.
to rally the public to his cause muir started publishing articles urging the passage of laws to protect wilderness areas.
by 1890 his writings had attracted enough support to convince congress to create yosemite national park.
conservationists found an ally in president theodore roosevelt.
while roosevelt was in office he increased the amount of land set aside as national forest from 47 million to 195 million acres.
he also doubled the number of national parks.
to muir s delight the presi dent also prohibited logging and ranching in yosemite and other national parks.
wilderness is a necessity said muir.
mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers but as fountains of life theodore roosevelt left and john muir right are pictured high on a cliff in yosemite national park.
muir founded the sierra club an organization committed to the preservation of the environment.

du bois spokesman for equal rights in 1897 a black sociologist named w e b.
du bois joined the faculty of atlanta university.
his plan was to study social problems in the light of the best scientific research.
everywhere he looked du bois saw the terrible effects of racism on african americans.
in the south jim crow laws segregated schools trains parks and other public places.
these laws also banned blacks from voting in most states.
blacks in the north were not legally segregated but they still faced discrimination particularly in housing and jobs.
african americans who fought these injustices risked being lynched or brutally attacked and killed.
between 1892 and 1903 almost 3 000 african americans were lynched across the south.
one could not be a calm cool and detached scientist du bois found while negroes were lynched murdered and starved du bois wanted to do something but what.
booker t washington the best known black leader of the time advised african americans to make the best of segregation.
washington was a former slave who had founded the tuskegee institute a vocational school for blacks.
he believed that job skills for african americans would lead to economic progress and eventual acceptance.
the wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly he said.
du bois could not accept such thinking.
in 1905 he gathered influential african americans at niagara falls to push directly for voting rights.
he wanted to see an end to discrimination.
in 1917 the naacp which w e b.
du bois helped form organized this silent protest parade against lynching.
i this group of african americans became known as the niagara movement.
they continued to meet each year.
in 1909 they joined a group of white reformers who were also dissatisfied with booker t washingtons cautious approach.
together they formed the national association for the advancement of colored people.
the new organization pledged to work for equal rights and opportunities for all african americans.
by 1920 the naacp had over 90 000 members.
their goal was to make 11 million african americans physically free from peonage servitude mentally free from ignorance politically free from disenfranchisement denial of rights and socially free from insult 544 chapter 27 27 9 upton sinclair truth writer when upton sinclair wrote a novel about the horrors of slavery few people bought his work.
then a publisher asked if sinclair would write a book about factory workers who were treated like slaves.
sinclair jumped at the chance.
workers at a chicago meatpacking plant had just been brutally defeated in a labor dispute.
sinclair decided to write about them.
meatpacking horrors in 1900 chicago was the home of the nations biggest meatpacking companies.
disguised as a worker sinclair spent seven weeks in the slaughterhouses in 1904.
there he observed how cattle and hogs became steaks and sausages.
he saw employees with missing thumbs and others whose fingers had been eaten away by acid.
he heard stories of deadly falls into cooking vats.
based on his research sinclair wrote a tragic story of poor immigrants trapped in poverty by greedy business owners.
in his 1906 novel the jungle he described the horrors of meatpacking plants in great detail.
he told of sick animals being processed into food.
he described sausage made from old rotten meat mixed with everything from sawdust to rodents.
rats were nuisances he wrote and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them they would die and then rats bread and meat would go into the hoppers together the jungle became the nations biggest best seller since the civil war eras uncle tom s cabin.
but readers were more upset about the contents of their sausage than the treatment of the wage slaves i aimed at the publics heart said sinclair and by accident i hit it in the stomach bo jr upton sinclair upton sinclair shocked readers with his description of conditions inside meatpacking plants like this one.
the unsanitary conditions prompted the governmentto begin meat inspections.
safer food and drugs after reading the jungle president roosevelt ordered an investigation of the meatpacking industry.
when his investigators confirmed that conditions were as bad as sinclair had claimed congress passed the meat inspection act in 1906.
this established health standards for the meatpacking industry and federal inspection of meat.
other muckrakers revealed similar problems in the food canning and drug industries.
also in 1906 congress passed the pure food and drug act.
this law requires manufacturers to use safe ingredients in their products and to advertise them truthfully.
future decades would bring more laws protecting american consumers.
io the progressive era 27 10 alice paul women s rights hero by 1900 women had won their fight for suffrage or the right to vote in four western states.
elsewhere the drive for voting rights seemed stalled.
the progressive movement however breathed new life into the campaign begun at seneca falls in 1848.
many progressives believed that their reforms would be adopted more quickly if women had the right to vote.
a new suffrage movement in 1916 a young reformer named alice paul formed what came to be known as the national womans party.
older womens groups had worked to win the right to vote state by state.
paul and her supporters were determined to win the vote by a constitutional amendment.
to build momentum for a suffrage amendment paul organized a parade in washington d c more than 5 000 women marched amidst jeers and insults from onlookers.
newspapers applauded the courage of the suffragettes as the activists came to be known.
suffrage the right to vote passing the nineteenth amendment by 1918 women could vote in 12 states but they had made little progress on the suffrage amendment.
the national womans party began holding silent vigils outside the white house.
the protesters held banners that read mr.
president what will you do for woman suffrage and how long must women wait for liberty police arrested 200 women for blocking the sidewalk.
while in jail paul and her supporters went on a hunger strike.
when the jailers tried to force feed them the public became enraged.
the women were released to a heros welcome.
less than two months later a suffrage amendment was approved by the house of representatives by just one vote more than the two thirds majority required.
the amendment had been introduced by jeanette rankin of montana the first woman elected to congress.
suffragettes in the national women s party along with women across the country made banners marched and banded together to demand the right to vote.
546 chapter 27 senate approval took another 18 months.
the states finally ratified the nineteenth amendment on august 26 1920.
that year women across the country voted in their first national election.
paul went on to draft another amendment guaranteeing equal rights to women.
i never doubted that equal rights was the right direction she said even though the amendment was never ratified.
most reforms most problems are complicated.
but to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary equality chapter summary in this chapter you learned about the progressive movement of the early 20th century.
sowing the seeds of reform as early as the 1870s farmers organized to protest the governments laissez faire policies and the growing power of big business.
the granger and populist movements championed the cause of the common man and helped sow the seeds of progressive reform.
andrew carnegie and john d rockefeller to men of industry like carnegie and rockefeller calls for reform were misguided.
all of america they argued had benefited from industrialization.
the country was growing in wealth and ordinary americans enjoyed luxuries that were previously unheard of.
theodore roosevelt and robert la follette unlike industrialists many people thought big businesses took unfair advantage of workers and consumers.
as president roosevelt broke up business monopolies including the northern securities company railroad monopoly and the standard oil monopoly.
as governor of wisconsin la follette helped put party bosses out of business by pushing reforms that put people in charge of politics.
mother jones labor leader mary harris jones known as mother jones fought hard to end child labor.

the progressive era reading further these pennsylvania breaker boys worked in the coal mine for 10 to 12 hours a day six days a week.
children at work the rise of industry changed the lives of even the youngest members of american society.
in the late 1800s and early 1900s children some as young as four worked in mines and factories.
they worked on city streets and in tenement rooms.
it would take decades of struggle to outlaw this kind of child labor.
rows of boys some only five years old sat on wooden planks that lay across long chutes.
high above the boys huge carts dumped tons of coal into the chutes.
as the coal came tumbling down the boys sorted it removing pieces of slate and stone.
the coal came from deep in the earth where older boys and men had mined it.
the boys who sat on the planks were called breakers because it was their job to break up the coal and remove the impurities.
work was hard and days were long.
lewis hine a photographer described a typical workday for the breaker boys.
as part of a campaign against child labor hine was taking pictures of children at work.
foremen breaker bosses kept watch as the boys toiled atthe chutes boys who were not working hard enough or carefully enough soon felt a sharp rap on the neckfrom the breaker boss s stick.
the pieces of coal rattled down through long chutes at which the breaker boys sat.
it s like sitting in a coal bin all day long except that the coal is always moving and clattering and cuts their fingers.
sometimes the boys wear lamps in their caps to help them see through the thick dust.
they bend over the chutes until their backs ache and they get tired and sick because they have to breathe coal dust instead of good pure air.
ihe boys got to work at 7 00 in the morning many of their mothers walked them to the mine and did not go home until 6 or 6 30 at night.
at best the work was uncomfortable.
ihe boys were not allowed to wear gloves because doing so could make them less efficient.
so their fingers would swell crack and bleed until they hardened after a few weeks on the job.
at worst the work was dangerous.
a breaker boy who leaned too far over might fall into a chute and be crushed or smothered to death.
boys who caught their fingers in the conveyers might get them cut off.
when the boys turned 12 they moved to jobs in the mine itself.
one such job was door boy the door boy sat 500 feet below ground.
he listened for the coal cars coming from the mine and opened the door for them when they arrived.
lewis hine described the lonely job explaining that the door boy was by himself nine or ten hours a day in absolute darkness save for his little oil lamp ihe boy could not fall asleep though.
if he did a cart filled with tons of coal might smash through the closed door and crush him an 1885 law in pennsylvania the site of many coal mines said that breaker boys had to be at least 12 years old.
a 1902 law raised the age to 14.
but the law was never enforced.
fake birth certificates were easy to come by.
they cost only a quarter and so a little boy might be identified as small for his age in order to pass for 12 or 14.
the 1900 census reported that 1 75 million children under the age of 16 were working in jobs in the united states.
considering how easy it was for underage children to get jobs that figure is probably lower than the actual number of working children.
during the progressive era the first two decades of the 1900s reformers like lewis hine exposed the terrible conditions that children endured in industrial workplaces.
they wanted to see child labor outlawed.
but it would take until the 1930s for their efforts to win out.
in the meantime children labored at terrible jobs to make money that would help their families survive.
working at home and on the streets coal mines were not the only place where children worked.
they worked in mills where cloth was made in factories where glass was made and in canneries where fish was packaged.
on farms they picked crops and hoed fields.
this boy s job was to open the mine door for the full carts of coal.
lewis hine wrote about the picture owing to the intense darkness of the mine i didn t notice the chalk drawings on the door until i had developed the photographic plate.
these drawings tell the tale of the boy s loneliness underground.
the progressive era lewis hine photographed this mother and her children making flowers at home in new york.
together they earned only about 50 cents a day.
most children who sold newspapers were boys between 8 and 15 years old.
very few girls worked on the streets.
most helped their mothers at home with ironing laundry sewing and cooking.
many children also worked at home but they did far more than help with household chores.
in the early 1900s many adults brought work to their homes and did it there.
this work was called piecework because workers were paid for each piece they completed no matter how long the work took.
one reformer described four year old anetta fachini working with her mother late into the night.
the frail little thing was winding green paper around wires to make stems for artificial flowers to decorate ladies hats.
every few minutes her head would droop and her weary eyelids close but her little fingers still kept moving uselessly helplessly mechanically moving.
then the mother would shake her gently saying.
sleep not anetta.
only a few more only a few more.
john spargo the bitter cry of the children 1906 in the home industries he continued the kindergartens are robbed to provide baby slaves children also worked on the city streets.
some boys worked as bootblacks polishing mens shoes for a fee.
others delivered telegrams.
the most common job for boys was selling newspapers.
in 1899 newsies as they were called could buy 100 newspapers from the publishers for 50 cents.
then they sold the papers for one cent apiece.
if they sold all their papers they made a profit.
selling newspapers was hard work.
the boys waited outside the newspaper offices in the early morning hours to get their papers.
then they rushed out to sell their papers using whatever skills and tricks they could come up with.
selling newspapers could also be dangerous.
newsies who jumped on and off streetcars might slip and have an arm or leg run over.
when a reformer raised money to buy wooden limbs for the injured boys the boys refused to wear them.
they preferred to get the sympathy of potential buyers.
reformers worried about the newsies.
the boys knew their way around the cities including the saloons the gambling houses and other unsavory places.
but the boys themselves often liked their work.
they felt proud and independent.
fighting back neither children nor reformers simply accepted child labor.
the kids themselves fought for higher pay and better working conditions.
for example some frustrated pennsylvania breaker boys fought back against one of the foremen who was particularly mean to them.
they decided not to go to work one day.
instead they went to a local swimming hole to play.
when the nasty foreman came to get them the boys pushed him into the water and dunked him.
eventually another company man rescued him but the boys won their case.
they got a new foreman.
children also followed the lead of older workers and went on strike.
in the summer of 1899 the newsies struck against the new york journal and the new york world.
the papers publishers had raised the price they charged newsies to 60 cents for 100 papers.
the boys decided to boycott the two papers.
as the boys leader kid blink said im trying to figure out how ten cents on a hundred can mean more to a millionaire than it does to a newsboy.
i cant see it after a two week strike the boys accepted a deal.
they would pay the 60 cents but they would be able to return their unsold papers.
child workers improved their own situations but reformers wanted to outlaw child labor entirely.
photographers like lewis hine and jacob riis showed the plight of working children.
their images helped change public opinion.
union organizers like mother jones led protest marches.
her efforts pressured employers and politicians.
groups like the national consumers league and the national child labor committee lobbied to end child labor.
they wanted children to be required to go to school.
change happened slowly one state at a time until 1938.
that year the federal government passed the fair labor standards act.
the law restricted what it called oppressive child labor today the fair labor standards act restricts the hours that children under 16 can work.
and it prevents children under 18 from doing dangerous jobs days of breaker boys and newsies are long gone in the united states.
reformers worked to outlaw child labor.
they pointed out that children worked in dangerous conditions in many industries.
children who worked in textile mills for example sometimes had fingers cutoff by the machines they tended.
the progressive era 55.
