616 chapter 25 about the insistence of the chinese leader chiang kai shek on expanding his governments power in manchuria officially a part of china but over which the japanese had maintained informal economic control since 1905.
in 1931 japans military leaders staged what was in effect a coup in tokyo.
shortly after that a railroad explosion in southern manchuria manchuria invaded likely set by japanese soldiers and known as the mukden incident served as a pretext for a japanese invasion of northern manchuria.
they had conquered the region by the end of the year.
secretary of state henry stimson issued stern warnings to the japanese but to no avail.
early in 1932 japan moved farther into china attacking the city of shanghai and killing thousands of civilians.
for details on the ensuing war see america in the world the sino japanese war 1931 1941 isolationism and internationalism the administration of franklin roosevelt faced a dual challenge as it entered office in 1933.
it had to deal with the worst economic crisis in the nations history and it had to deal as well with the effects of a decaying international structure.
depression diplomacy perhaps roosevelts sharpest break with the policies of his predecessor was on the question of american economic relations with europe.
hoover had argued that only by resolving the question of war debts and reinforcing the gold standard could the american economy hope to recover.
he had therefore agreed to participate in the world economic conference to be held in london in june 1933 to attempt to resolve these issues.
by the time the conference assembled however roosevelt had already become convinced that the gold value of the dollar had to be allowed to fall in order for american goods to compete in world markets.
shortly after the conference convened he released what became fdrs bombshell message known as the bombshell message repudiating the orthodox views of most of the delegates and rejecting any agreement on currency stabilization.
the conference quickly dissolved.
at the same time roosevelt abandoned the commitments of the hoover administration to settle the issue of war debts through international agreement.
in april 1934 he signed a bill that prohibited american banks from making loans to any nation in default on its debts.
the legislation ended the old circular system by which debt payments continued only by virtue of increasing american loans.
within months war debt payments from every nation except finland stopped for good.
sixteen years after the bolshevik revolution of 1917 the american government still had not officially recognized the government of the soviet union.
but a growing number of influential americans were urging a change in policy largely because the soviet union appeared to be a possible source of trade.
soviet leader josef stalin was hoping for american cooperation in containing japan.
in november 1933 the united states and the soviet union agreed to open formal diplomatic exchange.
relations with the soviet union however soon soured.
american trade failed to establish a foothold in russia disappointing hopes in the united states.
the american government did little to reassure u s soviet relations the soviets that it was interested in stopping japanese expansion in asia dousing expectations in russia.
by the end of 1934 the soviet union and the united states were once again viewing each other with considerable mistrust.
the global crisis 1921 1941 617 the roosevelt administration was also taking a new approach toward latin america an approach that became known as the good neighbor policy and good neighbor policy that expanded on the changes the hoover administration had made.
at an inter american conference in montevideo uruguay in december 1933 secretary of state cordell hull signed a formal convention declaring no state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another the rise of isolationism with the international system of the 1920s now beyond repair the united states faced a choice between more active efforts to stabilize the world or more energetic attempts to isolate itself from it.
most americans unhesitatingly chose isolation.
support for isolationism emerged from many quarters.
some wilsonian internationalists had grown disillusioned with the league of nations and its inability to stop japanese aggression in asia.
other americans argued that the american role in world war i was a result of wall street and munitions makers.
an investigation by a senate committee chaired by senator gerald nye of north dakota claimed to have produced evidence of exorbitant profiteering and tax evasion by many corporations during the war and it suggested that bankers had pressured wilson to intervene in the war so as to protect their loans abroad.
few historians now lend much credence to these charges.
roosevelt continued to hope for at least a modest american role in maintaining world peace.
in 1935 he proposed to the senate a treaty to make the united states a member of the world court a largely symbolic gesture.
isolationists led by father coughlin and william randolph hearst aroused popular opposition to the agreement and the senate voted it down.
in the summer of 1935 mussolinis italy was preparing to invade ethiopia.
fearing the invasion would provoke a new european war american legislators tried to prevent the united states from being dragged into the conflict.
the neutrality act neutrality acts of 1935 established a mandatory arms embargo against both sides in any military conflict and warned american citizens against traveling on the ships of warring nations.
thus isolationists believed the protection of neutral rights could not again become an excuse for american intervention in war.
a 1937 law established the so called cash and carry policy by which warring nations could purchase only nonmilitary goods from the united states and could do so only by paying cash and shipping their purchases themselves.
isolationist sentiment showed its strength again in 1936 1937 in response to the civil war in spain.
the falangists of general francisco franco a group spanish civil war somewhat like the italian fascists revolted in july 1936 against the existing republican government.
hitler and mussolini supported franco both vocally and with weapons and supplies.
some americans traveled to spain to assist the republican cause but the united states government joined with britain and france in an agreement to offer no assistance to either side.
in the summer of 1937 japan intensified its six year old assault on manchuria and attacked chinas five northern provinces.
in a speech in chicago in october 1937 roosevelt warned that japanese and other aggressors should be quarantined by the international community to prevent the contagion of war from spreading.
he was deliberately vague about what such a quarantine would mean.
even so public response to the speech was hostile and roosevelt drew back.
on december 12 1937 japanese aviators bombed and sank the united states gunboat panay almost certainly deliberately as it 618 chapter 25 the spanish civil war many americans took up arms to help the republican forces fight against franco and his army.
the novelist ernest hemingway joined them in spain as a reporter and supporter of the republicans and he spent much of his time talking with both american and spanish troops.
his novel for whom the bell tolls was inspired by his experience in the civil war.
robert capa international center of photography magnum photos sailed the yangtze river in china.
but so reluctant was the roosevelt administration to antagonize the isolationists that the united states eagerly seized on japanese claims that the bombing had been an accident accepted japans apologies and overlooked the attack.
the failure of munich in 1936 hitler had moved the revived german army into the rhineland rearming an area that had been off limits to german troops since world war i.
in march 1938 german forces marched without opposition into austria and hitler proclaimed a union or anschluss between austria his native land and germany his adopted one.
neither in america nor in most of europe was there much more than a murmur of opposition.
germany had by now occupied territory surrounding three sides of western czechoslovakia a region hitler dreamed of annexing.
in september 1938 he demanded that czechoslovakia cede him the sudetenland a part of czechoslovakia in which many ethnic germans lived.
although czechoslovakia was prepared to fight to stop hitler it needed assistance from other nations.
but most western governments including the united states were willing to pay almost any price to settle the crisis peacefully.
on september 29 hitler met with the leaders of france and great britain at munich in an effort to resolve the crisis.
the french and british agreed to accept the german demands in czechoslovakia in return for hitlers promise to expand no farther.
americans watched these events nervously and the fear of war became a fixture of domestic the global crisis 1921 1941 619 thought and culture.
see patterns of popular culture orson welles and the war of the worlds the munich agreement which roosevelt supported at the time was the most prominent element of a policy that came to be known as appeasement and that came to be identified not altogether fairly with british prime minister neville chamberlain.
whoever was to blame the policy was a failure.
in march 1939 hitler occupied the remaining areas of czechoslovakia violating the munich agreement unashamedly.
and in april he began issuing threats against poland.
at that point both britain and france assured the polish government that they would come to its assistance in case of an invasion they even tried too late to draw the soviet union into a mutual defense agreement.
but the soviet leader josef stalin who had not even been invited to the munich conference had decided he could expect no protection from the west.
he signed a nonaggression pact with hitler in august 1939 freeing the germans for a while from the danger of a two front war.
shortly after that hitler staged an incident on the polish border to allow him to claim that germany had been attacked and on september 1 1939 he launched a full scale invasion of poland.
invasion of poland britain and france true to their pledges declared war on germany two days later.
world war ii already under way in asia had begun in europe.
from neutrality to intervention this nation will remain a neutral nation the president declared shortly after the hostilities began in europe but i cannot ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well there was never any question that both he and the majority of the american people favored britain france and the other allied nations in the contest.
the question was how much the united states was prepared to do to assist them.
neutrality tested at the very least roosevelt believed the united states should make armaments available to the allied armies to counter the military advantage the large german munitions industry gave hitler.
in september 1939 he asked congress to revise the neutrality acts and lift the arms embargo against any nation engaged in war.
congress maintained the prohibition on american ships entering war zones.
but the 1939 law did permit belligerents to purchase arms on the same cash and carry basis that the earlier neutrality acts had established for the sale of nonmilitary materials.
after the german armies quickly subdued poland the war in europe settled into a long quiet lull that lasted through the winter and spring a phony war some called it.
but in the spring of 1940 germany launched a massive invasion known as the blitzkrieg lightning war to the west first attacking denmark and norway sweeping the blitzkrieg next across the netherlands and belgium and driving finally deep into the heart of france.
on june 10 mussolini invaded france from the south as hitler was attacking from the north.
on june 22 france fell and nazi troops marched into paris.
a new french regime assembled in vichy largely controlled by the german occupiers and vichy regime in france in all of europe only the shattered remnants of the british and french armies daringly rescued from the beaches of dunkirk by a hastily organized armada of english boats trawlers and yachts remained to oppose the axis forces.
patterns of popular culture orson welles and the war of the worlds on the evening of october 30 1938 about 6 million americans were listening to the weekly radio program the mercury theatre on the air produced by the actor filmmaker orson welles and broadcast over the cbs network.
a few minutes into the show an announcer interrupted some dance music with a terrifying report at least forty people including six state troopers lie dead in a field east of grovers mill new jersey their bodies burned and distorted beyond recognition.
good heavens somethings wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake.
now its another one and another.
its large as a bear and it glistens like black leather.
but that face.
its indescribable.
i can hardly force myself to keep looking at it.
the panicky announcer was describing the beginning of an alien invasion of earth and the appearance of martians armed with death rays determined to destroy the planet.
later in the evening an announcer claiming to be broadcasting from times square r eported the destruction of new york city before falling dead at the microphone.
the dramatic news bulletins were part of a radio play by howard koch loosely adapted from h g wellss 1898 novel the war of the worlds.
announcers reminded the audience repeatedly throughout the broadcast that welles on the air welles top right is shown here during the broadcast of the war of the worlds in 1938.
although announcers told listeners throughout the broadcast that it was fiction welles came under intense criticism in following days for the panic it caused among many listeners.
bettmann corbis 620 they were listening to a play but many people either did not hear or did not notice the disclaimers.
by the end of the hour according to some estimates as many as a million americans were flying into panics convinced that the end of the world was imminent.
thousands of listeners in new york and new jersey fled their homes and tried to drive along clogged highways into the hills or the countryside.
in newark people ran from their buildings with wet towels wrapped around their faces or wearing gas masks as if defending themselves against the chemical warfare that many remembered from the trenches in world war i.
in cities across the country people flocked into churches to pray called police and hospitals for help flooded the switchboards of newspapers magazines and radio stations desperate for information.
i never hugged my radio so closely as i did last night one woman later explained.
i held a crucifix in my hand and prayed while looking out of my open window for falling meteors the new york times described it the next day as a wave of mass hysteria for weeks thereafter orson welles and other producers of the show were the focus of a barrage of criticism for what many americans believed had been a deliberate effort to create public fear.
for years sociologists and other scholars studied the episode for clues about mass behavior.
welles and his colleagues claimed to be surprised by the reaction their show created.
the broadcast proved more effective than they had expected because it touched on anxieties that ran deep in american life at the time.
the show aired only a few weeks after the war fever that had preceded the munich pact among germany britain and france americans already jittery about the possibility of war proved easy prey to fears of another kind of invasion.
the show also tapped longer standing anxieties about the fragility of life that afflicted many americans during the long depression of the 1930s and it seemed to frighten working class people those most vulnerable to unexpected catastrophes in particular.
most of all however the war of the worlds unintentionally exploited the enormous power that radio had come to exercise in american life and the great trust many people had developed in what they heard over the air.
for many people the broadcasts they received over the radio had become their principal even their only source of information about the outside world.
when the actors from the mercury theatre began to use the familiar phrases and cadences of radio news announcers it was easy for members of their audience to assume that they were hearing the truth.
welles concluded the broadcast by describing the play as the mercury theaters own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo.
so goodbye everybody and remember please for the next day or so the terrible lesson you learned tonight.
the grinning glowing globular invader of your living room is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch and if your doorbell rings and theres no one there that was no martian.

621 622 chapter 25 the blitz london the german luftwaffe terrorized london and other british cities in 1940 1941 and again late in the war by bombing civilian areas indiscriminately in an effort to break the spirit of the english people.
the effort failed and the fortitude of the british did much to arouse american support for their cause.
st pauls cathedral largely undamaged throughout the raids looms in the background of this photograph as other buildings crumble under the force of german bombs.
daily mail rex alamy on may 16 in the midst of the offensive roosevelt asked congress for and quickly received an additional 1 billion for defense.
that was one day after winston churchill aid to churchill the new british prime minister had sent roosevelt the first of many long lists of requests for armaments without which he insisted england could not long survive.
some americans including the ambassador to london joseph p kennedy argued that the british plight was already hopeless that any aid to the english was a wasted effort.
but the president was determined to make war materials available to britain.
roosevelt even circumvented the cash and carry provisions of the neutrality acts by giving england fifty american destroyers most of them left over from world war i in return for the right to build american bases on british territory in the caribbean.
he also returned to the factories a number of new airplanes purchased by the american military so that the british could buy them instead.
roosevelt was able to take such steps in part because of a major shift in american public opinion.
by july 1940 more than 66 percent of the public according to opinion polls believed that germany posed a direct threat to the united states.
as a result congress was more willing to permit expanded american assistance to the allies.
congress was also becoming more concerned about the need for preparations for war and in peacetime draft september it approved the burke wadsworth act inaugurating the first peacetime military draft in american history.
but a powerful new isolationist lobby the america first committee whose members included such prominent americans as charles lindbergh and senators gerald nye and the global crisis 1921 1941 623 burton wheeler joined the debate over american policy toward the war.
the lobby had at least the indirect support of a large proportion of the republican party.
through the summer and fall of 1940 the debate was complicated by a presidential campaign.
the campaign of 1940 the biggest political question of 1940 was whether franklin roosevelt would break with tradition and run for an unprecedented third term.
the president himself did not reveal his own wishes.
but by refusing to withdraw from the contest he made it impossible for any rival democrat to establish a claim to the nomination.
and when just before the democratic national convention in july he let it be known that he would accept a draft from his party the issue was virtually settled.
the democrats quickly renominated him and even reluctantly swallowed his choice for vice president agriculture secretary henry a wallace a man too liberal and too controversial for the taste of many party leaders.
the republicans nominated for president a politically inexperienced indiana businessman wendell willkie who benefited from a powerful grassroots movement as well as strong support from the luce magazines especially time and life.
the republicans took positions little different from roosevelts they would keep the country out fdr reelected of war but would extend generous assistance to the allies.
willkie was an appealing figure and a vigorous campaigner and he managed to evoke more public enthusiasm than any republican candidate in decades.
but roosevelt still won decisively.
he received 55 percent of the popular vote to willkies 45 percent and he won 449 electoral votes to willkies 82.
neutrality abandoned in the last months of 1940 roosevelt began to make subtle changes in the american role in the war.
great britain was virtually bankrupt and could no longer meet the cash andcarry requirements imposed by the neutrality acts.
the president therefore lend lease proposed a new system for supplying britain lend lease it would allow the federal government not only to sell but also to lend or lease armaments to any nation deemed pivotal to the defense of the united states in other words america could funnel weapons to england on the basis of no more than britains promise to return them when the war was over.
congress enacted the bill by wide margins in march 1941.
attacks by german submarines had made shipping lanes in the atlantic extremely dangerous.
the british navy was losing ships more rapidly than it could replace them and was finding it difficult to transport materials across the atlantic from america.
roosevelt argued that the western atlantic was a neutral zone and the responsibility of the american nations.
by july 1941 therefore american ships were patrolling the ocean as far east as iceland.
at first germany did little to challenge these obviously hostile american actions.
by september 1941 however the situation had changed.
nazi forces had invaded the soviet union in june of that year.
when the soviets did not surrender as many had predicted they would roosevelt persuaded congress to extend lend lease privileges to them.
now american industry was providing vital assistance to hitlers foes on two fronts and the american navy was protecting the flow of those goods to europe.
in september nazi submarines began a concerted torpedo campaign against american vessels.

the two nations called for a new world order based on selfdetermination economic cooperation and antimilitarism.
the president of the united states and the prime minister mr churchill representing his majestys government in the united kingdom have met at sea.
they have considered the dangers to world civilization arising from the policies of military domination by conquest upon which the hitlerite government of germany and other governments associated therewith have embarked and have made clear the stress which their countries are respectively taking for their safety in the face of these dangers.
they have agreed upon the following joint declaration joint declaration of the president of the united states of america and the prime minister mr churchill representing his majestys government in the united kingdom being met together deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world.
first their countries seek no aggrandizement territorial or other second they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned third they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live and they wish to see 624 sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them fourth they will endeavor with due respect for their existing obligations to further the enjoyment by all states great or small victor or vanquished of access on equal terms to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity fifth they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the objector securing for all improved labor standards economic advancement and social security sixth after the final destruction of the nazi tyranny they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want seventh such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance eighth they believe that all of the n ations of the world for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force.
since no future peace can be maintained if land sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten or may threaten aggression outside of their frontiers they believe pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security that the disarmament of such nations is essential.
they will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.

see consider the source joint statement by president roosevelt and prime minister churchill the road to pearl harbor japan in the meantime was still extending its empire in the pacific.
in september 1940 the japanese signed the tripartite pact a loose defensive alliance with germany and italy although in reality the european axis powers never developed a very strong relationship with japan.
in july 1941 japanese troops moved into indochina and seized the capital of vietnam a colony of france.
the united states having broken japanese codes knew japans next target was to be the oil rich dutch east indies and when tokyo failed to respond to roosevelts stern warnings the president froze all japanese assets in the united states severely limiting japans ability to purchase needed american supplies.
tokyo now faced a choice.
either it would have to repair relations with the united states to restore the flow of oil and other supplies or it would have to find those supplies elsewhere most notably by seizing british and dutch possessions in hideki tojo in power the pacific.
in october militants in tokyo forced the moderate prime minister out of office and replaced him with the leader of the war party general hideki tojo.
by late november the state department had given up on the possibility of a peaceful settlement.
american intelligence had decoded japanese messages that made clear a japanese attack was imminent.
but washington did not know where the attack would take place.
most officials continued to believe that the japanese would not move first against american territory but against british or dutch possessions to the south.
a combination of confusion miscalculation and underestimation of the japanese military caused the government to overlook indications that japan intended a direct attack on american forces.
at 7 55 a m on sunday december 7 1941 a wave of japanese bombers attacked the united states naval base at pearl harbor in hawaii part of a coordinated pattern of attacks against american and british holdings in asia.
a second wave came an hour later.

conclusion american foreign policy in the years after world war i attempted something that ultimately proved impossible.
americans were determined to be a major power in the world.
they were determined to extend the nations trade broadly around the globe.
and they were determined to influence other nations in ways that would be beneficial to americas and the worlds interests.
the united states was also determined to do nothing that would limit its own freedom of action.
it would not join the league of nations.
it would not join the world court.
it would not form alliances with other nations.
it would operate powerfully and alone.
but ominous forces were at work in the world that would gradually push the united states into greater engagement with other nations.
the economic disarray that the great depression created around the globe the rise of totalitarian regimes the expansionist ambitions of powerful new leaders all worked to destroy the uneasy stability of the post world war i international system.
americas own interests economic and otherwise the global crisis 1921 1941 627 were now imperiled.
and americas go it alone foreign policy seemed powerless to change the course of events.
franklin roosevelt tried throughout the later years of the 1930s to push the american people slowly into a greater involvement in international affairs.
in particular he tried to nudge the united states toward taking a more forceful stand against dictatorship and aggression.
a powerful isolationist movement helped stymie him for a time even after war broke out in europe.
gradually however public opinion shifted toward support of the allies britain france and the soviet union and against the axis germany italy and japan.
the nation began to mobilize for war to supply ships and munitions to britain even to engage in naval combat with german forces in the atlantic.
finally on december 7 1941 the surprise japanese attack on the american base at pearl harbor in hawaii eliminated the last elements of uncertainty and drove the united states now united behind the war effort into the greatest and most terrible conflict in human history.

590 chapter 24 and dairy products would impose production limits on their crops.
the government through the agricultural adjustment administration aaa would then tell individual agricultural adjustment administration farmers how much they should produce and would pay them subsidies for leaving some of their land idle.
a tax on food processing for example the milling of wheat would provide the funds for the new payments.
farm prices were to be subsidized up to the point of parity.
the aaa helped bring about a rise in prices for farm commodities in the years after 1933.
gross farm income increased by half in the first three years of the new deal and the agricultural economy as a whole emerged from the 1930s more stable and prosperous than it had been in many years.
the aaa did however favor larger farmers over smaller ones.
by distributing payments to landowners not those who worked the land the government allowed planters to reduce their acreage evict tenants and sharecroppers and fire field hands.
in january 1936 the supreme court struck down the crucial provisions of the aaa arguing that the government had no constitutional authority to require farmers to limit production.
but within a few weeks the administration had secured passage of new legislation the soil conservation and domestic allotment act which permitted the government to pay farmers to reduce production so as to conserve soil prevent erosion and accomplish other secondary goals.
the administration launched several efforts to assist poor farmers as well.
the resettlement administration established in 1935 and its successor the farm security farm security administration administration created in 1937 provided loans to help farmers cultivating submarginal soil to relocate to better lands.
but the programs moved no more than a few thousand farmers.
more effective was the rural electrification administration created in 1935 which worked to make electric power available for the first time to thousands of farmers through utility cooperatives.
industrial recovery since 1931 leaders of the united states chamber of commerce and many others had been urging the government to adopt an antideflation program that would permit trade associations to cooperate in stabilizing prices within their industries.
existing antitrust laws clearly forbade such practices and herbert hoover had refused to endorse suspension of the laws.
the roosevelt administration was more receptive.
in exchange for relaxing antitrust provisions however new dealers insisted on other provisions.
business leaders would have to recognize the workers right to bargain collectively through unions and to ensure that the incomes of workers would rise along with prices.
and to help create jobs and increase consumer buying power the administration added a major program of public works spending.
the result of these and many other impulses was the national industrial recovery act which congress passed in june 1933.
at its center was a new federal agency the national recovery administration nra national recovery administration under the direction of the flamboyant and energetic hugh s johnson.
johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a t emporary blanket code a m inimum wage of between 30 and 40 cents an hour a maximum workweek of thirty five to forty hours and the abolition of child labor.
at the same time johnson negotiated another more specific set of codes with leaders of the nations major industries.
these industrial codes set floors below which no company would lower prices the new deal 591 or wages in its search for a competitive advantage and they included provisions for maintaining employment and production.
he quickly won agreements from almost every major industry in the country.
from the beginning however the nra stumbled.
the codes themselves were hastily and often poorly written.
large producers consistently dominated the problems of the nra code writing process and ensured that the new regulations would work to their advantage and to the disadvantage of smaller firms.
and the codes at times did more than simply set floors under prices they actively and artificially raised them sometimes to levels higher than the market could sustain.
other nra goals also worked against recovery.
section 7 a of the national industrial recovery act promised workers the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining and encouraged many workers to join unions for the first time.
but section 7 a contained no enforcement mechanisms.
the public works administration pwa established to administer the national industrial recovery acts spending programs only gradually allowed the 3 3 billion in public works funds to trickle out.
perhaps the clearest evidence of the nras failure was that industrial production actually declined in the months after the agencys establishment despite the rise in prices that the codes had helped create.
the nra failed to increase the buying power for consumers which made the higher prices an obstacle to growth.
by the spring of 1934 the nra was besieged by criticism.
that fall roosevelt pressured johnson to resign and established a new board of directors to oversee the nra.
then in 1935 the supreme court intervened with a case involving alleged nra code violations by the schechter brothers who operated a wholesale poultry business confined to brooklyn new york.
the court ruled unanimously that the schechters were not engaged in interstate commerce and thus not subject to federal regulation and further that congress had unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the president to draft the nra codes.
the justices struck down the legislation establishing the agency.
roosevelt denounced the justices for their horse and buggy interpretation of the interstate commerce clause.
he was rightly concerned for the reasoning in the schechter case threatened many other new deal programs as well.
but many new dealers and many others welcomed the nras demise.
regional planning the aaa and the nra largely reflected the beliefs of new dealers who favored economic planning but wanted private interests farmers or business leaders to dominate the planning process.
but other reformers believed that the government itself should be the chief planning agent in the economy.
their most conspicuous tennessee valley authority success was an unprecedented experiment in regional planning the tennessee valley authority tva.
progressive reformers had agitated for years for public development of the nations water resources as a source of cheap electric power.
in particular they had urged completion of a great dam at muscle shoals on the tennessee river in alabama a dam begun during world war i but left unfinished when the war ended.
but opposition from the utilities companies had blocked further progress on the dam.
in 1932 however one of the great utility empires that of the electricity magnate samuel insull collapsed spectacularly amid widely publicized exposs of corruption.

the federal government had helped fund many projects in its history canals turnpikes railroads bridges dams and others.
but never before had it undertaken a project of such great scope and never before had it maintained such close control and ownership over the public works it helped create.
this map illustrates the broad reach of the tva within the tennessee valley region which spanned seven states.
tva dams throughout the region helped control floods and also provided a source of hydroelectric power which the government sold to consumers.
note the dam near muscle shoals alabama in the bottom left of the map.
it was begun during world war i and efforts to revive it in the 1920s helped create the momentum that produced the tva.
why were progressives so eager to see the government enter the business of hydroelectric power in the 1920s.
the tennessee valley authority utilities soon grew so intense that the companies were no longer able to block the public power movement.
the result was legislation supported by the president and enacted by congress in may 1933 creating the tennessee valley authority.
the tva was authorized to complete the dam at muscle shoals and build other dams in the region and to generate and sell electricity from them to the public at reasonable rates.
it was also intended to promote a comprehensive redevelopment of the entire region encouraging the growth of local industries supervising a substantial program of reforestation and helping farmers improve productivity.
opposition by conservatives ultimately blocked many of the ambitious social planning projects proposed by the more visionary tva administrators but the authority revitalized the region in numerous ways.
it improved water transportation virtually eliminated flooding in the region and provided electricity to thousands who had never before had it.
throughout the country largely because of the yardstick provided by the tvas cheap production of electricity private power rates declined.
even so the tennessee valley remained a generally impoverished region despite the tvas efforts.
the growth of federal relief the roosevelt administration did not consider relief to the unemployed its most important task but it recognized the necessity of doing something to help impoverished americans survive until the government could revive the economy to the point where the new deal 593 relief might not be necessary.
among roosevelts first acts as president was the establishment of the federal emergency relief administration fera which provided cash grants to states to prop up bankrupt relief agencies.
to administer the program he chose the director of the new york state relief agency harry hopkins.
both hopkins and roosevelt had misgivings about establishing a government dole but they felt somewhat more comfortable with another form of government assistance work relief.
thus when it became clear that the fera grants were not enough the administration established a second program the civil works administration cwa which put more than 4 million people to work on temporary projects between november 1933 and april 1934.
some of the projects were of lasting value such as the construction of roads schools and parks others were little more than make work.
to hopkins however the important things were pumping money into the economy and providing assistance to people with nowhere else to turn.
roosevelts favorite relief project was the civilian conservation corps ccc.
the ccc created camps in national parks and forests and in other rural civilian conservation corps and wilderness settings.
there young unemployed men from the cities worked in a semimilitary environment on such projects as planting trees building reservoirs developing parks and improving agricultural irrigation.
mortgage relief was a pressing need for millions of farm owners and homeowners.
the farm credit administration which within two years refinanced mortgage relief one fifth of all farm mortgages in the united states was one response to that problem.
the frazier lemke farm bankruptcy act of 1933 was another.
it enabled some farmers to regain their land even after the foreclosure of their mortgages.
despite such efforts however 25 percent of all american farm owners had lost their land by 1934.
homeowners were similarly troubled and in june 1933 the administration established the home owners loan corporation which by 1936 had refinanced the mortgages of more than 1 million householders.
a year later congress established the federal housing administration to insure mortgages for new construction and home repairs.
the new deal in transition seldom has an american president enjoyed such remarkable popularity as franklin roosevelt did during his first two years in office.
but by early 1935 the new deal faced fierce public criticism.
for reverberations of such praise and condemnation in the historical scholarship on roosevelt see debating the past the new deal in the spring of 1935 partly in response to these growing attacks roosevelt launched an ambitious new program of legislation that has often been called the second new deal the conservative criticism of the new deal despite his great popularity franklin roosevelt had many conservative critics.
some of them detested him so bitterly that they would refuse to say his name calling him that man those critics included businessmen financiers wealthy families and members of aristocratic society.
debating the past the new deal contemporaries of franklin roosevelt debated the impact of the new deal with ferocious intensity.
conservatives complained of a menacing tyranny of the state.
liberals celebrated the new deals progressive achievements.
some people on the left charged that the reforms of the 1930s were largely cosmetic and ignored the nations fundamental problems.
although the conservative critique found relatively little scholarly expression until many years after roosevelts death the liberal and left positions continued for decades to shape the way historians described the roosevelt administration.
the dominant view from the beginning was an approving liberal interpretation and its most important early voice was that of arthur m schlesinger jr.
he argued in the three volumes of the age of roosevelt 1957 1960 that the new deal marked a continuation of the long struggle between public power and private interests a struggle roosevelt had moved to a new level.
workers farmers consumers and others now had much more protection than they had enjoyed in the past.
at almost the same time however other historians were offering more qualified assessments of the new deal although they remained securely within the liberal framework.
richard hofstadter argued in 1955 that the new deal gave american liberalism a social democratic tinge that had never before been present in american reform movements but that its highly pragmatic approach lacked a central guiding philosophy.
james macgregor burns argued in 1956 that roosevelt failed to make full use of his potential as a leader.
594 william leuchtenburgs franklin d roosevelt and the new deal 1963 was the first systematic revisionist interpretation.
leuchtenburg challenged the views of earlier scholars who had proclaimed the new deal a revolution in social policy.
leuchtenburg could muster only enough enthusiasm to call it a halfway revolution one that helped some previously disadvantaged groups most notably farmers and workers but that did little or nothing for many others african americans sharecroppers the urban poor.
harsher criticisms soon emerged.
barton bernstein in a 1968 essay concluded that the new deal had saved capitalism but at the expense of the least powerful.
ronald radosh paul conkin and later thomas ferguson and colin gordon expanded on these criticisms.
the new deal they contended was part of the twentieth century tradition of corporate liberalism a tradition in which reform is closely wedded to the needs and interests of capitalism.
most scholars in the 1980s and 1990s however seemed largely to have accepted the revised liberal view that the new deal was a significant and valuable chapter in the history of reform but one that worked within rigid occasionally crippling limits.
much of that work on the new deal therefore focused on the constraints it faced.
some scholars notably the sociologist theda skocpol emphasized the issue of state capacity the absence of a government bureaucracy with sufficient strength and expertise to shape or administer many programs.
james t patterson barry karl mark leff and others stressed the political constraints the new deal encountered the conservative inhibitions about government that remained strong in congress and among the public.
frank freidel ellis hawley herbert stein and many others pointed as well to the ideological constraints affecting franklin roosevelt and his supporters the limits of their own understanding of their time.
alan brinkley in the end of reform 1995 described an ideological shift within new deal liberalism that marginalized older concerns about wealth and monopoly power and replaced them with consumer oriented keynesianism.
david kennedy in freedom from fear 1999 argued by contrast that the more aggressively anticapitalist measures of the early new deal actually hampered recovery.
only when roosevelt embraced the power of the market did prosperity begin to return.
the conservative attacks on the new deal in the 2000s provided a newly powerful alternative view.
a group of conservatives among them amity schlaes and burton folsom attacked the new deal as a failure that created a vast bureaucracy and caused the depression to last longer than it had to.
the phrase new deal liberalism has come in the postwar era to seem synonymous with modern ideas of aggressive federal management of the economy elaborate welfare systems a powerful bureaucracy and large scale government spending.
but many historians of the new deal would argue that the modern idea of new deal liberalism bears only a limited relationship to the ideas that new dealers themselves embraced.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
how has the scholarly understanding of the new deal changed over time.
did the new deal save capitalism.
if so how and why.
roosevelt himself was among the most aristocratic presidents in american history.
but he became the enemy of the very world that he came from.
he was an alumnus of harvard university but the university president barely spoke to him when he went there to give a speech.
he was as many members of the american elite called him a traitor to his class but even greater hatred came from conservative businessmen and financiers who correctly accused new dealers of imposing new regulations on the business and financial worlds.
his critics were also infuriated by new taxes imposed by roosevelt even though high taxation reached only a few wealthy people.
the hatred of roosevelt from conservatives took many forms.
in 1935 a whispering campaign emerged from a new deal effort to regulate the public utility industry.
stories circulated that the president was a drug addict that he was insane and that he was surrounded by psychiatrists at all times.
hamilton fish jr a highly conservative member of congress said on the floor of the house of representatives that whom the gods would destroy they make first mad not all critics were as virulent in their hatred of the president.
walter lippmann a revered columnist complained that roosevelt was moving away from the nations traditions.
we belong to a generation that has lost its way he wrote.
unable to develop the great truths which it inherited from the emancipators it has returned to the heresies of absolutism authority and the domination of men by men he added that the enormous concentration of power in the hands of appointed officials.
can lead only to waste confusion bureaucratic rigidity and the loss of personal liberty he charged that roosevelt had become attracted to fascism and communism instead of protecting the freedom of individuals.
595 596 chapter 24 lewis douglas roosevelts first budget director resigned in response to the presidents determination to spend deficit funds to help provide relief to the unemployed.
al smith the former new york governor and twice the democratic candidate also turned against the president partly because of jealousy but also because he considered the new deal much too far to the left.
however for the most part the new deal lacked a clear ideology and instead experimented in many ways some that conservatives found offensive.
conservative business leaders were the most committed leaders of the attack on the liberty league established new deal.
they formed a new organization called the liberty league led by the du pont family owners of the nations largest chemical company.
its goal was to arouse public opposition to what its members called the dictatorial policies of the new deal and to what they considered its attacks on free enterprise.
it was led by john jacob raskob a former head of the democratic national committee a former director of general motors and a trustee of du pont who had abandoned the democratic party and joined the league.
within a year of its founding in 1934 there were more than 35 000 members of the league reaching a peak of 125 000 in 1936.
it also recruited college students from 345 institutions gaining over 10 000 members.
many followers were northeastern industrialists.
the league described itself as a nonpartisan organization founded to defend the constitution and defend the rights and liberties guaranteed by that constitution its purpose was to teach the necessity of respect for the rights of persons and property as fundamental to every form of government.
to teach the duty of government to encourage and protect individual and group initiative and enterprise to foster the right to work earn save and acquire property and to preserve the ownership and lawful use of property when acquired.
the liberty league attracted considerable attention but it had relatively little impact on the new deal.
its leaders tried to remain nonpartisan even though its members were staunchly anti roosevelt.
they became a target for the presidents 1936 reelection campaign.
soon after roosevelts landslide victory the league dissolved.
hatred of roosevelt did not disappear but there was little organized opposition after 1936.
the populist criticism of the new deal roosevelts critics on the far left also managed to produce alarm among some supporters of the administration.
the communist party the socialist party and other radical and semiradical organizations were at times harshly critical of the new deal.
but like the conservatives they failed to attract genuine mass support.
more menacing to the new deal than either the far right or the far left was a group of dissident political movements that defied easy ideological classification.
some gained substantial public support within particular states and regions.
and three men succeeded in mobilizing genuinely national followings.
dr francis e townsend an elderly california physician rose from obscurity to lead a movement of more than 5 million members with his plan for federal pensions for older adults.
according to the townsend the townsend plan plan all americans over the age of sixty would receive monthly government pensions of 200 provided they retired thus freeing jobs for younger unemployed americans and spent the money in full each month which would pump needed funds into the economy.
by 1935 the townsend plan had attracted the support of many older men and women.
the new deal 597 few public speakers could arouse a crowd more effectively than huey long of louisiana known to many as the kingfish a nickname borrowed from a scheming character on the popular radio show amos n andy.
it was longs effective use of radio however that contributed most directly to his spreading national popularity in the early 1930s.
archive photos getty images huey long father charles e coughlin a catholic priest in the detroit suburb of royal oak michigan achieved even greater renown through his weekly nationally father charles coughlin broadcast radio sermons.
he proposed a series of monetary reforms remonetization of silver issuing of greenbacks and nationalization of the banking system that he insisted would restore prosperity and ensure economic justice.
at first a warm supporter of roosevelt coughlin had become disheartened by late 1934 by what he claimed was the presidents failure to deal harshly enough with the money powers in the spring of 1935 he established his own political organization the national union for social justice.
most alarming to the administration was the growing national popularity of senator huey p long of louisiana.
long had risen to power in his home state through his huey long strident attacks on the banks oil companies and utilities and on the conservative political oligarchy allied with them.
elected governor in 1928 he launched an assault on his opponents so thorough and forceful that they were soon left with virtually no political power.
but he also maintained the overwhelming support of the louisiana electorate in part because of his flamboyant personality and in part because of his solid record of conventional progressive accomplishments building roads schools and hospitals revising the tax codes distributing free textbooks lowering utility rates.
barred by law from succeeding himself as governor he ran in 1930 for a seat in the united states senate and won easily.
598 chapter 24 long like coughlin supported franklin roosevelt for president in 1932.
but within six months of roosevelts inauguration long had broken with the president.
as an alternative to the new deal he advocated a drastic program of wealth redistribution a program he ultimately named the share our wealth plan.
the government he claimed could end the depression easily by using the tax system to confiscate the surplus riches of the wealthiest men and women in america and distribute these surpluses to the rest of the population.
that would he claimed allow the government to guarantee every family a minimum homestead of 5 000 and an annual wage of 2 500.
in 1934 long established his own national organization the share our wealth society which soon attracted a large following through much of the nation.
a poll by the democratic national committee in the spring of 1935 disclosed that long might attract more than 10 percent of the vote if he ran as a third party candidate possibly enough to tip a close election to the republicans.
members of the roosevelt administration considered dissident movements and the broad popular discontent they represented a genuine threat.
an increasing number of advisers were warning roosevelt that he would have to do something dramatic to counter their strength.
the second new deal roosevelt launched the so called second new deal in the spring of 1935 in response both to growing political pressures and to the continuing economic crisis.
the new proposals represented a shift in the emphasis of new deal policy.
perhaps the most conspicuous change was in the administrations attitude toward big business.
symbolically at least the president was now willing to attack corporate interests openly.
in march for example he proposed to congress an act designed to break up the great utility holding companies.
the holding company act of 1935 was the result although furious lobbying by the utilities led to amendments that sharply limited its effects.
equally alarming to affluent americans was a series of tax reforms proposed by the president in 1935.
apparently designed to undercut the appeal of huey longs share ourwealth plan the roosevelt proposals called for establishing the highest and most progressive peacetime tax rates in history although the actual impact of these rates was limited.
the supreme court decision in 1935 to strike down the national industrial recovery act also invalidated section 7 a of the act which had guaranteed workers the right to organize and bargain collectively.
a group of progressives in congress led by senator robert e wagner of new york introduced what became the national labor relations act of 1935.
the new law popularly known as the wagner act provided workers with a crucial enforcement mechanism missing from the 1933 law the national labor relations national labor relations board board nlrb which would have power to compel employers to recognize and bargain with legitimate unions.
the president was not entirely happy with the bill but he signed it anyway.
that was largely because american workers themselves had by 1935 become so important and vigorous a force that roosevelt realized his own political future would depend in part on responding to their demands.
labor militancy the emergence of a powerful trade union movement in the 1930s occurred partly in response to government efforts to enhance the power of unions.
it was also a result of the increased militancy of american workers after a lull during the 1920s.
business leaders the new deal 599 and industrialists lost at least temporarily the ability to control government policies.
equally important new and more powerful labor organizations emerged.
the american federation of labor afl remained committed to the idea of the craft union organizing workers on the basis of their skills.
but that concept had little to offer unskilled laborers who now constituted the bulk of the industrial workforce.
during the 1930s therefore a newer concept of labor organization challenged the craft union ideal industrial unionism.
advocates of this approach argued that all workers in a particular industry should be organized in a single union regardless of what functions the workers performed.
united in this way workers would greatly increase their power.
leaders of the afl craft unions for the most part opposed the new concept.
but industrial unionism found a number of important advocates most prominent among them john l lewis the leader of the united mine workers.
at first lewis john lewis and the cio and his allies attempted to work within the afl but friction between the new industrial organizations lewis was promoting and the older craft unions grew rapidly.
at the 1935 afl convention lewis became embroiled in a series of angry confrontations with craft union leaders before finally walking out.
a few weeks later he created the committee on industrial organization.
when the afl expelled the new committee and all the industrial unions it represented lewis renamed the committee the congress of industrial organizations cio and became its first president.
the cio expanded the constituency of the labor movement.
it was more receptive to women and to african americans than the afl had been in part because cio organizing drives targeted previously unorganized industries textiles laundries tobacco factories and others where women and minorities constituted much of the workforce.
the cio was also more militant than the afl.
by the time of the 1936 schism it was already engaged in major organizing battles in the automobile and steel industries.
organizing battles the united auto workers uaw gradually emerged preeminent in the early and mid1930s.
but although it was gaining recruits it was making little progress in winning recognition from the corporations.
in december 1936 however autoworkers employed a controversial and effective new technique for challenging corporate opposition the sit down strike.
employees in several general motors plants in detroit simply sat down inside the plants refusing either to work or to leave thus preventing the company from using strikebreakers.
the tactic spread to other locations and by february 1937 strikers had occupied seventeen gm plants.
the strikers ignored court orders and local police efforts to force them to vacate the buildings.
when michigans governor refused to call up the national guard to clear out the strikers and when the federal government also refused to intervene on behalf of employers general motors relented.
in february 1937 it became the first major manufacturer to recognize the uaw.
other automobile companies soon did the same.
in the steel industry the battle for unionization was less easily won.
in 1936 the steel workers organizing committee swoc later the united steelworkers of america began a major organizing drive involving thousands of workers and frequent at times bitter strikes.
in march 1937 to the surprise of almost everyone united states steel the giant of the industry recognized the union rather than risk a costly strike.
but the smaller companies known collectively as little steel were less accommodating.
on memorial day 1937 a group of striking workers from republic steel gathered with their families 600 chapter 24 the bitterness of the labor struggles of the 1930s was nowhere more evident than in chicago in 1937 when striking workers attempting to march on a republic steel plant were brutally attacked by chicago police who used clubs tear gas and guns to turn away the marchers.
ten strikers were killed and many others were injured.
carl linde ap images the memorial day massacre for a picnic and demonstration in south chicago.
when they attempted to march peacefully and legally toward the steel plant police opened fire on them.
ten demonstrators were killed another ninety were wounded.
despite a public outcry against the memorial day massacre the harsh tactics of little steel companies succeeded.
the 1937 strike failed.
but the victory of little steel was among the last gasps of the kind of brutal strikebreaking that had proved so effective in the past.
in 1937 alone there were 4 720 strikes rapid union growth over 80 percent of them settled in favor of the unions.
by the end of the year more than 8 million workers were members of unions recognized as official bargaining units by employers as compared with 3 million in 1932.
by 1941 that number had expanded to 10 million and included the workers of little steel whose employers had finally recognized the swoc.
social security from the first moments of the new deal important members of the administration had been lobbying for a system of federally sponsored social insurance for elderly people and those who were unemployed not just for humanitarian reasons but also to keep those groups active in the nations economy.
in 1935 roosevelt gave public support to what became the social security act which congress passed the same year.
it established the new deal 601 several distinct programs.
for older people there were two types of assistance.
those who were presently destitute could receive up to 15 a month in federal assistance.
more important for the future many americans presently working were incorporated into a pension system to which they and their employers would contribute through a payroll tax it would provide them with an income on retirement.
pension payments would provide only 10 to 85 a month to recipients.
at first payment was not to be distributed until 1942.
but public pressure pushed the payment date back to 1937.
broad categories of workers including domestic servants and agricultural laborers were excluded from the program.
but the act was a crucial first step in building the nations most important social program for retired americans.
in addition the social security act created a system of unemployment insurance which employers alone would finance.
it also established a system of federal aid to people with disabilities and a program of aid to dependent children.
the framers of the social security act wanted to create a system of insurance not welfare and the largest programs old age pensions and unemployment insurance were in many ways similar to private insurance programs.
but the act also provided considerable direct assistance based on need to low income aging adults to those with disabilities to dependent children and their mothers.
these groups were widely perceived to be small and genuinely unable to support themselves.
but in later generations the programs for these groups would expand until they assumed dimensions that the planners of social security had not foreseen.
new directions in relief social security was designed primarily to fulfill long range goals.
but millions of unemployed americans had immediate needs.
to help them the roosevelt administration established in 1935 the works progress administration wpa.
like the civil works administration and other earlier efforts the wpa established a system of work relief for the unemployed.
but it was much bigger than the earlier agencies.
under the direction of harry hopkins the wpa was responsible for building or renovating 110 000 public buildings and for constructing almost 600 harry hopkins and the wpa airports more than 500 000 miles of roads and over 100 000 bridges.
in the process the wpa kept an average of 2 1 million workers employed and pumped needed money into the economy.
the wpa also displayed remarkable flexibility and imagination.
the federal writers project of the wpa for example gave unemployed writers a chance to do their work and receive a government salary.
the federal art project similarly helped painters sculptors and others continue their careers.
the federal music project and the federal theatre project oversaw the production of concerts and plays creating work for unemployed musicians actors and directors.
other relief agencies emerged alongside the wpa.
the national youth administration nya provided work and scholarship assistance to men and women of high school and college age.
the emergency housing division of the public works administration began federal sponsorship of public housing.
the new welfare system dealt with men and women in very different ways.
for men the government concentrated mainly on work relief on such programs as the ccc the cwa and the wpa.
the principal government aid to women was not work relief but cash assistance most notably through the aid to dependent children program of social security which was designed largely to assist single mothers.
this disparity in treatment 602 chapter 24 the works progress administration funded an enormous variety of work projects to provide jobs for unemployed individuals.
the majority of wpa employees however worked on construction sites.
joseph schwartz corbis wpa workers on the job reflected a widespread assumption that men should constitute the bulk of the paid workforce.
yet millions of women were already employed by the 1930s.
the 1936 referendum by the middle of 1936 with the economy visibly reviving there could be little doubt that roosevelt would win a second term.
the republican party nominated the moderate governor of kansas alf m landon who waged a relatively dull campaign.
roosevelts dissident challengers now appeared powerless.
one reason was the assassination of their most effective leader huey long in louisiana in september 1935.
another reason was the ill fated alliance among father coughlin dr townsend and gerald l k smith an intemperate henchman of huey long who joined forces that summer to establish a new political movement the union party which nominated an undistinguished north dakota congressman william lemke.
the result was the greatest landslide in american history to that point.
roosevelt polled just under 61 percent of the vote to landons 36 percent and carried every state except maine and vermont.
the democrats increased their already large majorities in both houses of congress.
the election results demonstrated the party realignment that the new deal had produced.
the democrats now controlled a broad coalition of western and southern farmers the urban working classes the poor and unemployed and white southerners as well as the new deal 603 traditional progressives and committed new liberals.
new deal aid flowing to black communities in northern cities helped pry that constituency from the republican column.
the resulting coalition constituted a substantial majority of the electorate.
it would be decades before the republican party could again create a lasting majority coalition of its own.
the new deal in disarray roosevelt emerged from the 1936 election at the zenith of his popularity.
within months however the new deal was mired in serious new difficulties.
the court fight the 1936 mandate franklin roosevelt believed made it possible for him to do something about the supreme court.
no program of reform he believed could long survive the conservative justices who had already struck down the nra and the aaa.
in february 1937 roosevelt sent a surprise message to capitol hill proposing an overhaul of the federal court system included among the many provisions was one to add up to six new justices to the supreme court.
the courts were overworked the president claimed and needed additional manpower and younger blood to enable them to cope with their increasing burdens.
but roosevelts real purpose was to give himself the opportunity to appoint new liberal justices and change the ideological balance of the court.
see consider the source franklin d roosevelt speaks on the reorganization of the judiciary conservatives were outraged at the court packing plan and even many roosevelt supporters were disturbed by it.
still roosevelt might well reaction to court packing plan have persuaded congress to approve at least a compromise measure had not the supreme court itself intervened.
of the nine justices three reliably supported the new deal and four reliably opposed it.
of the remaining two chief justice charles evans hughes often sided with the progressives and associate justice owen j roberts usually voted with the conservatives.
on march 29 1937 roberts hughes and the three progressive justices voted together to uphold a state minimum wage law in the case of west coast hotel v parrish thus reversing a 5 to 4 decision of the previous year invalidating a similar law.
two weeks later again by a 5 to 4 margin the court upheld the wagner act and in may it validated the social security act.
whatever the reasons for the decisions the courts newly moderate position made the court packing bill seem unnecessary.
congress ultimately defeated it.
on one level franklin roosevelt had achieved a victory.
the court was no longer an obstacle to new deal reforms.
but the court packing episode did lasting political damage to the administration.
from 1937 on southern democrats and other conservatives voted against roosevelts measures much more often than they had in the past.
retrenchment and recession by the summer of 1937 the national income which had dropped from 82 billion in 1929 to 40 billion in 1932 had risen to nearly 72 billion.
other economic indices also showed similar advances.
roosevelt seized on these improvements as a justification for trying to balance the federal budget.
between january and august 1937 co ns ider t he s o urc e franklin d roosevelt speaks on the reorganization of the judiciary franklin d roosevelt made masterful use of the radio to explain his policies to the american people and win their support and affection.
on tuesday march 9 1937 he went on the air to defend his controversial proposal for reforming the courts.
the president couched his appeal within a broader summary of the new deals accomplishments.
tonight sitting at my desk in the white house i make my first radio report to the people in my second term of office.
i am reminded of that evening in march four years ago when i made my first radio report to you.
we were then in the midst of the great banking crisis.
soon after with the authority of the congress we asked the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold dollar for dollar to the government of the united states.
todays recovery proves how right that policy was.
in 1933 you and i knew that we must never let our economic system get completely out of joint again that we could not afford to take the risk of another great depression.
we also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark days was to have a government with power to prevent and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that system out of joint.
we then began a program of remedying those abuses and inequalities to give balance and stability to our economic system to make it bomb proof against the causes of 1929.
today we are only part way through that program and recovery is speeding up to a point where the dangers of 1929 are again becoming possible not this week or month perhaps but within a year or two.
604 national laws are needed to complete that program.
individual or local or state effort alone cannot protect us in 1937 any better than ten years ago.
it will take time and plenty of time to work out our remedies administratively even after legislation is passed.
to complete our program of protection in time therefore we cannot delay one moment in making certain that our national government has power to carry through.
four years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour.
it was almost too late.
if we learned anything from the depression we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and debate always postponing the day of decision.
the american people have learned from the depression.
for in the last three national elections an overwhelming majority of them voted a mandate that the congress and the president begin the task of providing that protection not after long years of debate but now.
the courts however have cast doubts on the ability of the elected congress to protect us against catastrophe by meeting squarely our modern social and economic conditions.
we are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection.
it is a quiet crisis.
there are no lines of depositors outside closed banks.
but to the far sighted it is far reaching in its possibilities of injury to america.
i want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis the need to meet the unanswered challenge of one third of a nation ill nourished illclad ill housed.
last thursday i described the american form of government as a three horse team provided by the constitution to the american people so that their field might be plowed.
the three horses are of course the three branches of government the congress the executive and the courts.
two of the horses are pulling in unison today the third is not.
those who have intimated that the president of the united states is trying to drive that team overlook the simple fact that the president as chief executive is himself one of the three horses.
it is the american people themselves who are in the drivers seat.
it is the american people themselves who want the furrow plowed.
it is the american people themselves who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other two.
s ince the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation the court has more and more often and more and more boldly asserted a power to veto laws passed by the congress and state legislatures.
in the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside.
the court has been acting not as a judicial body but as a policy making body.
when the congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture to improve the conditions of labor to safeguard business against unfair competition to protect our national resources and in many other ways to serve our clearly national needs the majority of the court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of these acts of the congress and to approve or disapprove the public policy written into these laws.
we have therefore reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the constitution from the court and the court from itself.
we must find a way to take an appeal from the supreme court to the constitution itself.
we want a supreme court which will do justice under the constitution and not over it.
in our courts we want a government of laws and not of men.
what is my proposal.
it is simply this whenever a judge or justice of any federal court has reached the age of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension a new member shall be appointed by the president then in office with the approval as required by the constitution of the senate of the united states.
those opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear by crying that i am seeking to pack the supreme court and that a baneful precedent will be established.
what do they mean by the words packing the court.

according to president roosevelt what had been most important for economic reform and recovery.
how did he assess this recovery.
how were the three branches of government supposed to work in the presidents view.
what criticism did the president level against the courts.
what solution did he offer.
was this conflict between the executive branch and the united states supreme court unique to the new deal.

for example he cut the wpa in half laying off 1 5 million relief workers.
a few weeks later the fragile boom collapsed.
the index of industrial production dropped from 117 in august 1937 to 76 in may 1938.
four million additional workers lost their jobs.
economic conditions were soon almost as bad as they had been in the bleak days of 1932 1933.
605 606 chapter 24 the recession of 1937 known to the presidents critics as the roosevelt recession was a result of many factors.
but to many observers at the time it seemed to be a direct result of the administrations unwise decision to reduce spending.
and so in april 1938 the president asked congress for an emergency appropriation of 5 billion for public works and relief programs and government funds soon began pouring into the economy once again.
within a few months another tentative recovery seemed to be under way.
at about the same time roosevelt sent a stinging message to congress vehemently denouncing what he called an unjustifiable concentration of economic power and asking for the creation of a commission to consider major reforms in the antitrust laws.
in response congress established the temporary national economic committee tnec whose members included representatives of both houses of congress and officials from several executive agencies.
later in 1938 the administration successfully supported one of its most ambitious pieces of labor legislation the fair labor standards act which for the first time established a national minimum wage and a forty hour workweek and which also placed strict limits on child labor.
despite these achievements however by the end of 1938 the new deal had essentially end of the new deal come to an end.
congressional opposition now made it difficult for the president to enact any major new programs.
but more important perhaps the threat of world crisis hung heavy in the political atmosphere and roosevelt was gradually growing more concerned with persuading a reluctant nation to prepare for war than with pursuing new avenues of reform.
sources of the roosevelt recession limits and legacies of the new deal the new deal made major changes in american government some of them still controversial today.
it also left important problems unaddressed.
african americans and the new deal the new deal was not hostile to black aspirations.
eleanor roosevelt spoke throughout the 1930s on behalf of racial justice and put continuing pressure on her husband and others in the federal government to ease discrimination against blacks.
the president himself appointed a number of african americans to significant second level positions in his administration creating an informal network of officeholders that became known the black cabinet as the black cabinet eleanor roosevelt interior secretary harold ickes and wpa director harry hopkins all made efforts to ensure that new deal relief programs did not exclude blacks.
by 1935 an estimated 30 percent of all african americans were receiving some form of government assistance even amid persistent racial discrimination against people of color by the administrators of aid.
one result was a historic change in black electoral behavior.
as late as 1932 most american blacks were voting republican as they had been doing since the civil war.
by 1936 more than 90 percent were voting democratic.
african americans supported franklin roosevelt but they had few illusions that the new deal represented a major turning point in american race relations.
the president was for example never willing to risk losing the support of southern democrats by supporting legislation to make lynching a federal crime or to ban the new deal 607 the poll tax one of the most potent tools by which white southerners kept blacks from voting.
new deal relief agencies did not challenge and indeed reinforced existing patterns of discrimination.
the ccc established separate black camps.
the nra codes tolerated paying blacks less than whites doing the same jobs.
the wpa routinely relegated african americans and hispanic workers to the least skilled and lowest paying jobs when funding ebbed african americans like women were among the first discrimination reinforced to be dismissed.
the new deal was not hostile to african americans and it made some contributions to their progress.
but it never made racial justice a significant part of its agenda.
the new deal and the indian problem new deal policy toward the indian tribes marked a significant break from earlier approaches largely because of the efforts of the extraordinary commissioner of indian affairs john collier.
collier was greatly influenced by the work of twentieth century anthropologists who advanced the idea of cultural relativism the theory that every culture should be accepted and respected on its own terms.
collier wanted to reverse the pressures on native americans to assimilate and instead allow them to remain indians.
he effectively promoted legislation which became the indian reorganization act of 1934 that restored to john colliers advocacy the tribes the right to own land collectively and to elect tribal governments.
in the thirteen years after passage of the 1934 bill tribal land increased by nearly 4 million acres and indian agricultural income increased from under 2 million in 1934 to over 49 million in 1947.
even with the redistribution of lands under the 1934 act however indians continued to possess for the most part only territory whites did not want much of it arid some of it desert.
and as a group they continued to constitute the poorest segment of the population.
women and the new deal symbolically at least the new deal marked a breakthrough in the role of women in public life.
roosevelt appointed the first female member of the cabinet in the nations history secretary of labor frances perkins.
he also named more than 100 frances perkins other women to positions at lower levels of the federal bureaucracy.
but the administration was concerned not so much about achieving gender equality as about obtaining special protections for women.
the new deal generally supported the widespread belief that in hard times women should withdraw from the workplace to open up more jobs for men.
new deal relief agencies offered relatively little employment for women.
the social security program excluded domestic servants waitresses and other predominantly female occupations.
repeating its handling of racial justice the new deal was not actively hostile to feminist aspirations but it accepted prevailing cultural norms.
there was not yet sufficient political pressure from women themselves to persuade the administration to do otherwise.
indeed some of the most important supporters of policies that reinforced traditional gender roles such as social security were themselves women.
608 chapter 24 eleanor roosevelt first lady eleanor roosevelt was among the first women to play an important role in politics and government.
she oversaw franklin roosevelts political campaigns before he became president as well as developing an important career of her own working on social programs in new york.
when she moved to the white house she championed human rights issues.
in this photograph she is on the way to inspect a washington d c jail that had a reputation for being overcrowded and obsolete.
underwood underwood corbis the new deal and the west one part of american society that did receive special attention from the new deal was the american west.
the west received more government funds per capita through relief programs than any other region.
except for the tva the largest new deal public works programs the great dams and power stations were mainly in the west both because the best locations for such facilities were there and because the west had the greatest need for new sources of water and power.
the grand coulee dam on the columbia river was the largest public works project in american history to that point and it provided cheap electric power for much of the northwest.
its construction and that of other smaller dams and water projects created a basis for economic development in the region.
without this enormous public investment by the federal government much of the economic growth that transformed the west after world war ii would have been much more difficult if not impossible to achieve.
the new deal the economy and politics the most frequent criticisms of the new deal involve its failure to revive or reform the american economy.
new dealers never fully recognized the value of government spending as a vehicle for recovery.
the economic boom sparked by world war ii not the new deal finally ended the crisis.
the new deal 609 nevertheless the new deal did have a number of important and lasting effects on the american economy.
it helped elevate new groups workers and farmers in particular to positions from which they could at times challenge the power of the corporations.
it increased the regulatory functions of the federal government in ways that helped stabilize previously troubled areas of the economy the stock market the banking system and others.
and the administration helped establish the basis for new forms of federal fiscal policy which in the postwar years would give the government tools for promoting and regulating economic growth.
the new deal also created the rudiments of the american welfare state through its many relief programs and above all through the social security system.
the conservative inhibitions new dealers brought to this task ensured that the welfare system that ultimately emerged would be limited in its impact would reinforce some traditional patterns of gender and racial discrimination and would be expensive and cumbersome to administer.
but for all its limits the new system marked a historic break with the nations traditional reluctance to offer public assistance to its neediest citizens.
finally the new deal had a dramatic effect on the character of american politics.
it took a weak and divided democratic party which had been a minority force in american politics for many decades and turned it into a mighty coalition that would dominate national party competition for more than thirty years.
it turned the attention of many voters away from some of the controversial cultural issues that had preoccupied them in the 1920s and awakened an interest in economic matters of direct importance to the lives of citizens.
conclusion from the time of franklin roosevelts inauguration in 1933 to the beginning of world war ii eight years later the federal government engaged in a broad and diverse series of experiments designed to relieve the distress of unemployment and poverty to reform the economy to prevent future crises and to bring the great depression itself to an end.
it had only partial success in all those efforts.
unemployment and poverty remained high throughout the new deal although many federal programs provided assistance to millions of people who would otherwise have had none.
the structure of the american economy remained essentially the same as it had been in earlier years although there were by the end of the new deal some important new regulatory agencies in washington and an important new role for organized labor.
the new deal failed to end the great depression.
but some of its policies kept the depression from getting worse others helped alleviate the suffering of people caught in its grip and still others pointed the way toward more effective economic policies in the future.
perhaps the most important legacy of the new deal was to create a sense of possibilities among many americans.
the new deal persuaded many citizens that the fortunes of individuals need not be left entirely to chance or to the workings of an unregulated market.
many americans republicans and democrats alike emerged from the 1930s convinced that individuals deserved some protections from the unpredictability and instability of the modern economy.
the new deal for all its limitations had demonstrated the value of enlisting government in the effort to provide those protections.

what was the sequence of events between 1939 and 1941 that brought the united states into military involvement in world war ii.
henry cabot lodge of massachusetts republican chair of the senate foreign relations committee led the fight that defeated ratification of the treaty of versailles in 1919 and 1920.
as a result the united states declined to join the league of nations.
american foreign policy embarked instead on an independent course that for the next two decades would attempt but ultimately fail to expand american influence in the world without committing the united states to any lasting relationships with other nations.
lodge was not an isolationist.
he believed the united states should exert its influence internationally.
but he believed too that the united states should remain unfettered by obligations to anyone else.
he said in 1919 we are a great moral asset of christian civilization.
how did we get there.
by our own efforts.
nobody led us nobody guided us nobody controlled us.
i would keep america as she has been not isolated not prevent her from joining other nations for.
great purposes but i wish her to be master of her own fate.
in the end the limited american internationalism of the interwar years proved insufficient to protect the interests of the united states to create global stability or to keep the nation from becoming involved in the most catastrophic war in human history.
611 the diplomacy of the new era time line dawes plan kellogg briand pact japan invades manchuria critics in the 1920s often described american foreign policy with a single word isolationism.
but in reality the united states played a more active role in world affairs in the 1920s than it had at almost any previous time in its history.

but secretary of state charles evans hughes wanted to find a replacement for the league as a guarantor of world peace and stability.
the most important effort was the washington conference of 1921 an attempt to prevent a destabilizing naval armaments race among the united states britain and japan.
hughes proposed a plan for dramatic reductions in the fleets of all three nations and a ten year moratorium on the construction of large warships.
to the surprise of almost everyone the conference ultimately agreed to accept most of hughess terms.
the five power pact of february 1922 established limits for total naval tonnage and a ratio of armaments among the signatories.
for every 5 tons of american and british warships japan would maintain 3 and france and italy 1 75 each.
when the french foreign minister aristide briand asked the united states in 1927 to join an alliance against germany secretary of state frank kellogg who had replaced hughes in 1925 proposed instead a multilateral treaty outlawing war as an instrument of national policy.
fourteen nations signed the agreement in paris on august 27 1928 amid wide international acclaim.
forty eight other nations later joined the kellogg briand pact.
it contained no instruments of enforcement.
the global crisis 1921 1941 613 debts and diplomacy the first responsibility of diplomacy hughes kellogg and others agreed was to ensure that american overseas trade faced no obstacles.
the allied powers of europe were struggling to repay 11 billion in loans they had contracted with the united states during and shortly after the war.
at the same time germany was attempting to pay the reparations levied by the allies.
the united states stepped in with a solution.
charles g dawes an american banker who became vice president under coolidge in 1925 negotiated an agreement in 1924 among france britain germany and the united states.
under the dawes plan american banks would provide enormous the dawes plan loans to germany which would use that money to pay reparations to france and britain britain and france would agree to reduce the amount of those payments and in turn use those funds as well as the large loans they themselves were receiving from american banks to repay war debts to the united states.
one historian said of this circular plan it would have made equal sense for the u s to have taken the money out of one drawer in the treasury and put it into another the flow of funds was able to continue only by virtue of the enormous debts the european nations were acquiring to american banks and corporations.
the american economic involvement in europe continued to expand until the worldwide depression shattered the system in 1931.
during the 1920s american military forces maintained a presence in nicaragua panama and several other countries in the region while united states investments in latin america more than doubled.
american banks offered large loans to latin american governments just as in europe and as with the europeans the latin americans had difficulty earning the money to repay them in the face of the formidable united states tariff barrier.
hoover and the world crisis by 1931 the world financial crisis had produced a rising nationalism in europe and japan.
it soon toppled some existing political leaders and replaced them with powerful belligerent governments committed to expansion.
herbert hoover thus confronted the beginning of a process that would ultimately lead to war.
in latin america hoover tried to repair some of the damage done by earlier american policies.
he made a ten week goodwill tour through latin america before his inauguration.
once in office he generally abstained from intervening in the internal affairs of neighboring nations and moved to withdraw american troops from nicaragua and haiti.
he also announced a new policy america would grant diplomatic recognition to any sitting government in the region without questioning the means it had used to obtain power.
he even repudiated the theodore roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine by refusing to permit american intervention when several latin american countries defaulted on debt obligations in october 1931.
in europe the administration enjoyed few successes.
when hoovers proposed moratorium on debts failed to produce financial stability he refused to cancel all war debts to the united states as many economists advised him to do.
several european nations promptly went into default.
efforts to extend the 1921 limits on naval construction fell victim to french and british fears of german and japanese militarism.
the ineffectiveness of american diplomacy in europe was particularly troubling in light of the rise of fascism an ideology that rejected democratic forms of government in favor of concentrated state power under a dictator.
benito mussolinis fascist party had america in the world the sino japanese war 1931 1941 long before pearl harbor well before war broke out in europe in 1939 the first shots of what would become world war ii had been fired in the pacific in a conflict between japan and china.
having lived in almost complete isolation from the world until the nineteenth century japan emerged from world war i as one of the worlds great powers with a proud and powerful military and growing global trade.
but the great depression created severe economic problems for the japanese and as in other parts of the world the crisis strengthened the political influence of highly nationalistic armed forces.
out of the japanese military emerged dreams of a new empire in the pacific.
such an empire would its proponents believed give the nation access to fuel raw material markets for its industries as well as land for its agricultural needs and its rapidly increasing population.
such an empire they also argued would free asia from its exploitation by europe and america and would create a new world order based on moral principles during world war i japan had taken territory and economic concessions from china and had created a particularly strong presence in the northern chinese region of manchuria.
there in september 1931 a group of young militant army officers seized on a railway explosion to justify a military campaign through which they conquered the entire province.
both the united states government and the league of nations demanded that japan evacuate manchuria.
the japanese ignored them and for the next six years consolidated its control over the new territory.
614 on july 7 1937 japan began a wider war when it attacked chinese troops at the marco polo bridge outside beijing.
over the next few weeks japanese forces overran a large part of southern china including most of the port cities killing many chinese soldiers and civilians in the process.
particularly notorious was the japanese annihilation of many thousands of civilians in the city of nanjing the number has long been in dispute but estimates range from 80 000 to over 300 000 in an event that became known in china and the west as the rape of nanjing or the nanjing massacre.
the chinese government fled to the mountains.
as in 1931 the united states and the league of nations protested in vain.
china was a nation in turmoil.
it was engaged in a civil war of its own between the so called kuomintang a nationalist party led by chiang kai shek and the chinese communist party led by mao zedong and this internal struggle weakened chinas capacity to resist.
but beginning in 1937 the two rivals agreed to an uneasy truce and began fighting the japanese together with some success bogging the japanese military down in a seemingly endless war and imposing great hardships on the japanese people at home.
the japanese government and military however remained determined to continue the war against china whatever the sacrifices.
one result of the costs of the war in china was a growing japanese dependence on the united states for steel and oil to meet civilian and military needs.
in july 1941 in an effort to pressure the japanese to stop their expansion the roosevelt administration made it impossible for the japanese to continue buying american oil.
japan now faced a choice between ending its war in china or finding other sources of fuel to keep its war effort and its civilian economy going.
japan chose to extend the war beyond china in a search for oil.
the best available sources were in the dutch east indies.
but the only way to secure that european colony the japanese believed would be to neutralize the increasingly hostile united states in asia.
visionary military planners in japan began advocating a daring move to immobilize the americans in the pacific before expanding the war elsewhere with an attack on the american naval base at pearl harbor.
the first blow of world war ii in america therefore was the culmination of more than a decade of japanese efforts to conquer china.

what were the goals of the japanese militarists in the 1930s that led to the attacks on china.
why was china unable to stop japanese aggression in the 1930s.
been in control of italy since the early 1920s and had become increasingly nationalistic and militaristic.
still more ominous was the growing power of the national socialist or nazi party in germany.
by the late 1920s the weimar hitler and mussolini in europe republic the nations government since the end of world war i had been largely discredited by among other things a ruinous inflation.
adolf hitler the leader of the nazis grew rapidly in popular favor and took power in 1933.
he believed in among other things the genetic superiority of the aryan german people and in extending german territory to provide lebensraum living space for what he called the german master race he displayed a pathological anti semitism and a passionate militarism.
more immediately alarming to the hoover administration was a major crisis in asia another early step toward world war ii.
the japanese suffering from an economic depression of their own were concerned about the increasing power of the soviet union and hitler and mussolini in berlin the german and italian dictators shown here reviewing nazi troops in berlin in the mid 1930s acted publicly as if they were equals.
privately hitler treated mussolini with contempt and mussolini complained constantly of being a junior partner in the relationship.

the americans took the offensive several months later in the southern solomon islands to the east of new guinea.
in august 1942 american forces assaulted three of the islands gavutu guadalcanal tulagi and guadalcanal.
a struggle of terrible ferocity continued at guadalcanal for six months inflicting heavy losses on both sides.
in the end however the japanese were forced to abandon the island and with it their last chance of launching an effective offensive to the south.

in the meantime however they began a campaign against axis forces in north africa and in the spring of 1943 they began an invasion across the mediterranean into italy.
this map shows the points along the coast of north africa where allied forces landed in 1942 with american forces moving east from morocco and algeria and british forces moving west from egypt.
the two armies met in tunisia and moved into italy from there.
why were america and britain reluctant to launch the cross channel invasion in 1942 or 1943.
america in a world at war 631 to begin at the earliest possible moment.
but the british wanted first to launch a series of allied offensives around the edges of the nazi empire in northern africa and southern europe before undertaking the invasion of france.
roosevelt ultimately decided to support the british plan in part because he was eager to get american forces into combat quickly and knew that a cross channel invasion would take a long time to prepare.
at the end of october 1942 the british opened a counter offensive against general erwin rommel and the nazi forces in northern africa who were threatening the suez canal.
in a major battle at el alamein they forced the germans to retreat from egypt.
in early november anglo american forces landed at oran and algiers in algeria and at casablanca in morocco areas under the nazi controlled french government at vichy and began moving east toward rommel.
the germans threw the full weight of their forces in africa against the inexperienced americans and inflicted a serious defeat on them at the kasserine pass in tunisia.
general george s patton however regrouped and began an effective counteroffensive.
with the help of allied air and naval power and of british forces attacking from the east under field marshall bernard montgomery the hero of el alamein the american offensive finally drove the last germans from africa in may 1943.
the north african campaign had tied up a large proportion of allied resources postponing the planned may 1943 cross channel invasion of france despite battle of stalingrad angry complaints from the soviet union.
by now however the threat of a soviet collapse seemed much diminished for during the winter of 1942 1943 the red army had successfully held off a major german assault at stalingrad in southern russia.
hitler had committed such enormous forces to the battle and had suffered such appalling losses that he could not continue his eastern offensive.
the soviet successes persuaded roosevelt to agree in a january 1943 meeting with churchill in casablanca to a british plan for an allied invasion of sicily.
churchill argued that the operation in sicily might knock italy out of the war and tie up german divisions that would otherwise be stationed in france.
on the night of july 9 10 1943 american and british armies landed in southeastern sicily thirtyeight days later they had conquered the island and were moving onto the italian mainland.
in the face of these setbacks mussolinis government collapsed italy invaded and the dictator himself fled north toward germany.
he was later captured by italian insurgents and hanged.
mussolinis successor pietro badoglio quickly committed italy to the allies.
germany moved eight divisions into italy and established a powerful defensive line south of rome.
the allied offensive which began on september 3 1943 got bogged down at that line.
not until may 1944 did the allies break through the german defenses to resume their northward advance.
on june 4 1944 they captured rome.
the invasion of italy delayed the invasion of france by as much as a year deeply embittering stalin but also giving the soviets time to begin moving toward the countries of eastern europe.
america and the holocaust in the midst of this intensive fighting the leaders of the american government confronted one of historys great tragedies the nazi campaign to exterminate the jews of europe which became known as the holocaust.
as early as 1942 high officials in washington had incontrovertible evidence that hitlers forces were rounding up jews and others 632 chapter 26 many people consider the fate of the german liner st louis to be a powerful symbol of the indifference of the united states and other nations to the fate of european jews during the holocaust even though its forlorn journey preceded both the beginning of world war ii and the beginning of systematic extermination of jews by the nazi regime.
the st louis carried a group of over 900 jews fleeing from germany in 1939 carrying exit visas of dubious legality cynically sold to them by members of hitlers gestapo.
it became a ship without a port as it sailed from country to country mexico paraguay argentina costa rica and cuba where its passengers were refused entry time and again.
most of the passengers were hoping for a haven in the united states but the american state department refused to allow the ship even to dock as it sailed up the american eastern seaboard.
eventually the st louis returned to europe and distributed its passengers among britain france holland and belgium where this photograph was taken showing refugees smiling and waving as they prepared to disembark in antwerp in june 1939.
less than a year later all those nations except britain fell under nazi control.
bettmann getty images the st louis including poles homosexuals and communists from all over europe transporting them to concentration camps in eastern germany and poland and systematically murdering them.
the death toll would ultimately reach 6 million jews and at least 4 million others.
news of the atrocities soon reached the public as well and pressure began to build for an allied effort to end the killing or at least to rescue some of the surviving jews.
the american government consistently resisted almost all such demands.
although by u s.
inaction mid 1944 allied bombers were flying missions within a few miles of the most notorious death camp at auschwitz in poland the war department argued that sending planes to destroy the crematoria was unfeasible.
american officials also refused to destroy railroad lines leading to the camp.
and the united states resisted pleas that it admit large numbers of jewish refugees attempting to escape europe.
more forceful action by the united states and britain which was even less amenable to jewish requests for assistance might have saved at least some lives.
that they did not take such action it seems clear in retrospect constituted a considerable moral failure.
but policymakers justified their inaction by insisting that they needed to focus exclusively on the larger goal of winning the war.
any diversion of energy and attention to other purposes they believed would distract them from the overriding goal of victory.
america in a world at war 633 the american economy in wartime not since the civil war had the united states been involved in so prolonged and consuming a military experience as world war ii.
american armed forces engaged in combat around the globe for nearly four years.
american society in the meantime experienced changes that reached into every corner of the nation.
prosperity and the rights of labor world war ii had a profound impact on american domestic life by ending the great depression.
by the middle of 1941 the economic problems of the 1930s unemployment deflation industrial sluggishness had vanished before the great wave of wartime industrial expansion.
the most important catalyst of the new prosperity was government spending which after 1939 was pumping more money into the economy each year than massive government spending had all the new deal relief agencies combined.
in 1939 the federal budget had been 9 billion the highest in american peacetime history.
by 1945 it had risen to 100 billion.
largely as a result the gross national product soared from 91 billion in 1939 to 166 billion in 1945.
personal incomes in some regions grew by as much as 100 percent or more.
the west coast naturally became the launching point for the war against japan and the government created large manufacturing facilities in california and elsewhere to serve the needs of the military.
altogether the government made almost 40 billion worth of wartime capital investments factories military and transportation facilities highways power plants in the west more than in any other region.
by the end of the war the pacific coast had become the center of a growing american aircraft industry and an important shipbuilding center.
los angeles formerly a medium sized city notable chiefly for its film industry now became a major industrial center as well.
the war created a serious labor shortage.
the armed forces took more than 16 million men and women out of the civilian workforce at the same time that the demand for labor was rising rapidly.
nevertheless the supply of workers increased by almost 20 percent during the war largely through the employment of many people previously considered inappropriate for the workforce individuals who were very young or elderly minorities and most important several million women.
the war gave a substantial boost to union membership which rose from about 10 5 million in 1941 to over 13 million in 1945.
that was in part a result of labors maintenance of membership agreement with the government union membership boosted which ensured that the thousands of new workers pouring into unionized defense plants would be automatically enrolled in the unions.
but the government also managed to win two important concessions from union leaders.
one was the no strike pledge by which unions agreed not to stop production in wartime.
another was the so called little steel formula which set a 15 percent limit on wage increases.
despite the no strike pledge nearly 15 000 work stoppages took place during the war mostly wildcat strikes strikes not authorized by the union leadership.
when the united mine workers defied the government by striking in may 1943 congress reacted by passing over roosevelts veto the smith connally act the war labor disputes act which required that unions wait thirty days before striking and which empowered the president to seize a struck war plant.
in the meantime public animosity toward labor rose rapidly and some states passed laws to limit union power.
634 chapter 26 stabilizing the boom and mobilizing production the fear of deflation the central concern of the 1930s gave way during the war to a fear of inflation particularly after prices rose 25 percent in the two years before pearl harbor.
the office of price administration fighting inflation was the task of the office of price administration opa which helped moderate what had been a serious problem during world war i.
even so the agency was never popular.
black marketing and overcharging grew in proportions far beyond opas policing capacity.
from 1941 to 1945 the federal government spent a total of 321 billion twice as much as it had spent in the entire 150 years of its existence as a nation to that point and ten times as much as the cost of world war i.
the national debt rose from 49 billion in 1941 to 259 billion in 1945.
the government borrowed about half the revenues it needed by selling 100 billion worth of bonds.
much of the rest it raised by radically increasing income tax rates through the revenue act of 1942.
to simplify collection congress enacted a withholding system of payroll deductions in 1943.
in january 1942 to mobilize the wartime economy the president created the war production board wpb.
throughout its troubled history the wpb was never able to win complete control over military purchases the army and navy often circumvented the board.
nor was it able to satisfy the complaints of small business which charged correctly that most contracts went to large corporations.
gradually the president transferred much of the wpbs authority to a new office located within the white house the office of war mobilization owm.
but the owm was only slightly more successful than the wpb.
despite the administrative problems however the war economy managed to meet almost all of the nations critical war needs.
by the beginning of 1944 american factories were in fact producing more than the government needed.
their output was twice that of all the axis countries combined.
wartime science and technology more than any previous american war world war ii was a watershed for technological and scientific innovation.
that was so partly because the american government poured substantial funds into research and development beginning in 1940.
in that year government financing of research the government created the national defense research committee which later became the office of scientific research and development.
by the end of the war the new agency had spent more than 100 million on research more than four times the amount spent by the government on military research and development in the previous forty years.
in the first years of the war all the technological advantages seemed to lie with the germans and japanese.
germany had made great advances in tanks and other mechanized armor in the 1930s particularly during the spanish civil war when it had helped arm francos forces.
german submarine technology surpassed british and american capabilities in 1940.
japan had developed extraordinary capacity in its naval air technology as indicated by the successful raid on pearl harbor.
but britain and america had advantages of their own.
american techniques of mass production the great automotive assembly lines in particular were converted efficiently to military production in 1941 and 1942 and soon began producing airplanes ships tanks and other armaments in much greater numbers than could the germans and japanese.
allied scientists and engineers moved quickly as well to improve anglo american aviation and naval technology particularly submarines and tanks.
by late 1942 allied america in a world at war 635 eaponry was at least as advanced as and more plentiful than that of the enemy.
the w allies likewise enjoyed superiority in radar technology and developed effective naval mine detection systems.
anglo american antiaircraft technology both on land and on sea also improved but never to the point where it could defeat bombing raids altogether.
germany made substantial advances in the development of rocket technology in the early years of the war and managed to launch some rocket propelled bombs the v1s and v2s across the english channel aimed at london.
the psychological effects of the rockets on the british people were considerable.
but the germans were never able to create a production technology capable of building enough such rockets to make a real difference in the balance of military power.
beginning in 1942 british and american forces seized the advantage in the air war by producing new and powerful four engine bombers in great numbers.
at higher altitudes and with new navigation systems they were able to conduct extensive bombing missions over germany and later japan with much less danger of being shot down.
long range bombing the allies also benefited from a radio device that sent a sonic message to airplanes to tell them when they were within 20 yards of their targets first introduced in december 1942.
the area in which the allies had perhaps the greatest advantage was the gathering of intelligence much of it through britains top secret ultra project.
some of the advantages the allies enjoyed came from the capture of german and japanese intelligence devices.
more important however were the efforts of cryptologists or code breakers.
much of germanys coded communication made use of the so called enigma machine which constantly changed the coding systems it used.
in the first months of the war polish intelligence had developed an electromechanical computer.
it was called the bombe and it could decipher some enigma messages.
after the fall of poland british scientists led by the brilliant computer pioneer alan turing took the bombe and greatly improved it.
on april 15 1940 the new improved high speed bombe deciphered a series of german messages within hours not days as had previously been the case.
a few weeks later it began decrypting german messages at the rate of 1 000 a day providing the british and later the americans with a constant flow of information about enemy operations throughout the war.
british scientists working for the intelligence services meanwhile built the first real programmable digital computer the colossus ii which became the colossus ii operational less than a week before the beginning of the normandy invasion and which could decipher an enormous number of intercepted german messages almost instantly.
the united states similarly developed the ability to crack a japanese coding system.
race and ethnicity in wartime america the war loosened many traditional barriers that had restricted the lives of minorities and women.
there was so much demand for fighting men so much demand for labor and so much fluidity and mobility that the social and cultural barriers could not survive intact.
african americans and the war in the summer of 1941 a philip randolph president of the mostly african american brotherhood of sleeping car porters union began to insist that the a philip randolph government require companies receiving defense contracts to integrate their workforces.
636 chapter 26 to mobilize support for the demand randolph planned a massive march on washington.
the threat led roosevelt to promise to establish what became the fair employment practices commission fepc to investigate discrimination against african americans in war industries.
the need for labor in war plants greatly increased the migration of african americans from the rural south into industrial cities.
the migration improved the economic conditions wartime race riots of many african americans.
but it also created urban tensions and occasional violence.
a terrible race riot in detroit in 1943 killed thirty four people twenty five of them black.
despite such tensions leading black organizations redoubled their efforts to challenge segregation.
the congress of racial equality core organized in 1942 mobilized mass popular resistance to discrimination in a way that the older more conservative organizations had never done.
randolph bayard rustin james farmer and other younger african american leaders helped organize sit ins and demonstrations in segregated theaters and core restaurants.
core also organized freedom rides to desegregate buses and bus terminals.
though often unsuccessful these efforts strengthened a culture of civil rights activism in the black community.
pressure for change also grew within the military.
the armed forces maintained their traditional practice of limiting african americans to the most menial assignments keeping them in segregated training camps and units and barring them entirely from the marine corps and the army air force.
but there were signs of change.
by the end of the war the number of black servicemen had increased sevenfold to 700 000 some training camps were being at least partially integrated.
african americans were allowed to serve on ships with white sailors and more black units were sent into combat.
the changes did not come easily.
in some of the partially integrated army bases fort dix new jersey for example riots broke out when black soldiers protested mistreatment and segregation.
native americans and the war approximately 25 000 indians served in the military during world war ii.
many native americans saw combat.
others mostly navajo became military code talkers speaknavajo code talkers ing their own language which enemy forces would be unlikely to understand over the radio and the telephones.
the war had important effects on the indians who served in the military.
it brought them into intimate contact often for the first time with white society and it awakened among some of them a taste for the material benefits of life in capitalist america that they would retain after the war.
some never returned to the reservations but chose to remain in the non indian world and assimilate to its ways.
the war had important effects too on the native americans who stayed on the reservations.
little war work reached the tribes.
government subsidies dwindled.
talented young people left the reservations to serve in the military or work in war production creating workforce shortages in some tribes.
the wartime emphasis on national unity undermined support for the revitalization of tribal autonomy that the indian reorganization act of 1934 had launched.
new pressures emerged to eliminate the reservation system and to require the tribes to assimilate into white society.
the pressures were so severe that john collier the energetic director of the bureau of indian affairs who had done so much to promote the reinvigoration of the reservations resigned in 1945.
america in a world at war 637 mexican american war workers large numbers of mexican workers entered the united states in response to wartime labor shortages on the pacific coast and in the southwest.
the american and mexican governments agreed in 1942 to a program by which braceros contract laborers braceros program would be admitted to the united states for a limited time.
some worked as migrant farm laborers but many mexicans were able for the first time to find factory jobs.
they formed the second largest group of migrants after african americans to u s cities in the 1940s.
they concentrated mainly in the west but established significant mexican communities in chicago detroit and other industrial cities.
the sudden expansion of mexican american neighborhoods created tensions and occasional conflict.
anglo residents of los angeles became alarmed at the activities of mexican american teenagers many of whom joined street gangs pachucos.
the mexican american youths were particularly distinctive because of their style of dress.
at a time when fabric had been rationed for the war effort they wore long loose jackets with padded shoulders baggy pants tied at the ankles long watch chains broad brimmed hats and greased ducktail hairstyles.
the outfit was known as a zoot suit in june 1943 zoot suits animosity toward the zoot suiters driven partly by ethnic prejudice and partly by the apparent disregard of rationing produced a four day riot in los angeles.
anglo sailors in long beach invaded mexican american communities and attacked zoot suiters.
the police did little to restrain the sailors who grabbed hispanic teenagers tore off and burned their clothes cut off their ducktails and beat them.
when mexicans tried to fight back the police moved in and arrested them.
in the aftermath of the zoot suit riots los angeles passed a law prohibiting zoot suits.
the internment of japanese americans world war ii produced considerable animosity toward the japanese.
after the attack on pearl harbor government propaganda and popular culture combined to create an image of the japanese as a devious malign and savage people.
see consider the source the face of the enemy this racial animosity soon extended to americans of japanese descent.
there were not many japanese americans in the united states about 127 000 most of them concentrated in a few areas in california.
about one third were unnaturalized first generation immigrants issei two thirds were naturalized or native born citizens of the united states nisei.
because they generally kept to themselves and preserved traditional japanese cultural patterns it was easy for anglo americans to imagine wrongly that the japanese americans were engaged in conspiracies on behalf of their ancestral homeland.
in february 1942 in response to pressure from military officials and political leaders on the west coast including california attorney general earl warren and recommendations from the war department the president authorized the army to intern the japanese americans.
more than 100 000 people issei and nisei alike were rounded up told to dispose of their property however they could which often meant simply abandoning it and taken to what the government euphemistically called relocation relocation centers centers in fact they were facilities little different from prisons many of them located in the western mountains and desert.
a group of innocent people many of them citizens of the united states were forced to spend up to three years in grim debilitating isolation barred from lucrative employment provided with only minimal medical care and deprived of decent schools for their children.
the supreme court upheld the evacuation in the 1944 co ns ider t he s o urc e the face of the enemy during world war ii illustrators used caricature symbolism exaggeration and juxtaposition to mobilize public opinion and behavior.
the japanese were frequent objects of such representation.
early in the war an artist working under the auspices of the work projects administration wpa formerly the works progress administration produced the poster salvage scrap to blast the jap the second image arthur szyks cover for epicts colliers magazine in december 1942 d the japanese prime minister hideki tojo.
understand analyze evaluate u s navy poster salvage scrap to blast the jap the library of congress arthur szyk colliers cover december 12 1942 private collection peter newark military 638 1.
the americans and japanese are repre sented by different animals in the wpa poster.
what do those choices suggest about how people in the united states viewed the character of the two nations.
what event is artist arthur szyk depicting in the cartoon on the colliers cover.
what evidence can you find in the cartoon to support your choice.
pictures bridgeman images reproduced with the cooperation of the arthur szyk society burlingame ca america in a world at war 639 korematsu decision and although most of the japanese americans were released later that year they were unable to win any significant compensation for their korematsu v u s losses until congress finally acted in the late 1980s.
chinese americans and the war at the same time that the war undermined the position of japanese americans the american alliance with china during world war ii significantly enhanced both the legal and social status of chinese americans.
in 1943 partly to improve relations with the government of china congress repealed the chinese exclusion act which had barred almost all chinese immigration since its renewal in 1892.
the new quota for chinese immigrants was minuscule 105 a year but a substantial number of chinese women managed to gain entry into the country through other provisions covering war brides and fiances.
over 4 000 chinese women entered the united states in the first three years after the war.
permanent residents of chinese descent were finally permitted to become citizens.
racial animosity toward the chinese did not disappear but it did decline in part because government propaganda and popular culture both began presenting positive images of the chinese in some measure to contrast them with the japanese and in part because chinese americans like african americans and other previously marginal groups began taking jobs in war plants and other booming areas suffering from labor shortages.
a higher proportion of chinese americans 22 percent of all adult males was drafted than that of any other national group and the entire chinese community in most cities worked hard and conspicuously for the war effort.
anxiety and affluence in wartime culture the war created considerable anxiety in american lives.
families worried about loved ones at the front and as the war continued many mourned relatives who had died in combat.
women struggled to support families in the absence of husbands and fathers.
businesses and communities struggled with shortages of goods and labor.
people living on the two coasts in particular worried about enemy invasions and sabotage.
but the abundance of the war years also created a striking buoyancy in american life.
suddenly people had money to spend again and despite the many shortages at least some things to spend it on.
in fact consumerism became as it had in consumerism reborn the 1920s one of the most powerful forces in american culture.
home front life and culture as part of the consumerist resurgence of the war years americans spent millions of dollars and hours on entertainment and leisure.
audiences equal to about half the nations population attended movies each week.
radio ownership increased and pictorial magazines such as life flourished.
dance halls were packed with young people drawn to the seductive music of bands.
soldiers and sailors home on leave or awaiting shipment abroad were special fans of the dances which became to many of them a symbol of the life they were leaving and fighting to protect.
the most popular music was the relatively new jazz form known as swing which had emerged from the african american musical imagination.
bandleaders such as benny goodman and duke ellington were among the 640 chapter 26 most recognized figures in american popular culture rivaling movie stars and they sometimes hired black musicians to join their groups.
much of what americans read heard and saw during the war was managed by the government and military.
at the center of the governments propaganda effort was the the office of war information office of war information owi.
the owi issued posters ran magazine advertisements and produced films.
these materials urged ordinary americans to do their part buy war bonds conserve household resources keep quiet about troop movements.
government and military officials meanwhile censored the reports that journalists filed from the war zone.
correspondents happily refrained from printing anything that might compromise military strategy or effectiveness they wanted the united states to win too after all.
but roosevelt and others also believed that gory or depressing war news would sap the publics will especially in the first two years of the war.
it wasnt until september 1943 that officials allowed an image of american dead to appear in print.
federal officials had changed their minds deciding that slightly more graphic war coverage would awaken a public growing complacent about the sacrifices being made on its behalf.
hollywood films about the war and there were hundreds of them offered a relatively the celluloid war sanitized picture of the conflict.
whether of their own volition or in consultation with military officials movie producers usually offered a picture of the soldier in line with journalistic reports and government propaganda.
in many platoon films death came quickly and without blood and guts.
soldiers behaved courageously missed home and found maturity rather than breakdown through combat.
blacks didnt typically appear in these platoons true to the reality of a jim crow army but many other white ethnic groups did.
in fact a central point of many wartime pictures as well as owi propaganda posters was that jews polish americans italian americans and other groups largely barred by the 1924 immigration restriction had become assimilated contributors to the american military machine.
the upshot of all this was a wartime popular culture saturated with combat imagery but which kept some of the worst realities of war obscured.
this frustrated one of the central figures in the project of wartime information management.
the beloved war correspondent ernie pyle a popular and honest chronicler of the american gi before an audience of millions believed that no one at home had really seen the war.
after a japanese sniper killed pyle in april 1945 american soldiers found an unfinished column in his pocket.
you didnt see him lying so grotesque and pasty beside the gravel road in france he wrote of the generic dead soldier.
we saw him saw him by the multiple thousands.
thats the difference love family and sexuality in wartime for men at the front the image of home both served as a motivational symbol and helped soften the rigors of combat.
letters and mementos from loved ones sustained the morale of millions of service members.
they dreamed of music food movies and other material comforts.
many also dreamed of women wives and girlfriends but also movie stars and entertainers who became the source of one of the most popular icons of the front the pinup.
sailors pasted pinups inside their lockers.
infantrymen carried them along with pictures of wives mothers and girlfriends in their knapsacks.
fighter pilots gave their planes female names and painted bathing beauties on their nose cones.
america in a world at war 641 for the servicemen who remained in america and for soldiers and sailors in cities far from home in particular the company of friendly wholesome women was the military believed critical to sustaining morale.
the branches of the united service organization known as usos recruited thousands of young women to serve as importance of usos hostesses in their clubs.
they were expected to dress nicely dance well and chat happily with lonely men.
other women joined dance brigades traveling by bus to military bases for social evenings with servicemen.
the uso girls and the members of the dance brigades were forbidden to have any contact with men except at parties at the clubs or during dances.
clearly such regulations were often violated.
the military took elaborate measures to root out gay men and lesbians from their ranks vigilantly searching for evidence of homosexuality and unceremoniously dismissing gay people with undesirable discharges.
the services quietly tolerated illicit heterosexual relationships which they believed were temporary natural and for many men necessary.
wartime families also experienced change.
the number of women in the workforce increased by nearly 60 percent during the war as many women replaced male industrial workers serving in the military.
these new wage earning women were likely to be married and were on the whole older than most who had entered the workforce in the past.
many factory owners continued to categorize jobs by gender reserving the most lucrative positions for men.
female work like male work was also categorized by race black women women at war many american women enlisted in the army and navy womens corps during world war ii but an equally important contribution to the war effort was their work in factories and offices often in jobs that would have been considered inappropriate for them in peacetime but that they were now encouraged to assume because of the absence of so many men.
the library of congress 642 chapter 26 were usually assigned more menial tasks and paid at a lower rate than their white counterparts.
but some women began to take on heavy industrial jobs that had long been considered rosie the riveter mens work the famous wartime image of rosie the riveter symbolized the new importance of the female industrial worker.
women joined unions in substantial numbers and helped erode at least some of the prejudice including the prejudice against mothers working that had previously kept many of them from paid employment.
most women workers during the war however were employed not in factories but in service sector jobs.
above all they worked for the government whose bureaucratic needs expanded dramatically alongside its military and industrial needs.
even within the miliwaacs and waves tary which enlisted substantial numbers of women as waacs army and waves navy most female work was clerical.
many mothers whose husbands were in the military had to combine work with child care.
the scarcity of child care facilities or other community services meant that some women had no choice but to leave young children at home alone or sometimes locked in cars in factory parking lots or with relatives or neighbors while they worked.
perhaps in part because of the family dislocations of the war juvenile crime rose markedly.
young boys were arrested at increasing rates for car theft burglary vandalism and vagrancy.
for many children however the distinctive experience of the war years was not crime but work.
more than a third of all teenagers between the ages of fourteen and eighteen were employed during the last years of the war causing some reduction in high school enrollments.
the return of prosperity helped increase the marriage rate and lower the age at which people married but many marriages were unable to survive the pressures of wartime separation.
the divorce rate rose rapidly.
even so the rise in the birthrate that accompanied the increase in marriages was the first sign of what would become the great postwar baby boom the growth of wartime conservatism late in 1943 franklin roosevelt publicly suggested that dr.
new deal as he called it had served its purpose and should now give way to dr.
win the war the statement reflected the presidents own genuine shift in concern victory was now more important than reform.
but it reflected too the political reality that had emerged during the first two years of war.
the greatest assault on new deal reforms came from conservatives in congress who seized on the war as a reason to do what many had wanted to do in peacetime dismantle many of conservative assault on the new deal the achievements of the new deal.
they were assisted by the end of mass unemployment which decreased the need for such relief programs as the civilian conservation corps and the works progress administration both of which congress abolished.
they were assisted too by their own increasing numbers.
in the congressional elections of 1942 republicans gained 47 seats in the house and 10 in the senate.
republicans approached the 1944 election determined to exploit what they believed was resentment of wartime regimentation and unhappiness with democratic reform.
they democrats drop wallace nominated as their candidate the young and vigorous governor of new york thomas e dewey.
roosevelt was unopposed within his party but democratic leaders pressured him to abandon vice president henry wallace an advanced new dealer and hero of the cio.
roosevelt agreed to replace him with a more moderate figure senator harry s truman of missouri.
truman had won acclaim as chairman of the senate war investigating committee known as the truman committee which compiled an impressive record uncovering waste and corruption in wartime production.
america in a world at war 643 the election revolved around domestic economic issues and indirectly the presidents health.
he was in fact gravely ill suffering from among other things advanced arteriosclerosis.
but the campaign seemed momentarily to revive him.
roosevelt made several strenuous public appearances late in october which dispelled popular doubts about his health and ensured his reelection.
he captured 53 5 percent of the p opular roosevelt reelected vote to deweys 46 percent and 432 electoral votes to deweys 99.
democrats lost 1 seat in the senate gained 20 in the house and maintained control of both.
the defeat of the axis by the middle of 1943 america and its allies had succeeded in stopping the axis advance in both europe and the pacific.

from the east the armies of the soviet union having halted the germans at stalingrad and moscow swept across eastern europe toward germany.
from the west and the south american british and other allied forces moved toward germany through italy and after the normandy invasion in june 1944 through france.
the two offensives met in berlin in may 1945.

what problems did the position of the allied forces at the end of the war help produce.
644 chapter 26 the european offensive by early 1944 american and british bombers were attacking german industrial installations and other targets almost around the clock drastically cutting production and impeding transportation.
a february 1945 incendiary raid on dresden created a great firestorm that destroyed three fourths of the previously undamaged city and killed approximately 135 000 people almost all civilians.
an enormous offensive force had been gathering in england for two years before the spring of 1944 almost 3 million troops and perhaps the greatest array of naval vessels and armaments ever assembled in one place.
on the morning of june 6 1944 d day d day this vast invasion force moved into action.
the landing came not at the narrowest part of the english channel where the germans had expected and prepared for it but along sixty miles of the cotentin peninsula on the coast of normandy.
while airplanes and battleships offshore bombarded the nazi defenses 4 000 vessels landed american british canadian and other troops and supplies on the beaches.
three divisions of paratroopers had been dropped chaotically behind the german lines the night before.
fighting was intense along the beach but the superior manpower and equipment of the allied forces gradually prevailed.
within a week the german forces had been dislodged from virtually the entire normandy coast.
for the next month further progress remained slow.
but in late july in the battle of saint l general omar bradleys first army smashed through the german lines.
george s pattons third army spearheaded by heavy tank attacks then moved through the hole bradley had created and began a drive into the heart of france.
on august 25 free french forces arrived in paris and liberated the city from four years of german occupation.
by mid september the allied armies had driven the germans almost entirely out of france and belgium.

the invasion was launched despite threatening weather and rough seas.
popperfoto getty images america in a world at war 645 the great allied drive came to a halt however at the rhine river against a firm line of nazi defenses.
in mid december german forces struck in desperation along fifty miles of front in the ardennes forest.
in the battle of the bulge named for a battle of the bulge large bulge that appeared in the american lines as the germans pressed forward they drove fifty five miles toward antwerp before they were finally stopped at bastogne.
it was the last major battle on the western front.
while the western allies fought their way through france soviet forces swept westward into central europe and the balkans.
in late january 1945 the russians launched a great offensive toward the oder river inside germany.

by the time this picture was taken the nazis had been driven out of auschwitz and were under the control of allied soldiers.
keystone getty images auschwitz december 1944 646 chapter 26 spring they were ready to launch a final assault against berlin.
general omar bradley in the meantime was pushing toward the rhine from the west.
early in march bradleys forces captured the city of cologne on the rivers west bank.
the next day they discovered and seized an undamaged bridge over the river at remagen allied troops were soon pouring across the rhine.
in the following weeks the british commander montgomery with a million troops pushed into germany in the north while bradleys army sweeping through central germany completed the encirclement of 300 000 german soldiers in the ruhr.
the german resistance was now broken on both fronts.
american forces were moving eastward faster than they had anticipated and could have beaten the russians to berlin and prague.
the american and british high commands decided instead to halt the advance along the elbe river in central germany to await the russians.
that decision enabled the soviets to occupy eastern germany and czechoslovakia.
on april 30 with soviet forces on the outskirts of berlin adolf hitler killed himself in his bunker in the capital.
and on may 8 1945 the remaining german forces surrendered unconditionally.
the pacific offensive in february 1944 american naval forces under admiral chester nimitz won a series of victories in the marshall islands and cracked the outer perimeter of the japanese empire.
within a month the navy had destroyed other vital japanese bastions.
american submarines in the meantime were decimating japanese shipping and crippling japans domestic economy.
americas principal ally in asia was china.
to assist the chinese forces the army sent general joseph w stilwell to help provide critical supplies to china by a land route through india and across the himalayas.
it was a brutal task but in the fall of 1944 stilwells forces succeeded in constructing a road and pipelines across the mountains into china.
more dangerously the japanese were also threatening the wartime capital of china in chungking.
chiang kai shek the chinese premier was reluctant to use his troops against the japanese and seemed more concerned with attacking chinese communists who were also fighting the japanese.
after stilwell left china his successors continued to have trouble prodding chiang to confront the japanese.
the decisive battles of the pacific war occurred not in china but at sea.
in mid june 1944 an enormous american armada struck the heavily fortified mariana islands and after some of the bloodiest operations of the war captured tinian guam and saipan.
on october 20 general macarthurs troops landed on leyte island in the philippines.
the japanese now employed virtually their entire fleet against the allied invaders in three major encounters which together constituted the decisive battle of leyte gulf the largbattles of leyte gulf and iwo jima est naval engagement in history.
american forces held off the japanese onslaught and sank four japanese carriers all but destroying japans capacity to continue a serious naval war.
in february 1945 american marines seized the tiny volcanic island of iwo jima just 750 miles from tokyo but only after the costliest battle in the history of the marine corps.
the battle for okinawa an island only 370 miles south of japan gave evidence of the okinawa strength of the japanese resistance in these last desperate days.
week after week the japanese sent kamikaze suicide planes against american and british ships sacrificing america in a world at war 647 soviet union sakhalin island.

the blue lines illustrate the advance of american forces back into the pacific beginning in may 1942 and accelerating in 1943 and after which drove back the japanese forces.
the american advance was a result of two separate offensives one in the central pacific under the command of chester nimitz which moved west from hawaii and the other under the command of douglas macarthur which moved north from australia.
by the summer of 1945 american forces were approaching the japanese mainland and were bombing tokyo itself.
the dropping of two american atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki finally brought the war to an end.
why did the soviet union enter the pacific war in august 1945 as shown in the upper left corner of the map.

the united states and its allies suffered nearly 50 000 casualties before finally capturing okinawa in late june 1945.
over 100 000 japanese died in the siege.
it seemed likely that the same kind of bitter fighting would await the americans when they invaded japan.
but there were also some signs early in 1945 that such an invasion might not be necessary.
the japanese had almost no ships or planes left with which to fight.
the firebombing of tokyo in march in which american bombers tokyo firebombed dropped napalm on the city and created a firestorm in which over 80 000 people died debating the past the decision to drop the atomic bomb there has been continuing disagreement since 1945 among historians and many others about how to explain and evaluate president trumans decision to use the atomic bomb against japan.
truman himself both at the time and in his 1955 memoirs insisted that the decision was a simple and straightforward one.
the alternative to using atomic weapons he claimed was an american invasion of a japanese woman and child look grimly at a photographer as they hold pieces of bread in the aftermath of the dropping of the second american atomic bomb this one on nagasaki.
bettmann corbis nagasaki survivors 648 ainland japan that might have cost as m many as a million american lives.
that view has received considerable support from historians.
herbert feis argued in the atomic bomb and the end of world war ii 1966 that truman made his decision on purely military grounds to ensure a speedy american victory.
david mccullough the author of a popular biography of truman published in 1992 also accepted trumans own account of his actions largely uncritically as did alonzo l hamby in man of the people 1995 an important scholarly study of truman.
one consideration weighed most heavily on truman hamby concluded.
the longer the war lasted the more americans killed others have strongly disagreed.
as early as 1948 british physicist p m s blackett wrote in fear war and the bomb that the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki was not so much the last military act of the second world war as the first major operation of the cold diplomatic war with russia the most important critic of trumans decision is the historian gar alperovitz the author of two influential books on the subject atomic diplomacy hiroshima and potsdam 1965 and the decision to use the atomic bomb 1995.
alperovitz dismissed the argument that the bomb was used to shorten the war and save lives.
japan was likely to have surrendered soon even if the bomb had not been used he claimed.
instead he argued the united states used the bomb less to influence japan than to intimidate the soviet union to make russia more manageable in europe john w dowers war without mercy 1986 contributed by implication at least to another controversial explanation of the american decision racism.
the japanese many americans came to believe during the war were almost a subhuman species.
even many of trumans harshest critics however note that it is as alperovitz has written all but impossible to find specific evidence that racism was an important factor in the decision to attack hiroshima and nagasaki the debate over the decision to drop the atomic bomb is an unusually emotional one and it has inspired bitter professional and personal attacks on advocates of almost e very position.
it illustrates clearly how history has often been and remains a powerful force in the way societies define themselves.

the united states dropped two atomic bombs on japan one on hiroshima and the other on nagasaki.

was it justifiable.
do the reasons for dropping the bomb on hiroshima apply equally to the bombing of nagasaki.
how might the war in the pacific have been different if the united states had decided not to drop the bombs.
further weakened the japanese will to resist.
moderate japanese leaders who had long since concluded the war was lost were looking to end the fighting.
but they continued to face powerful opposition from military leaders.
whether the moderates could ultimately have prevailed is a question historians continue to debate.
in any case their efforts became superfluous in august 1945 when the united states made use of a terrible new weapon it had been developing throughout the war.
the manhattan project and atomic warfare reports had reached the united states in 1939 that nazi scientists had taken the first step toward the creation of an atomic bomb a weapon more powerful than any previously devised.
the united states and britain immediately began a race to develop the weapon before the germans did.
649 650 chapter 26 the search for the new weapon emerged from theories developed by atomic physicists beginning early in the century and particularly from some of the founding ideas of modern physics developed by albert einstein.
einsteins famous theory of relativity had revealed that matter could be converted into a tremendous force of energy.
einstein himself who by then had left his native germany and was living in the united states warned franklin roosevelt of german interest in atomic weapons.
by the late 1930s and early 1940s scientists at american universities were working to catch up with the germans.
soon after the united states entered the war the army took over the research and named it the manhattan project because it was devised in the manhattan engineer district office of the army corps of engineers.
over the next three years the government secretly poured nearly 2 billion into a massive scientific and technological effort conducted at hidden laboratories in oak ridge tennessee los alamos new mexico hanford washington and other sites.
scientists in oak ridge who were charged with finding a way to create a nuclear chain reaction that could be feasibly replicated within the confined space of a bomb began experimenting with plutonium a derivative of uranium first discovered by scientists at university of california berkeley.
plutonium proved capable of providing a practical fuel for the weapon.
scientists in los alamos under the direction of j robert oppenheimer were charged with the construction of the actual atomic bomb.
by 1944 despite many unforeseen problems the manhattan project scientists pushed ahead much faster than anyone had predicted.
even so the war in europe ended before they were ready to test the first weapon.
just before dawn on july 16 1945 in the desert atomic test in new mexico near alamogordo new mexico the scientists gathered to witness the first atomic explosion in history the detonation of a plutonium fueled bomb that scientists had named trinity.
the explosion a blinding flash of light perhaps brighter than any ever before seen on earth followed by a huge billowing mushroom cloud created a vast crater in the barren desert.
watching the test oppenheimer was reminded of a passage from a hindu scripture i am become death the destroyer of worlds news of the explosion reached president harry s truman who had taken office in april on the death of roosevelt in potsdam germany where he was attending a conference of allied leaders.
he issued an ultimatum to the japanese signed jointly by the british demanding that they surrender by august 3 or face utter devastation.
when the japanese failed to meet the deadline truman ordered the air force to use the new atomic weapons against japan.
controversy has continued for decades over whether trumans decision to use the bombs was justified and what his motives were.
some have argued that the atomic attack was unnecessary that had the united states agreed to the survival of the emperor before the bombs were used which it ultimately did agree to after the bombings or had it waited only a few more weeks the japanese would have surrendered.
others argue that nothing less than the atomic bombs could have persuaded the japanese to surrender without a costly american invasion.
see debating the past the decision to drop the atomic bomb most of the nations military and political leaders however seemed little concerned about such matters.
truman who had not even known of the existence of the manhattan project until he became president made what he apparently believed to be a simple military decision.
a weapon was available that would end the war quickly he could see no reason not to use it.
on august 6 1945 an american b 29 the enola gay dropped an atomic weapon on hiroshima destroyed the japanese industrial center at hiroshima.
with a single bomb the united states completely incinerated a four square mile area at the center of the previously undamaged city.
more than 80 000 civilians died according to later american estimates.
america in a world at war 651 many more suffered the crippling effects of radioactive fallout or passed those effects on to their children in the form of birth defects.
the japanese government stunned by the attack was at first unable to agree on a response.
two days later on august 8 the soviet union declared war on japan.
and the following day another american plane dropped another atomic weapon this time on the city of nagasaki inflicting 100 000 deaths and terrible damage on yet another unfortunate community.
finally the emperor intervened to break the second bomb and surrender stalemate in the cabinet and on august 14 the government announced that it was ready to give up.
on september 2 1945 on board the american battleship missouri anchored in tokyo bay japanese officials signed the articles of surrender.
the most destructive war in human history had come to an end and the united states had emerged from it not only victorious but also in a position of unprecedented power influence and prestige.
it was a victory however that few could greet with unambiguous joy.
fourteen million combatants had died in the struggle.
as many as 50 million or more civilians may have perished making world war ii by far the deadliest war in history.
the united states had suffered only light casualties in comparison with some other nations and particularly in comparison with russia and germany but the cost had still been high more than 400 000 dead almost 700 000 injured.
and the world continued to face an uncertain future menaced by the threat of nuclear warfare and by an emerging antagonism between the worlds two strongest nations the united states and the soviet union that would darken the peace for many decades to come.
conclusion the united states played a critical indeed decisive role in the war against germany and italy.
it defeated imperial japan in the pacific largely alone.
but americas contributions to and sacrifices in the war paled next to those of its most important allies.
britain france and above all the soviet union paid a staggering price in lives treasure and social unity that had no counterpart in the united states.
most american citizens in the united states experienced a booming prosperity and only modest privations during the four years of american involvement in the conflict.
there were of course jarring social changes during the war that even prosperity could not entirely offset shortages restrictions regulations family dislocations and perhaps most of all the absence of millions of men and considerable numbers of women who went overseas to fight.
american fighting men and women of course had very different experiences from those of the people who remained at home.
they endured tremendous hardships substantial casualties and much fear and loneliness.
they fought effectively and bravely.
they helped liberate north africa and italy from german occupation.
and in june 1944 finally they joined british french and other forces in a great and successful invasion of france.
it led less than a year later to the destruction of the nazi regime and the end of the european war.
in the pacific americans turned back the japanese offensive through a series of difficult naval and land battles.
ultimately however it was not the american army and navy that brought the war against japan to a close.
it was the unleashing of the most destructive weapon ever created the atomic bomb on the people of japan that finally persuaded the leaders of that nation to surrender.

why did the u s government and the american people believe that there was a threat of internal communist subversion.
even before world war ii ended there were signs of tension between the united states and the soviet union.
once the fighting was over those tensions grew to create what became known as the cold war a long and dangerous rivalry between the two former allies that would cast its shadow over international affairs and american domestic life for more than four decades.
the cold war took shape gradually over a five year period during which the relationship between the united states and the soviet union deteriorated and the united states crafted a new structure for american foreign policy known as containment that sought to keep communism from expanding.
653 origins of the cold war time line yalta and potsdam conferences united nations founded atomic energy commission established truman doctrine marshall plan proposed national security act taft hartley act nato established berlin blockade truman elected president hiss case begins soviet union explodes a bomb mao victorious in china nsc 68 korean war begins truman fires macarthur mccarthys anticommunism campaign begins american occupation of japan ends eisenhower elected president 654 few issues in twentieth century american history have aroused more debate than the origins of the cold war.
some have claimed that soviet duplicity and expansionism created the international tensions others that american provocations and global ambitions were at least equally to blame.
see debating the past the cold war sources of soviet american tension at the heart of the rivalry between the united states and the soviet union in the 1940s in addition to the basic ideological economic and political distinctions between the two societies was a f undamental difference in the ways the great powers envisioned the postwar world.
one vision first openly outlined in the atlantic charter in 1941 was a world in which nations abandoned their traditional beliefs in military alliances and spheres of influence and governed their relations with one another through democratic processes with an international organization serving as the arbiter of disputes and the protector of every nations right of self determination.
at least in theory that vision appealed to many americans including franklin roosevelt.
the other vision was that of the soviet union and to some extent great britain.
both josef stalin and winston churchill had signed the atlantic charter.
but churchill had always been uneasy about the implications of self determination for britains own enormous empire.
and the soviet union was determined to create a secure sphere for itself in central and eastern europe as protection against possible future aggression from the west.
both churchill and stalin therefore tended to envision a postwar structure vaguely similar the cold war 655 to the traditional european balance of power in which the great powers would control areas of strategic interest to them.
the united states for its part soon labored to establish and protect its own spheres of interest around the globe.
when the two sides competed for influence and power in this way the cold war began.
wartime diplomacy serious strains began to develop in the alliance with the soviet union in january 1943 when roosevelt and churchill met in casablanca morocco to discuss allied strategy.
the two leaders could not accept stalins most important demand the immediate opening of a second front in western europe.
but they tried to reassure stalin by announcing that they would accept nothing less than the unconditional surrender of the axis powers.
they would not negotiate a separate peace with hitler and leave the soviets to fight on alone.
in november 1943 roosevelt and churchill traveled to tehran iran for their first meeting with stalin.
by now however roosevelts most effective bargaining tool stalins need for american assistance against germany had been largely removed.
the german advance against russia had been halted soviet forces were now launching their own westward offensive.
nevertheless the tehran conference seemed in tehran conference most respects a success.
stalin agreed to an american request that the soviet union enter the war in the pacific soon after the end of hostilities in europe.
roosevelt in turn promised that an anglo american second front would be established within six months.
on other matters however the origins of future disagreements were already visible.
most important was the question of poland.
roosevelt and churchill were willing to agree to a movement of the soviet border westward allowing stalin to annex some historically polish territory.
but they differed sharply on the nature of the postwar government in the portion of poland that would remain independent.
roosevelt and churchill supported the claims of the polish government in exile that had been functioning in london since 1940 stalin wished to install another pro communist exiled government that had spent the war in lublin in the soviet union.
the three leaders left the tehran conference with the issue unresolved.
yalta more than a year later in february 1945 roosevelt joined churchill and stalin again for a peace conference in the soviet city of yalta.
in return for stalins renewed promise to enter the pacific war roosevelt agreed that the soviet union should receive some of the pacific territory that russia had lost in the 1904 1905 russo japanese war.
the negotiators also agreed to a plan for a new international organization one that had been hammered out during the previous summer at a conference in washington d c.
the new united nations would contain a general assembly in which united nations established every member would be represented and a security council with permanent representatives of the five major powers the united states britain france the soviet union and china each of which would have veto power.
the security council would also have temporary delegates from several other nations.
these agreements became the basis of the united nations charter drafted at a conference of fifty nations beginning april 25 1945 in san francisco.
in sharp contrast to the american rejection of the league of nations a generation before the united states senate ratified the charter in july by a vote of 80 to 2.
it was many internationalists believed a second chance to create a stable world order.
debating the past the cold war for more than a decade after the beginning of the cold war few historians saw any reason to challenge the official american interpretation of its origins.
the breakdown of relations between the united states and the soviet union was most agreed a direct result of soviet expansionism and of stalins violation of the wartime agreements forged at yalta and potsdam.
the soviet imposition of communist regimes in eastern europe was part of a larger ideological design to spread communism throughout the world.
american policy was the logical and necessary response a firm commitment to oppose soviet expansionism and to keep american forces in a continual state of readiness.
disillusionment with the official justifications for the cold war began to find expression even in the late 1950s when anticommunist sentiment in america remained strong and pervasive.
william appleman williamss the tragedy of american diplomacy 1959 insisted that the cold war was simply the most recent version of a consistent american effort in the twentieth century to preserve an open door for american trade in world markets.
the confrontation with the soviet union he argued was less a response to soviet aggressive designs than an expression of the american belief in the necessity of capitalist expansion.
as the vietnam war grew larger and more unpopular in the 1960s the scholarly critique of the cold war quickly gained intensity.
walter lafebers america russia and the cold war first published in 1967 maintained that americas supposedly idealistic internationalism at the close of the war was in reality an effort to ensure a postwar order shaped in the american image with 656 every nation open to american influence and to american trade.
that was why the united states was so apt to misinterpret soviet policy much of which r eflected a perfectly reasonable commitment to ensure the security of the soviet union itself as part of a larger aggressive design.
the revisionist interpretations of the cold war ultimately produced a reaction of their own what has come to be known as postrevisionist scholarship.
the most important work in this school attempted to strike a balance between orthodoxy and revisionism and to identify areas of blame and patterns of misconceptions on both sides of the conflict.
an important early statement of this approach was john lewis gaddiss the united states and the cold war 1941 1947 1972 which argued that neither side can bear sole responsibility for the onset of the cold war both sides had limited options given their own political constraints and their own preconceptions.
other postrevisionist works by thomas g paterson melvyn leffler william taubman and others have elaborated on ways in which the united states and the soviet union acted in response to genuine if not necessarily accurate beliefs about the intentions of the other.
the united states and the soviet union were doomed to be antagonists ernest may wrote in 1984.
there probably was never any real possibility that the post 1945 relationship could be anything but hostility verging on conflict since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 scholars have had access to newly r eleased russian archives that have enriched although not fundamentally altered the way historians view the cold war.
john lewis gaddis in we now know rethinking cold war history 1998 and the cold war 2005 portrays a cold war somewhat more dangerous than his own earlier studies and those of many other scholars had portrayed and he argues that the strong anticommunist positions of margaret thatcher ronald reagan and pope john paul ii had a larger impact on the weakening of the soviet union than was previously understood.
similarly assisted by newly released archives odd arne westad in the global cold war 2005 roots the origins of the dangerous instability in the so called third world in the frequent interventions of both the soviet union and the united states in the cold war era.

what are the orthodox revisionist and postrevisionist arguments concerning the origins of the cold war.
was the cold war inevitable.
on other issues however the yalta conference produced no real accord.
basic disagreement remained about the postwar polish government.
stalin whose armies now occupied poland had already installed a government composed of the pro communist dispute over poland lublin poles.
roosevelt and churchill insisted that the pro western london poles must be allowed a place in the warsaw regime.
roosevelt envisioned a government based on free democratic elections which both he and stalin recognized the pro western forces would win.
stalin agreed only to a vague compromise by which an unspecified number of pro western poles would be granted a place in the government.
he said he would hold free and unfettered elections in poland on an unspecified future date.
they did not happen until 1989.
nor was there agreement about germany.
roosevelt seemed to want a reconstructed and reunited germany.
stalin wanted to impose heavy reparations on germany and to ensure a permanent dismemberment of the nation.
the final agreement was like the polish accord vague and unstable.
the decision on reparations would be referred to a future commission.
the united states great britain france and the soviet union would each control its own zone of occupation in germany the zones to be determined by the position of troops at the end of the war.
berlin the german capital was churchill left and stalin right were shocked at the physical appearance of franklin roosevelt center when he arrived for their critical meeting at yalta.
roosevelt had enough energy to perform capably at the conference but he was in fact gravely ill two months later not long after he gave congress what turned out to be an unrealistically optimistic report of the prospects for postwar peace he died.

658 chapter 27 already well inside the soviet zone but because of its symbolic importance it would itself be divided into four occupied s ectors.
at an unspecified date germany would be reunited.
as for the rest of europe the conference produced a murky accord on the establishment of governments broadly representative of all democratic elements and responsible to the will of the people the yalta accords in other words were less a settlement of postwar issues than a set of loose principles that sidestepped the most difficult questions.
roosevelt churchill and stalin returned home from the conference each apparently convinced that he had signed an important agreement.
but the soviet interpretation of the accords differed so sharply from the anglo american interpretation that the illusion endured only briefly.
in the weeks following the yalta conference roosevelt watched with growing alarm as the soviet union moved systematically to establish pro communist governments in one soviets in central and eastern europe central or eastern european nation after another and as stalin refused to make the changes in poland that the president believed stalin had promised.
still believing the differences could be settled roosevelt left washington early in the spring for a vacation at his retreat in warm springs georgia.
there on april 12 1945 he suffered a sudden massive stroke and died.
the collapse of the peace the new president harry s truman had almost no familiarity with international issues.
nor did he share roosevelts apparent faith in soviet flexibility.
truman sided with the many people inside the government who considered the soviet union fundamentally untrustworthy and viewed stalin himself with suspicion and even loathing.
the failure of potsdam truman had been in office only a few days before he decided to get tough with the soviet union.
on april 23 he met with soviet foreign minister molotov and sharply chastised him for violations of the yalta accords.
in fact truman had little leverage.
russian forces already occupied poland and much of the rest of central and eastern europe.
germany was already divided among the allies.
the united states was still engaged in a war in the pacific and was neither able nor willing to enter into a second conflict in europe.
truman insisted that the united states should be able to get 85 percent of what it wanted but he was ultimately forced to settle for much less.
he conceded first on poland.
when stalin made a few minor concessions to the pro western exiles truman recognized the warsaw government hoping that noncommunist forces might gradually expand their influence there.
until the 1980s they did not.
to settle other questions truman met in july at potsdam in russian occupied germany with stalin and churchill who after elections in britain in the midst of the talks was replaced as prime minister by clement attlee.
truman reluctantly accepted the adjustments of the polish german border that stalin had long demanded he refused however to permit the russians to claim any reparations from the american french and british zones of germany.
this stance effectively confirmed that germany would remain divided.
the western zones ultimately united into one nation friendly to the united states and the russian zone survived as another nation with a pro soviet communist government.
the cold war 659 the china problem and japan american hopes for an open peaceful world policed by the great powers required a strong independent china.
but those hopes faced a major obstacle the chinese government of chiang kai shek.
chiang was generally friendly to the chiang versus mao in china united states but his government was corrupt and incompetent with feeble popular support.
ever since 1927 the nationalist government he headed had been engaged in a bitter rivalry with the communist armies of mao zedong.
by 1945 mao was in control of one fourth of the population.
some americans urged the government to try to find a third force to support as an alternative to either chiang or mao.
truman however decided reluctantly that he had no choice but to continue supporting chiang.
for the next several years the united states continued to pump money and weapons to chiang even as it was becoming clear that the cause was lost.
but truman was not prepared to intervene militarily to save the nationalist regime.
instead the american government began to consider an alternative to china as the strong pro western force in asia a revived japan.
abandoning the strict support for japan occupation policies of the first years after the war when general douglas macarthur had governed the nation the united states lifted restrictions on industrial development and encouraged rapid economic growth in japan.
the vision of an open united world was giving way in asia as it was in europe to an acceptance of a divided world with a strong pro american sphere of influence.
the containment doctrine by the end of 1945 a new american foreign policy was slowly emerging.
it became known as containment.
rather than attempting to create a unified open world or to destroy communism where it already existed the united states and its allies would work to prevent soviet expansion.
the new doctrine emerged in part as a response to events in europe in 1946.
in turkey stalin was trying to win control over the vital sea lanes to the mediterranean.
in greece communist forces were threatening the pro western government the british had announced they could no longer provide assistance.
faced with these challenges truman decided to enunciate a firm new policy.
in doing so he drew from the ideas of the american diplomat george f kennan who had warned not long after the war that the only viable american response to soviet power was a long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies on march 12 1947 truman appeared before congress and used kennans warnings as the basis of what became known as the truman doctrine.
i believe he argued that it must be the policy of the united states to truman doctrine support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures in the same speech he requested 400 million for aid to greece and turkey which congress quickly approved.
the american commitment ultimately helped reduce soviet pressure on turkey and helped the greek government defeat the communist insurgents and in the process establish containment as a basis for american policy that survived for more than forty years.
the conservative opposition to containment the containment doctrine attracted broad bipartisan support for dealing with the cold war.
but not everyone believed that containment was the right way to deal with 660 chapter 27 c ommunism.
some americans on the left believed that containment was an unnecessarily belligerent approach to the soviet union that the united states could have made peace with the russians.
wider opposition to containment came from conservative americans who believed that containment was too weak a response to communism that indeed it was a kind of appeasement.
among the conservatives who disdained containment were members of an anticomjohn birch society munist organization known as the john birch society.
its leader was robert welch a man so fearful of communism that he believed that some of the most important leaders of american government were trying to undermine the united states and collaborating with the soviets.
welch presented his opposition in the blue book of the john birch society in which he argued that much of the american government was riddled with treason.
for years he wrote we have been taken steadily down the road to communism by steps supposedly designed.
as ways of fighting communism instead he argued it was communist americans themselves who were undermining the nation.
both the u s and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians welch wrote.
if left unexposed the traitors inside the u s government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a one world socialist government among the sources of treason welch claimed was the creation of the united nations and other international institutions.
many americans considered the john birch society an extremist organization but the belief that communism was the greatest danger facing the united states was widely supported.
the opposition to containment reached some of the highest levels of the government.
john foster dulles who would soon become secretary of state in the eisenhower administration wrote the foreign policy plank in the republican platform in 1952.
we charge that the leaders of the administration in power lost the peace so dearly earned by world war ii dulles charged.
they abandoned friendly nations such as latvia lithuania estonia poland and czechoslovakia containment they argued was a policy of weakness that had allowed the communists to take over much of the world.
instead those who opposed containment called for what was known as rollback instead of containing communism the united states should be pushing back the borders of communism despite the possibility of another war.
president dwight eisenhower however did not share dulless belief in rollback and the government abided by the containment strategy throughout the 1950s and beyond despite the fevered opposition to what some still considered to be treason.
the marshall plan an integral part of the containment policy was a proposal to aid in the economic reconstruction of western europe.
there were many motives humanitarian concern for the european people a fear that europe would remain an economic drain on the united states if it could not quickly rebuild and a desire for a strong european market for american goods.
but above all american policymakers believed that unless something could be done to strengthen the shaky pro american governments in western europe those governments might fall under the control of the growing domestic communist parties.
in june 1947 secretary of state george c marshall announced a plan to provide economic assistance to all european nations including the soviet union that would join in drafting a program for recovery.
although russia and its eastern satellites predictably the cold war 661 rejected the plan sixteen western european nations eagerly participated.
whatever isolationist opposition there was in the united states largely vanished after a sudden coup in czechoslovakia in february 1948 which established a soviet dominated communist government.
in april congress approved the creation of the economic cooperation administration the agency that would administer the marshall plan as it became known.
over the next three years the marshall plan channeled 13 billion of american aid into europe helping to spark a substantial economic revival.
by the end of 1950 european industrial production had risen 64 percent communist strength in the member nations had declined and opportunities for american trade had revived.
mobilization at home in 1948 at the presidents request congress approved a new military draft and revived the selective service system.
in the meantime the united states having failed to reach agreement with the soviet union on international control of nuclear weapons redoubled its own efforts in atomic research elevating nuclear weaponry to a central place in its military arsenal.
the atomic energy commission established in 1946 became the supervisory body charged with overseeing all nuclear research civilian and military alike.
and in 1950 the truman administration approved the development of the new hydrogen bomb a nuclear weapon far more powerful than those used in 1945.
the national security act of 1947 reshaped the nations military and diplomatic institutions.
a new department of defense would oversee all branches of the armed services combining functions previously performed separately by the war and navy departments.
a national security council nsc operating out creation of nsc cia and defense department of the white house would govern foreign and military policy.
a central intelligence agency cia would replace the wartime office of strategic services and would be responsible for collecting information through both open and covert methods as the cold war continued the cia would also engage in secret political and military operations on behalf of american interests.
the national security act in other words gave the president expanded powers with which to pursue the nations international goals.
the road to nato the united states also moved to strengthen the military capabilities of western europe.
convinced that a reconstructed germany was essential to the needs of the west truman reached an agreement with england and france to merge the three western zones of occupation into a new west german republic which would include the three non soviet sectors of berlin even though that city lay within the soviet zone.
stalin responded quickly.
on june 24 1948 he imposed a tight blockade around the western sectors of berlin.
berlin airlift if germany was to be officially divided stalin was implying then the countrys western government would have to abandon the capital city in the heart of the soviet controlled eastern zone.
truman refused to do so.
unwilling to risk war through a military challenge to the blockade he ordered a massive airlift to supply the city with food fuel and other needed goods.
the airlift continued for more than ten months transporting nearly 2 5 million tons of food and other material keeping a city of 2 million people alive.
in the spring of 1949 stalin lifted the now ineffective blockade.
and in october the division of germany into two nations the federal republic in the west with its new capital in bonn and the democratic republic in the east with its capital in east berlin became official.

iraq lebanon kuwait israel jordan suez canal libya saudi arabia egypt divided europe after world war ii this map shows the sharp division that emerged in europe after world war ii between the area under the control of the soviet union and the area allied with the united states.
in the east soviet control or influence extended into all the nations shaded brown including the eastern half of germany.
in the west and south the green shaded nations were allied with the united states as members of the north atlantic treaty organization nato.
the countries shaded gold were aligned with neither of the two superpowers.
the small map in the upper right shows the division of berlin among the various occupying powers at the end of the war.
eventually the american british and french sectors were combined to create west berlin a city governed by west germany but entirely surrounded by communist east germany.
the airplane icons represent the airlift of supplies ordered by president truman into the blockaded zones of west berlin beginning in june 1948.
how did the west prevent east germany from absorbing west berlin.
the crisis in berlin accelerated the consolidation of what was already in effect an alliance among the united states and the countries of western europe.
on april 4 1949 twelve nations signed an agreement establishing the north atlantic treaty organization nato declaring that an armed attack against one member would be considered an attack against all.
the nato countries would moreover maintain a standing military force in europe to defend against what they believed was the threat of a soviet invasion.
the formation of nato eventually spurred the soviet union to create an alliance of its warsaw pact own with the communist governments in eastern europe as formalized in 1955 by the warsaw pact.
the cold war 663 reevaluating cold war policy in september 1949 the soviet union successfully exploded its first atomic weapon.
the russian nuclear capacity came years earlier than predicted shocking and frightening many americans.
so did the collapse of chiang kai sheks nationalist government in china which occurred with startling speed in the last months of 1949.
chiang fled with his political allies and the remnants of his army to the offshore island of formosa taiwan and the entire chinese mainland came under the control of a communist victory in china communist government led by mao zedong that many americans believed to be an extension of the soviet union.
the united states refused to recognize the new communist regime.
the fall of china to communism was one of the most traumatic events of the cold war.
it accelerated the fear of communism and it persuaded many americans that the defeat was a result of weakness and even treason.
as a result american friends of china formed what came to be known as the china lobby.
among its eminent leaders were members of congress high level military figures and powerful journalists.
they believed that the united states had not done enough to prevent the communists from taking over mainland china.
the failure persuaded many americans that the government particularly members of the state department was responsible.
in this atmosphere of escalating crisis truman called for a thorough review of american foreign policy.
the result a national security council report issued in 1950 and commonly known as nsc 68 outlined a shift in the american position.
the first statements of the containment doctrine the writings of george kennan the truman doctrine speech had made distinctions between areas of vital interest to the united states and areas of less importance to the nations foreign policy.
the containment doctrine also called for sharing the military burden of protecting the western nations.
but nsc 68 argued that the united states could no longer rely on other nations to take the initiative in resisting communism.
it must move on its own to stop communist expansion virtually anywhere it occurred regardless of the intrinsic strategic or economic value of the lands in question.
among other things the report called for a major expansion of american military power with a defense budget almost four times the previously projected figure.
see consider the source national security council paper no.
68 america after the war the crises overseas were not the only frustrations the american people encountered after the war.
the nation also faced serious if short lived economic difficulties in adapting to peace.
and it suffered from an exceptionally heated political climate that produced a new wave of insecurity and repression.
the problems of reconversion despite widespread predictions that the end of the war would return america to depression conditions economic growth continued after 1945.
pent up consumer demand from workers who had accumulated substantial savings during the war helped spur the boom.
so did a 6 billion tax cut.
the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 better known as the gi bill of rights provided housing education and job training subsidies to gi bill veterans and increased spending even further.
co ns ider t he s o urc e national security council paper no.
68 nsc 68 on april 7 1950 foreign policy experts in the truman administration completed a top secret report calling for an expansion of the american commitment to containing the soviet union.
they based that call as outlined in the selection below on their dim view of soviet character and on their understanding of international power relations in the previous four decades.
within the past thirty five years the world has experienced two global wars of tremendous violence.
it has witnessed two revolutions the russian and the chinese of extreme scope and intensity.
it has also seen the collapse of five empires the ottoman the austro hungarian german italian and japanese and the drastic decline of two major imperial systems the british and the french.
during the span of one generation the international distribution of power has been fundamentally altered.
for several centuries it had proved impossible for any one nation to gain such preponderant strength that a coalition of other nations could not in time face it with greater strength.
the international scene was marked by recurring periods of violence and war but a system of sovereign and independent states was maintained over which no state was able to achieve hegemony.
two complex sets of factors have now basically altered this historical distribution of power.
first the defeat of germany and japan and the decline of the british and french empires have interacted with the development of the united states and the soviet union in such a way that power has increasingly gravitated to these two centers.
second the soviet union unlike previous aspirants to hegemony is animated by a new fanatic faith antithetical to our own and seeks to impose its absolute authority over the rest of the world.
conflict has therefore become endemic and is waged on the part of the soviet union by violent or nonviolent methods in accordance with the dictates of expediency.
with the development of increasingly terrifying weapons of mass destruction every individual faces the ever present possibility of annihilation should the conflict enter the phase of total war.
our overall policy at the present time may be described as one designed to foster a world environment in which the american system can survive and flourish.
it therefore rejects the concept of isolation and affirms the necessity of our positive participation in the world community.
this broad intention embraces two subsidiary policies.
one is a policy which we would probably pursue even if there were no soviet threat.
it is a policy of attempting to develop a healthy international community.
the other is the policy of containing the soviet system.
these two policies are closely interrelated and interact on one another.
nevertheless the distinction between them is basically valid and contributes to a clearer understanding of what we are trying to do.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
what broader historical trends did the authors of this memorandum identify as precursors to global power relations after world war ii.
how did memorandum nsc 68 characterize the soviet union.
how did it characterize the goals of the united states.

664 the cold war 665 the gi bill expressed the progressive hopes of many americans who wanted to see the government do more to assist its citizens.
but it also expressed some of the enduring inequalities in american life.
few gi bill benefits were available to women even though many women had assisted the war effort in important ways.
and while the gi bill itself did not discriminate against african americans its provisions giving local governments jurisdiction allowed southern states in particular to deny or limit benefits to black veterans.
the flood of consumer demand contributed to more than two years of inflation during which prices rose at annual rates of 14 to 15 percent.
compounding the economic difficulties was a sharp rise in labor unrest.
by the end of 1945 major strikes had occurred in the automobile electrical and steel industries.
in april 1946 john l lewis led the united mine workers out on strike shutting down the coal fields for forty days.
truman finally forced coal production to resume by ordering government seizure of the mines.
inflation and strikes but in the process he pressured mine owners to grant the union most of its demands.
almost simultaneously the nations railroads suffered a total shutdown the first in the nations history as two major unions walked out on strike.
by threatening to use the army to run the trains truman pressured the strikers back to work after only a few days.
reconversion was particularly difficult for the millions of women and minorities who had entered the workforce during the war.
with veterans returning home employers tended to push women african americans hispanics and others out of the plants to make room for white males.
some war workers particularly women left the workforce voluntarily out of a desire to return to their former domestic lives.
but as many as 80 percent of women workers and virtually all black and hispanic males wanted to continue working.
the postwar inflation the pressure of a growing high consumption society the rising divorce rate which left many women responsible for their own economic wellbeing all combined to create a high demand for paid employment among women.
as women workers found themselves excluded from industrial jobs therefore they moved increasingly into other areas of the economy above all the service sector.
the fair deal rejected days after the japanese surrender truman submitted to congress a twenty one point domestic program outlining what he later named the fair deal it called for an expansion of social security benefits the raising of the legal minimum wage from 40 to 65 cents an hour a program to ensure full employment through aggressive use of federal spending and investment a permanent fair employment practices act public housing and slum clearance long range environmental and public works planning and government promotion of scientific research.
weeks later he added other proposals federal aid to education government health insurance and prepaid medical care funding for the st lawrence seaway and nationalization of atomic energy.
but most of trumans programs fell victim to the same public and congressional conservatism that had crippled the last years of the new deal.
indeed that conservatism seemed to be intensifying as the november 1946 congressional elections suggested.
using the simple but devastating slogan had enough the republican party won control of both houses of congress which quickly moved to reduce government spending and chip away at new deal reforms.
its most notable action was its assault on the wagner act of 1935 in the form of the labor management relations act of 1947 better known as the taft hartley act.
it made illegal the closed shop a workplace in which no one can be hired without first being a member of a union.
and although it continued to permit the creation of union shops in which workers must join a union after being hired it permitted states to pass right to work laws 666 chapter 27 prohibiting even that.
the taft hartley act also empowered the president to call for a ten week cooling off period before a strike by issuing an injunction against any work stoppage that endangered national safety or health.
outraged workers and union leaders denounced the measure as a slave labor bill truman vetoed it.
but both houses easily overruled him the same day.
the taft hartley act did not destroy the labor movement.
but it did damage weaker unions in relatively lightly organized industries such as chemicals and textiles and it made much more difficult the organizing of workers who had never been union members at all especially in the south and the west.
taft hartley act the election of 1948 truman and his advisers believed that the american public was not ready to abandon the achievements of the new deal despite the 1946 election results.
as they planned their strategy for the 1948 campaign therefore they hoped to appeal to enduring democratic loyalties.
throughout 1948 truman proposed one reform measure after another including on february 2 the first major civil rights bill of the century.
to no ones surprise congress ignored or defeated them all but the president was building campaign issues for the fall.
candidate party harry s truman democratic thomas e dewey republican strom thurmond states rights henry a wallace progressive other candidates prohibition socialist labor socialist socialist workers electoral vote popular vote 24 105 695 49 5 21 969 170 45 1 1 169 021 2 4 1 156 103 2 4 272 713 53 of electorate voting the election of 1948 despite the widespread expectation that the republican candidate thomas dewey would easily defeat truman in 1948 the president in fact won a substantial reelection victory that year.
this map shows the broad geographic reach of trumans victory.
dewey swept most of the northeast but truman dominated almost everywhere else.
strom thurmond the states rights candidate carried four states in the south.
what had prompted thurmond to desert the democratic party and run for president on his own.
the cold war 667 there remained however the problems of trumans personal unpopularity the assumption among much of the electorate that he lacked stature and that his administration was weak and inept and the deep divisions within the democratic party.
at the democratic national convention that summer two factions abandoned the party a ltogether.
angered by trumans proposed civil rights bill and by the approval at the convention of a civil rights plank in the platform engineered by hubert humphrey the reform mayor of minneapolis some southern conservatives walked out and formed the states rights democratic or dixiecrat party with governor strom thurmond divided democratic party of south carolina as its nominee.
at the same time some members of the partys left wing contemptuous of what they considered trumans ineffectual leadership and his excessively confrontational stance toward the soviet union joined the new progressive party whose candidate was henry a wallace.
many democratic liberals who were unhappy with truman were unwilling to leave the party.
the americans for democratic action ada a coalition of anticommunist liberals tried to entice dwight d eisenhower the popular war hero to contest the nomination.
only after eisenhower refused did liberals concede the nomination to truman.
the republicans in the meantime once again nominated governor thomas e dewey of new york.
austere dignified and competent he seemed to offer an unbeatable alternative to the president.
only truman seemed to believe he could win.
as the campaign gathered momentum he became more and more aggressive turning the fire away from himself and toward dewey and the do nothing good for nothing republican congress which was he told voters responsible for fueling inflation and abandoning workers and common people.
to dramatize his point he called congress into special session in july to give it a chance he said to enact the liberal measures the republicans had recently written into their platform.
congress met for two weeks and predictably managed to pass almost nothing.
on election night to the surprise of almost everyone truman won a narrow but decisive and dramatic victory 49 5 percent of the popular vote to deweys truman defeats dewey 45 1 percent with the two splinter parties dividing the small remainder evenly between them and an electoral margin of 303 to 189.
democrats regained both houses of congress by substantial margins.
the fair deal revived despite the democratic victories the eighty first congress was little more hospitable to trumans fair deal reform.
truman did win some important victories.
congress raised the legal minimum wage from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour.
it approved an important expansion of the social security system increasing benefits by 75 percent and extending them to 10 million additional people.
and it passed the national housing act of 1949 which provided for the construction of 810 000 units of low income housing accompanied by long term rent subsidies.
but on other issues national health insurance and aid to education among them truman made little progress.
nor was he able to persuade congress to accept the civil rights legislation he proposed in 1949 legislation that would make lynching a federal crime provide federal protection of black voting rights abolish the poll tax and establish a new fair employment practices commission to curb discrimination in hiring.
southern democrats filibustered to kill the bill.
undeterred truman proceeded on his own to battle several forms of racial discrimination.
he ordered an end to discrimination in the hiring of government employees.
he 668 chapter 27 began to dismantle segregation within the armed forces.
and he allowed the justice department to become actively involved in court battles against discriminatory statutes.
the supreme court in the meantime signaled its own growing awareness of the issue by ruling in shelley v kraemer 1948 that courts could not be used to enforce private covenants meant to bar blacks from residential neighborhoods.
the nuclear age looming over the many struggles of the postwar years was the image of the great and terrible mushroom clouds that had risen over alamogordo in july 1945 and over the ruined japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki.
americans greeted these terrible new instruments of destruction with fear and awe but also with expectation.
postwar culture was torn between a dark image of the nuclear war that many americans feared would result from the rivalry with the soviet union and the bright image of a dazzling technological future that atomic power might help to produce.
the fear of nuclear weapons appeared widely in popular culture but it was often dismenace in films guised.
the late 1940s and early 1950s were the heyday of film noir a kind of filmmaking that originated in france and had been named for the dark lighting characteristic of the genre.
american film noir portrayed the loneliness of individuals in an impersonal world a staple of american culture for many decades but also suggested the menacing character of the age the looming possibility of vast destruction.
sometimes this 1949 movie poster suggests how much attention was directed to the threat of communism.
the film told the story of a man and a woman who joined the communist party only to become disillusioned when they watched the murder of a party member who had begun to doubt the partys principles.
republic pictures photofest the red menace the cold war 669 popular fears addressed nuclear fear explicitly for example the celebrated television show of the 1950s and early 1960s the twilight zone which featured dramatic portrayals of the aftermath of nuclear war or postwar comic books which depicted powerful superheroes saving the world from destruction.
such images resonated with the public because awareness of nuclear weapons was increasingly built into their daily lives.
schools and office buildings held regular air raid drills to prepare people for the possibility of nuclear attack.
radio stations regularly tested the emergency broadcast system which stood in readiness for war.
fallout shelters stocked with water and canned goods sprang up in public buildings and private homes.
though few americans went about their daily lives in a state of panic anxiety simmered below the surface.
and yet the united states was also an exuberant nation in these years dazzled by its own prosperity and excited by the technological innovations transforming the nation including nuclear power.
the same scientific knowledge that could destroy the world many believed might also lead it into a glimmering future.
the new york times only days after hiroshima expressed its own rosy view of the nuclear future this new knowledge.
can bring to this earth not death but life not tyranny and cruelty but a divine freedom that kind of optimism soon became widespread.
the secret of the atom many americans predicted would bring prosperity and a more complete life a public opinion poll late in 1948 revealed that approximately two thirds of those questioned believed that in the long run atomic energy would do more good than harm nuclear power nuclear power plants began to spring up in many areas of the country and were welcomed as the source of cheap and unlimited electricity their potential dangers scarcely even discussed by those who celebrated their creation.
the korean war though the cold war started in europe it quickly spread to asia.
on june 24 1950 the armies of communist north korea swept across their southern border and invaded the pro western half of the korean peninsula.
within days they had occupied much of south korea including seoul its capital.
true to the dictates of containment the united states almost immediately committed itself to the conflict.
the divided peninsula when world war ii ended both the united states and the soviet union had troops in korea fighting the japanese neither army was willing to leave.
instead they divided the nation supposedly temporarily along the 38th parallel.
the russians finally departed in 1949 leaving behind a communist government in the north with a strong soviet equipped army.
the americans left a few months later handing control to the pro western government of syngman rhee.
anticommunist but only nominally syngman rhee democratic he used his relatively small military primarily to suppress internal opposition.
the relative weakness of south korea offered a strong temptation to nationalists in the north korean government who wanted to reunite the country particularly after the american government implied that it did not consider korea within its own defense perimeter the soviets and chinese did not order the invasion but they did not try to stop it.
they supported the offensive once it began.
670 chapter 27 almost immediately on june 27 1950 the president ordered limited american military assistance to south korea and on the same day he appealed to the united nations to intervene.
the soviet union was boycotting the security council at the time to protest the councils refusal to recognize the new communist government of china and was thus unable to exercise its veto power.
as a result american delegates were able to win un agreement to a resolution calling for international assistance to the rhee government.
on june 30 the united states ordered its own ground forces into korea and truman appointed general douglas macarthur to command the un operations there.
several other nations provided assistance and troops but the un armies were in fact overwhelmingly american.
after a surprise american invasion at inchon in september had routed the north korean forces from the south and sent them back across the 38th parallel truman gave north korean forces june 25 1950 sept.

the map at the left shows the extent of the north korean invasion of south korea in 1950 communist forces for a time controlled all of korea except a small area around pusan in the southeast.
on september 15 1950 un troops under douglas macarthur landed in force at inchon and soon drove the north koreans back across the border.
macarthur then pursued the north koreans well into their own territory.
the map at right shows the very different circumstances once the chinese entered the war in november 1950.
chinese forces drove the un army back below the 38th parallel and briefly deep into south korea below seoul.
the un troops fought back to the prewar border between north and south korea late in 1951 but the war then bogged down into a stalemate that continued for a year and a half.
what impact did the korean war have on american politics in the early 1950s.
the korean war 1950 1953 the cold war 671 macarthur permission to pursue the communists into their own territory.
hoping now to create a unified independent and democratic korea the president had moved beyond simple containment to an attempted rollback of communist power.
from invasion to stalemate for several weeks macarthurs invasion of north korea proceeded smoothly.
on october 19 the capital pyongyang fell to the un forces.
victory seemed near until the chinese government alarmed by the movement of american forces toward its china intervenes border intervened.
in early november eight divisions of the chinese army entered the war.
the un offensive stalled and then collapsed.
through december 1950 outnumbered american forces were forced into a rapid bitter retreat in numbingly cold temperatures.
within weeks communist forces had pushed the americans back below the 38th parallel once again and had recaptured the south korean capital of seoul.
by mid january 1951 the rout had ceased and by march the un armies had managed to regain much of the territory they had recently lost taking back seoul and pushing the communists north of the 38th parallel for the second time.
with that the war turned into a protracted stalemate.
from the start truman had been determined to avoid a direct conflict with china which he feared might lead to a new world war.
once china truman macarthur controversy entered the war he began seeking a negotiated solution to the struggle.
but general macarthur had ideas of his own.
the united states was really fighting the chinese macarthur argued.
it should therefore attack china itself if not through an actual invasion then at least by bombing communist forces massing north of the chinese border with conventional or even atomic weapons.
in march 1951 he indicated his unhappiness with trumans reluctance to invade china.
in a public letter to house republican leader joseph w martin he concluded there is no substitute for victory his position had wide popular support.
yet the release of the martin letter struck the president as intolerable insubordination.
on april 11 1951 he relieved macarthur of his command.
sixty nine percent of the american people supported macarthur a gallup poll reported.
when the general returned to the united states later in 1951 he was greeted with wild enthusiasm.
public criticism of truman finally abated somewhat when a number of prominent military figures including general omar bradley publicly supported the presidents decision.
but substantial hostility toward truman remained.
in the meantime the korean stalemate continued.
negotiations between the opposing forces began at panmunjom in july 1951 but the talks and the war dragged on until 1953.
limited mobilization the war in korea produced only a limited american military commitment abroad.
it also created only a limited economic mobilization at home.
truman set up the office of defense mobilization to fight inflation by holding down prices and discouraging high union wage demands.
when these cautious regulatory efforts failed the president took more drastic action.
railroad workers walked off the job in 1951 and truman who considered the workers demands inflationary ordered the government to seize control of the railroads.
in 1952 during a nationwide steel strike truman seized the steel mills citing his powers as commander in chief.
but in a 6 to 3 decision the supreme court ruled that the president had exceeded his authority and truman was forced to relent.
672 chapter 27 the korean war significantly boosted economic growth by pumping new government funds into the economy at a point when many believed it was about to decline.
but the war had other less welcome effects.
it came at a time of rising insecurity about americas position in the world and intensified anxiety about communism.
as the long stalemate continued producing 140 000 american dead and wounded frustration turned to anger.
the united states which had recently won the greatest war in history seemed unable to conclude what many americans considered a minor border skirmish in a small country.
they began to believe that something must be deeply wrong not only in korea but within the united states as well.
such fears contributed to the rise of the second major campaign of the century against domestic communism.
the crusade against subversion why did the american people develop a growing fear of internal communist subversion a fear that by the early 1950s occasionally reached the point of hysteria.
there are many possible answers but no single definitive explanation.
see debating the past mccarthyism one factor was obvious communism was not an imagined enemy.
it had tangible shape in josef stalin and the soviet union.
adding to the concern were the korean stalemate the loss of china and the soviet development of an atomic bomb.
searching for someone to blame many began to believe that there was a communist conspiracy within american borders.
but there were other factors as well rooted in events in american domestic politics.
huac and alger hiss much of the anticommunist furor emerged out of the search by republicans for an issue with which to attack the democrats and out of the efforts of the democrats to take that issue away from them.
beginning in 1947 the house un american activities committee huac held widely publicized investigations to prove that under democratic rule the government had tolerated if not actually encouraged communist subversion.
the committee turned first to the movie industry arguing that communists had infiltrated hollywood and tainted american films with propaganda.
writers and producers some of them former communists were called to testify and when some of them the hollywood ten refused to answer questions about their political beliefs and those of their colleagues they were sent to jail for contempt.
others were barred from employment in the industry when hollywood attempting to protect its public image adopted a blacklist of those of suspicious loyalty more alarming to the public was huacs investigation into charges of disloyalty alger hiss leveled against alger hiss a former high ranking member of the state department.
in 1948 whittaker chambers a former communist agent now a conservative editor at time magazine told the committee that hiss had passed classified state department documents to him in 1937 and 1938.
when hiss sued him for slander chambers produced microfilms of the documents called the pumpkin papers because chambers had kept them hidden in a pumpkin in his vegetable garden.
hiss could not be tried for espionage because of the statute of limitations which protects individuals from prosecution for most crimes after seven years have passed.
but largely because of the cold war 673 the relentless efforts of richard m nixon a first term congressman from california and a member of huac hiss was convicted of perjury and served several years in prison.
the hiss case not only discredited a prominent young diplomat it also cast suspicion on a generation of liberal democrats.
it also transformed nixon into a national figure and helped him win a senate seat in 1950.
the federal loyalty program and the rosenberg case partly to protect itself against republican attacks and partly to encourage support for the presidents foreign policy initiatives the truman administration in 1947 initiated a widely publicized program to review the loyalty of federal employees.
by 1951 more than 2 000 government employees had resigned under pressure and 212 had been dismissed.
the federal employee loyalty program helped launch a major assault on subversion throughout the government and beyond.
the attorney general established a widely cited list of supposedly subversive organizations.
the director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi j edgar hoover investigated and harassed alleged radicals.
in 1950 congress passed the mccarran internal security act which among other restrictions on subversive activity required that all communist organizations register with the government and publish their records.
congress easily overrode trumans veto of the bill.
the successful soviet detonation of an atomic bomb in 1949 suggested to some that there had been a conspiracy to pass american atomic secrets to the russians.
in 1950 klaus fuchs a young british scientist seemed to confirm those fears when he testified that he had delivered to the russians details of the bombs manufacture.
the case ultimately moved to an obscure new york couple julius julius and ethel rosenberg and ethel rosenberg members of the communist party.
the government claimed the rosenbergs had received secret information from ethels brother a machinist on the manhattan project in new mexico and had passed it on to the soviet union through other agents including fuchs.
the rosenbergs were convicted and on april 5 1951 sentenced to death.
after two years of appeals and public protests they died in the electric chair on june 19 1953.
historians now believe that julius but not ethel was guilty as charged.
all these factors the huac investigations the hiss trial the loyalty investigations the mccarran act the rosenberg case combined with other concerns by the early 1950s to create a fear of communist subversion that seemed to grip the entire country.
state and local governments the judiciary schools and universities labor unions all sought to purge themselves of real or imagined subversives.
it was a climate that made possible the rise of an extraordinary public figure.
mccarthyism joseph mccarthy was an undistinguished first term republican senator from wisconsin until in february 1950 in the midst of a speech in wheeling west virginia he lifted up a sheet of paper and claimed to hold in my hand a list of 205 known communists currently working in the american state department.
no person of comparable stature had ever made so bold a charge against the federal government.
in the months to come as mccarthy repeated and expanded on his accusations he emerged as the nations most prominent leader of the crusade against domestic subversion.
debating the past mccarthyism the american civil liberties union warned in the early 1950s at the peak of what is now known as mccarthyism that the threat to civil liberties today is the most serious in the history of our country it was expressing a view with which many americans wholeheartedly agreed.
but while there were unusually powerful challenges to freedom of speech and association in the late 1940s and early 1950s there is wide disagreement about the causes and meaning of those challenges.
the simplest argument and one that continues to attract scholarly support is that the postwar red scare expressed real and legitimate concerns about communist subversion in the united states.
william oneill in a better world 1982 and richard gid powers in not without honor 1995 have both argued that anticommunism was a serious intelligent and patriotic movement despite its excesses.
the american communist party according to this view was an agent of stalin and the soviet union within the united states actively engaged in espionage and subversion.
the effort to root communists out of public life was both understandable and justifiable and the hysteria it sometimes produced was an unhappy but predictable by product of an essentially rational and justifiable effort.
anticommunism powers wrote expressed the essential american determination to stand against attacks on human freedom and foster the growth of democracy throughout the world.
to superimpose on this rich history the cartoon features of joe mccarthy is to reject history for the easy comforts of moralism 674 most interpretations however have been less charitable.
in the 1950s in the midst of the red scare itself an influential group of historians and social scientists began to portray the anticommunist fervor of their time as an expression of deep social maladjustment an argument perhaps most closely associated with a famous essay by richard hofstadter the paranoid style in american politics there was they argued no logical connection between the modest power of actual communists in the united states and the hysterical form these scholars believed anticommunism was assuming.
the explanation therefore had to lie in something other than reality in a deeper set of social and cultural anxieties that had only an indirect connection with the political world as it existed.
extreme anticommunism they claimed was something close to a pathology it expressed fear of and alienation from the modern world.
a person afflicted with the paranoid style hofstadter wrote believes himself to be living in a world in which he is spied upon plotted against betrayed and very likely destined for total ruin.
he feels that his liberties have been arbitrarily and outrageously invaded.
he is opposed to almost everything that has happened in american politics in the past twenty years.
other scholars writing not long after the decline of mccarthyism rejected the sociocultural arguments of hofstadter and others but shared the belief that the crusade against subversion was a distortion of normal public life.
they saw the anticommunist crusade as an example of party politics run amok.
richard freeland in rare book and special collection division the library of congress the truman doctrine and the origins of mccarthyism 1971 argued that the democrats began the effort to purge the government of radicals to protect themselves from attacks by the republicans.
nelson polsby robert griffith and others have noted how republicans seized on the issue of communism in government in the late 1940s to reverse their nearly twentyyear exclusion from power.
with each party trying to outdo the other in its effort to demonstrate its anticommunist credentials it was hardly surprising that the crusade reached extraordinarily intense proportions.
still other historians have emphasized the role of powerful government officials and agencies with a strong commitment to anticommunism most notably j edgar hoover and the fbi.
athan theoharis and kenneth oreilly introduced the idea of an anticommunist bureaucracy in work published in the 1970s and 1980s.
ellen schreckers many are the crimes 1998 likewise identified an interlocking cluster of official agencies committed to anticommunism and operating across many years not just those dominated by mccarthy.
yet those agencies and individuals she argued whatever the sincerity of their anticommunist fervor oversaw a period of repression that recklessly destroyed careers and lives shattered the left chilled dissent and narrowed the terms of political debate.
several scholars finally have presented an argument that does not so much challenge other interpretations as complement them.
anticommunist zealots were not alone to blame for the excesses of mccarthyism they argue.
it was also the fault of liberals in politics in academia and perhaps above all in the media who were so intimidated by the political climate or so imprisoned within the conventions of their professions that they found themselves unable to respond effectively to the distortions and excesses that they recognized around them.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
why did the american public feel so threatened by communism.
who exploited the publics fears and why.
was the public reaction to the red scare a logical response or disproportionate to the actual threat posed by communism.
how were party politics and mccarthyism connected.
do you find elements similar to mccarthyism in politics today.
within weeks of his charges against the state department mccarthy leveled accusations at other agencies.
after 1952 with the republicans in control of the senate and mccarthy now the chair of a special subcommittee he conducted highly publicized investigations of alleged subversion in many areas of the government.
mccarthy never produced conclusive evidence that any federal employee was a communist.
but a growing constituency adored him 675 676 chapter 27 nevertheless for his coarse fearless assaults on a government establishment that many considered arrogant effete even traitorous.
republicans in particular rallied to his claims that the democrats had been responsible for twenty years of treason and that only a change of parties could rid the country of subversion.
mccarthy in short provided his followers with an issue into which they could channel a wide range of resentments fear of communism animosity toward the countrys eastern establishment and frustrated partisan ambitions.
for a time mccarthy intimidated all but a few people from opposing him.
even the highly popular dwight d eisenhower running for president in 1952 did not speak out against him although he disliked mccarthys tactics and was outraged at among other things mccarthys attacks on general george marshall.
eventually his assaults against such respected figures and institutions drove mccarthy from popular favor but not before mccarthyism came to define an era of hysterical and often unfounded accusations.
the republican revival public frustration over the stalemate in korea and popular fears of internal subversion combined to make 1952 a bad year for the democratic party.
truman now deeply unpopular withdrew from the presidential contest.
the party united instead behind governor adlai e stevenson of illinois.
stevensons dignity wit and eloquence made him a beloved figure to many liberals and intellectuals.
but those same qualities seemed only to fuel republican charges that stevenson lacked the strength or the will to combat communism sufficiently.
stevensons greatest problem however was the republican candidate opposing him.
rejecting the efforts of conservatives to nominate robert taft or douglas macarthur the republicans turned to a man who had no previous identification with the party general dwight d eisenhower military hero commander of nato president of columbia university who won nomination on the first ballot.
he chose as his running mate the young california senator who had gained national prominence through his crusade against alger hiss richard m nixon.
in the fall campaign eisenhower attracted support through his geniality and his statesmanlike pledges to settle the korean conflict.
nixon after surviving early accusations of financial improprieties which he effectively neutralized in a famous television address the checkers speech exploited the issue of domestic anticommunism by attacking the democrats for cowardice and appeasement the response at the polls was overwhelmeisenhower elected ing.
eisenhower won both a popular and an electoral landslide 55 p ercent of the popular vote to stevensons 44 percent 442 electoral votes to stevensons 89.
republicans gained control of both houses of congress for the first time since 1946.
conclusion even during world war ii when the united states and the soviet union were allies it was evident to leaders in both nations that america and russia had quite different visions of what the postwar world should look like.
very quickly after the war ended the once fruitful relationship between the worlds greatest powers quickly soured.
americans came to believe that the soviet union like hitlers germany harbored dangerous expansionist ambitions.
soviets came to believe that the united states was trying to protect its own dominance in the world by encircling the soviet union.
the result of these tensions was what became known by the end of the 1940s as the cold war.
the cold war 677 in the early years of the cold war the united states constructed a series of policies designed to prevent both war and soviet aggression.
it helped rebuild the shattered economies of western europe through the marshall plan to stabilize those nations and prevent them from becoming communist.
america embraced a new foreign policy known as containment that committed it to keeping the soviet union from expanding its influence further into the world.
the united states and western europe formed a strong and enduring alliance nato to defend europe against possible soviet advances.
in 1950 the armed forces of communist north korea launched an invasion of noncommunist south korea and to most americans the conflict quickly came to be seen as a test of american resolve.
the korean war was long costly and unpopular with many military setbacks and frustrations.
in the end however the united states working through the united nations managed to drive the north koreans out of south korea and stabilize the original division of the peninsula.
the korean war hardened american foreign policy into a much more rigidly anticommunist form.
it undermined the truman administration and the democratic party and helped strengthen conservatives and republicans.
it greatly bolstered an already powerful crusade against communists and those believed to be communists within the united states a crusade often known as mccarthyism because of the notoriety of senator joseph mccarthy of wisconsin the most celebrated leader of the effort.
america after world war ii was indisputably the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world.
but in the harsh climate of the cold war neither wealth nor power could dispel deep anxieties and bitter divisions.

if america experienced a golden age in the 1950s and early 1960s as many americans believed at the time and many continue to believe today it was largely a result of two developments.
one was a booming national prosperity which profoundly altered the social economic and even physical landscape of the united states.
the other was the continuing struggle against communism a struggle that created considerable anxiety but that also encouraged many americans to look even more approvingly at their own society.
but if these powerful forces created a widespread sense of national purpose and selfsatisfaction they also helped blind many americans to serious problems developing at home.
678 the economic miracle perhaps the most striking feature of american society in the 1950s and early 1960s was the booming economic growth that made even the heady 1920s seem pale by comparison.
it was a better balanced and more widely distributed prosperity than that of thirty years earlier.
it was not however as universal as some americans liked to believe.
economic growth by 1949 despite the continuing problems of postwar reconversion an economic expansion had begun that would continue with only brief interruptions for almost twenty years.
between 1945 and 1960 the gross national product grew by 250 percent from 200 billion to over 500 billion.
unemployment remained at about 5 percent or lower throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.
inflation in the meantime hovered around 3 percent a year or less.
the causes of this growth were varied.
part of the growth came from americans throwing off the emotional shackles of the great depression.
buoyed by victory in the world war americans again began to believe in a brighter future and they invested in it.
government spending which had reached new levels from fighting a world war and the great depression continued to stimulate growth through public funding of schools housing veterans benefits welfare interstate highways and above all the military.
economic growth peaked during the first half of the 1950s when military spending was highest because of the korean war.
additionally trade agreements after the war began to open markets for goods and services like no other time in its history.
virtually untouched by the destruction of war u s manufacturing and services reaped the initial rewards of international trade.

568 chapter 23 supply shrank by perhaps a third or more between 1930 and 1933 which caused a decline in purchasing power and thus deflation.
manufacturers and merchants began reducing prices cutting back on production and laying off workers.
some economists argue that a severe depression could have been avoided if the federal reserve system had acted responsibly.
but late in 1931 in a misguided effort to build international confidence in the dollar it raised interest rates which contracted the money supply even further.
the american gross national product plummeted from over 104 billion in 1929 to 76 4 billion in 1932 a 25 percent decline in three years.
by 1932 according to the relatively crude estimates of the time 25 percent of the american workforce was unemployed.
some argue that the figure was even higher.
for the rest of the decade unemployment averaged nearly 20 percent never dropping below 15 percent.
up to another one third of the workforce was underemployed experiencing major reductions in wages hours or both.
the american people in hard times someone asked the british economist john maynard keynes in the 1930s whether he was aware of any historical era comparable to the great depression.
yes keynes replied.
it was called the dark ages and it lasted 400 years the depression did not last 400 years.
it did however bring unprecedented economic despair to the united states and much of the western world.
the hungry hundreds of men wait to be fed outside the municipal lodging house in new york city.
bettmann corbis the great depression 569 unemployment and relief in the industrial northeast and midwest cities were virtually paralyzed by unemployment.
cleveland ohio for example had an unemployment rate of 50 percent in 1932 akron 60 percent toledo 80 percent.
unemployed workers walked through the streets day after day looking for jobs that did not exist.
an increasing number of families turned to state and local public relief systems just to be able to eat.
but those systems which in the 1920s had served only a small number of indigents were totally unequipped to handle the heavy new demands.
in many cities therefore relief simply collapsed.
private charities attempted to supplement the public relief efforts but the problem was far beyond their capabilities as well.
in rural areas conditions were in many ways worse.
farm income declined by 60 percent between 1929 and 1932.
a third of all american farmers lost their land.
in addition a large area of agricultural settlement in the great plains suffered from a catastrophic natural disaster one of the worst droughts in the history of the nation.
beginning in 1930 the region that came to be known as the dust bowl which stretched north from texas into the dakotas experienced a steady decline dust bowl in rainfall and an accompanying increase in heat.
the drought continued for a decade turning what had once been fertile farm regions into virtual deserts.
severe winds blew dust across the eastern united states.
many farmers like many urban unemployed left their homes in search of work.
in the south in particular many dispossessed farmers black and white simply wandered from town to town hoping to find jobs or handouts.
hundreds of thousands of families from the dust bowl often known collectively as okies though not all came from okies oklahoma traveled to california and other states where they found conditions little better than those they had left.
many worked as agricultural migrants traveling from farm to farm picking fruit and other crops at starvation wages.
dust storm southwest plains 1937 the dust storms of the 1930s were a terrifying experience for all who lived through them.
resembling a black wall sweeping in from the western horizon such a storm engulfed farms and towns alike blotting out the light of the sun and covering everything with a fine dirt.
bettmann corbis 570 chapter 23 african americans and the depression most african americans had not shared very much in the prosperity of the previous decade.
but they did share in the hardships of the great depression.
as the depression began over half of all black americans still lived in the south.
most were farmers.
the collapse of prices for cotton and other staple crops left some with no income at all.
many left the land altogether either by choice or because they had been evicted by landlords who no longer found sharecropping profitable.
some migrated to southern cities.
but there unemployed whites believed they had first claim to what work there was and some now began to take positions as janitors street cleaners and domestic servants displacing the african americans who formerly occupied those jobs.
by 1932 over half the blacks in the south were unemployed.
unsurprisingly therefore many black southerners perhaps 400 000 in all left the south in the 1930s and journeyed to the cities of the north.
but conditions there were little better.
in new york black unemployment was nearly 50 percent.
in other cities it was higher.
two million african americans half the total black population of the country were on some form of relief by 1932.
traditional patterns of segregation and disenfranchisement in the south survived the depression largely unchallenged.
but a few particularly notorious examples of racism did attract the attention of the nation.
the most celebrated was the scottsboro case.
in scottsboro case march 1931 nine black teenagers were taken off a freight train in northern alabama in a small town near scottsboro and were arrested for vagrancy and disorder.
later two white women who had also been riding the train accused them of rape.
in fact there was overwhelming evidence medical and otherwise that the women had not been raped at all they may have made their accusations out of fear of being arrested themselves.
nevertheless an all white jury in alabama quickly convicted all nine of the scottsboro boys as they were known to both friends and foes and sentenced eight of them to death.
the supreme court overturned the convictions in 1932 and a series of new trials began.
the international labor defense an organization associated with the communist party came to the aid of the accused youths and began to publicize the case.
although the white southern juries who sat on the case never acquitted any of the defendants all of the accused eventually gained their freedom although the last of the scottsboro defendants did not leave prison until 1950.
hispanics and asians in depression america similar patterns of discrimination confronted many mexicans and mexican americans.
the hispanic population of the united states had been growing steadily since early in the century largely in california and other areas of the southwest.
chicanos mexican americans filled many of the same menial jobs there that blacks had traditionally filled in other regions.
some farmed small marginal tracts others became agricultural migrants.
it had always been a precarious existence and the depression made things significantly worse.
unemployed whites in the southwest demanded jobs held by hispanics jobs that whites had previously considered beneath them.
thus mexican unemployment rose quickly to levels far higher than those for whites.
some officials arbitrarily removed mexicans from relief rolls or simply rounded up and deported them.
perhaps half a million chicanos left the united states for mexico in the first years of the depression.
hispanic workers targeted the great depression 571 there were occasional signs of organized resistance by mexican americans themselves most notably in california where some formed a union of migrant farmworkers.
but harsh repression by local growers and the public authorities allied with them prevented such organizations from having much impact.
as a result many hispanics began to migrate to cities such as los angeles where they lived in poverty comparable to that of urban blacks in the south and northeast.
for asian americans too the depression reinforced long standing patterns of discrimination and economic marginalization.
in california where the plight of asian americans largest japanese american and chinese american populations were educated asians had always found it difficult if not impossible to move into mainstream professions.
japanese american college graduates often found themselves working in family fruit stands.
for those who found jobs in the industrial or service economy employment was precarious like blacks and hispanics asians often lost jobs to white americans desperate for work.
japanese farmworkers like chicano farmworkers suffered from the increasing competition for even these low paying jobs with white migrants from the great plains.
a chinese man carries a signboard through the streets of new york citys chinatown bearing the latest news of the war between china and japan which in 1938 was well under way.
chinese americans had the duel challenge in the 1930s of dealing both with large scale unemployment and with continuing news of catastrophe from china where most still had family members.

yes i really went through the depression.
there were thousands who went down during the panic lost fortunes homes business and in fact everything.
some have survived and many never will.
a great many were too old to begin building up again.
in the kind of work im in i have been in position to know some of the devastating e ffects of it and it certainly gets on your sympathy.
i guess you would say i am recovering from it.
when i say that though im not boasting but im deeply grateful for the good fortunes that have came my way.
then too i feel under everlasting obligations to some of my friends who have helped me to get where i am.
i had not accumulated a great deal at the time of the panic but i did have some savings and a good job.
that was the trouble my savings and my job went at the same time.
now that was real trouble.
nobody but my wife and i knew just what we did go through.
i was making a fine salary had a growing savings account and a host of friends and no serious troubles to worry about.
my wife is just the smartest thriftiest person you have ever seen.
to her i owe a lot of my successes.
she is fine with her needle and crocheting and you never saw her idle.
she made all her spending money that way.
even now since we have been in washington she keeps it up.
and her fruit cake.
people here rave about it.
she cooks an enormous amount of it every christmas and sells it for 572 a big profit.
she cant fill all the orders she gets.
she is very resourceful and right now if i were to die and not leave her a thing she would manage some way.
one of my hobbies was gardening and it proved to be a profitable one too.
this place we rented had a fine garden spot the finest in dublin so every one said.
i worked in it early every morning and in the afternoon after banking hours.
i sold lots of vegetables and realized a lot on them especially the early variety that brought a good price.
one morning we three were at the breakfast table when the phone rang.
it was one of the fellows who worked at the bank.
tarver he said have you heard the news what news.
no i havent heard any news said i whats it all about well he said hurry on down and see if you will excuse the expression when he said that the seat of my britches almost dropped out.
i felt like it meant trouble of some kind.
i had had a terrible feeling of uneasiness over the bank for some time.
banks had been closing all over the country.
there had been a run on our bank some time previous to that but we tided that over and since then it had seemed stronger than ever.
i hurried down and sure enough in front of the bank there stood a crowd of employees as blank expressions on their faces as ive ever seen.
they were too dumbfounded to be excited even.
the bank was closed and a notice to that effect on the door.
we stood there just looking at each other until finally one said well boys guess we had better go on the inside and see if we can find out what its all about.
i guess there goes our jobs.
just as i was getting in the dumps about a regular job i was notified to report at once to act as assistant receiver for a defunct bank in florida.
they were feeling the depression there even more than we were in georgia and banks were closing every day.
banks were still closing until it was hard to get enough receivers for them.
oh we did work.
banks in neighboring towns were added to our work until we were liquidating six banks at one time all in different places.
i had to have another car then but was lucky to pick up a good used car almost at my own price.
people had lost their cars as well as their homes so it was no trouble to buy a good used one.
sometimes i would ride to all six of these banks in one day and when night came i would be completely given out.
i couldnt stop even then for there was scarcely a night that we didnt work understand analyze evaluate 1.

chinese americans fared no better.
the overwhelming majority worked as they had for many years in chinese owned laundries and restaurants.
those who moved outside the asian community could rarely find jobs above the entry level.
chinese women for example might find work as stock girls in department stores but almost never as salesclerks.
educated chinese men and women could hope for virtually no professional opportunities outside the world of the chinatowns.
women and families in the great depression the economic crisis strengthened the widespread belief that a womans proper place was in the home.
many men and women believed that with employment so scarce what work there was should go to men and that no woman whose husband was employed should accept a job.
indeed from 1932 until 1937 it was illegal for more than one member of a family to hold a federal civil service job.
but the widespread assumption that married women at least should not work outside the home did not stop them from doing so.
both single and married women worked in the 1930s because they or their families needed the money.
some women did small jobs at home or sold food or goods to make ends meet.
see consider the source mr tarver remembers the great depression by the end of the depression 25 percent more women were working for wages than had been doing so at the beginning despite considerable obstacles.
professional opportunities for women declined because unemployed men began moving into professions that had previously been considered womens fields.
female industrial workers were more likely to be laid off or to female wage earners experience wage reductions than their male counterparts.
but white women also had certain advantages in the workplace.
the nonprofessional jobs that women traditionally held salesclerks stenographers and other service positions were less likely to disappear than the predominantly male jobs in heavy industry.
573 574 chapter 23 black women suffered massive unemployment particularly in the south because of a great reduction of domestic service jobs.
as many as half of all black working women lost their jobs in the 1930s.
even so at the end of the 1930s 38 percent of black women were employed as compared with 24 percent of white women.
that was so because black women both married and unmarried had always been more likely to work than white women less out of preference than out of economic necessity.
the depression also worked to erode the strength of many family units.
there was a declining marriage rate and birthrate decline in the divorce rate but largely because divorce was now too expensive for some.
more common was the informal breakup of families particularly the desertion of families by unemployed men trying to escape the humiliation of being unable to earn a living.
the marriage rate and the birthrate both declined for the first time since the early nineteenth century.
the depression and american culture the great depression was a traumatic experience for millions of americans.
out of the crisis emerged probing criticisms of american life.
but the depression also produced powerful confirmations of more traditional values and reinforced many traditional goals.
there was not one depression culture but many.
depression values prosperity and industrial growth had done much to shape american values in the 1920s.
yet even when hard times came american social values seemed to change relatively little in response to the depression.
instead many people responded to hard times by redoubling their commitment to familiar ideas and goals.
the depression did not destroy the success ethic.
the survival of the ideals of work and individual responsibility was evident in many ways not least in the reactions of those most traumatized by the depression people who suddenly found themselves without employment.
some expressed anger and struck out at the economic system.
many however seemed to blame themselves.
at the same time millions responded eagerly to reassurances that they could through their own efforts dale carnegie restore themselves to prosperity and success.
dale carnegies how to win friends and influence people 1936 a self help manual preaching individual initiative was one of the best selling books of the decade.
yet the most popular cultural products of the 1930s diverted attention away from the depression.
and they came to americans primarily through the two most powerful instruments of popular culture in the 1930s radio and the movies.
for another powerful vehicle of escapist culture see patterns of popular culture the golden age of comic books radio almost every american family had a radio in the 1930s.
in cities and towns radio consoles were as familiar a part of the furnishing of homes as tables and chairs.
even in remote rural areas without access to electricity many families purchased radios and hooked them up to car batteries when they wished to listen.
radio was often a community experience.
young people would place radios on their front porches and invite friends by to sit talk or dance.
in poor urban neighborhoods the great depression 575 people would gather on a street or in a backyard to listen to sporting events or concerts.
within families the radio often drew parents and children together to listen to favorite programs.
although radio stations occasionally carried provocative programs the staple of broadcasting was escapism including comedies such as amos n escapist programming andy with its demeaning picture of urban blacks and adventures such as superman dick tracy and the lone ranger.
radio brought a new kind of comedy to a wide audience.
jack benny george burns and gracie allen and other masters of elaborately timed repartee began to develop broad followings.
enormously popular especially among women who were alone in the house during the day were soap operas so named because they were generally sponsored by soap companies whose advertising was targeted at women.
radio provided americans with their first direct access to important public events.
on air coverage of news and sports expanded rapidly to meet the demand.
some of the most dramatic moments of the 1930s were a result of radio coverage of celebrated events the world series the academy awards political conventions.
when the german dirigible hindenburg crashed in flames in lakehurst new jersey in 1937 it the hindenburg crash produced an enormous national reaction largely because of the live radio account by a broadcaster overcome with emotion who cried out as he watched the terrible crash oh the humanity.
oh the humanity the actor director orson welles created another memorable event on halloween night 1938 when he broadcast a radio play about aliens landing in central new jersey who had set off toward new york armed with terrible weapons.
the play took the form of a news broadcast and it created panic among some people who believed for a while that the events it described were real.
the movies in the first years of the depression movie attendance dropped significantly.
by the mid 1930s however most americans had resumed their moviegoing habits in part because the movies now with sound and by the end of the decade color were becoming more appealing.
hollywood continued to exercise tight control over its products in the 1930s through its resilient censor will hays who ensured that most movies carried no sensational or controversial messages.
the studio system through which a few large movie companies exercised iron control over actors writers and directors also worked to ensure that hollywood films avoided controversy.
neither the censor nor the studio system however could or wished to completely prevent films from exploring social questions.
there were many serious films that portrayed the problems of the depression for example king vidors our daily bread 1932 and john fords adaptation of the grapes of wrath 1940.
gangster movies such as little caesar 1930 and the public enemy 1931 portrayed a dark gritty violent world with which few americans were familiar but their desperate stories were popular nevertheless with those engaged in their own difficult struggles.
but the most effective presentation of a social message came from the brilliant italian born director frank capra.
capra had a deep and somewhat romanticized love for his adopted country and he translated that love into a vaguely populistic admiration for ordinary people.
he contrasted the decency of small town america films of frank capra and the common man with what he considered the grasping opportunism of the patterns of popular culture the golden age of comic books in the troubled years of the great depression and later world war ii many americans sought release from their anxieties in fantasy.
movies plays books radio shows and other diversions drew people out of their own lives and into a safer or more glamorous or more exciting world.
beginning in 1938 one of the most popular forms of escape for many young americans was the comic book.
in february 1935 malcolm wheelernicholson founded the first comics magazine what we now know as the comic book titled new fun.
it was not successful but wheeler founded a new company detective comics.
he began in 1937 to design a new magazine called action comics.
wheeler ran out of money before he could publish anything but the company continued without him.
in 1938 the first issue of action comics appeared with a startling and controversial cover a powerful man in a skintight suit lifting a car over his head.
his name was superman and he became the most popular cartoon character of all time.
within a year superman had a comic book named after him which was selling over 1 2 million copies each issue.
by 1940 there was a popular superman radio show introduced by a breathless announcer crying its a bird.
its a plane.
superman soon other publishers began developing new superheroes a term invented by the creators of superman to capitalize on this growing popular appetite.
in 1939 a s econd great comic book publisher appeared marvel comics.
by the early 1940s superman had been joined by other superheroes the human torch the sub mariner batman the flash 576 and wonder woman a character created in part to signal the importance of women to the war effort.
it is not hard to imagine why super heroes would be so appealing to americans in the 1930s and 1940s particularly to the teenage boys who were the largest single purchasers of comic books.
superman and other superheroes were idealized versions of the ideal boy smart good the perfect boy scout as one fan put it.
but they were also all powerful capable of righting wrong and preventing catastrophe.
even as the national economy faltered comic book heroes modeled patriotic pride resilience and optimism.
they operated with moral certainty when so much was uncertain.
at a time when suffering was an ever present reality in the world superheroes offered a comforting escape from anxiety.
many of the early comic book writers were young jewish men conscious of their outsider status in an american culture not yet wholly open to them.
almost all the characters they created had alter egos identities they used while living within the normal world.
superman was clark kent a mild mannered reporter batman was bruce wayne a wealthy heir.
all were part of mainstream american society and they expressed in part the outsiders dream of assimilation.
the superheroes themselves were outsiders too but outsiders endowed with special powers and abilities unavailable to ordinary people.
in the last years of the depression the comic superheroes began battling the axis powers.
marvels human torch and submariner joined forces against the german navy.
superman fought spies and saboteurs at home.
captain america a new character created in march 1941 was a frail young man rejected by the army who after being given a secret serum by a military doctor became extraordinarily powerful.
the cover of the first issue of captain america showed the title character punching adolf hitler in his headquarters in germany.
the end of the war was also the end of this first golden age of american comic books.
new comic books emphasized romance mild sexuality and over time violence and cruelty.
but comic books never surpassed the heights of popularity that the superhero comics attained during the depression and world war ii.
understand analyze evaluate superman the most popular action figure in the history of comic books was superman whose superhuman powers were particularly appealing fantasies to americans suffering through the depression and later world war ii.

capras films incredibly popular in the 1930s helped audiences find solace in a vision of an imagined american past in the warmth and goodness of idealized small towns and the decency of ordinary people.
more often however the commercial films of the 1930s like most radio programs were deliberately and explicitly escapist lavish musicals such as gold diggers of 1933 screwball comedies such as capras it happened one night or the many films of the marx brothers films designed to divert audiences from their troubles and often indulge their fantasies about quick and easy wealth.
the 1930s were the first years of walt disneys long reign as the champion of animation and childrens entertainment.
after producing cartoon shorts for theaters in the late 1920s many of them starring the newly created character mickey mouse disney began to produce feature length animated films starting in 1937 with snow white.

everett collection a night at the opera hollywood did little to challenge the conventions of popular culture on issues of gender and race.
women in movies were portrayed overwhelmingly as wives and mothers or if not as sexually attractive flirts.
mae west portrayed herself in a series of successful stereotypes in film films as an overtly sexual woman manipulating men through her attractiveness.
few films included important african american characters.
most of the black men and women who did appear in movies were portrayed as servants or farmhands or entertainers.
literature and journalism much literature and journalism in the 1930s dealt directly or indirectly with the tremendous disillusionment and the increasing radicalism of the time.
not all literature of course was challenging or controversial.
the most popular books and magazines of the 1930s in fact were as escapist and romantic as many radio shows and movies.
two of the best selling novels of the decade were romantic sagas set in earlier eras margaret mitchells gone with the wind 1936 and hervey allens anthony adverse 1933.
leading magazines focused more on fashions stunts scenery and the arts than on the social conditions of the nation.
the new and enorlife magazine mously popular photographic journal life first published in 1936 had the largest readership of any publication in the united states other than readers digest.
the great depression 579 it devoted some attention to politics and to the economic conditions of the depression but it was best known for stunning photographs of sporting and theater events natural landscapes and impressive public projects.
one of its most popular features was life goes to a party which took the chatty social columns of daily newspapers and turned them into glossy photographic glimpses of the rich and famous but also ordinary people enjoying less lavish parties.
other depression writing however was frankly and openly challenging to the dominant values of american popular culture.
some of the most depression era fiction significant literature offered corrosive portraits of the harshness and emptiness of american life john dos passoss u s a trilogy 1930 1936 which attacked what he considered the materialistic madness of american culture in richard wrights native son 1940 the story of a young african american man broken by the system of racial oppression nathanael wests miss lonelyhearts 1933 the story of an advice columnist overwhelmed by the sadness he encounters in the lives of those who consult him jack conroys the disinherited 1933 a harsh portrait of the lives of coal miners and james t farrells studs lonigan 1932 a portrait of a lost hardened working class youth.
perhaps the best known depiction of depression era life is john steinbecks the grapes of wrath 1939.
the novels main characters are the joad family migrants from the dust bowl to california who encounter an unending string of calamities and failures.
their story offers a critique of the exploitative features of agrarian life in the west as well as a tribute to the fortitude and heart of the community the joads represent.
the popular front and the left the communist party a relatively small organization in the early twentieth century flourished during the great depression.
it had long been a harsh and unrelenting critic of american capitalism largely hidden from the public world.
but with the capitalist systems flaws exposed the depression brought the communists into the light.
they created what came to be called the popular front a broad coalition of popular front alliances antifascist groups on the left.
not all members of the popular front considered themselves communists but communism was its driving force.
the popular front presented itself as an american organization but it was in fact largely controlled by the soviet union.
over time stalin and the communist party softened their attitude toward president franklin roosevelt elected in 1932 hoping that he would become an ally against nazi germany.
to that end the popular front formed loose alliances with progressive groups and it praised even some strong anticommunists such as the labor leader john l lewis.
in its heyday the popular front did much to enhance the reputation and influence of the communist party.
it also helped mobilize writers artists and intellectuals behind a critical democratic sensibility.
the spanish civil war of the mid 1930s showed how the left helped give meaning and purpose to individual lives.
the war in spain pitted the forces supporting francisco franco who received aid from hitler and mussolini and was thus allied with fascism against the existing republican government.
a substantial group of young americans more than 3 000 in all formed the abraham lincoln brigade and trav lincoln brigade eled to spain to join in what they considered a fight against the fascists.
the american communist party was instrumental in creating the lincoln brigade and directed many of its activities.
580 chapter 23 the party was active as well in organizing the unemployed in the early 1930s and staged a hunger march in washington d c in 1931.
party members were among the most effective union organizers in some industries.
and the party was virtually alone among political organizations in taking a firm stand in favor of racial justice its active defense of the scottsboro defendants was but one example of its efforts to ally itself with the aspirations of african americans.
the american communist party was not however the open patriotic organization it tried to appear.
it was always under the close and rigid supervision of the soviet union.
the subordination of the party leadership to the soviet union was most clearly demonstrated in 1939 when stalin signed a nonaggression pact with nazi germany.
moscow sent orders to the american communist party to abandon the popular front and return to its old stance of harsh criticism of american liberals.
communist party leaders in the united states immediately obeyed although thousands of disillusioned members left the party as a result.
the socialist party of america under the leadership of norman thomas also cited the socialist party message the economic crisis as evidence of the failure of capitalism and sought vigorously to win public support for its own political program.
among other things it attempted to mobilize support among the rural poor.
the southern tenant farmers union stfu supported by the party and organized by a young socialist h l mitchell attempted to create a biracial coalition of sharecroppers tenant farmers and others to demand economic reform.
neither the stfu nor the party itself however made any real progress toward establishing socialism as a major force in american politics.
antiradicalism was a powerful force in the 1930s.
hostility toward the communist party in particular was intense at many levels of government.
congressional committees chaired by hamilton fish of new york and martin dies of texas investigated communist influence wherever they could find or imagine it.
white southerners tried to drive communist organizers out of the countryside just as growers in california and elsewhere tried unsuccessfully to keep communists from organizing mexican american and other workers.
at few times before and few since in american history did being part of the left seem leftist ideas in the arts so respectable and even conventional among workers intellectuals and others.
the 1930s witnessed an impressive if temporary widening of the ideological range of mainstream art and politics.
the roosevelt administrations new deal for example sponsored artistic work through the works projects administration that was frankly challenging to the capitalist norms of the 1920s.
the filmmaker pare lorentz with funding from new deal agencies made two powerful documentaries the plow that broke the plains 1936 and the river 1937 that combined a celebration of new deal programs with a harsh critique of the exploitation of people and the environment that industrial capitalism had produced.
other new deal sponsored artists also sought to reveal the harshness of poverty and the human cost of social neglect.
notable among them were numerous documentary photographers many of them employed by the farm security administration who traveled through rural areas recording the ravaged nature of agricultural life.
they included some of the great photographers of their era dorothea lange margaret bourke white arthur rothstein russell lee walker evans ben shahn and others.
writers too devoted themselves to exposing social injustice some of them working through the new deals federal writers project and federal art project.
the great depression 581 migrant family this photograph by the great depression photographer dorothea lange portrays a family of migrants leaving texas in search of work in california.
it suggests the plight of hundreds of thousands of families who fled the regions affected by drought in the 1930s a devastation that became known as the dust bowl.

the ordeal of herbert hoover herbert hoover began his presidency in march 1929 believing like most americans that the nation faced a bright and prosperous future.
for the first six months of his administration he attempted to expand the associational policies he had advocated during his eight years as secretary of commerce.
the economic crisis that began before the year was out forced hoover to deal with a new set of problems.
but for most of the rest of his term he continued to rely on the principles that had always governed his public life.
the hoover program hoover first responded to the depression by attempting to restore public confidence in the economy.
the fundamental business of this country that is production and distribution of commodities he said in 1930 is on a sound and prosperous basis he then summoned leaders of business labor and agriculture to the white house and urged them to adopt a program of voluntary cooperation for recovery.
he implored businessmen not to cut production or lay off workers he talked labor leaders into forgoing demands for 582 chapter 23 higher wages or better hours.
but by mid 1931 economic conditions had deteriorated so much that the structure of voluntary cooperation had collapsed.
hoover also attempted to use government spending as a tool for fighting the depression.
the president proposed to congress an increase of 423 million a significant sum by the standards of the time in federal public works programs and he encouraged state and local governments to fund public construction.
but the spending was not nearly enough in the face of such devastating problems.
and when economic conditions worsened he became less willing to increase spending worrying instead about keeping the budget balanced.
even before the stock market crash hoover had begun to construct a program to assist the troubled agricultural economy.
in april 1929 he proposed the agricultural marketing agricultural marketing act act which established the first major government program to help farmers maintain prices.
a federally sponsored farm board would make loans to national marketing cooperatives or establish corporations to buy surpluses and thus raise prices.
at the same time hoover attempted to protect american farmers from international competition hawley smoot tariff by raising agricultural tariffs.
the hawley smoot tariff of 1930 increased protection on seventy five farm products.
but neither the agricultural marketing act nor the hawley smoot tariff ultimately helped american farmers significantly.
agricultural surpluses combined with declining consumption kept the farm economy in crisis.
by the spring of 1931 herbert hoovers political position had deteriorated considerably.
in the 1930 congressional elections democrats won control of the house and made substantial inroads in the senate.
many americans blamed the president personally for the crisis and began calling the shantytowns that unemployed people established on the outskirts of cities hoovervilles democrats urged the president to support hoovervilles more vigorous programs of relief and public spending.
hoover instead seized on a slight improvement in economic conditions early in 1931 as proof that his policies were working.
the international financial panic of the spring of 1931 destroyed that illusion.
by the time congress convened in december 1931 conditions had grown so desperate that hoover supported a series of measures designed to keep endangered banks afloat and protect homeowners from foreclosure on their mortgages.
most important was a bill the rfc passed in january 1932 establishing the reconstruction finance corporation rfc a government agency to provide federal loans to troubled banks railroads and other businesses.
unlike some earlier hoover programs the rfc operated on a large scale.
in 1932 it had a budget of 1 5 billion for public works alone.
nevertheless the new agency failed to deal directly or forcefully enough with the real problems of the economy to produce any significant recovery.
the rfc lent funds only to financial institutions with sufficient collateral much of its money went to large banks and corporations.
at hoovers insistence it helped finance only those public works projects that promised ultimately to pay for themselves toll bridges public housing and others.
above all the rfc did not have enough money to make any real impact on the depression and it did not even spend all the money it had.
popular protest for the first several years of the depression most americans were either too stunned or too confused to raise much effective protest.
by the middle of 1932 however dissident voices began to be heard.
in the summer of 1932 a group of unhappy farm owners gathered in des moines iowa to establish a new organization the farmers holiday association which endorsed the great depression 583 the withholding of farm products from the market in effect a farmers strike.
the strike began in august in western iowa spread briefly to a few neighboring areas and succeeded in blockading several markets but in the end it dissolved in failure.
a more celebrated protest movement emerged from american veterans.
in 1924 congress had approved the payment of a 1 000 bonus to all those who had served in world war i the money to be paid beginning in 1945.
by 1932 however many veterans were demanding that the bonus be paid immediately.
hoover concerned about balancing the budget rejected their appeal.
in june more than 20 000 veterans members of the self proclaimed bonus expeditionary force or bonus army marched the bonus army into washington built crude camps around the city and promised to stay until congress approved legislation to pay the bonus.
some of the veterans departed in july after congress had voted down their proposal.
many however remained in washington.
in july 1932 president hoover ordered the washington d c police to evict the bonus marchers from some of the public buildings and land they had been occupying.
after a series of skirmishes between police and the protesters hoover ordered the united states army to complete the eviction.
bettmann corbis clearing out the bonus marchers 584 chapter 23 their continued presence in washington embarrassed president hoover.
finally in mid july he ordered police to clear the marchers out of several abandoned federal buildings in which they had been staying.
a few marchers threw rocks at the police and someone opened fire two veterans fell dead.
hoover called the incident evidence of uncontrolled violence and radicalism and he ordered the united states army to assist the police in clearing out the buildings.
general douglas macarthur the army chief of staff carried out the mission himself and greatly exceeded the presidents orders.
he led the third cavalry two infantry regiments a machine gun detachment and six tanks down pennsylvania avenue in pursuit demise of the bonus army of the bonus army.
the veterans fled in terror.
macarthur followed them across the anacostia river where he ordered the soldiers to burn their tent city to the ground.
more than 100 marchers were injured.
the incident dealt another serious blow to hoovers already battered political standing.
the great engineer the personification of the optimistic days of the 1920s had become a symbol of the nations failure to deal effectively with its startling reversal of fortune.
the election of 1932 as the 1932 presidential election approached few people doubted the outcome.
the republican party dutifully renominated herbert hoover for a second term of office but few delegates believed he could win.
the democrats in the meantime gathered jubilantly in chicago to nominate the governor of new york franklin delano roosevelt.
roosevelt had been a well known figure in the party for many years already.
a hudson franklin delano roosevelt valley aristocrat a distant cousin of theodore roosevelt and a handsome charming young man he progressed rapidly from a seat in the new york state legislature to a position as assistant secretary of the navy during world war i to his partys vice presidential nomination in 1920 on the ill fated ticket with james m cox.
less than a year later he was stricken with polio.
although he never regained use of his legs and could walk only by using crutches and braces he built up sufficient physical strength to return to politics in 1928.
when al smith received the democratic nomination for president that year roosevelt was elected to succeed him as governor.
in 1930 he easily won reelection.
roosevelt worked no miracles in new york but he did initiate enough programs of government assistance to be able to present himself as a more energetic and imaginative leader than hoover.
in national politics he avoided divisive cultural issues a new deal and emphasized the economic grievances that most democrats shared.
as a result he was able to assemble a broad coalition within the party and win his partys nomination.
in a dramatic break with tradition he flew to chicago to address the democratic national convention in person and accept the nomination.
in the course of his acceptance speech roosevelt aroused the delegates with his ringing promise i pledge you i pledge myself to a new deal for the american people neither then nor in the subsequent campaign did roosevelt give much indication of what that program would be.
but herbert hoovers unpopularity virtually ensured roosevelts election.
roosevelt won by a landslide receiving 57 4 percent of the popular vote to hoovers 39 7 and carried every state except delaware pennsylvania connecticut vermont new hampshire and maine.
democrats won large majorities in both houses of the great depression 585 29 14 26 8 11 candidate party franklin d roosevelt democratic herbert hoover republican norman thomas socialist other candidates communist prohibition socialist labor liberty electoral vote popular vote 22 821 857 57 4 15 761 841 39 7 881 951 2 2 271 355 56 9 of electorate voting the election of 1932 like the election of 1928 the election of 1932 was exceptionally one sided.
but this time the landslide favored the democratic candidate franklin roosevelt who overwhelmed herbert hoover in all regions of the country except new england.
roosevelt obviously benefited primarily from popular disillusionment with hoovers response to the great depression.
but what characteristics of roosevelt himself contributed to his victory.
it was a convincing mandate but it was not yet clear what roosevelt intended to do with it.
the interregnum the period between the election and the inauguration which in the early 1930s lasted more than four months was a season of growing economic crisis.
presidents elect traditionally do not involve themselves directly in government.
but in a series of brittle exchanges with roosevelt hoover tried to exact a pledge from the president elect to maintain policies of economic orthodoxy.
roosevelt genially refused.
in february only a month before the inauguration a new crisis developed when the collapse of the american banking system suddenly and rapidly accelerated.
banking collapse depositors withdrew their money in panic and one bank after another closed its doors and declared bankruptcy.
hoover again asked roosevelt to give prompt public assurances that there would be no tinkering with the currency no heavy borrowing no unbalancing of the budget.
roosevelt again refused.
march 4 1933 was therefore a day of both economic crisis and considerable personal bitterness.
on that morning herbert hoover rode glumly down pennsylvania avenue with a beaming buoyant franklin roosevelt who would shortly be sworn in as the thirtysecond president of the united states.
586 chapter 23 conclusion the great depression changed many things in american life.
it created unemployment on a scale never before experienced in the nations history.
it put enormous pressures on families on communities on state and local governments and ultimately on washington.
the innovative but ultimately failed presidency of herbert hoover was unable to produce policies capable of dealing effectively with the crisis.
in the nations politics and culture there were strong currents of radicalism and protest and many middle class americans came to fear that a revolution might be approaching.
in reality while the great depression shook much of american society and culture it actually toppled very little.
the capitalist system survived damaged for a time but never truly threatened.
the values of materialism and personal responsibility were shaken but never overturned.
the american people in the 1930s were more receptive than they had been in the 1920s to evocations of community generosity and the dignity of common people.
they were more open to experiments in government and business and even private lives than they had been in earlier years.

what were the principal achievements of the second new deal in 1935.
during his twelve years in office franklin roosevelt became more central to the life of the nation than any president had ever been.
more important his administration constructed a series of reforms that fundamentally altered the federal government and its relationship to society.
by the end of the 1930s the new deal as the roosevelt administrations program was called had not ended the great depression only world war ii did that.
but it had created many of the broad outlines of the political world we know today.

he did so in part by force of personality and in part by rapidly constructing an ambitious and diverse program of legislation.
much of roosevelts early success was a result of his ebullient personality.
he was the first president to make regular use of the radio and his friendly fireside chats d uring which he explained in simple terms his programs and plans to the people helped build public confidence in the administration.
but roosevelt could not rely on image alone.
on march 6 two days after taking office he issued a proclamation closing all american banks for four days until congress could meet in special session to consider banking reform legislation.
so great was the panic about bank failures that the bank holiday as the president euphemistically described it created a general sense of relief and hope.
three days later roosevelt sent to congress the emergency banking act a generally conservative bill designed primarily to protect the larger banks from being dragged down by the weakness of smaller ones.
the bill provided for treasury department inspection of all banks before they would be allowed to reopen.
it also provided federal assistance to some troubled institutions and a thorough reorganization of those banks in the greatest difficulty.
congress passed the bill within a few hours of its introduction.
whatever else the new law accomplished it helped dispel the panic.
three quarters of the banks in the federal reserve system reopened within the next three days and 1 billion in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month.
the immediate banking crisis was over.
the new deal 589 on the morning after passage of the emergency banking act roosevelt sent to congress another measure the economy act designed to convince the public and especially the business community that the federal government was in safe responsible hands.
the act proposed to balance the federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and reducing pensions to veterans by as much as 15 percent.
like the banking bill this one passed through congress almost instantly even though the cost cutting reduced the growth of the economy.
later that spring roosevelt signed the glass steagall act of june 1933 which gave the government authority to curb irresponsible speculation by banks.
more important perhaps it established the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which guaranteed all bank deposits up to 2 500.
even if federal deposit insurance corporation a bank should fail small depositors would be able to recover their money.
to restore confidence in the stock market congress passed the so called truth in securities act of 1933 requiring corporations issuing new securities to provide full and accurate information about them to the public.
in june 1934 another act established the securities and exchange commission sec to police the stock market.
roosevelt also securities and exchange commission signed a bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer with a 3 2 percent alcohol content an interim measure pending the repeal of prohibition for which a constitutional amendment the twenty first was already in process.
the amendment was ratified later in 1933.
agricultural adjustment these initial actions bought time for more comprehensive programs.
the first was the agricultural adjustment act which congress passed in may 1933.
under the provisions of the act producers of seven basic commodities wheat cotton corn hogs rice tobacco the new deal of the many resources at roosevelts disposal was the impression of his sunny personality during dark times.
it conveyed to many a sense of hope and optimism.
in this political cartoon from about 1934 roosevelt is seen steering the ship of state toward economic recovery.
his detractors are shown grumbling under the cloud of depression.

548 chapter 22 henry ford for example shortened the workweek raised wages and instituted paid vacations.
by 1926 nearly 3 million industrial workers were eligible for at least modest pensions upon retirement.
when labor grievances surfaced despite these efforts workers could voice them through the so called company unions that emerged in many industries workers councils and shop committees organized by the corporations themselves.
but welfare capitalism in the end gave workers no real control over their own fates.
company unions were feeble vehicles.
and welfare capitalism survived only as long as industry prospered.
after 1929 with the economy in crisis the entire system collapsed.
welfare capitalism affected only a relatively small number of firms in any case.
most laborers worked for employers who were interested primarily in keeping their labor costs low.
workers as a whole therefore received wage increases that were proportionately far below the growth of the economy.
at the end of the decade the average annual income of a worker remained below 1 500 when 1 800 was considered necessary to maintain a minimally decent standard of living.
only by relying on the combined earnings of several family members could many working class families make ends meet.
the new era was a bleak time for labor organization in part because many unions themselves were relatively conservative and failed to adapt to the realities of the modern economy.
the american federation of labor afl led after samuel gomperss death by the cautious william green sought peaceful cooperation with employers and remained wedded to the concept of the craft union.
in the meantime the rapidly rising number of unskilled industrial workers received little attention from the craft unions.
but whatever the unions weaknesses the strength of the corporations was the principal reason for the absence of effective labor organization in the 1920s.
after the turmoil of 1919 corporate leaders worked hard to spread the doctrine that a crucial element of democratic capitalism was the protection of the open shop a shop in which no worker could be required to join a union.
the crusade for the open shop euphemistically titled american plan the american plan became a pretext for a harsh campaign of unionbusting.
as a result union membership fell from more than 5 million in 1920 to under 3 million in 1929.
women and minorities in the workforce a growing proportion of the workforce consisted of women who were concentrated in what have since become known as pink collar jobs low paying service occupations.
large numbers of women worked as secretaries salesclerks and telephone operators and in other nonmanual service capacities.
because technically such positions were not industrial jobs the afl and other labor organizations were uninterested in organizing these workers.
similarly the half million african americans who had migrated from the rural south into the cities during the great migration after 1914 had few opportunities for union representation.
the skilled crafts represented in the afl usually excluded black workers.
partly as a result of that exclusion most blacks worked in jobs in which the afl took no interest at all as janitors dishwashers garbage collectors and domestics and in other service capacities.
a philip randolphs brotherhood of sleeping car porters brotherhood of sleeping car porters was one of the few important unions dominated and led by african americans.
the new era 549 the frail union movement among african americans in the 1920s led by a philip randolph and others slowly built up a constituency within the black working class.

photo by john vachon anthony potter collection getty images african american worker protesting in the west and the southwest the ranks of the unskilled included considerable numbers of asians and hispanics.
in the wake of the chinese exclusion acts japanese immigrants increasingly replaced the chinese in menial jobs in california.
they worked on railroads construction sites farms and in many other low paying workplaces.
some japanese managed to escape the ranks of the unskilled by forming their own small businesses or setting themselves up as truck farmers and many of the issei japanese immigrants and issei and nisei nisei their american born children enjoyed significant economic success so much so that california passed laws in 1913 and 1920 to make it more difficult for them to buy land.
other asians most notably filipinos also swelled the unskilled workforce and generated considerable hostility.
anti filipino riots in california beginning in 1929 helped produce legislation in 1934 virtually eliminating immigration from the philippines.
mexican immigrants formed a major part of the unskilled workforce throughout the southwest and california.
nearly half a million mexicans entered the united states in the 1920s.
most lived in california texas arizona and new mexico and by 1930 most lived in cities.

the gold and purple areas of the two maps show the territory that residents of oregon could reach within two hours.
note how small that area was in 1900 and how much larger it was in 1930 by which time an area of over 100 square miles had become easily accessible to the town.
note too the significant network of paved roads in the region by 1930 few of which had existed in 1900.
why did automobiles do so much more than railroads to expand the travel horizons of small towns.
mexican barrios grew up in los angeles el paso san antonio denver and many other urban centers.
some of the residents found work locally in factories and shops others traveled to mines or did migratory labor on farms but returned to the cities between jobs.
mexican workers too faced hostility and discrimination from the anglo population of the region but there were few efforts actually to exclude them.
employers in the relatively underpopulated west needed this ready pool of low paid and unorganized workers.
rising mexican immigration the new era 551 agricultural technology and the plight of the farmer like industry american agriculture in the 1920s embraced new technologies.
the number of tractors on american farms quadrupled during the 1920s especially after they began to be powered by internal combustion engines like automobiles rather than by the cumbersome steam engines of the past.
they helped open 35 million new acres to cultivation.
increasingly sophisticated combines and harvesters proliferated making it possible to produce more crops with fewer workers.
agricultural researchers worked on other innovations the invention of hybrid corn made possible by advances in genetic research which became available to farmers in 1921 but was not grown in great quantities for a decade or more and the creation of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which also had limited use in the 1920s but proliferated quickly in the 1930s and 1940s.
the new technologies greatly increased agricultural productivity but the demand for agricultural goods was not rising as fast as production.
as a result declining food prices there were substantial surpluses a disastrous decline in food prices and a severe drop in farmers incomes beginning early in the 1920s.
more than 3 million people left agriculture altogether in the course of the decade.
of those who remained many lost ownership of their lands and had to rent instead from banks or other landlords.
in response some farmers began to demand relief in the form of government price supports.
one price raising scheme in particular came to dominate agrarian demands the idea of parity parity was a complicated formula for setting an adequate price for parity farm goods and ensuring that farmers would earn back at least their production costs no matter how the national or world agricultural market might fluctuate.
champions of parity urged high tariffs against foreign agricultural goods and a government commitment to buy surplus domestic crops at parity and sell them abroad.
the legislative expression of the demand for parity was the mcnary haugen bill which required the government to support prices at parity for grain cotton tobacco and rice.
it was introduced repeatedly between 1924 and 1928.
in 1926 and again in 1928 congress approved the bill.
president calvin coolidge vetoed it both times.
the new culture the urban and consumer oriented culture of the 1920s helped americans in all regions live their lives and perceive their world in increasingly similar ways.
that same culture exposed them to a new set of values.
but different segments of american society experienced the new culture in different ways.
consumerism and communications the united states of the 1920s was a consumer society.
more people than ever before could buy items not just because of need but also for convenience and pleasure.
middle class families purchased electric refrigerators washing machines and vacuum cleaners.
people wore wristwatches and smoked cigarettes.
women purchased cosmetics and mass produced fashions.
above all americans bought automobiles.
by the end of the decade there were more than 30 million cars on american roads.
no group was more attuned to the emergence of consumerism or more responsible for creating it than the advertising industry.
in the 1920s partly as a advertising industry result of techniques pioneered by wartime propaganda advertising came of age.
publicists america in the world the cinema there is probably no cultural or commercial product more closely identified with the united states than motion pictures or as they are known in much of the world the cinema.
although the technology of cinema emerged from the work of inventors in england and france as well as the united states the production and distribution of films has been dominated by americans almost from the start.
the united states was the first nation to create a film industry and it did so at a scale vaster than that of any other country.
with 700 feature films a year in the 1920s hollywood produced ten times as many movies as any other nation and even then its films were dominating not only the huge american market but much of the worlds market as well.
seventy percent of the films seen in france 80 percent of those seen in latin america and 95 percent of the movies viewed in canada and great britain were produced in the united states in the 1920s.
as early as the 1930s the penetration of other nations by american movies was already troubling many governments.
the soviet union responded to the popularity of walt disneys mickey mouse cartoons by inventing a cartoon hero of its own a porcupine designed to e ntertain in a way consistent with socialist values and not the capitalist ones that they believed hollywood conveyed.
during world war ii american films were banned in occupied france prompting some antifascist dissidents to screen such american films as frank capras mr smith goes to washington in protest.
american dominance was a result in part of world war i and its aftermath which debilitated european filmmaking just as 552 movies were vigorously growing in the united states.
by 1915 the united states had gained complete control of its own vast market and had so saturated it with movie theaters that by the end of world war i half the theaters of the world were in america.
two decades later after an extraordinary expansion of theaters in other nations the united states continued to have over 40 percent of the worlds cinemas.
and while the spread of theaters through other areas of the world helped launch film industries in many other countries it also increased the market and the appetite for american films and strengthened american supremacy in their production.
the sun it now appears the saturday evening post commented in the mid 1920s never sets on the british empire and the american motion picture movies were then and perhaps remain still americas most influential cultural export.
even american popular music which has enormous global reach faces more significant local competition than american movies do in most parts of the world.
despite this american dominance however filmmaking has flourished and continues to flourish in many countries around the world.
indias fabled bollywood for example produces an enormous number of movies for its domestic market almost as many as the american industry creates although few of them are widely exported.
this global cinema has had a significant impact on american filmmaking.
the small british film industry had a strong early influence on american movies partly because of the quality and originality of british films and partly because of the emigration of talented actors directors and screenwriters valentino the popularity of the film star rudolph valentino among american women was one of the most striking cultural phenomena of the 1920s.
valentino was slight and delicate not at all like the conventional image of manliness but he developed an enormous following among women in part as this poster is obviously intended to suggest by baring his body on screen.
valentino was italian which made him seem somehow strange and foreign to many older stock americans and he was almost always cast in exotic roles never as an american.
his sudden death in 1926 at the age of 31 created enormous outpourings of grief among many american women.
united artists photofest to the united states.
the great alfred hitchcock for example made his first films in london before moving to hollywood where he spent the rest of his long career.
after world war ii french new wave cinema helped spawn a new generation of highly individualistic directors in the united states.
asian cinema especially the thriving film industry in hong kong with its gritty realism helped lead to some of the powerfully violent american films of the 1980s and beyond as well as the genre of martial arts films that has become popular around the world.
german italian swedish dutch japanese spanish australian and indian filmmakers also had enormous influence on hollywood and over time perhaps even greater influence on the large and growing independent film movement in the united states.
in recent decades as new technologies and new styles have transformed films around the world the american movie industry has continued to dominate global cinema.
but national boundaries no longer adequately describe moviemaking in the twenty first century.
it is becoming as truly global as other commercial ventures.
american films today are often produced abroad often have non american directors and actors and are often paid for with international financing.
hollywood still dominates worldwide filmmaking but hollywood itself is now an increasingly global community.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
did american movies as the soviet union claimed in the 1930s promote capitalism.
why has the american movie industry continued to dominate global cinema.
no longer simply conveyed information they sought to identify products with a particular lifestyle.
they also encouraged the public to absorb the values of promotion and salesmanship and to admire those who were effective boosters and publicists.
one of the most successful books of the 1920s was the man nobody knows by the advertising executive bruce barton.
it portrayed jesus as not only a religious prophet but also a super salesman bartons message one sensitive to the new spirit of the consumer culture was that jesus had been concerned with living a full and rewarding life in this world and that twentieth century men and women should do the same.
553 554 chapter 22 the advertising industry made good use of new vehicles of communication.
newspapers were absorbed into national chains.
mass circulation magazines attracted broad national audiences.
movies in the 1920s became an ever more popular and powerful form of mass communication.
over 100 million people saw films in 1930 as compared to 40 million in 1922.
the addition of sound to motion pictures beginning in 1927 with the first the jazz singer feature length talkie the jazz singer starring al jolson greatly enhanced films appeal.
a series of scandals in the early 1920s led to the creation of the new motion picture association which imposed much tighter controls over the content of films.
the result was safer more conventionally acceptable films which may in fact have broadened the appeal of movies generally.
see america in the world the cinema an equally important communications vehicle was the radio.
the first commercial radio station in america kdka in pittsburgh began broadcasting in 1920 and the first national radio network the national broadcasting company was formed in 1927.
that same year congress passed the radio act which created a federal radio commission to regulate the public airwaves used by private companies.
in 1935 it became the federal communications commission which survives today.
women in the new era college educated women were no longer pioneers in the 1920s.
there were now two and even three generations of graduates of womens or coeducational colleges and universities and some were making their presence felt in professional areas that in the past women had rarely penetrated.
the new professional woman was a vivid and widely publicized figure in the 1920s.
in reality however most employed women were still nonprofessional lower class workers.
middle class women in the meantime remained largely in the home.
yet the 1920s constituted a new era for middle class women nonetheless.
in particular the decade saw a redefinition of motherhood.
shortly after world war i john b watson and other behavioralists began to challenge the long held assumption that women had an motherhood redefined instinctive capacity for motherhood.
maternal affection was not they claimed sufficient preparation for child rearing.
instead mothers should rely on the advice and assistance of experts and professionals doctors nurses and trained educators.
for many middle class women these changes devalued what had been an important and consuming activity.
many attempted to compensate through what are often called companionate marriages which elevated the importance of compatibility and love between partners.
some women now openly considered their sexual relationships with their husbands not simply as a means of procreation as earlier generations had been taught but as important and pleasurable experiences in their own right the culmination of romantic love.
one result of the new era for women was growing interest in birth control.
the pioneer margaret sanger of the american birth control movement margaret sanger began her career as a promoter of the diaphragm and other birth control devices out of a concern for workingclass women she believed that large families contributed to poverty and distress in poor communities.
by the 1920s she was becoming more effective in persuading middle class women to see the benefits of birth control.
nevertheless some birth control devices remained illegal in many states and abortion remained illegal nearly everywhere.
to the consternation of many longtime women reformers and progressive suffragists some women concluded that in the new era it was no longer necessary to maintain a rigid victorian female respectability they could smoke drink dance wear seductive the new era 555 by the mid 1920s the flapper the young woman who challenged traditional expectations had become not only a social type but a movement in fashion as well.
here catherine dear is shown posing in a beach costume a fashion a long way from the rigid respectability of victorian age styles.
bettmann corbis the flapper clothes and makeup and attend lively parties.
those assumptions were reflected in the emergence of the flapper the modern woman whose liberated lifestyle found flappers expression in dress hairstyle speech and behavior.
the flapper lifestyle had a particular impact on urban lower middle class and working class single women who were filling new jobs in industry and the service sector.
at night such women flocked to clubs and dance halls in search of excitement and companionship.
many more affluent women soon began to copy the flapper style.
despite all the changes most women remained highly dependent on men and relatively powerless when men exploited that dependence.
the national womans party under the leadership of alice paul attempted to fight that powerlessness through its campaign for the equal rights amendment although it found little support in congress.
responding to the suffrage victory women organized the league of women voters and the womens auxiliaries of both the democratic and republican parties.
female dominated consumer groups grew rapidly and increased the range and energy of their efforts.
women activists won a brief triumph in 1921 when they helped secure passage of the sheppard towner act which provided federal funds to states to establish prenatal and child health care programs.
from the start however the act produced controversy.
alice paul and her supporters opposed the measure complaining that it classified all women as mothers.
more important the american medical association fought sheppard towner warning that it would introduce untrained outsiders into the health care field.
in 1929 no longer worried about women voting as a bloc congress terminated the program.
the disenchanted the generation that lived through and in many cases fought in the great war quickly came to see the conflict as a useless waste of lives lost for no purpose.
for many young people in the 1920s disenchantment with the war contributed to a growing disenchantment with the united states.
the newly prosperous and consumer driven era they encountered 556 chapter 22 seemed meaningless and vulgar to many artists and intellectuals in particular.
as a result they came to view their own culture with contempt.
rather than trying to influence and reform their society they isolated themselves from it and embarked on a restless search the lost generation for personal fulfillment.
the american writer gertrude stein once referred to the young americans emerging from world war i as a lost generation many artists and intellectuals coming of age in the 1920s experienced that fundamental disenchantment with modern america reflected in a series of savage critiques of modern society critiqued modern society by a wide range of writers some of whom were known as the debunkers among them was the baltimore journalist h l mencken who delighted in ridiculing religion politics the arts even democracy itself.
sinclair lewis published a series of savage novels main street 1920 babbitt 1922 arrowsmith 1925 and others in which he lashed out at one aspect of modern bourgeois society after another.
intellectuals of the 1920s claimed to reject the success ethic they believed dominated american life.
the novelist f scott fitzgerald for example attacked the american obsession with material success in the great gatsby 1925.
the roster of important american writers active in the 1920s may have no equal in any other period.
it included fitzgerald lewis ernest hemingway thomas wolfe john dos passos ezra pound t s eliot gertrude stein edna ferber william faulkner and eugene oneill and a remarkable group of african american artists.
in new york city a new generation of black intellectuals created a flourishing artistic life widely described as the harlem harlem renaissance renaissance the harlem poets novelists and artists drew heavily from their african roots in an effort to prove the richness of their own racial heritage and assert resistance against white racism and stereotyping.
the ethos was captured in a single sentence by the poet langston hughes i am a negro and beautiful other black writers in harlem and elsewhere james weldon johnson countee cullen zora neale hurston claude mckay alain locke as well as black artists and musicians helped establish a thriving and at times highly politicized culture.
a conflict of cultures the modern secular culture of the 1920s did not go unchallenged.
it grew up alongside an older more traditional culture with which it continually and often bitterly competed.
prohibition when the prohibition of the sale and manufacture of alcohol went into effect in january 1920 it had the support of most members of the middle class and most of those who considered themselves progressives.
within a year however it had become clear that the failure of prohibition noble experiment as its defenders called it was not working well.
at first prohibition did substantially reduce drinking in most parts of the country.
but it also produced conspicuous and growing violations.
before long it was almost as easy to acquire illegal alcohol in many parts of the country as it had once been to acquire legal alcohol.
and since an enormous lucrative industry was now barred to legitimate businessmen organized crime took it over.
many middle class progressives who had originally supported prohibition soon soured on the experiment.
but a large constituency of provincial largely rural protestant americans continued vehemently to defend it.
to them prohibition represented the effort of an older the new era 557 america to protect traditional notions of morality.
drinking which they associated with the modern city and catholic immigrants became a symbol of the new culture they believed was displacing them.
as the decade proceeded opponents of prohibition or wets gained steadily in influence.
not until 1933 however when the great depression added weight to their appeals were they finally able to challenge the drys effectively and win repeal of the eighteenth amendment.
nativism and the klan agitation for a curb on foreign immigration had begun in the nineteenth century and as with prohibition had gathered strength in the years before the war largely because of the support of middle class progressives.
in the years immediately following the war as immigrations association with radicalism intensified and migration from europe resumed popular sentiment on behalf of restriction grew rapidly.
in 1921 congress passed an emergency immigration act establishing a quota system by which annual immigration from any country could not exceed 3 percent of the number of persons of that nationality who had been in the united states in 1910.
the new law cut immigration from 800 000 to 300 000 in any single year but the nativists remained unsatisfied.
the national origins act of 1924 banned immigration from national origins act of 1924 east asia entirely and reduced the quota for europeans from 3 to 2 percent.
the quota would be based moreover not on the 1910 statistics but on the census of 1890 a year in which there had been far fewer southern and eastern europeans in the country.
what new immigration there was in other words would heavily favor northwestern europeans.
five years later a further restriction set a rigid limit of 150 000 immigrants a year.
in the years that followed immigration officials seldom permitted even half that number actually to enter the country.
to defenders of an older more provincial america the growth of large communities of foreign peoples alien in speech habits and values came to seem a direct threat to their own embattled way of life.
among other things this provincial nativism helped instigate the rebirth of the ku klux klan as a major force in american society.
the first klan founded during reconstruction had died in the 1870s.
but in 1915 a new group of white southerners met on stone mountain near atlanta and established rise of the new klan a modern version of the society.
nativist passions had swelled in georgia and elsewhere in response to the case of leo frank a jewish factory manager in atlanta convicted in 1914 on very flimsy evidence of murdering a female employee a mob stormed franks jail and lynched him.
the premiere also in atlanta of d w griffiths film the birth of a nation which glorified the early klan also helped inspire white southerners to form a new one.
at first the new klan like the old was largely concerned with intimidating blacks.
after world war i however concern about blacks gradually became secondary to concern about catholics jews and foreigners.
at that point membership in the klan expanded rapidly and dramatically not just in the small towns and rural areas of the south but in industrial cities in the north and midwest as well.
by 1924 there were reportedly 4 million members including many women organized in separate parallel units.
the largest state klan was not in the south but in indiana.
beginning in 1925 a series of scandals involving the organizations leaders precipitated a slow but steady decline in the klans influence.
558 chapter 22 most klan units or klaverns tried to present their members as patriots and defenders of morality and some did nothing more menacing than stage occasional parades and rallies.
often however the klan also operated as a brutal even violent opponent of alien groups.
klansmen systematically terrorized blacks jews catholics and foreigners.
at times they engaged in public whipping tarring and feathering arson and lynching.
what the klan feared however was not simply foreign or racially impure groups but anyone who posed a challenge to traditional values.
religious fundamentalism another cultural controversy of the 1920s involved the place of religion in contemporary society.
by 1921 american protestantism was already divided into two warring camps.
on one side stood the modernists mostly urban middle class people who were attempting to adapt religion to the teachings of modern science and to the realities of their modern secular society.
fundamentalists and modernists on the other side stood the fundamentalists provincial largely although far from exclusively rural men and women fighting to preserve traditional faith and to maintain the centrality of religion in american life.
the fundamentalists insisted the bible was to be interpreted literally.
above all they opposed the teachings of charles darwin whose theory of evolution had openly challenged the biblical story of the creation.
by the mid 1920s to the great alarm of modernists fundamentalist demands to forbid the teaching of evolution in public schools were gaining political strength in some states.
in tennessee in march 1925 the legislature adopted a measure making it illegal for any public school teacher to teach any theory that denies the story of the divine creation of man as taught in the bible the tennessee law caught the attention of the fledgling american civil liberties union aclu founded in 1917 to defend pacifists radicals and conscientious objectors during world war i.
the aclu offered free counsel to any tennessee educator willing to defy the law and become the defendant in a test case.
a twenty four year old biology teacher scopes trial in the town of dayton john t scopes agreed to have himself arrested.
and when the aclu decided to send the famous attorney clarence darrow to defend scopes the aging william jennings bryan now an important fundamentalist spokesman announced that he would travel to dayton to assist the prosecution.
journalists from across the country flocked to tennessee to cover the trial.
scopes had of course clearly and deliberately violated the law and a verdict of guilty was a foregone conclusion especially when the judge refused to permit expert testimony by evolution scholars.
scopes was fined 100 and the case was ultimately dismissed in a higher court because of a technicality.
nevertheless darrow scored an important victory for the modernists by calling bryan himself to the stand to testify as an expert on the bible in the course of the crossexamination which was broadcast by radio to much of the nation darrow made bryans defense of biblical truths appear stubborn and foolish and finally maneuvered bryan into admitting the possibility that not all religious dogma was subject to only one interpretation.
the scopes trial put fundamentalists on the defensive.
it discouraged many of them from participating openly in politics.
but it did not resolve the conflict between fundamentalists and modernists which continued to smolder.
the democrats ordeal the anguish of provincial americans attempting to defend an embattled way of life proved particularly troubling to the democratic party during the 1920s.
more than the the new era 559 republicans the democrats consisted of a diverse coalition of interest groups including prohibitionists klansmen and fundamentalists on one side and catholics urban workers and immigrants on the other.
at the 1924 democratic national convention in new york city a bitter conflict broke out over the platform when the partys urban wing attempted to win approval of planks calling for the repeal of prohibition and a denunciation of the klan.
both planks narrowly failed.
the effort to condemn the klan by name failed by one vote out of 1 085.
even more damaging to the party was a deadlock in the balloting for a presidential candidate.
urban democrats supported alfred e smith the irish catholic governor divided democrats of new york rural democrats backed william mcadoo woodrow wilsons treasury secretary who had skillfully positioned himself to win the support of southern and western delegates suspicious of modern urban life but whose reputation had been tarnished by a series of scandals resulting from his work as an attorney for an unsavory oil tycoon.
for 103 ballots the convention dragged on with smith supporters chanting no oil on al until finally both smith and mcadoo withdrew.
the party settled on a compromise the corporate lawyer john w davis who lost decisively to calvin coolidge.
a similar schism plagued the democrats again in 1928 when al smith finally secured his partys nomination for president.
he was not however able to unite his divided party in part because of widespread anti catholic sentiment especially in the south.
he was the first democrat since the civil war not to carry the entire south.
elsewhere he carried no states at all except massachusetts and rhode island.
smiths opponent and the victor in the presidential election was a man who perhaps more than any other personified the modern prosperous middle class society of the new era herbert hoover.
republican government for twelve years beginning in 1921 both the presidency and the congress rested in the hands of the republican party.
for most of those years the federal government enjoyed a warm and supportive relationship with the american business community.
yet the government of the new era was more than the passive pliant instrument that critics often described.
it attempted to serve in many respects as an agent of economic change.
harding and coolidge nothing seemed more clearly to illustrate the unadventurous nature of 1920s politics than the characters of the two men who served as president during most of the decade warren g harding and calvin coolidge.
harding who was elected to the presidency in 1920 was an undistinguished senator from ohio.
he had received the republican presidential nomination as a result of an agreement among leaders of his party who considered him as one noted a good second rater harding appointed distinguished men to some important warren harding cabinet offices and he attempted to stabilize the nations troubled foreign policy.
but he seemed baffled by his responsibilities as if he recognized his own unfitness.
i am a man of limited talents from a small town he reportedly told friends on one occasion.
i dont seem to grasp that i am president hardings intellectual limits were compounded by personal weaknesses his penchant for gambling illegal alcohol and attractive women.
560 chapter 22 harding lacked the strength to abandon the party hacks who had helped create his political success.
one of them ohio party boss harry daugherty he appointed attorney general.
another new mexico senator albert b.
fall he made secretary of the interior.
members of the so called ohio gang filled important offices throughout the administration.
unknown to the public daugherty fall and others were engaged in fraud and corruption.
teapot dome scandal the most spectacular scandal involved the rich naval oil reserves at teapot dome wyoming and elk hills california.
at the urging of fall harding transferred control of those reserves from the navy department to the interior department.
fall then secretly leased them to two wealthy businessmen and received in return nearly half a million dollars in loans to ease his private financial troubles.
fall was ultimately convicted of bribery and sentenced to a year in prison harry daugherty barely avoided a similar fate for his part in another scandal.
in the summer of 1923 only months before senate investigations and press revelations brought the scandals to light a tired and depressed harding left washington for a speaking tour in the west.
in seattle late in july he complained of severe pain which his doctors wrongly diagnosed as food poisoning.
a few days later in san francisco he died.
he had suffered two major heart attacks.
in many ways calvin coolidge who succeeded harding in the presidency was utterly different from his predecessor.
where harding was genial garrulous and debauched coolidge was dour silent even puritanical.
in other ways however harding and coolidge were similar figures.
both took essentially passive approaches to their office.
elected governor of massachusetts in 1919 coolidge had won national attention with calvin coolidge his tough if laconic response to the boston police strike that year.
that was enough to make him his partys vice presidential nominee in 1920.
three years later after hardings death he took the oath of office from his father a justice of the peace by the light of a kerosene lamp.
if anything coolidge was even less active as president than harding partly as a result of his conviction that government should interfere as little as possible in the life of the nation.
in 1924 he received his partys presidential nomination virtually unopposed.
running against john w davis he won a comfortable victory 54 percent of the popular vote and 382 of the 531 electoral votes.
coolidge probably could have won renomination and reelection in 1928.
instead in characteristically understated fashion he walked into a press room one day and handed each reporter a slip of paper containing a single sentence i do not choose to run for president in 1928 government and business however passive the new era presidents may have been much of the federal government worked effectively and efficiently during the 1920s to adapt public policy to the widely accepted goal of the time helping business and industry to operate with maximum efficiency and productivity.
the close relationship between the private sector and the federal government forged during world war i continued.
secretary of the treasury andrew mellon a sharp tax reductions wealthy steel and aluminum tycoon worked to achieve substantial reductions in taxes on corporate profits personal incomes and inheritances.
largely because of his efforts congress cut them all by more than half.
mellon also worked closely with president coolidge after 1924 on a series of measures to trim dramatically the already modest federal budget even managing to retire half the nations world war i debt.
the new era 561 the most prominent member of the cabinet was commerce secretary herbert hoover.
during his eight years in the commerce department hoover constantly encouraged voluntary cooperation in the private sector as the best avenue to stability.
but the idea of voluntarism did not require that the government remain passive on the contrary public institutions hoover believed had a duty to play an active role in creating the new cooperative order.
above all hoover became the champion of the concept of business associationalism a concept that envisioned the creation of national organizations of businessmen in particular industries.
through these trade associations associationalism private entrepreneurs could hoover believed study and stabilize their industries and promote efficiency in production and marketing.
many progressives derived encouragement from the election of herbert hoover to the presidency in 1928.
hoover easily defeated al smith the democratic herbert hoover candidate.
and he entered office promising bold new efforts to solve the nations remaining economic problems.
but hoover had few opportunities to prove himself.
less than a year after his inauguration the nation plunged into the severest and most prolonged economic crisis in its history a crisis that brought many of the optimistic assumptions of the new era crashing down and launched the nation into a period of unprecedented social innovation and reform.

herbert hoover won over 58 percent of the popular vote to alfred smiths 41 percent.
smith carried only massachusetts rhode island and some traditionally democratic states in the south.
why did smith do so poorly even in some parts of the south.
562 chapter 22 conclusion the remarkable prosperity of the 1920s shaped much of what exuberant contemporaries liked to call the new era in the years after world war i america built a vibrant and extensive national culture.
its middle class moved increasingly into the embrace of the growing consumer culture.
politics were reorganized around the needs of a booming interdependent industrial economy rejecting many of the reform crusades of the previous generation but also creating new institutions to help promote economic growth and stability.
beneath the glittering surface of the new era however were great controversies and injustices.
although the prosperity of the 1920s was more widely spread than at any time in the nations industrial history more than half the population failed to achieve any real benefits from the growth.
a new optimistic secular culture attracted millions of urban middle class people.
but many other americans looked at it with alarm and fought against it with great fervor.
the unprepossessing conservative presidents of the era suggested a time of stability but in fact few eras in modern american history have seen so much political and cultural conflict.
the 1920s ended in a catastrophic economic crash that has colored the image of those years ever since.
the crises of the 1930s should not obscure the real achievements of the new era economy.
neither however should the prosperity of the 1920s obscure the inequity and instability in those years that helped produce the difficult years to come.

in february 1928 stock prices began a steady ascent that continued with only a few temporary lapses for a year and a half.
between may 1928 and september 1929 the average price of stocks rose over 40 percent.
trading mushroomed from 2 or 3 million shares a day to over 5 million and at times to as many as 10 or 12 million.
in short a widespread speculative fever grew steadily more intense particularly once brokerage firms began encouraging the mania by offering absurdly easy credit to those buying stocks.
the great crash in the autumn of 1929 the market began to fall apart.
on october 29 black tuesday after a week of growing instability all efforts to save the market failed.
sixteen million shares of stock were traded the industrial index dropped 43 points or nearly 10 percent wiping out all the gains of the previous year stocks in many companies became virtually worthless.
within a month stocks had lost half their september value and despite occasional short lived rallies they continued to decline for several years after that.
popular folklore has established the stock market crash as the beginning and even the cause of the great depression.
although october 1929 might have been the most visible early sign of the crisis the depression had earlier beginnings and other causes.
the great depression 565 causes of the depression economists and historians have argued for decades about the causes of the great depression.
but most agree on several things.
they agree first that what is remarkable about the crisis is not that it occurred but that it was so severe and that it lasted so long which most observers agree even if they agree on little else was the result of several factors.
one was a lack of diversification in the american economy in the 1920s.
prosperity had depended excessively on a few basic industries notably construction and automobiles which in the late 1920s began to decline.
expenditures on weaknesses in the u s economy construction fell from 11 billion in 1926 to under 9 billion in 1929.
automobile sales fell by more than a third in the first nine months of 1929.
newer industries were emerging to take up the slack among them petroleum chemicals electronics and plastics but none had yet developed enough strength to compensate for this decline.
a second important factor was the maldistribution of purchasing power and as a result a weakness in consumer demand.
as industrial and agricultural production increased the proportion of the profits going to potential consumers was too small to create an adequate market for the goods the economy was producing.
even in 1929 after nearly a decade of economic growth more than half the families in america lived on the edge of or below the minimum subsistence level.
a third major problem was the credit structure of the economy.
farmers were deeply in debt and crop prices were too low to allow them to pay off what they owed.
small banks were in constant trouble as their customers defaulted on loans large banks were in trouble too.
although most american bankers were very conservative some of the nations biggest banks were investing recklessly in the stock market or making unwise loans.
when the market crashed and the loans went bad some banks failed and others made the crisis worse by contracting already scarce credit and calling in loans that borrowers could not pay.
a fourth factor was americas position in international trade.
late in the 1920s european demand for american goods began to decline partly because global factors european industry and agriculture were becoming more productive and partly because some european nations were having financial difficulties of their own.
but it was also because the european economy was being destabilized by the international debt structure that had emerged in the aftermath of world war i.
this debt structure therefore was a fifth factor contributing to the depression.
when the war came to an end in 1918 all the european nations that had been allied with the united states owed large sums of money to american banks sums much too large to be repaid out of their shattered economies which is partly why the allies had insisted on reparation payments from germany and austria.
reparations they believed would provide them with a way to pay off their own debts.
but germany and austria were no more able to pay the reparations than the allies were able to pay their debts.
the american government refused to forgive or reduce the debts.
instead american banks began making large loans to european governments which used them to pay off their earlier loans.
thus debts and reparations were being paid only by piling up new and greater debts.
at the same time american protective tariffs were making it difficult for europeans to sell their goods in american markets.
without any source of foreign exchange with which to repay their loans they began to default.
the collapse of the international credit structure was one of the reasons the depression spread to europe after 1931.
see america in the world the global depression america in the world the global depression the great depression began in the united states.
but it did not end there.
the american economy was the largest in the world and its collapse sent shock waves across the globe.
by 1931 the american depression had become a world depression with important implications for the course of global history.
the origins of the worldwide depression lay in the pattern of debts that had emerged during and after world war i when the united states loaned billions of dollars to european nations.
in 1931 with american banks staggering and in many cases collapsing large banks in new york began desperately calling in their loans from germany and austria.
that precipitated the collapse of one of austrias largest banks which in turn created panic through much of central europe.
the economic collapse in germany and austria meant that those nations could not continue paying reparations to britain and france required by the treaty of versailles of 1919 which meant in turn that britain and france could not continue paying off their loans to the united states.
this spreading financial crisis was accompanied by a dramatic contraction of international trade precipitated in part by the hawley smoot tariff in the united states which established the highest import duties in history and stifled much global commerce.
depressed agricultural prices a result of worldwide overproduction also contributed to the downturn.
by 1932 worldwide industrial production had declined by more than one third and world trade had plummeted by nearly two thirds.
by 1933 30 million people in industrial nations were unemployed five times the number of four years before.
but the depression was not confined to industrial nations.

hulton archive getty images looking for work in london 1935 i ndustrialization had drawn almost all regions of the world into the international industrial economy.
colonies and nations in africa asia and south america critically dependent on exporting raw materials and agricultural goods to industrial countries experienced a collapse in demand for their products and thus rising levels of poverty and unemployment.
some nations among them the soviet union and china remained relatively unconnected to the global economy and suffered relatively little from the great depression.
but in most parts of the world the depression caused tremendous social and economic hardship.
it also created political turmoil.
among the countries hardest hit by the depression was germany where industrial production declined by 50 percent and unemployment reached 35 percent in the early 1930s.
the desperate economic conditions there contributed greatly to the rise of the nazi party and its leader adolf hitler who became chancellor in 1933.
japan suffered as well dependent as it was on world trade to sustain its growing industrial economy and purchase essential commodities for its needs at home.
and in japan as in germany economic troubles produced political turmoil and aided the rise of a new militaristic regime.
in italy the fascist government of benito mussolini which had first taken power in the 1920s also saw militarization and territorial expansion as a way out of economic difficulties.
in other nations governments sought solutions to the depression through reform of their domestic economies.
the most prominent example was the new deal in the united states.
but there were important experiments in other nations as well.
among the most common responses to the depression around the world was substantial government investment in public works such as roads bridges dams public buildings and other large projects.
among the nations that adopted this approach in addition to the united states were britain france germany italy and the soviet union.
another response was the expansion of government funded relief for the unemployed.
all the industrial countries of the world experimented with various forms of relief often borrowing ideas from one another in the process.
and the depression helped create new approaches to economics in the face of the apparent failure of classical models of economic behavior to explain or provide solutions to the crisis.
the great british economist john maynard keynes revolutionized economic thought in much of the world.
his 1936 book the general theory of employment interest and money despite its bland title created a sensation by arguing that the depression was a result not of declining production but of inadequate consumer demand.
governments he said could stimulate their economies by increasing the money supply and creating investment through a combination of lowering interest rates and public spending.
keynesianism as keyness theories became known began to have an impact in the united states in 1938 and in much of the rest of the world in subsequent years.
the great depression was an important turning point not only in american history but also in the history of the twentieth century world.
it transformed ideas of public policy and economics in many nations.
it toppled old regimes and created new ones.
and perhaps above all it was a major factor in the coming of world war ii.

how did the governments of european nations respond to the depression.
what effect did the global depression have on economic theory.
why was keyness economic theory so revolutionary.
progress of the depression the stock market crash of 1929 did not so much cause the depression then as help trigger a chain of events that exposed larger weaknesses in the american economy.
during the next three years the crisis grew steadily worse.
the most serious problem at first was the collapse of much of the banking system.
between 1930 and 1933 over 9 000 american banks either went bankrupt or closed their doors to avoid bankruptcy.
partly as a result of these banking closures the nations money 567.

one response to the problems of such communities borrowed from england was the settlement house the most famous was jane addams and hull house hull house which opened in 1889 in chicago as a result of the efforts of the social worker jane addams.
it became a model for more than 400 similar institutions throughout the nation.
staffed by members of the educated middle class settlement houses sought to help immigrant families adapt to the language and customs of their new country.
young college women mostly unmarried were important participants in the settlement house movement.
working in a settlement house a protected site that served mostly women was consistent with the widespread assumption that women needed to be sheltered from difficult environments.
the clean and well tended buildings that settlement houses created were not only a model for immigrant women but an appropriate site for elite women as well.
the settlement houses also helped create another important institution of reform the profession of social work.
a growing number of programs for the professional training of social workers began to appear in the nations leading universities partly in response to the activities of the settlement houses.
the allure of expertise as the emergence of the social work profession suggests progressives involved in humanitarian efforts placed a high value on knowledge and expertise.
even nonscientific problems they believed could be analyzed and solved scientifically.
many reformers came to believe that only enlightened experts and well designed bureaucracies could create the stability and order america needed.
some even spoke of the creation of a new civilization in which the expertise of scientists and engineers could be brought to bear on the problems of the economy and society.
the social scientist thorstein veblen for example proposed a new economic system in which power would reside in the hands of highly trained engineers.
only they he argued could fully understand the machine process by which modern society must be governed.
the professions the late nineteenth century saw a dramatic expansion in the number of americans engaged in administrative and professional tasks.
industries needed managers technicians and accountants as well as workers.
cities required commercial medical legal and educational services.
new technology required scientists and engineers who in turn required institutions and instructors to train them.
by the turn of the century those performing these services had come to constitute a distinct social group what some historians have called a new middle class by the early twentieth century millions within this new middle class were building organizations and establishing standards to secure their position in society.
most of all they created the modern organized professions.
the idea of professionalism had been a frail one in america even as late as 1880 but as the demand for professional services increased so did the pressures for reform.
among the first to respond was the medical profession.
in 1901 doctors who considamerican medical association ered themselves trained professionals reorganized the american medical association ama into a national professional society.
by 1920 nearly two thirds the progressives 493 of all american doctors were members.
the ama quickly called for strict scientific standards for admission to the practice of medicine.
state governments responded by passing new laws requiring the licensing of all physicians.
by 1900 medical education at a few medical schools notably johns hopkins in baltimore founded in 1893 compared favorably with those in the leading institutions of europe.
by 1916 lawyers in all forty eight states had established professional bar associations.
the nations law schools accordingly expanded greatly.
businessmen supported the creation of schools of business administration and set up their own national organizations the national association of manufacturers in 1895 and national association of manufacturers the united states chamber of commerce in 1912.
farmers responded to the new order by forming through the national farm bureau federation a network of agricultural organizations designed to spread scientific farming methods.
the professions removed the untrained and incompetent.
but the admission requirements also protected those already in the professions from excessive competition and lent prestige and status to the professional level.
some professions used their entrance requirements to exclude african americans women immigrants and other undesirables from their ranks.
others used them simply to keep the numbers down to ensure that demand would remain high.
women and the professions american women found themselves excluded from most of the emerging professions.
but a substantial number of middle class women particularly those emerging from the new womens colleges and from the coeducational state universities entered professional careers nevertheless.
a few women managed to establish themselves as physicians lawyers engineers scientists and corporate managers.
most however turned by necessity to those professional outlets that society considered suitable for women settlement houses social work and most important teaching.
indeed in the late nineteenth century perhaps 90 percent of all professional women were teachers.
for educated black women in particular the existence of segregated schools in the south created a substantial market for african american teachers.
women also dominated other professional activities.
nursing had become primarily a womens field during and after the civil war.
by the early twentieth century it was adopting professional standards.
and many women entered academia often earning advanced degrees at such predominantly male institutions as the university of chicago mit or columbia and then finding professional opportunities in the new and expanding womens colleges.
women and reform the prominence of women in reform movements is one of the most striking features of progressivism.
in many states in the early twentieth century women could not vote.
they almost never held public office.
they had footholds in only a few and usually primarily female professions and lived in a culture in which most people male and female believed that women were not suited for the public world.
what then explains the prominent role so many women played in the reform activities of the period.
494 chapter 20 the new woman the phenomenon of the new woman was a product of social and economic changes in both the private and public spheres.
by the end of the nineteenth century almost all income producing activity had moved out of the home and into the factory or the office.
at the same time many women were having fewer children and their children were beginning school at earlier ages and spending more time there.
for wives and mothers who did not work for wages the home was less of an all consuming place.
hence more and more women began looking for activities outside the home.
some educated women shunned marriage entirely believing that only by remaining single could they play the roles they envisioned in the public world.
single women were among the most prominent reformers of the time.
some of these women lived alone.
others lived with other women often in long term relationships some of them secretly romantic that were known at the time as boston marriages the divorce rate also rose rapidly in the late nineteenth century from one divorce for every twenty one marriages in 1880 to one in nine by 1916 women initiated the majority of divorces.
the clubwomen among the most visible signs of the increasing public roles of women in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were womens clubs which proliferated rapidly beginning in the 1880s and 1890s and became the vanguard of many important reforms.
the womens clubs began largely as cultural organizations to provide middle and upper class women with an outlet for their intellectual energies.
in 1892 when women formed the general federation of womens clubs there were more than 100 000 members in nearly 500 clubs.
by 1917 there were over 1 million members.
much of what the clubs did was uncontroversial planting trees supporting schools libraries and settlement houses building hospitals and parks.
but clubwomen were also an important force in winning passage of state and ultimately federal laws that regulated the conditions of woman and child labor.
they pushed government to inspect workplaces regulate the food and drug industries reform policies toward the indian tribes apply new standards to urban housing and perhaps most notably outlaw the manufacture and sale clubwomens causes of alcohol.
womens clubs were instrumental in pressuring state legislatures in most states to provide mothers pensions to widowed or abandoned mothers with small children a system that ultimately became absorbed into the social security system.
in 1912 they convinced congress to establish the childrens bureau in the labor department an agency directed to develop policies to protect children.
in many of these efforts the clubwomen formed alliances with other womens groups such as the womens trade union league wtul founded in 1903 by female union members and upper class reformers and committed to persuading women to join unions.
in addition to working on behalf of protective legislation for women wtul members held public meetings on behalf of female workers raised money to support strikes marched on picket lines and bailed striking women out of jail.
black women occasionally joined clubs dominated by whites.
but most clubs excluded blacks and so african americans formed clubs of their own.
some of them affiliated with the general federation but most became part of the independent national association of colored women.
some black clubs also took positions on issues of particular concern to african americans such as lynching and aspects of segregation.
the progressives 495 suffrage pageant on march 3 1913 the day before woodrow wilsons presidential inauguration more than 5 000 supporters of woman suffrage staged a parade in washington d c that overshadowed wilsons arrival in the capital.
crowds estimated at over half a million watched the parade some of the onlookers attacked the marchers.
in this photograph from the event suffragist florence noyce poses as liberty in front of the u s treasury building.
the library of congress woman suffrage perhaps the largest single reform movement of the progressive era indeed one of the largest in american history was the fight for woman suffrage.
throughout the late nineteenth century many suffrage advocates argued that natural rights entitled them to the same rights as men including first and foremost the right to vote.
elizabeth cady stanton for example wrote in 1892 of woman as the arbiter of her own destiny.
if we are to consider her as a citizen as a member of a great nation she must have the same rights as all other members this was an argument that challenged the views of the many men and women who believed that society required a distinctive female sphere in which women would serve first and foremost as wives and mothers.
a powerful antisuffrage movement emerged dominated by men but with the active support of many women.
to these critics woman suffrage seemed a radical demand.
in the first years of the twentieth century suffragists were becoming better organized and more politically sophisticated than their opponents.
under the leadership of anna howard shaw a boston social worker and carrie chapman catt a journalist from iowa membership in the national american woman suffrage association nawsa grew from about 13 000 in 1893 to over 2 million in 1917.
the movement gained strength because many of its most prominent leaders began to justify suffrage in safer less threatening ways.
suffrage some supporters began to argue would not challenge the separate sphere in which women resided.
instead they claimed that because women occupied a distinct sphere because as mothers and wives and homemakers they had special experiences and 496 chapter 20 special sensitivities to bring to public life woman suffrage would make an important contribution to politics.
in particular many suffragists argued that enfranchising women would help the temperance movement by giving its largest group of supporters a political voice.
some suffrage advocates claimed that once women had the vote war would become a thing of the past since women would by their calming maternal influence help curb the belligerence of men.
the principal triumphs of the suffrage movement began in 1910 when washington became the first state in fourteen years to extend suffrage to women.
california followed a year later and four other western states in 1912.
in 1913 illinois became the first state east of the mississippi to embrace woman suffrage.
and in 1917 and 1918 new york and michigan two of the most populous states in the union gave women the vote.
by 1919 thirty nine states had granted women the right to vote in at least some elections fifteen had allowed them full participation.
in 1920 finally suffragists won nineteenth amendment ratification of the nineteenth amendment which guaranteed voting rights to women throughout the nation.
to some feminists however the victory seemed less than complete.
alice paul head alice paul of the militant national womans party founded in 1916 never accepted the relatively conservative separate sphere justification for suffrage.
she argued that the nineteenth amendment alone would not be sufficient to protect womens rights.
women needed more a constitutional amendment that would provide full legal protection for their rights and would prohibit all discrimination on the basis of gender.
but alice pauls argument found limited favor even among many of the most important leaders of the recently triumphant suffrage crusade.
the assault on the parties sooner or later most progressive goals required the involvement of government.
only government reformers agreed could effectively counter the many powerful private interests that threatened the nation.
but american government at the dawn of the new century was poorly adapted to meet progressive demands.
before progressives could reform reforming government society effectively they would have to reform government itself.
many reformers believed the first step must be an assault on the dominant role the political parties played in the life of the state.
early attacks attacks on party dominance had been frequent in the late nineteenth century.
greenbackism and populism for example had been efforts to break the hammerlock with which the republicans and democrats controlled public life.
the independent republicans or mugwumps had attempted to challenge the grip of partisanship.
the early assaults enjoyed some success.
in the 1880s and 1890s for example most states adopted the secret ballot.
prior to that the political parties themselves had printed ballots or tickets with the names of the partys candidates and no others.
they distributed the tickets to their supporters who then simply went to the polls to deposit them new secret ballot in the ballot boxes.
the old system had made it possible for bosses to monitor the voting behavior of their constituents.
the new secret ballot printed by the the progressives 497 government and distributed at the polls to be filled out and deposited in secret helped chip away at the power of the parties over the voters.
municipal reform many progressives believed the impact of party rule was most damaging in the cities.
municipal government therefore became the first target of those working for political reform.
the muckrakers were especially successful in arousing public outrage at corruption and incompetence in city politics.
they struck a responsive chord among a powerful group of urban middle class progressives who set out to destroy the power of city bosses and their entrenched political organizations.
one of the first major successes in municipal reform came in galveston texas where the old city government proved completely unable to deal with the effects of a destructive hurricane in 1900.
capitalizing on public dismay reformers won approval of a new city charter that replaced the mayor and council with an elected nonpartisan commission.
in 1907 des moines iowa adopted its own version of the commission plan and other cities soon followed.
another approach to municipal reform was the city manager plan by which elected officials hired an outside expert often a professionally trained business manager or engineer to take charge of the government.
the city manager would presumably remain city manager plan untainted by the corrupting influence of politics.
by the end of the progressive era almost 400 cities were operating under commissions and another 45 employed city managers.
in most urban areas reformers had to settle for lesser victories.
some cities made the election of mayors nonpartisan so that the parties could not choose the candidates or moved them to years when no presidential or congressional races were in progress to reduce the influence of the large turnouts that party organizations produced.
reformers tried to make city councilors run at large to limit the influence of ward leaders and district bosses.
they tried to strengthen the power of the mayor at the expense of the city council on the assumption that reformers were more likely to succeed in getting a sympathetic mayor elected than they were to win control of the entire council.
statehouse progressivism other progressives turned to state government as an agent for reform.
they looked with particular scorn on state legislatures whose ill paid relatively undistinguished members they believed were generally incompetent often corrupt and totally controlled by party bosses.
reformers began looking for ways to circumvent the boss controlled legislatures by increasing the power of the electorate.
a big victory came in 1913 when the states ratified a constitutional amendment the seventeenth that transferred the right to elect u s senators from the state legislatures to ordinary voters.
two other important changes were proposed by populists in the 1890s the initiative and the referendum.
the initiative allowed reformers to circumvent initiative and referendum state legislatures by submitting new legislation directly to the voters in general elections.
the referendum provided a method by which actions of the legislature could be returned to the electorate for approval.
by 1918 more than twenty states had enacted one or both of these reforms.
the direct primary and the recall were other efforts to limit the power of party and improve the quality of elected officials.
the primary election was direct primary and recall 498 chapter 20 an attempt to remove the selection of candidates from the bosses and give it to the people.
in the south it was also an effort to limit black voting since primary voting many white southerners believed would be easier to control than general elections.
the recall gave voters the right to remove a public official from office at a special election which could be called after a sufficient number of citizens had signed a petition.
by 1915 every state in the nation had instituted primary elections for at least some offices.
the recall encountered more strenuous opposition but a few states such as california adopted it as well.
the most celebrated state level reformer was robert m la follette of wisconsin.
elected robert la follette governor in 1900 he helped turn his state into what reformers across the nation described as a laboratory of progressivism under his leadership wisconsin progressives won approval of direct primaries initiatives and referendums.
they regulated railroads and utilities.
they passed laws to regulate the workplace and provide compensation for laborers injured on the job.
they instituted graduated taxes on inherited fortunes and they nearly doubled state levies on railroads and other corporate interests.
parties and interest groups the reformers did not of course eliminate parties from american political life.
but they did contribute to a decline in party influence.
evidence of their impact came from among other things the decline in voter turnout.
in the late nineteenth century up to 81 percent of eligible voters routinely turned out for national elections.
in the early twentieth century the figure declined markedly.
in the presidential election of 1900 73 percent of the electorate voted.
by 1912 turnout had declined to about 59 percent.
never again has voter turnout reached as high as 70 percent.
why did voter turnout decline in these years.
the secret ballot was one reason.
party bosses had less ability to get voters to the polls.
illiterate voters had trouble reading the new ballots.
party bosses lost much of their authority and were unable to mobilize voters as successfully as they had in the past.
but perhaps the most important decline of party influence reason for the decline of party rule and voter turnout was that other power centers were beginning to replace them.
they have become known as interest groups beginning late in the nineteenth century and accelerating rapidly in the twentieth century new organizations emerged outside the party system professional organizations trade associations representing businesses and industries labor organizations farm lobbies and many others.
social workers the settlement house movements womens clubs and others learned to operate as interest groups to advance their demands without relying on parties.
sources of progressive reform middle class reformers most of them from the east dominated the public image and much of the substance of progressivism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
but they were not alone in seeking to improve social conditions.
workingclass americans african americans westerners and even party bosses played crucial roles in advancing some of the important reforms of the era.
for historians changing views on who the progressives were and what motivated them see debating the past progressivism the progressives 499 labor the machine and reform although the american federation of labor and its leader samuel gompers remained largely aloof from many of the reform efforts of the time some unions nevertheless played important roles in reform battles.
between 1911 and 1913 thanks to political pressure from labor groups such as the newly formed union labor party california passed a child labor law a workmens compensation law and a limitation on working hours for women.
union pressures contributed to the passage of similar laws in many other states as well.
party bosses sometimes allowed their machines to become vehicles of social reform.
one example was new yorks tammany hall the nations oldest and most notorious city machine.
its astute leader charles francis murphy began in the early years of the twentieth century to fuse the techniques of boss rule with some of the concerns of social reformers.
tammany at times used its political power on behalf of legislation to improve working conditions protect child laborers and eliminate the worst abuses of the industrial economy.
in 1911 a terrible fire swept through the factory of the triangle shirtwaist company in new york 146 workers most of them women died.
many of them triangle shirtwaist fire had been trapped inside the burning building because management had locked the emergency exits to prevent malingering.
for the next three years a state commission studied the disaster and the conditions of factories generally.
in 1914 the commission issued a series of reports calling for major reforms in the conditions of modern labor.
the report itself was a classic progressive document based on the testimony of experts and filled victims of the triangle shirtwaist fire 1911 in this bleak photograph victims of the fire in the triangle shirtwaist company are laid out on the sidewalk of the building as police and passersby look up at the scene of the blaze.
this tragedy galvanized new york legislators into passing laws to protect workers.

debating the past progressivism until the early 1950s most historians seemed to agree on the central characteristics of early twentieth century progressivism.
it was just what many progressives themselves had said it was a movement by the people to curb the power of special interests.
more specifically it was a protest by an aroused citizenry against the excessive power of urban bosses corporate moguls and corrupt elected officials.
in 1951 the historian george mowry began challenging these assumptions by examining progressives in california and describing them as a small privileged elite of business and professional figures people who considered themselves the natural leaders of society and who were trying to recover their fading influence from the new capitalist institutions that had displaced them.
progressivism was not in other words a popular democratic movement but the effort of a displaced elite to restore its authority.
richard hofstadter expanded on this idea in the age of reform 1955 by describing reformers as people afflicted by status anxiety fading elites suffering not from economic but from psychological discontent.
the mowry hofstadter argument soon encountered a range of challenges.
gabriel kolko in the triumph of conservatism 1963 rejected both the older democratic view of progressivism and the newer status anxiety view.
progressive reform he argued was not an effort to protect the people from the corporations it was rather a vehicle through which corporate leaders used the government to protect themselves from competition.
a more moderate reinterpretation came from historians embracing what would later 500 be called the organizational approach to twentieth century american history.
samuel hays in the response to industrialism 1957 and robert wiebe in the search for order 1967 portrayed progressivism as a broad effort by businessmen professionals and other middle class people to bring order and efficiency to political and economic life.
in the new industrial society economic power was increasingly concentrated in large national organizations while social and political life remained centered primarily in local communities.
progressivism wiebe argued was the effort of a new middle class a class tied to the emerging national economy to stabilize and enhance its position in society by bringing those two worlds together.
in the 1970s and 1980s much of the scholarship on progressivism focused on discovering new groups among whom progressive ideas and efforts flourished.
historians found evidence of progressivism in the rising movement by consumers to define their interests in the growth of reform movements among african americans in the changing nature of urban political machines and in the political activism of working people and labor organizations.
other scholars attempted to identify progressivism with broad changes in the structure and culture of politics.
richard mccormick writing in 1981 argued that the crucial change in the progressive era was the decline of political parties and the corresponding rise of interest groups working for particular social and economic goals.
at the same time many historians have focused on the role of women and the vast network of voluntary associations they c reated in shaping and promoting progressive reform.
some progressive battles historians such as kathryn sklar ruth rosen elaine tyler may and linda gordon have argued were part of an effort by women to protect their interests within the domestic sphere in the face of jarring challenges from the new industrial world.
this protective urge drew women reformers to such issues as temperance divorce prostitution and the regulation of female and child labor.
other women worked to expand their own roles in the public world particularly through their support of suffrage.
the gendered interests of women reformers are many historians insist critical to an understanding of progressivism.
more recently a number of historians have sought to place progressivism in a broader context.
daniel rodgerss atlantic crossings 1998 is an important study of how european reformers shaped the goals of many american progressives.
both michael mcgerr in a fierce discontent 2003 and alan dawley in changing the world 2003 see progressivism as a fundamentally moral project mcgerr as an effort by the middle class to create order and stability and dawley as an effort by groups on the left to attack social injustice.
progressivism they argue was not just a political movement but also an effort to remake society and reshape social relations.

with statistics and technical data.
when its recommendations reached the new york legislature its most effective supporters were two tammany democrats from working class backgrounds senator robert f wagner and assemblyman alfred e smith.
with the support of murphy and the backing of other tammany legislators they helped pass a series of pioneering labor laws that imposed strict regulations on factory owners and established effective mechanisms for enforcement.
western progressives the american west produced some of the most notable progressive leaders of the time hiram johnson of california george norris of nebraska william borah of idaho and others almost all of whom spent at least some of their political careers in the united states senate.
for western states the most important vehicle of reform was the federal government which exercised a kind of authority in the west that it had never possessed in the east.
disputes over water for example almost always involved rivers and streams that crossed state lines.
more significant perhaps the federal government exercised enormous power over the lands and resources of the western states and provided substantial subsidies to the region in the form of land grants and support for railroad and water projects.
huge areas of the west remained and still remain public lands controlled by washington.
much of the growth of the west was and continues to be a result of federally funded dams water projects and other infrastructure undertakings.
african americans and reform most white progressives paid little attention to race.
but among african americans themselves the progressive era produced significant challenges to existing racial norms.
501 502 chapter 20 african americans faced greater obstacles than any other group in seeking reform.
so it was not surprising perhaps that so many african americans embraced the message of booker t washington in the late nineteenth century.
washington encouraged black men and women to work for immediate self improvement rather than long range social change.
by the beginning of the twentieth century however a powerful challenge to the philosophy of washington was emerging.
the chief spokesperson for this new approach was w e b.
du bois a sociologist and historian and one of the first african americans to receive a degree from harvard.
in the souls of black folk 1903 du bois launched an open attack on the philosophy of washington accusing him of encouraging white efforts to sustain segregation and of limiting the aspirations of his race.
rather than content themselves with education at trade and agricultural schools du bois encouraged talented blacks to accept nothing less than a full university education and aspire to the professions.
they should above all fight for their civil rights not simply wait for them to be granted as a reward for patient striving.
in 1905 du bois and a group of his supporters met at niagara falls on the canadian side of the border because no hotel on the american side of the falls would have them and launched what became known as the niagara movement.
four years later they joined with sympathetic white progressives to form the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp.
in the years that followed the new organizanaacp founded tion worked for equal rights.
among the many issues that engaged the naacp and other african american organizations was lynching in the south.
the most determined opponents of lynching were southern women and the most effective crusader was a black woman ida b wells barnett who worked both on her own at great personal risk and with such ida b wells barnett organizations as the national association of colored women and the womens convention of the national baptist church to try to expose lynching and challenge segregation.
the crisis w e b.
du bois founded the crisis the magazine of the naacp in 1910.
its object was to show the danger of race prejudice particularly as manifested today toward colored people this photograph shows the magazines office.
underwood underwood corbis the progressives 503 crusades for social order and reform many reformers crusaded on behalf of what they considered moral issues working to eliminate alcohol curb prostitution limit divorce and restrict immigration.
the temperance crusade many progressives considered the elimination of alcohol from american life a necessary step in restoring order to society.
scarce wages vanished as male workers spent hours in saloons.
drunkenness spawned violence and occasionally murder within urban families.
many working class wives and mothers hoped through temperance to reform male behavior and thus improve womens lives.
employers too regarded alcohol as an impediment to industrial efficiency workers often missed time on the job because of drunkenness or came to the factory intoxicated.
critics of economic privilege denounced the liquor industry as one of the nations most sinister trusts.
and political reformers who correctly looked on the saloon as one of the central institutions of the urban machine saw an attack on drinking as part of an attack on the bosses.
out of such sentiments emerged the temperance movement.
there had been a major temperance movement before the civil war mobilizing large numbers of people in a crusade with strong evangelical overtones.
in 1873 the movement developed new strength.
temperance advocates formed the womens christian temperance union wctu which was led after 1879 by frances willard.
by 1911 it had 245 000 wctu members and had become the single largest womens organization in american history to that point.
in 1893 the anti saloon league joined the temperance movement and along with the wctu began to press for the legal abolition of saloons.
gradually that demand grew to include the complete prohibition of the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages.
pressure for prohibition grew steadily through the first decades of the new century.
by 1916 nineteen states had passed prohibition laws.
americas entry into world prohibition war i which made the use of grain for alcohol seem wasteful and unnecessary provided the last push to the advocates of prohibition.
in 1917 with the support of rural fundamentalists who opposed alcohol on moral and religious grounds progressive advocates of prohibition steered through congress a constitutional amendment.
two years later after ratification by every state in the nation except connecticut and rhode island with large populations of catholic immigrants opposed to prohibition the eighteenth amendment became law to take effect in january 1920.
immigration restriction virtually all reformers agreed that the growing immigrant population had created social problems but there was wide disagreement on how best to respond.
some progressives believed that the proper approach was to help the new residents adapt to american society.
others argued that the only solution was to limit the flow of new arrivals.
in the first decades of the century pressure grew to close the nations gates.
new scholarly theories argued that the introduction of immigrants into american society was polluting the nations racial stock.
one of these theories eugenics began as the science of altering the reproductive processes of plants and animals to produce new hybrids or breeds.
but in the late nineteenth century eugenicists spread the spurious belief that human inequalities were hereditary and that immigration was contributing to the multiplication of the unfit.
a special federal commission of experts chaired by senator william 504 chapter 20 p dillingham of vermont issued a study filled with statistics and scholarly testimony.
it argued that the newer immigrant groups largely southern and eastern europeans had proved themselves less assimilable than earlier immigrants.
immigration the report implied should be restricted by nationality.
even many people who rejected these racial arguments supported limiting immigration as a way to solve such urban problems as overcrowding unemployment strained social services and social unrest.
the combination of these concerns gradually won the support of some of the nations leading progressives to limit immigration among them former president theodore roosevelt.
powerful opponents employers who saw immigration as a source of cheap labor immigrants themselves and their political representatives managed to block the restriction movement for a time.
but by the beginning of world war i which itself effectively blocked immigration temporarily the nativist tide was gaining strength.
the dream of socialism although never a force to rival or even seriously threaten the two major parties socialism gained considerable strength during the early years of the twentieth century.
in the election of 1900 the socialist party of america attracted the support of fewer than 100 000 voters eugene v debs in 1912 its durable leader and perennial presidential candidate eugene v debs received nearly 1 million ballots.
strongest in urban immigrant communities particularly among germans and jews it also attracted the loyalties of a substantial number of protestant farmers in the south and the midwest.
virtually all socialists agreed on the need for basic structural changes in the economy but they differed widely on the extent of those changes and the tactics necessary to achieve them.
some socialists endorsed the radical goals of european marxists a complete end to capitalism and private property others envisioned more moderate reform that would allow small scale private enterprise to survive but would nationalize major industries.
some believed in working for reform through electoral politics others favored militant direct action.
among the militants was the radical labor union the industrial workers of the world iww wobblies iww known to opponents as the wobblies under the leadership of william big bill haywood the iww advocated a single union for all workers and was one of the few labor organizations to champion the cause of unskilled workers.
the wobblies were widely believed to have been responsible for dynamiting railroad lines and power stations and committing other acts of terror in the first years of the twentieth century.
moderate socialists who advocated peaceful change through political struggle dominated the socialist party.
they emphasized a gradual education of the public to the need for change and patient efforts within the system to enact it.
but the party refused to support the nations war effort in world war i.
the growing wave of antiradicalism during the war subjected the socialists to enormous harassment and persecution contributing to socialisms decline.
decentralization and regulation most progressives retained faith in the possibilities of reform within a capitalist system.
rather than nationalize basic industries many reformers hoped to restore the economy to a more human scale.
they argued that the federal government should work to break up the largest combinations and enforce a balance between the need for bigness and the need for competition.
this viewpoint came to be identified particularly closely with louis d louis brandeis brandeis a brilliant lawyer and later justice of the supreme court who the progressives 505 wrote widely most notably in his 1913 book other peoples money about the curse of bigness brandeis insisted that government must regulate competition in such a way as to ensure that large combinations did not emerge.
other progressives were less enthusiastic about the virtues of competition.
more important to them was efficiency.
government they argued should not fight bigness but rather should guard against abuses of power by large institutions.
it should distinguish between good trusts and bad trusts since economic consolidation was destined to remain a permanent feature of american society continuing oversight by a strong modernized government was essential.
thus many progressives believed that government should play a more active role in regulating and planning economic life.
one of those who came to endorse that position although not fully until after 1910 was theodore roosevelt who once said we should enter upon a course of supervision control and regulation of those great corporations roosevelt became for a time the most powerful symbol of the reform impulse at the national level.
theodore roosevelt and the modern presidency to a generation of progressive reformers theodore roosevelt was more than an admired public figure he was an idol.
no president before and few since attracted such attention and devotion.
yet for all his popularity among reformers roosevelt was in many respects decidedly conservative.
he earned his extraordinary popularity less because of the extent of the reforms he championed than because he brought to his office a broad conception of its powers.
he invested the presidency with something of its modern status as the center of national political life.
the accidental president when president william mckinley was assassinated in september 1901 roosevelt fortytwo years old at the time became the youngest man ever to assume the presidency.
i told william mckinley that it was a mistake to nominate that wild man at philadelphia party boss mark hanna was reported to have exclaimed.
now look that damned cowboy is president of the united states as president roosevelt rarely openly rebelled against the leaders of his party.
he became rather a champion of cautious moderate change.
reform he believed was a vehicle less for remaking american society than for protecting it against more radical challenges.
roosevelt allied himself with those progressives who urged regulation but not destruction of the trusts.
at the heart of his policy was to give the roosevelts vision of federal power government the power to investigate corporations and publicize the results.
although roosevelt was not a trustbuster at heart he made a few highly publicized efforts to break up combinations.
in 1902 he ordered the justice department to invoke the sherman antitrust act against a great new railroad monopoly in the northwest the northern securities company a 400 million enterprise pieced together by j p morgan and others.
roosevelt filed more than forty additional antitrust suits during antitrust suits the remainder of his presidency but he made no serious commitment to reverse the prevailing trend toward economic concentration.
when a bitter 1902 strike by the united mine workers endangered coal supplies for the coming winter roosevelt asked both the operators and the miners to accept impartial federal 506 chapter 20 boys in the mines these young boys covered in grime and no more than twelve years old pose for lewis hine outside the coal mine in pennsylvania where they worked as breaker boys crawling into newly blasted areas and breaking up the loose coal.
the rugged conditions in the mines were one cause of the great strike of 1902 in which theodore roosevelt intervened.

when the mine owners balked roosevelt threatened to send federal troops to seize the mines.
the operators finally relented.
arbitrators awarded the strikers a 10 percent wage increase and a nine hour day although no recognition of their union less than the miners had wanted but more than they would likely have won without roosevelts intervention.
the square deal during the 1904 campaign for the presidency roosevelt boasted that he had worked in the anthracite coal strike to provide everyone with a square deal one of his first targets after winning the election was the powerful railroad industry.
the interstate commerce act of 1887 establishing the interstate commerce commission icc had been an early effort to hepburn act regulate the industry but over the years the courts had sharply limited its influence.
the hepburn railroad regulation act of 1906 sought to restore some regulatory authority to the government by giving the icc the power to oversee railroad rates.
roosevelt also pressured congress to enact the pure food and drug act which pure food and drug act restricted the sale of dangerous or ineffective medicines.
the jungle a powerful novel published by upton sinclair in 1906 included appalling descriptions of conditions in the meatpacking industry.
roosevelt pushed for passage of the meat inspection act which helped eliminate many diseases once transmitted in impure meat.
starting in 1907 he proposed even more stringent reforms an eight hour day for workers broader compensation for victims of industrial accidents inheritance and income taxes and regulation of the stock market.
conservative opposition blocked much of his agenda widening the gulf between the president and the conservative wing of his party.
the progressives 507 roosevelt and the environment roosevelts aggressive policies on behalf of conservation contributed to that gulf.
using executive powers he restricted private development on millions of acres of undeveloped government land most of it in the west by adding them to the previously modest national forest system.
when conservatives in congress restricted his authority over public lands in 1907 roosevelt and his chief forester gifford pinchot seized all the forests and many of the water power sites still in the public domain before the bill became law.
roosevelt was the first president to take an active interest in the new and struggling american conservation movement.
in the early twentieth century many people who considered themselves conservationists including pinchot the first director of the u s forest service which he helped create promoted policies to protect land for carefully managed development.
roosevelt also supported public reclamation and irrigation projects.
in 1902 the president backed the national reclamation act which provided federal funds for the construction of dams reservoirs and canals in the west projects that would open new lands for cultivation and years later provide cheap electric power.
despite his sympathy with pinchots vision of conservation roosevelt also shared some of the concerns of the naturalists those committed to protecting the natural beauty of the land and the health of its wildlife from human intrusion.
early in his presidency roosevelt spent four days camping in the sierras with john muir the nations leading preservationist and the founder of the sierra club.
roosevelt also added significantly to the still young national park system whose purpose was to protect public land from exploitation or development.

note for example how many new areas were added in the 1920s.
what is the difference between national parks and national forests.
co ns ider t he s o urc e john muir on the value of wild places 1901 john muir is often called the father of the national parks for his role as advocate on behalf of legislation to designate certain wilderness areas as off limits for commercial development.
in this excerpt from his book our national parks he argues for the restorative benefits of visiting unspoiled nature.
the tendency nowadays to wander in wildernesses is delightful to see.
thousands of tired nerve shaken over civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home that wildness is a necessity and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers but as fountains of life.
awakening from the stupefying effects of the vice of overindustry and the deadly apathy of luxury they are trying as best they can to mix and enrich their own little ongoings with those of nature and to get rid of rust and disease.
briskly venturing and roaming some are washing off sins and cobweb cares of the devils spinning in all day storms on mountains sauntering in rosiny pinewoods or in gentian meadows brushing through chaparral bending down and parting sweet flowery sprays tracing rivers to their sources getting in touch with the nerves of mother earth jumping from rock to rock feeling the life of them learning the songs of them panting in whole souled exercise and rejoicing in deep long drawn breaths of pure wildness.
this is fine and natural and full of promise.
so also is the growing interest in the care and preservation of forests and wild places in general and in the half wild parks and gardens of towns.
when like a merchant taking a list of his goods we take stock of our wildness we are glad to see how much of even the most destructible kind is still unspoiled.
508 looking at our continent as scenery when it was all wild lying between beautiful seas the starry sky above it the starry rocks beneath it to compare its sides the east and the west would be like comparing the sides of a rainbow.
but it is no longer equally beautiful.
t he continents outer beauty is fast passing away especially the plant part of it the most destructible and most universally charming of all.
only thirty years ago the great central valley of california five hundred miles long and fifty miles wide was one bed of golden and purple flowers.
now it is ploughed and pastured out of existence gone forever scarce a memory of it left in fence corners and along the bluffs of the streams.
the same fate sooner or later is awaiting them all unless awakening public opinion comes forward to stop it.
the grand caon reserve of arizona of nearly two million acres or the most interesting part of it as well as the rainier region should be made into a national park on account of their supreme grandeur and beauty.
no matter how far you have wandered hitherto or how many famous gorges and valleys you have seen this one the grand caon of the colorado will seem as novel to you as unearthly in the color and grandeur and quantity of its architecture as if you had found it after death on some other star so incomparably lovely and grand and supreme is it above all the other caons in our fire moulded earthquake shaken rain washed wave washed river and glacier sculptured world.

the contending views of the early conservation movement came to a head beginning in 1906 in a controversy over the hetch hetchy valley in yosemite fight over hetch hetchy national park a spectacular high walled valley popular with naturalists.
but many residents of san francisco worried about finding enough water to serve their growing population.
they saw hetch hetchy as an ideal place for a dam which would create a large reservoir for the city.
in 1906 san francisco suffered a devastating earthquake and fire.
widespread sympathy for the city strengthened the case for the dam and roosevelt turned the decision over to pinchot who approved its construction.
for over a decade a battle raged between naturalists and the advocates of the dam a battle that consumed the energies of john muir for the rest of his life and that eventually many believed led him to an early death.
to pinchot the needs of the city were more important than the claims of preservation.
muir helped place a referendum question on the ballot in 1908 certain that the residents of the city would oppose the project.
instead san franciscans approved the dam by a huge margin.
construction of the dam finally began after world war i.
this setback for the naturalists was not however a total defeat.
the fight against hetch hetchy helped mobilize a new coalition of people committed to preservation of wilderness.
panic and retirement despite the flurry of reforms roosevelt was able to enact the government still had relatively little control over the industrial economy.
that became clear in 1907 when a serious panic and recession began.
conservatives blamed roosevelts mad economic policies for the disaster.
and while the president naturally and correctly disagreed he nevertheless acted quickly to reassure business leaders that he would not interfere with their recovery efforts.
the financier j p morgan helped construct a pool of the assets of several important new york banks to prop up shaky financial institutions.
the key to the arrangement morgan told the president was a purchase by u s steel of the shares of the tennessee coal and iron company currently held by a threatened new york bank.
morgan insisted that he needed assurances that the purchase would not prompt antitrust action.
roosevelt tacitly agreed and the morgan plan proceeded.
whether or not as a result the panic soon subsided.
roosevelt loved being president and many people assumed that he would run for reelection in 1908 despite the long standing tradition of presidents serving no more than two terms.
but the panic of 1907 and roosevelts reform efforts so alienated conservatives in his own party that he might have had difficulty winning the republican nomination.
in 1904 moreover he had made a public promise to step down four years later.
and so in 1909 roosevelt fifty years old retired from public life briefly.
509 510 chapter 20 the troubled succession william howard taft who assumed the presidency in 1909 had been theodore roosevelts most trusted lieutenant and his handpicked successor progressive reformers believed him to be one of their own.
but taft was also a restrained and moderate jurist a man with a punctilious regard for legal process conservatives expected him to abandon roosevelts aggressive use of presidential powers.
by seeming acceptable to almost everyone taft easily won election to the white house in 1908 over william jennings bryan running for the democrats for the third time.
four years later however taft would leave office the most decisively defeated president of the twentieth century his party deeply divided and the government in the hands of a democratic administration for the first time in twenty years.
william howard taft taft and the progressives tafts first problem arose in the opening months of the new administration when he called congress into special session to lower protective tariff rates an old progressive demand.
but the president made no effort to overcome the opposition of the congressional old guard arguing that to do so would violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.
the result was the feeble payne aldrich tariff which reduced tariff rates scarcely at all.
a sensational controversy that broke out late in 1909 helped destroy tafts popularity with reformers for good.
many progressives had been unhappy when taft replaced roosevelts secretary of the interior james r garfield an aggressive conservationist with richard a ballinger a conservative corporate lawyer.
suspicion of ballinger grew when he attempted to invalidate roosevelts removal of nearly 1 million acres of forests and mineral reserves from private development.
in the midst of this mounting concern louis glavis an interior department investigator charged ballinger with having once connived to turn over valuable public coal lands in alaska to a private syndicate for personal profit.
glavis took the evidence to gifford pinchot still director of the u s forest service and a critic of ballinger pinchot dispute ballingers policies.
pinchot took the charges to the president.
taft investigated them and decided they were groundless.
unsatisfied pinchot leaked the story to the press and asked congress to investigate the scandal.
the president discharged him for insubordination and the congressional committee appointed to study the controversy dominated by old guard republicans exonerated ballinger.
but progressives throughout the country supported pinchot.
the controversy aroused as much public passion as any dispute of its time.
by the time it was over taft had alienated the supporters of roosevelt completely and it seemed irrevocably.
the return of roosevelt during most of these controversies theodore roosevelt was out of the country on a long hunting safari in africa and an extended tour of europe.
to the american public however roosevelt remained a formidable presence.
his return to new york in the spring of 1910 was a major public event.
roosevelt insisted that he had no plans to reenter politics but within a month he announced that he would embark on a national speaking tour before the progressives 511 roosevelt at osawatomie roosevelts speech at osawatomie kansas in 1910 was the most radical of his career and openly marked his break with the taft administration and the republican leadership.
the essence of any struggle for liberty he told his largely conservative audience has always been and must always be to take from some one man or class of men the right to enjoy power or wealth or position or immunity which has not been earned by service to his or their fellows granger nyc all rights reserved.
the end of the summer.
furious with taft he was becoming convinced that he alone was capable of reuniting the republican party.
the real signal of roosevelts decision to assume leadership of republican reformers came in a speech he gave on september 1 1910 in osawatomie kansas.
in it he outlined a set of principles which he labeled the new nationalism that made new nationalism clear he had moved a considerable way from the cautious conservatism of the years of his presidency.
he argued that social justice was possible only through a strong federal government whose executive acted as the steward of the public welfare he supported graduated income and inheritance taxes workers compensation for industrial accidents regulation of the labor of women and children tariff revision and firmer regulation of corporations.
spreading insurgency the congressional elections of 1910 provided further evidence of how far the progressive revolt had spread.
in primary elections conservative republicans suffered defeat after defeat while almost all the progressive incumbents were reelected.
in the general election the democrats won control of the house of representatives for the first time in sixteen years and gained strength in the senate.
but roosevelt still denied any 512 chapter 20 presidential ambitions and claimed that his real purpose was to pressure taft to return to progressive policies.
two events however changed his mind.
the first on october 27 1911 was the announcement by the administration of a suit against u s steel which charged among other things that the 1907 acquisition of the tennessee coal and iron company had been illegal.
roosevelt had approved that acquisition in the midst of the 1907 panic and he was enraged by the implication that he had acted improperly.
roosevelt was still reluctant to become a candidate for president because senator robert la follette the great wisconsin progressive had been working since 1911 to secure the presidential nomination for himself.
but la follettes candidacy stumbled in february 1912 when exhausted and distraught over the illness of a daughter he appeared to suffer a nervous breakdown during a speech in philadelphia.
roosevelt announced his candidacy on february 22.
roosevelt versus taft for all practical purposes the campaign for the republican nomination had now become a battle between roosevelt and taft.
roosevelt scored overwhelming victories in all thirteen presidential primaries.
taft however remained the choice of most party leaders who controlled the nominating process.
the battle for the nomination at the chicago convention revolved around an unusually large number of contested delegates 254 in all.
roosevelt needed fewer than half the disputed seats to clinch the nomination.
but the republican national committee controlled by the old guard awarded all but 19 of them to taft.
at a rally the night before the convention opened roosevelt addressed 5 000 cheering supporters.
we stand at armageddon he told the roaring crowd and we battle for the lord the next day he led his supporters out of the convention and out of the party.
the convention then quietly nominated taft on the first ballot.
roosevelt summoned his supporters back to chicago in august for another convention this one to launch the new progressive party and to nominate himself as its presidential can bull moose party didate.
roosevelt approached the battle feeling as he put it fit as a bull moose thus giving his new party an enduring nickname.
but roosevelt was also aware that his cause was almost hopeless partly because many of the insurgents who had supported him during the primaries refused to follow him out of the republican party.
it was also because of the man the democrats had nominated for president.
woodrow wilson and the new freedom the 1912 presidential contest was not simply one between conservatives and reformers.
it was also one between two brands of progressivism.
and it matched the two most important national leaders of the early twentieth century in an unequal contest.
woodrow wilson reform sentiment had been gaining strength within the democratic party as well as the republican party in the first years of the century.
at the june 1912 democratic convention in baltimore champ clark the conservative speaker of the house was the progressives 513 unable to assemble the two thirds majority necessary for nomination because of progressive opposition.
finally on the forty sixth ballot woodrow wilson the governor of new jersey and the only genuinely progressive candidate in the race emerged as the partys nominee.
wilson had been a professor of political science at princeton until 1902 when he was named president of the university.
elected governor of new jersey in 1910 he quickly earned a national reputation for winning passage of progressive legislation.
as a presidential candidate in 1912 wilson presented a progressive program that came to be called the new freedom roosevelts new nationalism supported economic concentration and using government to regulate and control it.
wilsons new freedom wilson seemed to side with those who like louis brandeis believed that bigness was both unjust and inefficient that the proper response to monopoly was not to regulate it but to destroy it.
the 1912 presidential campaign was an anticlimax.
taft resigned to defeat barely campaigned.
roosevelt campaigned energetically until a gunshot wound from a would be assassin forced him to the sidelines during the last weeks before the election but he 29 15 24 10 12 8 12 candidate party electoral vote popular vote woodrow wilson democratic theodore roosevelt progressive bull moose william h taft republican 6 293 454 41 9 eugene v debs socialist other parties prohibition socialist labor 4 119 538 27 4 3 484 980 23 2 900 672 6 0 235 025 58 8 of electorate voting the election of 1912 was one of the most unusual in american history because of the dramatic schism within the republican party.
two republican presidents william howard taft the incumbent and theodore roosevelt his predecessor ran against each other opening the way for a victory by the democratic candidate woodrow wilson who won with only 42 percent of the popular vote.
a fourth candidate the socialist eugene v debs received a significant 6 percent of the vote.
what events caused the schism between taft and roosevelt.
the election of 1912 514 chapter 20 failed to draw any significant number of democratic progressives away from wilson.
in november roosevelt and taft split the republican vote wilson held on to most democrats and won.
he received only 42 percent of the popular vote compared with 27 percent for roosevelt 23 percent for taft and 6 percent for the socialist eugene debs.
but in the electoral college wilson won 435 of the 531 votes.
the scholar as president wilson was a bold and forceful president.
he exerted firm control over his cabinet and he delegated real authority only to those who were loyal to him.
his most powerful adviser colonel edward m house was an intelligent and ambitious texan who held no office and whose only claim to authority was his personal intimacy with the president.
in legislative matters wilson skillfully welded together a coalition that would support his goals.
democratic majorities in both houses of congress made his task easier.
wilsons first triumph as president was the fulfillment of an old democratic and woodrow wilson woodrow wilson the 28th president of the united states was a virginian the first southerner to be elected president since before the civil war a professor of political science and later president of princeton university governor of new jersey and a progressive.
his election to the presidency brought the first democrat to the white house since 1896.
the library of congress the progressives 515 progressive goal a substantial lowering of the protective tariff.
the underwoodsimmons tariff provided cuts significant enough progressives believed to introduce real competition into american markets and thus to help break the power of trusts.
to make up for the loss of revenue under the new tariff congress lowering the tariff approved a graduated income tax which the recently adopted sixteenth amendment to the constitution now permitted.
this first modern income tax imposed a 1 percent tax on individuals and corporations earning more than 4 000 a year with rates ranging up to 6 percent on incomes over 500 000 annually.
wilson held congress in session through the summer to work on a major reform of the american banking system the federal reserve act which banking system reform congress passed and the president signed on december 23 1913.
it created twelve regional banks each to be owned and controlled by the individual banks of its district.
the regional federal reserve banks would hold a certain percentage of the assets of their member banks in reserve they would use those reserves to support loans to private banks at an interest or discount rate that the federal reserve system would set they would issue a new type of paper currency federal reserve notes that would become the nations basic medium of trade and would be backed by the government.
most important they would be able to shift funds quickly to troubled areas to meet increased demands for credit or to protect imperiled banks.
supervising and regulating the entire system was a national federal reserve board whose members were appointed by the president.
in 1914 turning to the central issue of his 1912 campaign wilson proposed two measures to deal with the problem of monopoly which took shape as the corporate oversight federal trade commission act and the clayton antitrust act.
the federal trade commission act created a regulatory agency that would help businesses determine in advance whether their actions would be acceptable to the government.
the agency would also have authority to launch prosecutions against unfair trade practices and it would have wide power to investigate corporate behavior.
wilson signed the federal trade commission bill happily but he seemed to lose interest in the clayton antitrust bill which proposed stronger measures to break up trusts.
wilson did little to protect it from conservative assaults which greatly weakened it.
retreat and advance by the fall of 1914 wilson believed that the new freedom program was essentially complete and that agitation for reform would now subside.
he refused to support the movement for national woman suffrage.
deferring to southern democrats he condoned the reimposition of segregation in the agencies of the federal government in contrast to roosevelt who had ordered the elimination of many such barriers.
when congressional progressives attempted to enlist his support for new reform legislation wilson dismissed their proposals as unconstitutional or unnecessary.
the congressional elections of 1914 however shattered the presidents complacency.
democrats suffered major losses in congress and voters who in 1912 had supported the progressive party began returning to the republicans.
wilson realized he would not be able to rely on a divided opposition when he ran for reelection in 1916.
by the end of 1915 therefore wilson had begun to support a second flurry of reforms.
in january 1916 he appointed louis brandeis to the supreme court 516 chapter 20 making him not only the first jew but also the most advanced progressive to serve there.
later wilson supported a measure to make it easier for farmers to receive credit and another measure creating a system of workers compensation for federal employees.
in 1916 wilson supported the keating owen act which prohibited the shipment of goods produced by underage children across state lines thus giving an expanded child labor laws importance to the constitutional clause assigning congress the task of regulating interstate commerce.
the president similarly supported measures that used federal taxing authority as a vehicle for legislating social change.
after the court struck down keating owen a new law attempted to achieve the same goal by imposing a heavy tax on the products of child labor.
the court later struck down that law too.
the smith lever act of 1914 offered matching federal grants to support agricultural extension education.
over time these innovative uses of government overcame most of the constitutional objections and became the foundation of a long term growth in federal power over the economy.
conclusion the powerful surge of reform efforts in the last years of the nineteenth century and the first years of the twentieth century caused many americans to identify themselves as progressives that label meant many different things to many different people but at its core was a belief that human effort and government action could improve society.
by the early twentieth century progressivism had become a powerful transformative force in american life.
this great surge of reform eventually reached the federal government and national politics as progressives came to believe that success required the engagement of the federal government.
two national leaders theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson contributed to a period of national reform that made the government in washington a great center of power for the first time since the civil war a position it has never relinquished.
progressivism did not solve the nations problems but it gave movements organizations and governments new tools to deal with them.

what were the most important events that led up to the united states declaring war on germany.
how did u s participation in the great war affect the nations economy and society both during the war and after the conflict ended.
why did the great war fail to become the war to end all wars.
the great war as it was known to a generation unaware that a greater war would soon follow began quietly in august 1914 when austria hungary invaded the tiny balkan nation of serbia.
within weeks however the conflict had grown into a conflagration engaging the armies of most of the major nations of europe.
americans looked on with horror as the war became what many people claimed was the most savage in history.
it dragged on brutally and inconclusively for over four years.
most americans also believed at first that the conflict had little to do with them.
they were wrong.
after nearly three years of attempting to affect the outcome of the conflict without becoming embroiled in it the united states formally entered the war in april 1917.
518 the big stick america and the world 1901 1917 to most of the american public foreign affairs remained largely remote in the early twentieth century.
but to theodore roosevelt and later presidents that remoteness made foreign affairs appealing.
overseas the president could act with less regard for congress and the courts.
roosevelt and civilization theodore roosevelt believed in using american power in the world a conviction he once alluded to by citing the proverb speak softly and carry a big stick.
but he had two different standards for using that power.
roosevelt believed that an important distinction existed between the civilized and uncivilized nations of the world.
civilized nations as he defined them were predominantly white and anglo saxon or teutonic uncivilized nations were generally nonwhite latin or slavic.
civilized nations were also by roosevelts definition producers of industrial goods.
uncivilized nations were suppliers of raw materials and markets for industrial products.
roosevelt believed that a civilized society had the right and duty to intervene in the affairs of backward nations to preserve order and stability for the sake of both nations.
that belief the obligation of a civilized nation to in effect police the world was one important reason for roosevelts early support of the development of american sea power.
by 1906 the american navy had attained a size and strength surpassed only by that of great britain.

granger nyc all rights reserved.
the new diplomacy protecting the open door in asia in 1904 the japanese staged a surprise attack on the russian fleet at port arthur in southern manchuria a province of china that both russia and japan hoped to control.
roosevelt hoping to prevent either nation from becoming dominant there agreed to mediate an end to the conflict.
russia faring badly in the war had no choice but to agree.
at a peace conference in portsmouth new hampshire in 1905 roosevelt pressured the embattled russians to accept japans territorial gains.
the japanese agreed to cease the fighting and expand no farther.
at the same time roosevelt negotiated a secret agreement with the japanese to ensure that the united states could continue to trade freely in the region.
roosevelt received the nobel peace prize in 1906 for his mediation of what became the treaty of portsmouth.
in the years that followed relations between the united states and japan steadily deteriorated.
japan by then the preeminent naval power in the pacific began to exclude american trade from many of the territories it controlled.
roosevelt took no direct action against japan but to be sure the japanese government recognized the power of the united states he sent sixteen battleships of the new american navy known as the great white great white fleet fleet because the ships were temporarily painted white for the voyage on an unprecedented journey around the world that included a call on japan.
the iron fisted neighbor roosevelt took a particular interest in latin america.
embarking on a series of ventures in the caribbean and south america he established a pattern of american intervention in the region that would outlive his presidency.
america and the great war 521 in 1902 the government of venezuela began to renege on debts to european bankers.
naval forces of britain italy and germany blockaded the venezuelan coast in response.
then german ships began to bombard a venezuelan port.
amid rumors that germany planned to establish a permanent base in the region roosevelt used the threat of american naval power to pressure the german navy to withdraw.
the incident helped persuade roosevelt that european intrusions into latin america could result not only from aggression but also from instability or irresponsibility such as defaulting on debts within the latin american nations themselves.
as a result in 1904 he announced what came to be known as the roosevelt corollary to the monroe roosevelt corollary doctrine.
the united states he claimed had the right not only to oppose european intervention in the western hemisphere but also to intervene in the domestic affairs of its neighbors if those neighbors proved unable to maintain order and national sovereignty on their own.
the immediate motivation for the roosevelt corollary and the first opportunity for using it was a crisis in the dominican republic.
a revolution had toppled its corrupt and bankrupt government in 1903 but the new regime proved no better able than the old to make good on the countrys 22 million in debts to european nations.
using the rationale provided by the roosevelt corollary roosevelt established in effect an american receivership assuming control of dominican customs and distributing 45 percent of the revenues to the dominicans and the rest to foreign creditors.
this arrangement lasted in one form or another for more than three decades.
the panama canal the most celebrated foreign policy accomplishment of roosevelts presidency was the construction of the panama canal which linked the atlantic and the pacific by creating a channel through central america.
at first roosevelt and many others favored a route across nicaragua which would permit a sea level canal requiring no locks.
but they soon turned instead to the narrow isthmus of panama then part of colombia the site of an earlier failed effort by a french company to construct a channel.
although the panama route was not at sea level it was shorter than the one in nicaragua and construction was already about 40 percent complete.
the french then lowered the price for its holdings and the united states opted for panama.
roosevelt dispatched john hay his secretary of state to negotiate an agreement with colombian diplomats that would allow construction to begin without delay.
under heavy american pressure the colombian charg daffaires toms herrn unwisely signed an agreement giving the united states perpetual rights to a six mile wide canal zone across colombia in return the united states would pay colombia 10 million and an annual rental of 250 000.
the outraged colombian senate refused to ratify the treaty.
colombia then sent a new representative to washington with instructions to demand at least 20 million from the americans plus a share of the payment to the french.
roosevelt was furious and began to look for ways to circumvent the colombian government.
philippe bunau varilla chief engineer of the french canal project was a ready ally.
in 1903 with the support of the united states he helped organize and finance a revolution in panama.
roosevelt landed troops from the u s s.
nashville there to maintain order their presence prevented colombian forces from suppressing the rebellion and three days later roosevelt recognized panama as an independent nation.
the new panamanian government quickly agreed to the terms the colombian senate had rejected.
work on the canal proceeded rapidly and it opened in 1914.

but as this map reveals the united states exercised considerable influence both political and economic augmented at times by military intervention in these regions throughout this period.
note the particularly intrusive presence of the united states in the affairs of cuba haiti and the dominican republic as well as the canal related interventions in colombia and panama.
what were the reasons for american intervention in latin america.
the united states and latin america 1895 1941 taft and dollar diplomacy like his predecessor william howard taft worked to advance the nations economic interests in latin america.
but he showed little interest in roosevelts larger vision of world stability.
instead tafts secretary of state philander c knox worked aggressively to extend american investments into less developed regions.
critics called his policies dollar diplomacy.
the policy was particularly visible in the caribbean.
when a revolution broke out in nicaragua occupied nicaragua in 1909 the administration quickly sided with the insurgents and sent american troops into the country to seize the customs houses.
as soon as peace was restored knox encouraged american bankers to offer substantial loans to the new government thus increasing washingtons financial leverage over the country.
when the new pro american government faced an insurrection less than two years later taft again landed american troops in nicaragua this time to protect the existing regime.
the troops remained there for more than a decade.
diplomacy and morality woodrow wilson entered the presidency with relatively little interest or experience in international affairs.
yet he faced international challenges of a scope and gravity unmatched america and the great war 523 by those of any president before him.
in many respects he continued and even strengthened the roosevelt taft approach to foreign policy.
having already seized control of the finances of the dominican republic in 1905 the united states established a military government there in 1916.
the military occupation lasted eight years.
in haiti wilson landed marines in 1915 to interventions in the caribbean quell a revolution during which a mob had murdered an unpopular president.
american military forces remained in the country until 1934 and american officers drafted the new haitian constitution adopted in 1918.
when wilson began to fear that the danish west indies might be about to fall into the hands of germany he bought the colony from denmark and renamed it the virgin islands.
concerned about the possibility of european influence in nicaragua he signed a treaty with that countrys government allowing for intervention to protect american interests.
closer to the american border the corrupt dictator porfirio daz had long permitted american businessmen to establish an enormous economic presence in mexico.
in 1910 however daz was overthrown by the popular leader francisco regime changes in mexico madero who promised democratic reform and seemed hostile to american businesses in mexico.
the united states quietly encouraged a reactionary general victoriano huerta to depose madero early in 1913.
but when the new government murdered madero woodrow wilson announced that he would never recognize huertas government of butchers wilson hoped that by refusing to recognize huerta he could help topple the regime and bring to power the constitutionalists now led by venustiano carranza.
but huerta with the support of american business interests established a full military dictatorship in october 1913 a few months later one of his army officers briefly arrested several american sailors from the u s s.
dolphin who had gone ashore in veracruz incident tampico.
the men were immediately released but the american admiral demanded a twenty one gun salute as a public display of penance.
the mexicans refused.
wilson used the incident as a pretext for seizing the mexican port of veracruz.
wilson had envisioned a bloodless action but in a clash with mexican troops the americans killed 126 of the defenders and suffered 19 casualties.
his show of force however had helped strengthen the position of the carranza faction which captured mexico city in august 1914 and forced huerta to flee the country.
at last it seemed the crisis might be over.
but wilson reacted angrily when carranza whom he had previously supported refused to accept american guidelines for the creation of a new government and he briefly considered throwing his support to still another aspirant to leadership carranzas erstwhile lieutenant pancho villa now staking his own claim to power.
when villas pancho villa military position deteriorated however wilson abandoned him and granted preliminary recognition to carranza.
villa angry at what he considered an american betrayal retaliated in early 1916 by shooting sixteen american mining engineers in northern mexico and seventeen more americans across the border in columbus new mexico.
wilson ordered general john j pershing to lead an american expeditionary force across the mexican border in unsuccessful pursuit of villa.
they did engage in two ugly skirmishes with carranzas army in which forty mexicans and twelve americans died.
but before a fuller war could erupt wilson quietly withdrew american pershing expedition troops from mexico and in march 1917 finally granted formal recognition to the carranza regime.
by now however wilsons attention was turning to a far greater international crisis.
524 chapter 21 the road to war by 1914 the european nations had created an unusually precarious international system.
it careened into war very quickly on the basis of what seemed to be a minor series of provocations.
the collapse of the european peace the major powers of europe were organized by 1914 in two great competing alliances.
the triple entente linked britain france and russia.
the triple alliance united germany the austro hungarian empire and italy.
the conflict emerged most directly out of a controversy involving nationalist movements within the austro hungarian empire.
on june 28 1914 archduke franz ferdinand heir to the throne of the tottering empire was assassinated while paying a state visit to sarajevo the capital of bosnia then a province of austria hungary.
slavic nationalists wished to annex bosnia to neighboring serbia.
the killer of the archduke and his wife sophie was a serbian nationalist.
austria immediately blamed serbia for the murders and issued impossible ultimatums.
russia serbias slavic ally and a seeker of greater influence in the balkans mobilized its armies along the border with austria hungary.
the germans faced with that provocation against their ally and concerned about a two front war against russia and france declared war against both.
germanys subsequent assault on france ran through neutral belgium prompting britain to declare war on germany.
the coalitions soon changed in name and membership.
on one side were the central powers germany and austria hungary joined in the fall by the ottoman empire.
on the allies and central powers other side were the allies made up of britain france and russia.
hoping to seize territory from the central powers italy and japan soon threw in their lot with the allies.
as these changes suggest the alliance system did not necessarily bind nations to act as they did.
leaders made the decision for war based on their own interests and ambitions on the assumption that national self defense required it and on the erroneous belief that their objectives could be met quickly.
what the alliance system did was provide a framework within which the choices for war were made.
as tragic as those choices seem in retrospect no one expected or wanted the ghastly world war that followed.
wilsons neutrality wilson called on his fellow citizens in 1914 to remain impartial in thought as well as deed but that was impossible.
most americans sympathized with britain.
lurid reports of german atrocities in belgium and france sometimes but not always exaggerated by british propagandists strengthened the hostility of many americans toward germany.
economic realities also made it impossible for the united states to deal with the belligerents on equal terms.
the british had imposed a naval blockade on germany to prevent munitions and supplies from reaching the enemy.
as a neutral the united states had the right in theory to trade with germany but the british blockade made that impossible.
a truly neutral response to the blockade would have been to stop trading with britain as well.
but while the united states could survive an interruption of its relatively modest trade with the central powers it could not easily weather a break in its much more america and the great war 525 extensive trade with the allies.
so america tacitly accepted the blockade of germany and continued trading with britain.
by 1915 the united states had continued trade with britain gradually transformed itself from a neutral power into the arsenal of the allies.
the germans in the meantime were resorting to a new and in american eyes barbaric tactic submarine warfare.
unable to challenge british domination on sinking of lusitania the oceans surface the germans announced early in 1915 that they would sink enemy vessels on sight.
months later on may 7 a german submarine or u boat a name derived from the german unterseeboot sank the british passenger liner lusitania without warning causing the deaths of 1 198 people 128 of them americans.
the ship was carrying both passengers and munitions but most americans considered the attack an unprovoked act on civilians.
wilson angrily demanded that germany promise not to repeat such outrages and the germans reluctantly agreed.
but early in 1916 in response to an announcement that the allies were now arming merchant ships to sink submarines germany proclaimed that it would fire on such vessels without warning.
a few weeks later it attacked the unarmed french steamer sussex injuring several american passengers.
again wilson demanded that germany abandon its unlawful tactics again the german government relented.
preparedness versus pacifism despite the presidents increasing bellicosity in 1916 he was still far from ready to commit the united states to war.
one obstacle was american domestic politics.
the question of whether america should make military and economic preparations for war sparked a heated debate between pacifists and interventionists.
wilson at first denounced the idea of an american military buildup as needless and provocative.
in the fall of 1915 however he endorsed an ambitious proposal by american military leaders for a large and rapid increase in the nations armed forces.
still the peace faction wielded considerable political strength as became clear at the democratic national convention in the summer of 1916.
the convention became especially enthusiastic when the keynote speaker punctuated his list of the presidents diplomatic achievements with the chant what did we do.
what did we do.
we didnt go to war.
we didnt go to war that speech helped produce one of the most prominent slogans of wilsons reelection campaign he kept us out of war during the campaign wilson did nothing to discourage those who argued that the republican candidate the progressive new york governor charles evans hughes was more likely than he to lead the nation into war.
wilson ultimately won reelection by fewer than 600 000 popular votes and only 23 electoral votes.
but he was uncomfortable about a slogan that had aided his victory.
any little german lieutenant he said of the u boat situation can put us into the war at any time by some calculated outrage intervention wilson was right but it was the german leadership that provoked him.
in january 1917 germany made a desperate gamble declaring unrestricted submarine warfare against all maritime traffic in the hopes of defeating the allies before wilson could mobilize an army.
meanwhile the german foreign secretary arthur zimmermann zimmermann telegram sent a telegram to the german ambassador in mexico instructing him to offer the mexicans a deal if they would join a military alliance germany would help mexico take back 526 chapter 21 29 15 24 10 12 8 12 popular vote candidate party electoral vote woodrow wilson democratic charles e hughes republican a l benson socialist 585 113 3 2 other parties prohibition socialist labor 233 909 9 129 606 49 4 8 538 221 46 2 61 6 of electorate voting the election of 1916 woodrow wilson had good reason to be concerned about his reelection prospects in 1916.
he had won only about 42 percent of the vote in 1912 and the republican party which had been divided four years earlier was now reunited around the popular charles evans hughes.
in the end wilson won a narrow victory over hughes with just under 50 percent of the vote and a similarly narrow margin in the electoral college.
note the striking regional character of his victory.
how did wilson use the war in europe to bolster his election prospects.
t erritory in the present states of texas new mexico and arizona.
by march when wilson released the intercepted and decoded telegram and after three united states ships were torpedoed by u boats war with germany seemed imminent.
although german crimes on the seas the offer to mexico and the threats to american commerce provided the immediate causes for war wilson had broader purposes in mind as well.
the president hoped that american intervention by earning him a seat at the postwar negotiating table would usher in a new era.
in the place of militarism secret alliances violence and autocracy would come democracy freedom of travel and commerce open diplomacy and self determination.
president wilson articulated this vision on the rainy evening of april 2 1917 when he asked congress for a declaration of war.
german u boat warfare had claimed american wilsons war message lives and treasure.
the countrys honor could not tolerate such affronts.
but aware of divisions in public opinion wilson sought to invest the moment with higher meaning.
the war would make the world safe for democracy and safeguard the rights of mankind america would not fight for material gain or territory the president said but to guarantee a future of free trade self governance peace and justice.
opposition to the war would not be tolerated.
if there should be disloyalty he warned it will be dealt with a firm hand of repression america and the great war 527 wilsons view carried the session but dissenters spoke up.
some midwesterners and southerners saw corporate profits not honor at stake in the atlantic.
a few pacifists including the first woman elected to congress jeannette rankin a republican from montana argued that no war was worth the costs.
still others argued the united states should stay out of europes affairs.
when the declaration of war finally passed on april 6 six senators and fifty representatives voted against it.
over there european armies on both sides of the conflict were decimated and exhausted by the time of woodrow wilsons declaration of war.
the allies looked desperately to the united states for help in breaking the stalemate.
mobilizing the military by the spring of 1917 great britain was suffering such vast losses from german submarines that its ability to receive vital supplies from across the atlantic was in jeopardy.
within weeks of joining the war the united states had begun to alter the balance.
a fleet of american destroyers aided the british navy in attacking the u boats and planting antisubmarine mines in the north sea.
the results were dramatic.
sinkings of allied ships had totaled nearly 900 000 tons in the month of april 1917 the figure dropped to 350 000 by december 1917 and to 112 000 by october 1918.
many americans had hoped that providing naval assistance alone would be enough to end the war but it quickly became clear that a major commitment of american ground forces would be necessary as well.
britain and france had few remaining reserves.
after the bolshevik revolution in november 1917 a new communist bolshevik revolution government led by v i lenin negotiated a hasty and costly peace between russia and the central powers.
that freed german troops to fight on the western front.
the united states did not have a large enough standing army to provide the necessary ground forces in 1917.
even amid recruitment efforts see consider the source race gender and world war i posters enlistments proved inadequate.
only a national draft could provide the needed men.
despite protests wilson won passage of the selective service act in mid may.
from a prewar total of 121 000 enlisted soldiers the army selective service act grew to more than 4 million 2 million of whom went to france.
draftees comprised 72 percent of all american soldiers in the war a far higher percentage than on either side of the civil war.
the typical american soldier or doughboy in the great war was a white single poorly educated draftee in his early twenties.
women were barred from r egular military the doughboy service but could sign up for things like nursing clerical work and telephone operation.
as many as 400 000 african americans joined the military the vast majority conscripted.
but this was a strict jim crow army.
units were segregated white officers were in charge and blacks generally performed menial labor.
yet two combat divisions the ninety second and ninety third were composed entirely of african american soldiers.

the small map on the upper right helps locate the area of conflict within the larger european landscape.
the larger map at left shows the long snaking red line of the western front in france stretching from the border between france and southwest germany all the way to the northeast border between belgium and france.
along that vast line the two sides had been engaged in murderous inconclusive warfare for over three years by the time the americans arrived.
beginning in the spring and summer of 1918 bolstered by reinforcements from the united states the allies began to win a series of important victories that finally enabled them to begin pushing the germans back.
american troops as this map makes clear were decisive along the southern part of the front.
at what point did the germans begin to consider putting an end to the war.

dont allow a whore to smirch your record the yanks are coming the united states had sent the first units of the american expeditionary forces aef to france in june 1917 under the leadership of general john j pershing but american soldiers werent heavily implicated in the fighting until the next year.
in march 1918 the germans launched nimble thrusts into the allied defenses.
under the french commander of allied forces ferdinand foch pershings troops halted the german offensive at cantigny and chteau thierry.
then the american second division including a brigade of marines lost 9 800 casualties in a savage but successful fight to drive the germans from belleau wood a place that would live on in marine corps lore.
in july the germans attacked again and at the second battle of the marne the allies fought together to repulse them.
over the course of that summer the influx of american divisions helped the allies push the german army back roughly to its original position.
530 chapter 21 by september with american troops plentiful and the germans depleted the allies prepared to advance toward germany.
pershing withdrew many of his divisions to the americans own sector on the southern edge of the front.
from that position the doughboys took the saint mihiel salient a bulge into allied lines that the germans had held for years.
foch then ordered pershings divisions to their place in the wars final allied the meuse argonne offensive push the meuse argonne offensive.
beginning on september 26 more than a million american doughboys the great majority of them seeing combat for the first time advanced against the germans while to the northwest the british and french undertook coordinated campaigns.
the germans sagged but held and something like trench warfare set in again.
september and october were terrible months for the americans with 27 000 men killed.
those of us who still lived wrote one doughboy who were able to move in body if not in spirit wanted to drop to our knees and implore god to stop this horrible slaughter of mankind by november the germans had been worn down their civilian population suffering from an increasingly effective blockade their soldiers captured by the hundreds of thousands their u boats more or less neutralized by a convoy system and their rear harassed armistice by airplane bombardment.
facing invasion the germans sought an armistice.
early on the morning of november 11 1918 while men along the front were still dying representatives of the warring parties signed an armistice in a railway car in the french forest.
the four year war to end all wars shuddered to a close.
the new technology of warfare world war i was a proving ground for a range of new military technologies.
the trench warfare that characterized the conflict was a result of the enormous destructive power of newly improved machine guns and higher powered artillery.
it was no longer feasible to send troops out into an open field.
the new weaponry would slaughter them in an instant.
trenches sheltered troops while allowing limited and usually inconclusive fighting.
but technology overtook the trenches too as mobile weapons tanks and flamethrowers proved capable of piercing entrenched positions.
most terrible of all perhaps new chemical weapons poisonous mustard gas which required troops to carry gas masks at all times made it possible to attack entrenched soldiers without direct combat.
the new forms of technological warfare required elaborate maintenance.
faster machine guns needed more ammunition.
motorized vehicles required fuel spare parts and mechanics capable of servicing them.
the logistical difficulties of supply became a major factor in planning tactics and strategy.
late in the war when the allied armies were advancing toward germany they frequently had to stop for days at a time to wait for their equipment to catch up with them.
world war i was the first conflict in which airplanes played a significant role.
the planes themselves were relatively simple and not very maneuverable but antiaircraft technology was not yet highly developed either so their effectiveness was still significant.
planes began to be constructed to serve various functions bombers fighters planes that would engage in dogfights with other planes and reconaissance aircraft.
the most modern part of the military during world war i was the navy.
battleships emerged that made use of new technologies such as turbine propulsion hydraulic gun controls electric light and power wireless telegraphy and advanced navigational aids.
submarines which had made a brief appearance in the american civil war now became trench warfare america and the great war 531 for most british french german and to a lesser extent american troops in france the most debilitating part of world war i was the misery of life in the trenches.
some young men lived in these cold wet muddy dugouts for months even years surrounded by filth sharing their space with vermin eating mostly rotten food.
occasional attacks to try to dislodge the enemy from its trenches usually ended in failure and became the scenes of terrible slaughter.
national archives and records administration life in the trenches significant weapons as the german u boat campaign in 1915 and 1916 made clear.
the new submarines were driven by diesel engines that were more compact than steam engines and used fuel that was less explosive than that of gasoline engines.
the new technologies were responsible for the wars truly stunning statistics of death.
russia lost 1 8 million soldiers germany 2 million france 1 4 million appalling casualties the british empire 1 million austria hungary 1 5 million italy 460 000.
something 532 chapter 21 like 5 million civilians died under the stress of war by violence or slower means though the exact number is hard to know.
the united states lost 116 000 soldiers about half of those in combat the others to disease.
some perished in the 1918 influenza pandemic that ultimately claimed an estimated 50 to 100 million lives worldwide.
although only in the war briefly the americans had played a significant role in the victory.
their casualty rates in the periods of intense fighting approximated or exceeded those of their allies.
the prospect of more doughboys arriving in the future surely affected the german leaderships capitulation in 1918.
the british russian and french contributions of course dwarfed the american one in sheer numbers.
but wilsons army had acquitted itself well enough to earn him a seat at the negotiating table one of his ambitions all along.
organizing the economy for war by the time the war ended the federal government had appropriated 32 billion for war expenses a staggering sum at the time.
the entire federal budget had seldom exceeded 1 billion before 1915 and as recently as 1910 the nations entire gross national product had been only 35 billion.
to raise the money the government relied on two devices.
first it launched a major drive to solicit loans from the american people by selling liberty bonds liberty bonds to the public.
by 1920 the sale of bonds accompanied by elaborate patriotic appeals had produced 23 billion.
at the same time new taxes were bringing in an additional sum of nearly 10 billion some of it coming from levies on the excess profits of corporations but much of it coming from new steeply graduated income and inheritance taxes that ultimately rose as high as 70 percent in some brackets.
an even greater challenge was to organize the economy to meet war needs.
in 1916 wilson established the council of national defense composed of members of his cabinet and the civilian advisory commission which set up local defense councils in every state and locality.
but this early administrative structure soon proved completely unworkable and members of the council urged a more centralized approach.
the administrative structure that slowly emerged was dominated by a series of war boards one to oversee the railroads one to supervise fuel supplies largely coal another to handle food a board that elevated to prominence the brilliant young engineer and business executive herbert hoover.
the boards generally succeeded in meeting essential war needs without paralyzing the domestic economy.
the war industries board wib was created in july 1917 to coordinate government war industries board purchases of military supplies.
casually organized at first it stumbled badly until march 1918 when wilson restructured it and placed it under the control of the wall street financier bernard baruch.
baruch decided which factories would convert to the production of which war materials and he set prices for the goods they produced.
when materials were scarce baruch decided to whom they should go.
when corporations were competing for government contracts he chose among them.
baruch viewed himself openly and explicitly as a partner of business and within the wib businessmen themselves the so called dollar a year men who took paid leave from their corporate jobs and worked for the government for a token salary supervised the affairs of the private economy.
the national war labor board established in april 1918 served as the final mediator of labor disputes.
it pressured industry to grant important concessions to workers an america and the great war 533 women industrial workers in world war ii such women were often called rosie the riveter their presence in these previously all male work environments was no less startling to americans during world war i.

in return it insisted that workers forgo strikes and that employers not engage in lockouts.
the search for social unity government leaders were painfully aware that public sentiment about the war was sharply divided.
the most conspicuous official effort to support the war was a vast propaganda campaign orchestrated by the committee on public information cpi wartime propaganda under the direction of the progressive journalist george creel.
the cpi supervised the distribution of over 75 million pieces of printed material and controlled much of the information available for newspapers and magazines.
creel encouraged journalists to exercise self censorship when reporting war news and most complied by covering the war largely as the government wished.
by 1918 government distributed posters and films were offering lurid and exaggerated portrayals of the savagery of the germans.
in this climate songwriters and other artists produced popular works that heavily favored the war.
see patterns of popular culture george m cohan over there 1917 the government also began efforts to suppress dissent.
cpi financed advertisements in magazines implored citizens to report to the authorities any evidence among their neighbors of disloyalty pessimism or yearning for peace.

lyricists and composers eager to peddle their sheet music widely had long captured popular attitudes toward the issues of their day.
in 1915 with men dying in the great war at a staggering rate songwriters churned out such antimilitarist numbers as i didnt raise my boy to be a soldier and dont take my darling boy away in april 1917 however president wilsons demand for unanimity changed tin pan alleys tune.
songs now demonized kaiser wilhelm ii the emperor of germany glorified the american doughboy a term dating to the mid nineteenth century but of mysterious origins and sentimentalized the homefront family.
other tunes became anthems of american confidence and strength none more so than george m cohans over there even before that hit which became the best known song of the war cohan was a leading figure in the american entertainment industry a prolific creator and performer of broadway productions and the composer of hundreds of original songs including classics such as yankee doodle boy written just after wilsons war address of april 2 over there offered a jaunty soundtrack for american intervention.

both passed in 1918 expanded the meaning of the espionage act to make illegal any public expression of opposition to the war in practice they espionage and sedition acts allowed officials to prosecute anyone who criticized the president or the government.
the most frequent targets of the new legislation were anticapitalist groups such as the socialist party and the industrial workers of the world iww.
many americans had favored the repression of socialists and radicals even before the war the wartime policies now made it possible to move against them with full legal sanction.
eugene v debs the humane leader of the socialist party and an opponent of the war was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1918.
a pardon by president warren g harding ultimately won his release in 1921.
big bill haywood and members of the iww were energetically prosecuted.
only by fleeing to the soviet union did haywood avoid imprisonment.
in all more than 1 500 people were arrested in 1918 for the crime of criticizing the government or the war.
state and local governments corporations universities and private citizens contributed as well to the climate of repression.
a cluster of citizens groups emerged to mobilize respectable members of communities to root out disloyalty.
the greatest target of abuse was the german american community.
most german americans supported the american war effort once it began but public opinion still turned bitterly hostile.
a campaign to purge society of all things german quickly gathered speed at times assuming ludicrous forms.
performances of german music were frequently banned.
german foods such as sauerkraut and bratwurst were renamed liberty cabbage and liberty sausage german books were removed from library shelves.
courses in the german language were dropped from school curricula.
germans were routinely fired from jobs in war industries lest they sabotage important tasks.
the search for a new world order woodrow wilson had led the nation into war promising a just and stable peace at its conclusion.
even before the armistice he was preparing to lead the fight for what he considered a democratic postwar settlement.
the fourteen points on january 8 1918 wilson appeared before congress to present the principles for which he believed the nation was fighting.
he grouped the war aims under fourteen headings widely known as the fourteen points they fell into three broad categories.
first wilsons proposals contained a series of eight specific recommendations for adjusting postwar boundaries and establishing new nations to replace the defunct austro hungarian 535 536 chapter 21 and ottoman empires.
second five general principles would govern international conduct in the future freedom of the seas open covenants instead of secret treaties reductions in armaments free trade and impartial mediation of colonial claims.
finally there was a proposal for a league of nations that would help implement these new principles and territorial adjustments and resolve future controversies.
wilsons international vision ultimately enchanted not only much of his own generation in both america and europe but also members of generations to come.
it reflected his belief that the world was as capable of just and efficient government as were individual nations that once the international community accepted certain basic principles of conduct and constructed modern institutions to implement them the world could live in peace.
despite wilsons confidence leaders of the allied powers were preparing to resist him even before the armistice was signed.
britain and france in particular were in no mood for a benign and generous peace.
at the same time wilson was encountering problems at home.
in 1918 with the war almost over wilson unwisely tied support of his peace plans to the election of democrats to congress in november.
days later the republicans captured majorities in both houses.
domestic economic troubles more than international issues had been the most important factor in the voting but the results damaged his ability to claim broad popular support for his peace plans.
wilson further antagonized the republicans when he refused to appoint any important member of their party to the negotiating team that would attend the peace conference in paris.
wilsons international vision the paris peace conference when wilson entered paris on december 13 1918 he was greeted some claimed by the largest crowd in the history of france.
the peace conference itself however proved less satisfying.
the principal figures in the negotiations were the leaders of the victorious allied nations president wilson as well as david lloyd george the prime minister of great britain georges clemenceau the prime minister of france and vittorio orlando the prime minister of italy.
from the beginning the atmosphere of idealism wilson had sought to create competed with his counterparts national self interest thirst for revenge and fears of the unstable negotiating the peace situation in eastern europe and the threat of communism.
russia whose new bolshevik government was still fighting anti bolshevik counterrevolutionaries was unrepresented in paris but the radical threat it seemed to pose to western governments was never far from the minds of the delegates.
in this tense and often vindictive atmosphere wilson was unable to win approval of many of his broad principles or to prevent the other allies from imposing punitive reparations on germany.
wilson did manage to win some important victories in paris in setting boundaries and dealing with former colonies.
but his most visible triumph and the one most important to him was the creation of a permanent international organization to oversee world affairs and prevent future wars.
on january 25 1919 the allies voted to the league of nations accept the covenant of the league of nations.
the ratification battle wilson presented the treaty of versailles so named for the palace outside paris where the agreement was signed to the senate on july 10 1919.
but members of that chamber america and the great war 537 had many objections.
some the so called irreconcilables believed that america should remain free of binding foreign entanglements.
but many other opponents were principally concerned with constructing a winning issue for the republicans in 1920.
most notable of these was senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts the powerful henry cabot lodge chair of the foreign relations committee who loathed the president and used every possible tactic to obstruct the treaty.
public sentiment clearly favored ratification so at first lodge could do little more than play for time.
gradually however his opposition to the treaty crystallized into a series of reservations amendments to the league covenant further limiting american obligations to the organization.
wilson might still have won approval at this point if he had agreed to some relatively minor changes in the language of the treaty.
but the president refused to yield.
when he realized the senate would not budge wilson decided to appeal to the public and embarked on a grueling cross country speaking tour to arouse public support for the treaty.
for more than three weeks he traveled over 8 000 miles by train speaking as often as four times a day resting hardly at all.
finally he reached the end of his strength.
after speaking at pueblo colorado on september 25 1919 he collapsed with severe headaches.
canceling the rest of his itinerary he rushed back to washington where a few days later he suffered a major stroke.
for two weeks he was close to death for six weeks more he was so seriously ill that he was virtually unable to conduct public business.
his wife and his doctor formed an almost impenetrable barrier around him shielding the president from any official pressures that might impede his recovery.
wilson ultimately recovered enough to resume a limited official schedule but he was essentially an invalid for the remaining eighteen months of his presidency.
his condition only intensified what had already been his strong tendency to view public issues in moral terms and to resist any attempts at compromise.
when the foreign relations committee finally sent the treaty to the senate recommending nearly fifty league membership rejected amendments and reservations wilson refused to consider any of them.
the effort to win ratification failed.
in the aftermath of this defeat wilson became convinced that the 1920 national election would serve as a solemn referendum on the league.
by now however public interest in the peace process had begun to fade as a series of other crises claimed attention.
a society in turmoil even during the paris peace conference many americans were concerned less about international matters than about turbulent events at home.
some of this unease was a legacy of the almost hysterical social atmosphere of the war years some of it was a response to issues that surfaced after the armistice.
the unstable economy the war ended sooner than almost anyone had anticipated.
without warning without planning the nation lurched into the difficult task of economic reconversion.
at first the boom continued but accompanied by raging inflation.
through most of 1919 and 1920 prices rose at an average of more than 15 percent a year.
finally late in 1920 the economic bubble burst as inflation began killing the market for consumer postwar recession 538 chapter 21 goods.
between 1920 and 1921 the gross national product declined nearly 10 percent 100 000 businesses went bankrupt and nearly 5 million americans lost their jobs.
well before this severe recession began labor unrest increased dramatically.
the raging inflation of 1919 wiped out the modest wage gains workers had achieved during the war labor unrest many laborers were worried about job security as veterans returned to the workforce arduous working conditions continued to be a source of discontent.
employers aggravated the resentment by using the end of the war to rescind benefits they had been forced to concede to workers in 1917 and 1918 most notably recognition of unions.
the year 1919 therefore saw an unprecedented strike wave.
in january a walkout by shipyard workers in seattle washington evolved into a general strike that brought the entire city to a virtual standstill.
in september the boston police force struck to demand recognition of its union.
with its police off the job boston erupted in violence and looting.
governor calvin coolidge called in the national guard to restore order and attracted national acclaim by declaring there is no right to strike against the public safety coolidges statement tapped into a broad middle class hostility to unions and strikes.
that hostility played a part in defeating the greatest strike of 1919 a steel strike that began in september when 350 000 steelworkers in several midwestern cities demanded an eight hour day and union recognition.
the long and bitter steel strike climaxed in a riot in gary indiana in which eighteen strikers were killed.
steel executives managed to keep most plants running with nonunion labor and public opinion was so hostile to the strikers that the american federation of labor timidly repudiated the strike.
by january the strike like most of the others in 1919 had collapsed.
the demands of african americans black world war i veterans 400 000 of them came home in 1919 and marched down the main streets of cities with other returning troops.
and then in new york and elsewhere percentage of total population 50 75 10 25 25 50 5 10 0 5 two great waves of migration produced a dramatic redistribution of the african american population in the first half of the twentieth century one around the time of world war i the other during and after world war ii.
the map on the left shows the almost exclusive concentration of african americans in the south as late as 1910.
the map on the right shows both the tremendous increase of black populations in northern states by 1950 and the relative decline of black populations in parts of the south.
note in particular the changes in mississippi and south carolina.
why did the wars produce such significant migration out of the south.
african american migration 1910 1950 america and the great war 539 they marched again through the streets of black neighborhoods such as harlem led by jazz bands and cheered by thousands of african americans.
they believed that the glory of black heroism in the war would make it impossible for white society ever again to treat african americans as second class citizens.
as it turned out the fact that black soldiers had fought in the war had almost no impact at all on white attitudes.
but it profoundly affected black attitudes accentuated african american bitterness and increased the determination to fight for civil rights.
during the war nearly half a million blacks had migrated from the rural south to industrial cities often enticed by northern labor agents who offered free transportation in search of the factory jobs the war was rapidly generating.
this was the beginning of what became known as the great migration.
suddenly large black communities arose in northern great migration cities part of the broader twentieth century transformation of the black population from a generally southern rural one to a northern urban one.
by 1919 the racial climate had become savage and murderous.
in the south lynchings suddenly increased more than seventy blacks some of them war veterans died at the hands of white mobs in 1919 alone.
in the north black factory workers faced widespread layoffs as returning white veterans displaced them from their jobs.
and as whites became convinced that black workers with lower wage demands were hurting them economically animosity grew rapidly.
wartime riots in east st louis and elsewhere were a prelude to a summer of much worse racial violence in 1919.
in chicago a black teenager swimming in chicago race riot lake michigan on a hot july day happened to drift toward a white beach.
whites onshore allegedly stoned him unconscious he sank and drowned.
angry african americans gathered in crowds and marched into white neighborhoods to retaliate whites formed even larger crowds and roamed into mostly black neighborhoods.
for more than a week chicago was virtually at war.
in the end 38 people had died 15 whites and 23 blacks and 537 were injured over 1 000 people were left homeless.
the chicago riot was the worst but not the only racial violence during the so called red summer of 1919 in all 120 people died in such racial outbreaks in little more than three months.
racially motivated urban riots were not new.
but the 1919 riots were different in one respect they did not just involve white people attacking blacks but also blacks fighting back.
the naacp signaled this change by urging blacks not just to demand government protection but also to defend themselves.
the poet claude mckay one of the major figures of what would soon be known as the harlem renaissance wrote a poem after the chicago riot called if we must die like men well face the murderous cowardly pack.
pressed to the wall dying but fighting back.
at the same time a black jamaican marcus garvey began to attract a wide following in the united states with his ideology of black nationalism.
marcus garvey and black nationalism garvey encouraged african americans to reject assimilation into white society and to develop pride in their own race and culture.
his universal negro improvement association unia launched a chain of black owned grocery stores and pressed for the creation of other black businesses.
eventually garvey began urging his supporters to leave america and return to africa where they could create a new society of their own.
in the early 1920s the garvey movement experienced explosive growth for a time but it began to decline after garvey was indicted in 1923 on charges of business fraud.
he was deported to jamaica two years later.
but the allure of black nationalism survived in black culture long after garvey was gone.
540 chapter 21 the red scare many americans regarded the industrial warfare and racial violence of 1919 as frightening omens of instability and radicalism.
after the russian revolution of november 1917 communism was no longer simply a theory but the basis of an important regime.
concerns about the communist threat grew in 1919 when the bolshevik government announced the formation of the communist international or comintern whose purpose was to export revolution around the world.
in america meanwhile there was in addition to the great number of imagined radicals a modest number of real ones.
these small groups of radicals were presumably responsible for a series of bombings in the spring of 1919.
in april the post office intercepted several dozen parcels addressed to leading businessmen and politicians that were triggered to explode when opened.
two months later eight bombs exploded in eight cities within minutes of one another suggesting a nationwide conspiracy.
the combination of strikes and the comintern announcement produced what became known as the red scare.
nearly thirty states enacted new peacetime sedition laws imposing harsh penalties on promoters of revolution.
spontaneous acts of violence against supposed radicals occurred in some communities and universities and other institutions tried to expel radicals from their midst.
but the greatest agent of the red scare was the federal government.
on new years day 1920 attorney general a mitchell palmer and his palmer raids ambitious young assistant j edgar hoover orchestrated a series of raids on alleged radical centers throughout the country and arrested more than 6 000 people.
most of those arrested were ultimately released but about 500 who were not american citizens were summarily deported.
later in 1920 a bomb exploded on wall street killing thirtyeight people.
no one was ever convicted of this bombing.
the ferocity of the red scare gradually abated but its effects lingered well into the 1920s.
in may 1920 two italian immigrants nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti were charged with the murder of a paymaster in south braintree massachusetts.
the case against them was weak and suffused with nativist prejudices and fears but because both men were confessed anarchists they faced a widespread public presumption of guilt.
they were convicted and eventually sentenced to death.
over the next several years public sacco and vanzetti support for sacco and vanzetti grew to formidable proportions.
but on august 23 1927 amid widespread protests in the united states and around the world sacco and vanzetti still proclaiming their innocence died in the electric chair.
refuting the red scare an unexpected result of postwar turmoil was the emergence of a vigorous defense of civil liberties that not only discredited the red scare but also helped give new force to the bill of rights.
the heavy handed actions of the federal government after the war created a powerful backlash.
it destroyed the career of a mitchell palmer.
it almost nipped in the bud the ascent of j edgar hoover.
it damaged the democratic party.
and it led to an organization committed to protecting civil liberties the national civil liberties bureau launched in 1917 which in 1920 was renamed the american civil liberties union aclu and which remains a prominent institution today.
at the same time members of the supreme court most notably justices oliver wendell holmes and louis brandeis gradually moved to defend unpopular speech.
the clash of fighting faiths holmes wrote in a dissent in 1920 was best resolved by free trade in america and the great war 541 ideas that the best test of truth is.
the competition of the market this and other dissents eventually became law as other justices committed themselves to a robust defense of speech however unpopular.
the retreat from idealism on august 26 1920 the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote became part of the constitution.
to the suffrage movement this was the culmination of nearly a century of struggle.
to many progressives it seemed to promise new support for reform.
yet the nineteenth amendment marked not the beginning of a new era of progressive reform but the end of an earlier one.
economic problems labor unrest racial tensions and the intensity of the antiradicalism they helped create all combined in the years immediately disillusionment and reaction following the war to produce a general sense of disillusionment.
that became particularly apparent in the election of 1920.
woodrow wilson hoped the campaign would be a referendum on the league of nations and the democratic candidates governor james m cox of ohio and assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt dutifully tried to keep wilsons ideals alive.
the republican presidential nominee warren gamaliel harding an obscure ohio senator offered a different vision.
he embraced no soaring ideals only a vague promise of a return as he later phrased it to normalcy harding won in a landslide with 61 percent of the popular vote and victories in every state outside the south.
the party made major gains in congress as well.
to many americans it seemed that for better or worse a new age had begun.
conclusion presidents roosevelt taft and wilson contributed to a continuation and indeed an expansion of americas active role in international affairs in part as an effort to abet the growth of american capitalism and in part as an attempt to impose american ideas of morality and democracy on other parts of the world.
similar mixtures of ideals and self interest soon guided the united states into a great world war.
for a time after the outbreak of war in europe in 1914 most americans president wilson among them wanted nothing so much as to stay out of the conflict.
but as the war dragged on and the tactics of britain and germany began to impinge on american trade and access to the seas the united states found itself drawn into the conflict.
in april 1917 congress agreed to the presidents request that the united states enter the war as an ally of britain france and russia.
within a few months of the arrival of american troops in europe germany agreed to an armistice and the war ended.
american casualties although not inconsiderable were negligible compared to the millions suffered by the european combatants.
wilsons bold and idealistic dream of a peace based on international cooperation suffered a painful death.
the treaty of versailles which he helped draft contained a provision for a league of nations which wilson believed could transform the international order.
but the league quickly became controversial in the united states and despite strenuous efforts by the president efforts that hastened his own physical collapse the treaty was defeated in the senate.
in the aftermath of that traumatic battle the american people turned away from wilson and his ideals and prepared for a very different era.
542 chapter 21 the social experience of the war in the united states was on the whole dismaying to reformers.
although the war enhanced some reform efforts most notably prohibition and woman suffrage it also introduced an atmosphere of intolerance and repression into american life.
the aftermath of the war was even more disheartening to progressives because of both a brief but highly destabilizing recession and a wave of repression directed against labor radicals african americans and immigrants.

what were some of the cultural conflicts of the 1920s and what caused them.
is the term the new era a fitting description of the 1920s.
in popular culture the 1920s are often remembered as an era of affluence conservatism and cultural frivolity.
in reality however the decade was a time of significant even dramatic social economic and political change.
the american economy not only enjoyed spectacular growth but also developed new forms of organization.
many americans reshaped themselves to reflect the increasingly urban industrial consumer oriented society of the united states.
and american government experimented with new approaches to public policy.
that was why contemporaries liked to refer to the 1920s as the new era an age in which america was becoming a modern nation.
at the same time however the decade saw the rise of a series of spirited and at times effective rebellions against the transformations in american life.
the intense cultural conflicts that characterized the 1920s showed that much of american society remained unreconciled to the modernizing currents of the new era.

less visible at the time but equally significant was the survival and even the growth of inequalities and imbalances.
technology organization and economic growth no one could deny the remarkable feats of the american economy in the 1920s.
the nations manufacturing output rose by more than 60 percent.
per capita income grew by a third.
inflation was negligible.
a mild recession in 1923 briefly interrupted the pattern of growth but when it subsided early in 1924 the economy expanded with even greater vigor.
the economic boom was a result of many things but one of the most important was technology.
as a result of the development of the assembly line and other innovations automobiles now became one of the most important industries in the nation stimulating growth in such related industries as steel rubber and glass tool companies oil corporations and road construction.
the increased mobility that the automobile made possible increased the demand for suburban housing fueling a boom in the construction industry.
radio contributed as well to the economic growth.
early radio had been able to broadcast little besides pulses which meant that radio communication could occur only through the morse code.
but with the discovery of the theory of modulation pioneered by the canadian scientist reginald fessenden it became possible to transmit speech and music.
many people built their own radio sets at home for very little money benefiting from the discovery that inexpensive crystals could receive signals over long distances but not very well over short ones.
these shortwave radios which allowed the new era 545 individual owners to establish contact with one another marked the beginning of what later became known as ham radio once commercial broadcasting began families flocked to buy more conventional radio sets powered by reliable vacuum tubes and capable of receiving high quality signals over short and medium distances.
by 1925 there were 2 million sets in american homes and by the end of the 1920s almost every family had one.
commercial aviation developed slowly in the 1920s beginning with the use of planes to deliver mail.
on the whole airplanes remained curiosities and sources of commercial aviation entertainment.
but technological advances the development of the radial engine and the creation of pressurized cabins laid the groundwork for the great increase in commercial travel in the 1930s and beyond.
electronics home appliances plastics and synthetic fibers such as nylon aluminum magnesium oil electric power and other industries fueled by technological advances all grew dramatically.
telephones continued to proliferate.
by the late 1930s there were approximately 25 million telephones in the united states roughly one for every six people.
see consider the source americas early telephone network the seeds of future technological breakthroughs were also visible.
in both england and america scientists and engineers were working to transform primitive calculating machines into devices capable of performing more complicated tasks.
by the early early computing 1930s researchers at mit led by vannevar bush had created an instrument capable of performing a variety of complicated tasks the first analog computer.
a few years later howard aiken with financial assistance from harvard and mit built a much more complex computer with memory capable of multiplying eleven digit numbers in three seconds.
genetic research had begun in austria in the mid nineteenth century through the work of gregor mendel a catholic monk who performed experiments on the genetic research hybridization of vegetables in his monastery garden.
his findings attracted little attention during his lifetime but in the early twentieth century they were discovered by several investigators and helped shape modern genetic research.
among the american pioneers was thomas hunt morgan of columbia university and later cal tech whose experiments with fruit flies revealed how several genes could be transmitted together.
he also revealed the way in which genes were arranged along the chromosome.
his work helped open the path to understanding how genes could recombine a critical discovery that led to more advanced experiments in hybridization and genetics.
large sectors of american business accelerated their drive toward national organization and consolidation.
certain industries notably those dependent on large scale mass production such as steel and automobiles seemed to move naturally toward concentrating production in a few large firms.
other industries less dependent on technology and less susceptible to great economies of scale proved more resistant to consolidation.
the strenuous efforts by industrialists throughout the economy to find ways to curb competition reflected a strong fear of overcapacity.
even in the booming 1920s industrialists remembered how too rapid expansion and overproduction had helped produce recessions in 1893 1907 and 1920.
the great unrealized dream of the new era was to find a way to stabilize the economy so that such collapses would never occur again.
workers in an age of capital despite the remarkable economic growth more than two thirds of the american people in 1929 lived at no better than what one major study described as the minimum comfort level half of those were at or below the level of subsistence and poverty co ns ider t he s o urc e americas early telephone network alexander graham bell received a patent for the invention of the telephone in 1876.

american labor experienced both the successes and the failures of the 1920s.
on the one hand most workers saw their standard of living rise during the decade.
some employers adopted paternalistic techniques that came to be known as welfare capitalism.
the steamfitter lewis hine was among the first american photographers to recognize his craft as an art.
