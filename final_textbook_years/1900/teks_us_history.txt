roosevelt won the presidency in november 1932 but the situation grew worse between the election and his inauguration.
unemployment continued to rise and bank runs increased.
people feared that roosevelt would abandon the gold standard and reduce the value of the dollar to fight the depression.
under the gold standard one ounce of gold equaled a set number of dollars.
to reduce the value of the dollar the united states would have to stop exchanging dollars for gold.
many americans and foreign investors with deposits in american banks decided to take their money out of the banks and convert it to gold before it lost its value.
across the nation people stood in long lines with paper bags and suitcases waiting to withdraw their money from banks.
by march 1933 more than 4 000 banks had collapsed wiping out nine million savings accounts.
in 38 states governors declared bank holidays closing the remaining banks before bank runs could put them out of business.
by the day of roosevelts inauguration most of the nations banks were closed.
one in four workers was unemployed.
roosevelt knew he had to restore the nations confidence.
first of all he declared in his inaugural address let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
this nation asks for action and action now skills practice as you read about the first new deal use a graphic organizer of your choice to take notes about the different approaches to ending the depression.
after completing the lesson use your notes to write a summary of what you read.
the new deal begins roosevelt and his advisers came into office bursting with ideas about how to end the depression.
roosevelt had no clear agenda nor did he have a strong political ideology.
he argued the country needs bold persistent experimentation.
above all try something the new president sent bill after bill to congress.
between march 9 and june 16 1933 which came to be called the hundred days congress passed 15 major acts to resolve the economic crisis.
these programs made up what would be called the first new deal.
a divided administration although he alone made the final decision about what policies and programs to pursue roosevelt depended on his advisers for new ideas.
he deliberately chose advisers who disagreed with one another because he wanted to hear many different points of view.
one influential group of president roosevelts advisers supported the belief that if the government agencies worked with businesses to regulate wages prices and production they could lift the economy out of the depression.
a second group of advisers who distrusted big business and felt business leaders had caused the depression wanted government planners to run key parts of the economy.
a third group of advisers supported former president woodrow wilsons new freedom philosophy.
they wanted roosevelt to break up big companies and allow competition to set wages prices and production levels.
this group of advisers also thought that the government should impose regulations to keep economic competition fair.
hreading progress check summarizing what were the key accomplishments during roosevelt s first hundi days in office.
312 banks and debt relief guiding question why did roosevelt broadcast fireside chats.
roosevelt knew that very few of the new programs would work as long as the nations banks remained closed.
before he did anything else he had to restore peoples confidence in the banking system.
within a week of his taking office the emergency banking relief act was passed.
the new law required federal examiners to survey the nations banks and issue treasury department licenses to those that were financially sound.
on march 12 roosevelt addressed the nation by radio.
sixty million people listened to this first of many fireside chats he said i assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.
when banks opened on march 13 deposits far outweighed withdrawals.
the banking crisis was over.
with confidence in the banking system restored roosevelt then proceeded to use powers granted in the emergency banking relief act to take the dollar off the gold standard.
in june congress went further passing a law that made all contracts payable only in legal tender.
no one could demand gold in payment or use gold to pay for things.
almost immediately inflation began.
this was exactly what the president wanted.
the purpose of going off the gold standard was to cause inflation what roosevelt called reflation because he believed the dollar was overvalued from decades of deflation.
roosevelt wanted to cause inflation to help people in debt.
when money inflates it loses value.
debts become easier to pay because the money owed is not worth as much anymore.
at the same time inflation causes prices to go up earning more money for farmers and others who were suffering from low prices for their goods.
the united states stayed off the gold standard for about nine months until the president thought the dollars value had fallen far enough.
in early 1934 roosevelt set a new price for the gold standard where one ounce of gold equaled 35 u s dollars.
fireside chats radio broadcasts made by roosevelt to the american people to explain his initiatives thefdicand sec many of roosevelt s advisers wanted to go further pushing for new regulations for banks and the stock market.
roosevelt agreed and supported the securities act of 1933 and the glass steagall banking act.
the securities act required companies that sold stocks and bonds to provide complete and truthful information to investors.
the securities and exchange commission sec was created to regulate the stock market and stop fraud.
the glass steagall act separated commercial banking from investment banking.
commercial banks handle everyday transactions and could no longer risk depositors money through stock speculation.
the act also created the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to provide government insurance for bank deposits.
the creation of the fdic increased public confidence in the banking system.
in creating the fdic and the sec congress changed the historical role of state and federal governments in financial matters.
until the new deal the regulation of banks had been the responsibility of state governments today banks can have a federal charter or a state charter and be subject to ot federal and state regulations.
similarly up until 1933 the operation of stock markets had been generally unregulated.
under the laissez faire ideas oft e fate 1800s the idea that the federal government should impose ru es on a market where people met to buy and sell stocks was never seriously considere.
the great crash of 1929 changed peoples thinking.
roosevelt and the new deal 313 the fdic still exists today.
it guarantees bank deposits up to 250 000 for all member banks and is funded by insurance premiums paid by the banks not by taxpayer money.
the fdic supervises the operations of over 4500 banks nationwide making sure they are sound and comply with all financial regulations and consumer protection laws.
you can tell if a bank is insured by the fdic by looking for the member fdic logo on bank windows paper documents and websites.
the sec also still exists regulating the operations of the nations stock markets.
it inspects stock brokers investment advisors and agencies that rate stocks.
it investigates reports of fraud insider trading and works to prevent companies from misleading investors with false information.
the sec does not insure investments.
investing in companies always carries risk and investors can lose their money.
the secs role is not to protect investments but to prevent fraud and make sure investors are given correct information so they can make good investment decisions.
mortgage and debt relief terrified of losing their homes and farms many americans cut back on spending to make sure they could pay their mortgages.
roosevelt responded by introducing policies to help americans with their debts.
for example the home owners loan corporation bought the mortgages of home owners who were behind in their payments.
it then restructured the loans with longer repayment terms and lower interest rates.
the farm credit administration fca helped farmers refinance their mortgages.
these loans saved millions of farms from foreclosure.
although the fca may have slowed economic recovery by making less money available to lend to more efficient businesses it did help many desperate and impoverished people hold onto their land.
both the holc and the fca represented a dramatic expansion ofthe federal governments role in the economy.
never before had the federal government been involved in helping people with their mortgages.
h reading progress check summarizing how did the government restore confidence in the banking system.
farms and industry guiding question how did new deal legislation try to stabilize agriculture and industry.
many of roosevelts advisers believed that both farmers and businesses were suffering because prices were too low and production too high.
to help the nations farmers congress passed the agricultural adjustment act.
the act was based on a simple idea that prices for farm goods were lo because farmers grew too much food.
under this act the governments agricultural adjustment administration aaa would pay farmers not to rai certain livestock grow certain crops and produce dairy products.
over the ne two years farmers withdrew millions more acres from cultivation and receive.
more than 1 billion in support payments.
the program met its goal althougl raising food prices in a depression drew harsh criticism.
also not all farmers benefited.
thousands of tenant farmers many of them african americans los their jobs and homes when landlords took their fields out of production.
the government turned its attention to manufacturing in june 1933 with the national industrial recovery act nira.
once passed this law authorize the national recovery administration nra to suspend antitrust laws and a owed business labor and government to cooperate with rules or codes of 1 314 competition for each industry.
codes set prices established minimum wages shortened workers hours to create more jobs permitted unionization and helped businesses develop industry wide rules of fair competition.
the nra revived a few industries but the codes were difficult to administer.
employers disliked that the nra allowed workers to form unions.
they also argued that paying minimum wages forced them to raise prices.
after the nra was instituted industrial production fell.
the nra was declared unconstitutional in 1935.

relief programs guidingquestion how did new deal programs differ from president hoover s attempts to combat the depression.
many of president roosevelts advisers emphasized tinkering with prices and providing debt relief to solve the depression.
others maintained that the depressions fundamental cause was low consumption.
they thought getting money into the hands of needy individuals would be the fastest remedy.
because neither roosevelt nor his advisers wanted to give money to the unemployed they supported work programs for the unemployed.
the decision to create federal work programs marked yet another change in the historical roles of state and federal government.
until the depression relief programs run by government were rare but when they have been set up they had always been funded and managed by state and local governments.
during the hoover administration relief aid had for the first time been sent from the federal government to state governments to help them fund jobs fundamental being of central importance roosevelt and the new deal 315 this poster for the civilian conservation corps ccc expresses the optimism ofthe new deal.
critical thinking drawing conclusions how did the ccc provide opportunities for work play study and health.
but the new deal went even further with the creation of several federally managed job programs that bypassed the state governments entirely the ccc u 1 the most highly praised new deal work relief program was the civilian conservation corps ccc.
the ccc offered unemployed young men 18 25 years old the opportunity to work under the direction of the forestry service planting trees fighting forest fires and building reservoirs.
to prevent a repeat ofthe dust bowl the workers planted a line of more than 200 million trees known as a shelter belt from north texas to north dakota.
the young men lived in camps near their work areas and earned 30 a month 25 of which was sent directly to their families.
the average ccc worker returned home after six to twelve months better nourished and with greater self respect.
ccc programs also taught more than 40 000 of their recruits to read and write.
by the time the ccc closed down in 1942 it had put 3 million young men to work outdoors including 80 000 native americans who helped reclaim land they had once owned.
after a second bonus army march on washington in 1933 roosevelt added some 250 000 veterans to the ccc as well.
fera and the pwa a few weeks after authorizing the ccc congress established the federal emergency relief administration fera.
roosevelt chose harry hopkins a former social worker to run fera.
initially it did not create projects for the unemployed.
instead it gave money to state and local agencies to fund their relief projects.
after meeting with roosevelt to discuss his new job hopkins took the next two hours to spend 5 million on relief projects.
when critics charged that some of the projects did not make sense in the long run hopkins replied people dont eat in the long run they eat every day in june 1933 congress authorized another relief agency the public works administration pwa.
one third of the nations unemployed were in the construction industry.
to put them back to work the pwa began building highways dams schools and other government facilities.
the pwa awarded contracts to construction companies.
by insisting that contractors not discriminate against african americans the agency broke down some of the racial barriers in the construction trades.
the cwa by the fall of 1933 neither fera nor the pwa had reduced unemployment significantly and hopkins realized that unless the federal government acted quickly a huge number of unemployed citizens would be in severe distress once winter began.
after hopkin explained the situation president roosevelt authorized him to set u the civil works administration cwa.
hiring workers directly the cwa employed 4 million people including 300 000 women.
the agency built or improved 1 000 airports 500 000 miles of roads 40 000 school buildings and 3 500 playgrounds a parks.
the program spent nearly 1 billion in just five months.
although the cwa helped many people get through the winter president rooseve was alarmed by how quickly the agency was spending money.
he did no want americans to get used to the federal government providing them v jobs.
warning that the civil works administration would become aha with the country roosevelt insisted that it be shut down the following spring.

perhaps the most important result of the first new deal was a change in the spirit of the american people.

president roosevelt was tremendously popular during his first two years in office but opposition to his policies began to grow.
new deal programs had created more than 2 million new jobs.
more than 10 million workers remained unemployed however and the nations total income was about half of what it had been in 1929.
criticism from right and left roosevelt faced hostility from both the political right and the left.
the right wing had long believed that the new deal regulated business too tightly.
opponents thought that it gave the federal government too much power over the states.
by late 1934 the right wing increased its opposition as roosevelt started deficit spending abandoning a balanced budget and borrowing money to pay for his programs.
many business leaders became alarmed at the growing deficit.
some on the left however believed that the new deal had not gone far enough.
they wanted even more economic intervention to shift wealth from the rich to middle income and poor americans.
one outspoken critic was huey long.
as governor of louisiana long had championed the poor.
he improved schools colleges and hospitals and built roads and bridges.
these benefits made him popular and he built a powerful but corrupt political machine.
in 1930 long was elected to the u s senate.
in 1934 he established the share our wealth society to pull down these huge piles of gold until there shall be a real job not a little old sow belly black eyed pea job but a real spending 320 money beef steak and gravy ford in the garage red white and blue job for every man long planned to run for president in 1936.
roosevelt also faced a challenge from catholic priest and popular radio host father charles coughlin.
once an ardent new deal supporter the detroit resident had grown impatient with its moderate reforms.
he called for inflating the currency and nationalizing the banking system.
in 1934 he organized the national union for social justice which some democrats feared would become a new political party.
a third challenge came from california physician francis townsend.
he proposed that the federal government pay citizens over age 60 a pension of 200 a month.
recipients would have to retire and spend the entire check each month.
townsend believed that the plan would increase spending and free up jobs for the unemployed.
his proposal attracted millions of supporters especially older americans who mobilized as a political force for the first time.
together the three men had supporters around the country.
roosevelt faced the possibility of a coalition that would prevent his reelection.
thewpa in 1935 roosevelt launched a series of programs now known as the second new deal to generate greater economic recovery.
among these new programs was the works progress administration wpa the new deals largest public works program.

the schechter brothers had been convicted of violating the nras poultry code.
the court ruled that the constitution did not allow congress to delegate its legislative powers to the executive branch and therefore the nras codes were unconstitutional.
roosevelt worried that the ruling suggested the supreme court could strike down the rest of the new deal.
roosevelt knew he needed a new series of programs to keep voters support.
he called congressional leaders to a white house conference and thundered that congress could not go home until it passed his new bills.

when the supreme court struck down the nra it also invalidated the section of the nira that gave workers the right to organize.
democrats knew that the working class vote was key to winning reelection in 1936.
they also believed that unions could help end the depression because higl union wages would give workers more money to spend thereby boosting t economy.
opponents disagreed arguing that high wages forced companies to charge higher prices and hire fewer people.
despite these concerns congress pushed ahead with new labor legislation.
the wagner act in july 1935 congress passed the national labor relations act also called the wagner act.
this act guaranteed workers the right to unionize and bargain collectively.
it also established the national labor relations board nlrb which organized factory elections by secret ballot to determine whether workers wanted a union.
the nlrb could also investigate employers actions and.
stop unfair practices.
the wagner act also set up a process called binding arbitration whereby dissatisfied union members took their complaints to a neutral party who would listen to both sides and decide on the issues.
322 the wagner act led to a burst of labor activity.
in 1935 john l lewis leader ofthe united mine workers helped form the committee for industrial organization cio which set out to organize unions that included all workers skilled and unskilled in a particular industry.
first it focused on the automobile and steel industries two of the largest industries in which workers were not yet unionized.
organizers used new tactics to get employers to recognize the unions.
for example during sit down strikes employees stopped work inside the factory and refused to leave.
this technique prevented management from sending in replacement workers.
it was a common cio tactic for several years.
in late december 1936 the united auto workers uaw a cio union began a sit down strike at general motors plant in flint michigan.
family friends and others passed food and other provisions to them through windows.
violence broke out when police launched a tear gas assault on strikers wounding 13 but the strike held.
on february 11 1937 general motors recognized the uaw as its employees sole bargaining agent.
the uaw became one of the most powerful unions in the united states.
u s steel the nations largest steel producer and a long standing opponent of unionizing decided it did not want to repeat gms experience.
in march 1937 the company recognized the cios steelworkers union.
smaller steel producers did not follow suit and suffered bitter strikes.
by 1941 however the steelworkers union had won contracts throughout the industry.
in the late 1930s employees in other industries worked hard to gain union recognition from their employers.
union membership tripled from roughly 3 million in 1933 to about 9 million in 1939.
in 1938 the cio changed its name to the congress of industrial organizations and became a federation of industrial unions.
social security after passing the wagner act congress began work on one of the united statess most important pieces of legislation.
this was the social security act which provided some financial security for older americans unemployed workers and others.
roosevelt and his advisers viewed the bill primarily as an insurance measure.
workers earned the right to receive benefits because they paid special taxes to the federal government just as they paid premiums in buying a life insurance policy.
the legislation also provided modest welfare payments to others in need including people with disabilities and poor mothers with dependent children.
some critics did not like the fact that the money came from payroll taxes imposed on workers and employers but to roosevelt these taxes were crucial.
analyzing primary sources the gm strike beds were made up on the floor of each car the seats being removed if necessary.
i could not see and i looked for it carefully the slightest damage done anywhere to the general motors corporation.
the nearly completed car bodies for example were as clean as they would be in the salesroom their glass and metal shining bruce bliven from sitting down in flint the new republic january 27 1937 dbq drawing conclusions how do the strikers seem to have i acted during the strike.
thereby because of that binding arbitration process in which a neutral party hears arguments from two opposing sides and makes a decision that both must accept sit down strike method of boycotting work by sitting down at work and refusing to leave the establishment sit down strikers at the gm fisher body plant in flint michigan took over the plant in late december 1936.
their action led to a national strike that lasted until february 11 1937.
critical thinking analyzing primary sources what did the atmosphere within the gm fisher plant seem to be during the strike.
roosevelt andthe new deal 323 the social security act provided small incomes to millions of americans who were unable to work through no fault of their own.
primary source critical thinking predicting consequences how might social security have changed americans sense of personal economic security.
we put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal moral and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits.
with those taxes in there no politician can ever scrap my social security program quoted in memorandum on conference with fdr concerning social security taxation 19 what roosevelt did not anticipate was that congress would later horror from the social security fund to pay for other programs without raising payroll taxes.
the core of social security was the monthly retirement benefit which people collected when they stopped working at age 65.
unemployment insurance supplied a temporary income to workers who had lost their jobs.
social security continues to be a part of american life today.
when americans find themselves unemployed they can draw on their unemployment insurance from social security for many weeks while they look for a new job.
in addition of course americans who have contributed t the social security system are eligible for a pension benefit when they retire.
in 2013 the government paid out over 1 3 trillion dollars in social security payments approximately 37 of all federal government spending that year.
social security dramatically changed the role of the federal governmen it was the first example of what came to be called entitlement programs.
an entitlement program is not simply a form of welfare or relief.
it is a payment from the government that americans are entitled to receive in pa because they have paid into the system regularly with deductions from thei paychecks and in part because the law imposes a requirement on the government to make the payments.
social security was controversial at the time it was passed and remains a source of political debate today in part because even though americans are entitled to their social security payments the federal government has borrow against the social security fund in the past and is now forced to borrow more money to pay its social security obligations.
with the federal government deeply in debt and continuing to use deficit spending in almost every budget concerns have arisen as to whether social security can remain solvent and the u s government will be able to meet its obligations.
social security establishe the principle that the federal government should be responsible for those who through no fault of their own were unable to work.

in 1936 millions of voters owed their jobs mortgages and bank accounts to the new deal.
many african americans who had reliably voted republican since reconstruction switched their allegiance to the democratic party.
women and african americans had made modest gains thanks to the support of eleanor roosevelt who toured the country and recounted her experiences to her husband.
she persuaded him to address some of their problems in his new deal programs.
a democratic party coalition emerged including not just the white south but also african americans farmers workers immigrants women progressives and intellectuals.
the election of 1936 the republicans nominated kansas governor alfred landon as their presidential challenger.
he wanted to free the spirit of american enterprise but could not convince most voters change was needed.
roosevelt won more than 60 percent of the popular vote.
the court packing plan although the new deal was popular the supreme court saw things differently.
in january 1936 it declared the agricultural adjustment act unconstitutional.
cases pending on social security and the wagner act meant that the court might strike down other new deal programs.
roosevelt was furious.
after his reelection he tried to change the courts political balance.
he sent congress a bill that would increase the number of justices and allow the president to appoint an additional roosevelt and the new deal 325 court packing the act of a leader to change the political balance of power in a nation s judiciary system by appointing judges who will rule in favor of his or her policies recovery an economic upturn as after a depression continued from p 325 teks texas essential knowledge and skills 19a evaluate the impact of new deal legislation on the historical roles of state and federal government 19b explain constitutional issues raised by federal government policy changes during times of significant events including world war i the great depression world war ii the 1960s and 9 11 20b evaluate the impact of relationships among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government including franklin d roosevelts attempt to increase the number of u s supreme court justices and the presidential election of 2000 continued on the next page mary mcleod bethune shown with eleanor roosevelt became the first african american woman to head a federal agency.
critical thinking comparing and contrasting what mood does the photograph convey.
justice if a sitting justice who had served 10 years did not retire within six months of reaching age 70.
the bill if passed would have allowed roosevelt to appoint up to six new justices.
the court packing plan as it was called was a major political mistake.
many southern democrats feared new justices would overturn segregation.
african american leaders worried future justices might oppose civil rights.
many americans thought the plan gave the president too much power.
the court appeared to back down narrowly upholding the constitutionality of both the wagner act and the social security act.
soon after a conservative justices resignation allowed roosevelt to appoint a justice who supported the new deal although the bill was quietly killed and roosevelt achieved his goal of changing the courts view of the new deal the court packing plan hurt his reputation.
moreover it caused conservative democrats to work with republicans to block any further new deal proposals.
the recession of 1937 roosevelts problems continued.
in early 1937 the economy seemed to be on the verge of recovery.
industrial output was almost back to pre depression levels and many people believed the worst was over.
concerned about rising debt roosevelt ordered the wpa and the pwa to be cut significantly.
unfortunately he cut spending just as the first social security payroll taxes took 2 billion out of the economy.
by the end of 1937 about 2 million peop were out of work.
a debate over the value of government spending arose within the administration.
the leaders of the wpa and the pwa cited a new economic theory called keynesianism kayn zee uh nih zuhm which held that government should spend heavily in a recession to jump start the economy.
at first roosevelt was reluctant to begin deficit spending again.
some critics believed the recession proved the public was becoming too dependent on government spending.
but in early 1938 with no recovery i sight roosevelt asked congress for 3 75 billion for the pwa the wpa and other programs.
hreaping progress check determining cause and effect what factors helped roosevelt win a landslide victory in 19.
the new deal ends guiding question what impact has new deal legislation had on federal and state governments.
in his second inaugural address roosevelt had pointed out that despite progrf in climbing out of the depression many americans were still poor primarysource i see one third of a nation ill housed ill dad ill nourished.
the test of our progress is not whe we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those1 have too little.
from the public papers and addresses of franklin d roosevelt the constitution prevail the last new deal reforms one ofthe presidents goals for his second term was to provide better housin for the nations poor.
eleanor roosevelt who had toured poverty stricken appalachia and the rural south strongly urged the president to do somethin roosevelt responded with the passage of the national housing act which established the united states housing authority.
this organization received 500 million to subsidize loans to builders willing to construct low cost hous roosevelt also sought to help the nations tenant farmers.
about 150 000 white and 195 000 afncan american tenant farmers were expelled from farms when landlords took their land out of production under the aaa to stop this trend congress created the farm security administration to give loans to tenants so they could purchase farms.
the last major piece of new deal reform was the fair labor standards act which abolished child labor limited the workweek to 44 hours for most workers and set the first federal minimum wage at 25 cents an hour.
the recession of 1937 enabled republicans to win seats in congress in the midterm elections of 1938.
together with conservative southern democrats they began blocking further new deal legislation.
by 1939 the new deal era had come to an end.
continued from p 326 teks texas essential knowledge and skills 21c evaluate constitutional change in terms of strict construction versus judicial interpretation 26d identify the political social and economic contributions of women such as frances willard jane addams eleanor roosevelt dolores huerta sonia sotomayor and oprah winfrey to american society the new deal s legacy the onset of the great depression in 1929 was a major turning point in american history.
the economic crisis of the depression led to the new deal which fundamentally changed the relationship between the american people and the federal government.
as a result of the depression the power of the federal government to intervene in the economy significantly increased.
at the same time the historical role of the state governments and their relationship to the federal government began to shift as well.
increasingly the federal government took on a regulatory role that had previously been left to state governments.
in addition state governments began to look to the federal government as a source of additional funds to help them afford state programs and provide aid in difficult economic circumstances.
the new deal did not end the depression but it did give many americans a stronger sense of security and stability.
as a whole the new deal tended to balance competing economic interests.
supreme court decisions in 1937 and 1942 further increased federal power over the economy and allowed it to mediate between competing groups.
in taking on this mediating role the new deal established what some have called the broker state in which the government works out conflicts among different interests.
this broker role has continued under the administrations of both parties ever since.
the new deal also brought about a new public attitude toward government.
roosevelts programs had succeeded in creating a safety net safeguards and relief programs that protected people against economic disaster.
throughout the hard times of the depression most americans maintained a surprising degree of confidence in the american system.

the rise of dictators guiding question what economic and political conditions following world war i encouraged dictatorships.
the treaty of versailles along with the economic depression that followed contributed to the rise of antidemocratic governments in both europe and asia.
these antidemocratic states would eventually break the peace agreement that ended world war i mussolini and fascism in italy one of europes first dictatorships arose in italy.
in 1919 benito mussolini founded italys fascist movement.
fascism was an aggressive nationalistic movement that considered the nation mor important than the individual.
fascists believed that order in society and national greatness came through a dictator who led a strong government and built an empire.
fascism was also strongly anticommunist.
after the russian revolution many europeans feared that communists allied with labor unions were trying to bring down their governments.
mussolini exploited these fears by portraying fascism as a bulwark against communism protecting private property and the middle class.
he pledged to return italy to the glories of the roman empire.
backed by the blackshirts a fascist militia mussolini threatened to march on rome in 1922 claiming he was defending italy against a communist revolution.
liberal members of the italian parliament insisted that the king declare martial law.
when he refused the cabinet resigned.
conservative advisers then persuaded the king to appoint mussolini as the premier.
once in office mussolini who took the title of ii duce or the leader embarked on an ambitious program of bringing order to italy.
stalin takes over the soviet union after the russian revolution the communist party led by vladimir lenin created the union of soviet socialist republics ussr in 1922.
the communists instituted one party rule suppressed individual liberties and punished opponents.
after lenin died in 1924 joseph stalin came to power.
by 1926 stalin was the new soviet dictator.
he began a massive effort to industrialize his country using five year plans.
steel production increased but industrial wages declined by 43 percent from 1928 to 1940.
family farms were combined and turned into collectives or government owned farms.
peasants who resisted by killing livestock or hoarding crops faced show trials or death from starvation.
as many as 10 million peasants died in famines during 1932 and 1933.
stalin also sought to expand soviet influence beyond its borders proclaiming w orld dictatorship can be established only when the victory of socialism has been achieved in certain countries or groups of countries growing into a world union of soviet socialist republics uniting the whole of mankind stalin tolerated no opposition targeting political enemies along with artists and intellectuals.
he used concentration camps which held nearly 2 million people by 1935.
prisoners were used as slave labor.
between 15 and 20 million people died under stalins rule which lasted until his death in 1953.
hitler and nazi germany fascism a political system headed by a dictator that calls for extreme nationalism and often racism and no tolerance of opposition exploit to take unfair advantage of collective a farm especially in communist countries formed from many small holdings collected into a single unit for joint operation under governmental supervision adolf hitler was a fervent nationalist who hated both the victorious allies and the german government that had accepted their peace terms ending world war i.
he became the leader of the national socialist german workers party or nazi party.
the nazis were one of many political parties that arose out of postwar germanys political and economic chaos.
the party called for germany to expand its territory and to reject the terms of the treaty of versailles.
it also was anti semitic.
in november 1923 the nazis tried to seize power by marching on city hall in munich germany.
the plan failed the nazi party was banned for a time and hitler was arrested.
while in prison hitler wrote mein kampf my struggle in which he claimed that germans particularly blond blue eyed germans belonged to a master race called aryans.
he argued that the slavic peoples of eastern europe belonged to an inferior race which germans should enslave.
hitlers racism was strongest however toward jews.
hitler blamed the jews for many of the worlds problems especially for germany s defeat in world war i.
after his release hitler changed his tactics.
he focused on getting nazis elected to the reichstag the lower house of the german parliament.
when the depression struck germany many desperate germans began to vote for radical parties including the nazis and communists.
by 1932 the nazis were the largest party in the reichstag.
the following year the german president appointed hitler as chancellor.
after taking office hitler called for new elections.
storm troopers as the nazi paramilitary units were called began intimidating voters.
after the election the reichstag dominated by the nazis and other right wing parties voted to give hitler dictatorial powers.
in 1934 hitler became president which gave him control ofthe army.
he then gave himself the new title of der fuhrer or the leader.

criticalthinking predicting consequences what might be a result of tojo s aggressive leadership.
command to be in control of to have full power militarists control japan in japan as in germany difficult economic times helped undermine the political system.
japanese industries had to import nearly all ofthe resources they needed to produce goods.
when the depression struck other countries raised their tariffs making things worse.
many japanese military officers blamed the countrys problems on corrupt politicians.
they believed that japan was destined to dominate east asia and that straying from traditional beliefs corrupted the country.
the military leaders argued that seizing territory was the only way japan could get the resources it needed.
in september 1931 the japanese army invaded manchuria a resource rich region of northern china.
in october hoping to avoid conflict with the united states emperor hirohitos prime minister asked minister of war hideki tojo to withdraw some troop from china.
tojo refused threatening to bring down the government.
the military was in command of the country.

in 1935 hitler began to defy the treaty of versailles that had ended world war i.
he announced that germany would build a new air force and begin a military draft that would greatly expand its army actions in direct violation of the treaty.
rather than enforce the treaty by going to war european leaders tried to negotiate with hitler.
europes leaders had several reasons for believing or wanting to believe that a deal could be reached with hitler to avoid war.
first they wanted to avoid a repeat of world war i.
second some thought most of hitlers demands were reasonable including his demand that all german speaking regions be united.
third many people assumed that the nazis would want peace once they gained more territory.
the austrian anschluss in late 1937 hitler again called for the unification of all german speaking people including those in austria and czechoslovakia.
he believed that germany could expand its territory only by force.
in february 1938 hitler threatened to invade german speaking austr unless austrian nazis were given important government posts.
austrias chancellor gave in to this demand but then tried to put the matter of unification with germany to a democratic vote.
fearing the outcome hit.
sent troops into austria in march and announced the anschluss or unification of austria and germany.
the munich crisis hitler next announced german claims to the sudetenland an area of czechoslovakia with a large german speaking population.
the czechs strong resisted germanys demands.
france threatened to fight if germany attacked czechoslovakia and the soviet union also promised aid.
prime minister nev chamberlain pledged britains support to france its ally.
representatives of britain france italy and germany met in munich germany to decide czechoslovakias fate.
at the munich conference on september 29 1938 britain and france agreed to hitlers demands a policy that came to be known as appeasement.
in other words they made concessions and believed that if they gave hitler what he wanted they could avoid war.
czechoslovakia had to give up the sudetenland or fight germany on its own.
when chamberlain returned home he stated my good friends for the second time in our history a british prime minister has returned from germany bringing peace with honor.
i believe it is peace for our time go home and get a nice quiet sleep appeasement however failed to preserve the fragile peace.
in march 1939 germany sent troops into czechoslovakia and divided the country.
slovakia became independent in name but it was actually under german control.
the czech lands became a german protectorate.
hitler demands danzig a month after the munich conference hitler demanded that the city of danzig be returned to german control.
danzig was more than 90 percent german and it had been part of poland since world war i hitler also requested a highway and railroad across the polish corridor.
hitlers new demands convinced britain and france that war was inevitable.
on march 31 1939 britain announced that if poland went to war to defend its territory britain and france would come to its aid.
this declaration encouraged poland to refuse hitlers demands.
in may 1939 hitler ordered the german army to prepare to invade poland.
he also ordered his foreign minister to begin negotiations with the soviet union.
if germany was going to fight britain and france hitler did not want to have to fight the soviets too.
the nazi soviet pact when german officials proposed a non aggression treaty to the soviets stalin agreed.
he believed the best way to protect the soviet union was to turn the capitalist nations against each other.
if the treaty worked germany would go to war against britain and france.
the non aggression pact signed by germany and the soviet union on august 23 1939 shocked the world.
communism and nazism were supposed to be opposed to each other.
leaders in britain and france understood however that hitler had made the deal to free himself for war against their countries and poland.
they did not know that the treaty called for the division of poland between germany and the soviet union.
the invasion of poland and the fall of france on september 1 1939 germany invaded poland.
two days later britain and france declared war on germany.
world war ii had begun.

the nye committee meanwhile accusations emerged that arms manufacturers had tricked the united states into entering world war i.
in 1934 senator gerald p nye held hearings to investigate these allegations.
the nye committee report documented the huge profits that arms factories had made during the war and created the impression that these businesses influenced the decision to go to war.
even more americans turned toward isolationism.

on the other side were the republicans supported both by the soviet union and by thousands of volunteers from europe and the united states who went to spain to fight against franco.
the spanish civil war was widely portrayed as the first clash between the forces of fascism and the forces of western democracy and it greatly contributed to growing tensions in europe and to the fear that another world war was coming.
francos forces eventually won the civil war and skills practice work with a partner.
point to a picture in this lesson about the united states entering world war ii.
retell in your own words the part of the text that goes with the picture.
franco became the leader of spain until his death in 1975.
soon after the spanish civil war began hitler and mussolini pledged to cooperate on several international issues and japan aligned itself with germa and italy.
together the three nations became known as the axis powers.
as european tensions worsened congress passed the neutrality act of 1937 continuing the ban on selling arms to warring nations and also requiring thei to buy all nonmilitary supplies from the united states on a cash and carry basis.
countries had to send their own ships to pick up goods and had to pay cash.

neutrality tested guiding question howdid president roosevelt assist britain while maintaining u s neutrality.
roosevelt wanted to help britain and france in their struggle and asked congress to revise the neutrality laws to allow the sale of weapons to warring nations.
congress passed the neutrality act of 1939 permitting the sale of weapons but only on a cash and carry basis.
in the spring of 1940 the united states faced the first test of its neutrality.
britain asked roosevelt for old american destroyers to replenish its fleet and the president used a loophole in the cash only requirement for purchases.
he sent 50 ships to britain in exchange for americas use of british bases in the atlantic.
because the deal did not involve an actual sale the neutrality act did not apply.
widespread acceptance of the destroyers for bases deal indicated a change in public opinion.
by july 1940 most americans favored offering limited aid to the allies but debate continued over the scope of that aid.
the fight for freedom committee wanted the repeal of neutrality laws and stronger actions against germany.
on the other side the america first committee opposed any intervention to help the allies.
after winning reelection in 1940 roosevelt expanded the nations role in the war.
speaking to congress he listed the four freedoms for which both the united states and britain stood freedom of speech freedom of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear.
the lend lease act by december 1940 great britain had run out of funds to fight the war.
roosevelt proposed the lend lease act which allowed the united states to lend or lease arms to any country considered vital to the defense of the united states britain could receive weapons then return them or pay rent for them after the war.
congress passed the lend lease act by a wide margin.
lend lease aid eventually went to the soviet union as well when in june 1941 hitler invaded the soviet union.
roosevelt followed britains lead in supporting any state fighting the nazis.
a hemispheric defense zone the problem of getting american arms and supplies to britain remained.
german submarines in the atlantic sank hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo each month.
the british navy lacked the ships to stop them.
because the united states was still officially neutral roosevelt could not order the navy to protect british cargo ships.
instead he developed the idea s of a hemispheric defense zone declaring that the entire western half of the i atlantic was part of the western hemisphere and therefore neutral.
he then biography winston churchill 1874 1965 british leader winston churchill first won election to parliament in 1900 rising to become head of the british navy in 1911.
in the years leading up to world war ii he spoke out repeatedly against hitler s aggression and after becoming prime minister committed the nation to intense efforts to defeat germany.
churchill became known for his public speaking skills and for his tenacious patriotism during the war.
his conservative party lost power after the war but churchill again served as britain s prime minister from 1951 until his retirement in 1955.

despite the growing tensions in europe it was the japanese attack on pearl harbor that finally brought the united states into world war ii.
ironically roosevelts efforts to help britain fight germany resulted in japans decision to attack the united states.
america embargoes japan as german submarines sank british ships in the atlantic the british begai moving warships from southeast asia leaving india and other colonial possessions vulnerable to japanese attack.
to hinder japanese aggression roosevelt began applying economic pressure.
japan depended on the unit states for many key materials including scrap iron steel and especially oi in july 1940 congress gave the president the power to restrict the sale of strategic materials items important for fighting a war.
roosevelt then blocked the sale of airplane fuel and scrap iron to japan.
furious the japanese signed an alliance with germany and italy becoming a member the axis.
in 1941 roosevelt began sending lend lease aid to china hoping to enable the chinese to tie down the japanese and prevent them from attacking elsewhere.
the strategy failed.
by july 1941 japan had sent military forces into southern indochina directly threatening the british empire.
in response roosevelt froze all japanese assets in the united states reduced the oil shipments to japan and sent general douglas macarthur to the philippines to build up american defenses there.
342 with its war against china in jeopardy because of a lack of resources the japanese military planned to attack the resource rich british and dutch colonies in southeast asia.
they also decided to seize the philippines and to attack the american fleet at pearl harbor.
negotiations with the americans continued but neither side would back down.
in late november 1941 six japanese aircraft carriers two battleships and several other warships set out for hawaii.
surprise attack the japanese government appeared to be continuing negotiations with the united states in good faith.
american intelligence however had decoded japanese messages that made it clear that japan was preparing to go to war against the united states.
on november 27 american commanders at the pearl harbor naval base received a war warning from washington d c but it did not mention hawaii as a possible target.
because of its great distance from japan officials doubted that japan would attack hawaii.
the u s militarys inability to interpret the intelligence correctly left pearl harbor an open target.
japans surprise attack on december 7 1941 was devastating.
eight battleships three cruisers three destroyers and four other vessels were sunk or damaged.
the attack destroyed over 180 aircraft and killed 2 403 americans.
another 1 178 were injured.
that night a gray faced roosevelt met with his cabinet telling them the country faced the most serious crisis since the civil war.
the next day he asked congress to declare war the senate voted 82 to 0 and the house 388 to 1 to declare war on japan.
because american officials did not expect it the attack on pearl harbor was particularly devastating.
critical thinking determining cause and effect what was the immediate result of the attack on pearl harbor.
germany declares war hitler had hoped that japan would attack the united states so that the majority of u s forces would be sent to the pacific front.
he expected the united states to enter the european war as incidents between german submarines and the united states mounted in the atlantic.
hitler underestimated the strategy of the united states which was to view germany as the larger threat but fight the japanese with the u s.

examples of persecution teks texas essential knowledge and skills 7d analyze major issues of world war ii including the holocaust the internment of german italian and japanese americans and executive order 9066 and the development of conventional and atomic weapons during the holocaust the nazis killed nearly 6 million european jews.
the nazis also killed millions of people from other groups they considered inferior.
the hebrew term for the holocaust is shoah meaning catastrophe but it is often used specifically to refer to the nazi campaign to exterminate the jews during world war ii.
the nuremberg laws although the nazis persecuted anyone who dared oppose them as well as the disabled gypsies now known as roma homosexuals and slavic peoples they reserved their strongest hatred for the jews.
this loathing went far beyond the european anti semitism that was common at the time.
in the middle ages jews had been subjected to discrimination and sometimes to mob violence and expulsions.
but in nineteenth and twentieth century western and central europe both the frequency and intensity of anti jewish government policies diminished.
after the nazis took power however they quickly moved to deprive german jews of many established rights.
in september 1935 the nuremberg laws took citizenship away from jewish germans and banned marriage between jews and other germans.
two months later another decree barred jews from holding public office or voting.
another law compelled jews 344 with german sounding names to adopt jewish names.
soon the passports of jews were marked with a red j to identify them as jewish.
by the summer of 1936 at least half of germanys jews were jobless having lost the right to work as civil servants journalists farmers and actors.
in 1938 the nazis also banned jews from practicing law and medicine and from operating businesses.
with no source of income life for jews became very difficult.
despite worsening conditions many jews chose to remain in germany during the early years of nazi rule.
well integrated into german society before this time they were reluctant to leave and give up the lives they had built there.
many also thought that conditions would surely improve after a time.
in fact conditions soon became worse.
kristallnacht on november 7 1938 a young jewish refugee named herschel grynszpan shot and killed a german diplomat in paris.
grynszpans parents and more than 14 000 other polish jews had been deported from germany to poland and the distraught young man was seeking revenge for this act and for the persecution of the jews in general.
using this as a pretext hitler ordered his minister of propaganda joseph goebbels to stage attacks against the jews that would seem like a spontaneous popular reaction to news of the murder.
on the night of november 9 this plan played out in a spree of destruction.
in vienna a jewish child named frederic morton watched in terror that night as nazi storm troopers broke into his familys apartment on kristallnacht november 9 1938 nazi storm troopers destroyed jewish property such as this burned out synagogue and terrorized jewish families across the third reich.

they let the cutlery jangle across the floor the clothes scatter and stepped over the mess to fling the next drawer.
their exuberance was amazing we might be back the leader said.
on the way out he threw our mother of pearl ashtray over his shoulder like confetti.
we did not speak or move or breathe until we heard their boots against the pavement.
quoted in facing history and ourselves the anti jewish violence that erupted throughout germany and austria that night came to be called kristallnacht or night of broken glass because broken glass littered the streets afterward.
by the following morning more than 90 jews were dead hundreds were badly injured and thousands more were terrorized.
the nazis had forbidden police to interfere while roving bands of thugs destroyed 7 500 jewish businesses and hundreds of synagogues.
the lawlessness of kristallnacht continued to persist.
following the initial night of violence the gestapo the governments secret police arrested about 30 000 jewish men.
the state also confiscated insurance payments owed to jewish owners of ruined businesses.

prohibit to make illegal by an authority assume to take for granted or as true jewish refugees try to flee kristallnacht and its aftermath marked a significant escalation of nazi persecutioi against the jews.
many jews including frederic mortons family decided that was time to leave and fled to the united states.
between 1933 when hitler took power and the start of world war ii in 1939 some 250 000 jews escaped nazi controlled germany.
these emigrants included prominent scientists such as albert einstein and business owners lik otto frank who resettled his family in amsterdam in 1933.
ottos daughter anr kept a diary of her familys life in hiding after the nazis overran the netherland the secret annex as she called their hiding place has become a museum.
limits on jewish immigration by 1938 one u s consulate in germai had a backlog of more than 100 000 visa applications from jews trying to leave for the united states.
following the nazi anschluss some 3 000 austrian jews applied for u s visas each day.
most never received visas 1 the united states or to the other countries where they applied.
as a result millions of jews remained trapped in nazi dominated europe.
several factors limited jewish immigration to the united states.
na2 orders prohibited jews from taking more than about four dollars outoi germany.
u s immigration law however forbade granting a visa to anyone likely to become a public charge customs officials tended to assume that this description applied to jews because germany had fore them to leave behind any wealth.
high unemployment rates in the 1930 also made immigration unpopular.
few americans wanted to raise immigration quotas even to accommodate european refugees.
others d not want to admit jews because they held anti semitic attitudes.
the existing immigration policy allowed only 150 000 immigrants annually with a fixed quota from each country.
the law permitted no exceptions refugees or victims of persecution.
international response at an international conference on refugees in 1938 several european countries the united states and latin america stated their regret that they could not take in more of germanys jews without raising their immigration quotas.
meanwhile nazi propaganda chief joseph goebbels announced i f there is any country that believes i has not enough jews i shall gladly turn over to it all our jews hitler also declared himself ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries even on luxury ships as war loomed in 1939 many ships departed from germany cramm with jews desperate to escape.
some of their visas however had been forged or sold illegally and mexico paraguay argentina and costa rica denied access to jews with such documents.
so too did the united state the st louis affair on may 27 1939 the ss st louis entered the harb in havana cuba with 930 jewish refugees on board.
most of these passengers hoped to go to the united states eventually but they had certi icates improperly issued by cubas director of immigration giving em permission to land in cuba.
when the ships arrived in havana the 346 cuban government refused to let the refugees come ashore.
for several days the ships captain steered his ship in circles off the coast of florida awaiting official permission to dock at a u s port.
denied permission the ship turned back toward europe disembarking in france holland belgium and great britain.
within two years the first three of these countries fell under nazi domination.
many of the refugees brought to these countries perished in the nazis final solution q rfading progress check explaining what factors made it difficult for jewish people to leave europe.

on january 20 1942 nazi leaders met at the wannsee conference to coordinate the final solution of the jewish question previous solutions had included rounding up jews gypsies slavs and others from conquered areas shooting them and piling them into mass graves.
another method forced jews and other undesirables into trucks and then piped in exhaust fumes to kill them.
these methods however had proven too slow and inefficient for the nazis.
at wannsee the nazis made plans to round up jews from the vast areas of nazi controlled europe.
jews were taken to detention centers known as concentration camps.
there healthy individuals would work as slave laborers until they dropped dead of exhaustion disease or malnutrition.
most others including the elderly young children and the i infirm among them laborers who could no longer work would be sent to extermination camps attached to many of the concentration camps to be.
executed in massive gas chambers.
concentration camp a camp where persons are detained or confined extermination camp a camp where men women and children were sent to be executed concentration camps the nazis had established their first concentration camps in 1933 to jail political opponents.
after the war began the nazis built concentration camps throughout europe.

places and regions which three nations had the highest number of jewish losses.
as one of the largest concentration camps buchenwald had more tha 200 000 prisoners working 12 hour shifts as slave laborers in nearby factories.
although buchenwald had no gas chambers hundreds of prisoners died there every month from exhaustion and horrible living conditions.
as a u s army chaplain wrote in his diary in 1945 primarysource one thousand weimar citizens toured the buchenwald camp in groups of 100.
they saw blackens skeletons and skulls in the ovens ofthe crematorium.
in the yard outside they saw a heap of white human ashes and bones those who were dead were stripped of their clothing and lay naked m stacked like cordwood waiting to be burned in the crematory.
at one time 5 000 had been stacked the vacant lot next to the crematory.
from the diary of captain luther d fletcher qu world war ii from the battle front to the hon leon bass a young american soldier saw buchenwald at the end of the war.
a room built to hold 50 people had housed more than 150 with bunk beds built almost to the ceiling.
bass recalled primarysource i looked at a bottom bunk and there i saw one man.
he was too weak to get up he could just b3i turn his head.
he was skin and bones.
he looked like a skeleton and his eyes were deep set.
he didr utter a sound he just looked at me with those eyes and they still haunt me today.
quoted in facing history ond 0 extermination camps in late 1941 the nazis built extermination facilities at the chelmno and auschwitz camps in poland.
after the wannsee conference extermination facilities were built at four other camps in poland.
at these camps including the infamous treblinka jews were the nazis main victims.
auschwitz alone housed about 100 000 people in 300 prison barracks.
its gas chambers built to kill 2 000 people at a time could gas 12 000 people in a day.
of the estimated 1 600 000 people who died at auschwitz about 1 300 000 were jews.
most of the others were poles soviet prisoners of war or gypsies.
upon arrival at auschwitz healthy prisoners were selected for slave labor.
elderly or disabled people the sick and mothers and children went immediately to the gas chambers after which their bodies were burned in giant crematoriums.
in only a few years jewish culture which had existed in europe for more than 1 000 years had been virtually obliterated by the nazis in the lands they conquered.
despite exhaustive debate there is still great controversy about why and how an event so horrifying as the holocaust could have occurred.
no consensus has been reached but most historians point to a number of factors the german peoples sense of injury after world war i severe economic problems hitlers control over the german nation the lack of a strong tradition of representative government in germany german fear of hitlers secret police and a long history of anti jewish prejudice and discrimination in europe.

fighting a global war troubled president roosevelt but not british prime minister winston churchill who knew that victory depended on industry.
he compared the american economy to a gigantic boiler once the fire is lighted under it there is no limit to the power it can generate converting the economy war production increased rapidly after the attack on pearl harbor helped by existing government plans to build thousands of warplanes and a two ocean navy.
roosevelt believed that government and business had to work together to prepare for war.
he created the national defense advisory committee and asked business leaders to serve on the committee.
the president and his advisers believed that giving industry incentives to produce goods quickly was the best way to rapidly mobilize the economy.
normally the government asked companies to bid on contracts to produce military equipment a slow process.
instead the government signed cost plus contracts agreeing to pay a company the cost to make a product plus a guaranteed percentage as profit.
under the cost plus system the more and faster a company produced the more money it made.
although not cheap the system got war materials produced quickly and in quantity.
cost plus convinced many companies to convert to war production and congress authorized the reconstruction finance corporation rfc to make loans to companies wanting to convert.
american industry gets the job done by the fall of 1941 much had already been done to prepare the economy for war but it was still only partially mobilized.

the philippines had fallen to the japanese.
the doolittle raid on tokyo even before the philippines fell president roosevelt was searching for way to raise the morale of the american people.
he wanted to bomb tc but american planes could reach tokyo only if an aircraft carrier brouj them close enough.
however japanese ships in the north pacific preve carriers from getting near japan.
in early 1942 a military planner suggested replacing the carriers u short range bombers with long range b 25 bombers that could attack f farther away.
the only problem was that although b 25s could take off from a carrier the bombers could not land on its short deck.
after attac japan they would have to land in china.

the battle of the coral sea the japanese believed that they could safely proceed with two attacks at once because they thought their operations were secret.
what the japanese did not know was that an american team of code breakers based in hawaii had already broken the japanese navys secret code for conducting operations.
in march 1942 decoded japanese messages alerted the united states to the japanese attack on new guinea.
in response admiral nimitz sent two carriers the yorktown and the lexington to intercept the japanese in the coral sea.
there in early may carriers from both sides launched all out airstrikes against each other.
although the japanese sank the lexington and badly damaged the yorktown the american attacks prevented the japanese from landing on new guineas south coast and kept the supply lines to australia open.
the navajo code talkers when american marines stormed an enemy beach they used radios to communicate.
using radios however meant that the japanese could intercept and translate the messages.
in the midst of the battle there was no time to use a code machine.

once the marines reached the beach t battle was still far from over.
although many troops died wading ashore on vehicle had been able to cross the reef and deliver its troops onto the beaches.
the vehicle was a boat with tank tracks nicknamed the alligator this amphibious tractor or amphtrac had been invented in the late 1930s to rescue people in florida swamps.
it had never been used in combat and the navy decided to buy only 2 of them in 1941.
if more had been available at tarawa american casualties probably would have been much lower.
more than 1 000 marines died on tarawa.

the next assault kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands went mu more smoothly.
this time all of the troops went ashore in amphtracs.
although the japanese resisted fiercely the marines captured kwajalein and nearby eniwetok with far fewer casualties.
after the marshall islands the navy targeted the mariana islands.
ameri military planners wanted to use the marianas as a base for a new heavy bomb the b 29 superfortress.
the b 29 could fly farther than any other plane in the world.
from airfields in the marianas b 29s could bomb japan.
admiral nin decided to invade three of the mariana islands saipan tinian and guam.
despite strong japanese resistance american troops captured all three by august 1944.
a few months later b 29s began bombing japan.
macarthur returns as the forces under admiral nimitz hopped across the central pacific general douglas macarthurs troops began their own campaign in the southwest pacific.
the campaign began by invading guadalcanal in the solomon islands east of new guinea in august 1942.
it continued until early 1944 when macarthurs troops finally captured enough islands to surround the main japanese base in the region.
in response the japanesi withdrew their ships and aircraft from the base although they left 100 0 troops behind to hold the island.
worried that the navys advance across the central pacific was leavin him behind macarthur ordered his forces to leap nearly 600 miles 9661 to capture the japanese base at hollandia on the north coast of new guinea.
shortly after securing new guinea macarthurs troops seized t island of morotai the last stop before the philippines.
to take back the philippines the united states assembled an enormous invasion force.
in october 1944 over 700 ships carrying more than 160 000 372 photo digital stock corbis royalty troops sailed for leyte gulf in the philippines.
on october 20 the troops beg to land on leyte an island on the eastern side of the philippines.
a few hours after the invasion began macarthur headed to the beach.
upon reaching the shore he strode to a radio and spoke into the microphone people ofthe philippines i have returned.
by the grace of almighty god our forces stand again on philippine soil to stop the american invasion the japanese sent four aircraft carriers toward the philippines from the north and secretly dispatched another fleet from the west.
believing the japanese carriers were leading the main attack most of the american carriers protecting the invasion left leyte gulf and headed north to stop them.
seizing their chance the japanese warships to the west raced through the philippine islands into leyte gulf and ambushed the remaining american ships.
the battle of leyte gulf was the largest naval battle in history.
it was also the first time that the japanese used kamikaze attacks.
kamikaze means divine wind in japanese.
it refers to the great storm that destroyed the mongol fleet during its invasion of japan in the thirteenth century.
kamikaze pilots would deliberately crash their planes into american ships killing themselves but also inflicting severe damage.
luckily for the americans just as their situation was becoming desperate the japanese commander believing more american ships were on the way ordered a retreat.
although the japanese fleet had retreated the campaign to recapture the philippines from the japanese was long and grueling.
more than 80 000 japanese were killed fewer than 1 000 surrendered.
macarthurs troops did not capture manila until march 1945.
the battle left the city in ruins and more than 100 000 filipino civilians dead.
the remaining japanese retreated into the rugged terrain north of manila they were still fighting in august 1945 when word came that japan had surrendered.

he wanted to get u s troops into battle in europe but prime minister churchill did n believe the united states and britain were ready to invade eurof instead the prime minister wanted to attack the periphery or edges of the german empire.
roosevelt eventually agreed andi july 1942 he ordered the invasion of morocco and algeria tw french territories indirectly under german control.
the battle for north africa roosevelt decided to invade for two reasons.
the invasion woul give the army some experience without requiring a lot of troops it would also help the british troops fight the germans in egypt most of britains empire including india hong kong singapon malaya and australia sent supplies to britain through egypts suez canal.
german general erwin rommel whose success earned him nickname desert fox commanded the afrika korps after a 12 day battle at the egyptian coastal city of el alamein the brit secured the suez canal and forced rommel to retreat in novem 1942.

american cargo ships were easy targets especially at night when the glow from the cities in the night sky silhouetted the vessels.
to protect the ships citizens on the east coast dimmed their lights every evening and put up special blackout curtains if they had to drive at night they did so with their headlights off.
by august 1942 german submarines had sunk about 360 american ships along the east coast including many oil tankers.
the loss of so many ships convinced the u s navy to set up a convoy system in which cargo ships traveled in groups escorted by warships.
the convoy system improved the situation dramatically making it much more difficult for a submarine to torpedo a cargo ship and escape without being attacked.
the spring of 1942 marked the high point of the german submarine campaign.
in may and june alone more than 1 2 million tons of shipping were sunk.
yet in those same two months american and british shipyards built more than 1 1 million tons of new shipping.
at the same time american airplanes and warships began to use new technology including radar sonar and depth charges to locate and attack submarines.
as the new technology began to take its toll on german submarines the battle of the atlantic turned in favor of the allies.

striking germany and italy guiding question iv iof were the goals of strategic bombing in germany and the invasion of sicily.
the allied invasion of north africa in november 1942 had shown that a large scale invasion from the sea was possible.
the success of the landinj convinced roosevelt to meet again with churchill to plan the next stage the war.
in january 1943 roosevelt headed to casablanca morocco tor the prime minister.
at the casablanca conference roosevelt and churchill agreed to step up the bombing of germany.
the goal of this new campaign was the progressive destruction of the german military industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the german people the allies also agreed to attack the axis on the island of sicily.
churchill called italy the soft underbelly of europe.
he was convinced that the italians would quit the war if the allies invaded their homeland strategic bombing the allies had been bombing germany even before the casablanca conference.
britains royal air force had dropped an average of 2 300 2 093 t of explosives on germany every month for more than three y the united states eighth army air force had dropped an additional 1 tons 1 365 t of bombs during the last six months of 1942.
these numl were small however compared to the massive new campaign.
between january 1943 and may 1945 the royal air force and the united states eighth army air force dropped approximately 53 000 tons 48 2301 of explosives on germany every month.
the bombing campaign did not destroy germanys economy or undermine german morale but it did cause a severe oil shortage and wrecked the railroad system.
it also destroyed so many aircraft factork that germany s air force could not replace its losses.
by the time the al landed in france they had control of the air ensuring that their troop would not be bombed.
striking the soft underbelly as the bombing campaign against germany intensified plans to invad sicily also moved ahead.
general dwight d eisenhower commanded invasion with general patton and british general bernard montgome 376 heading the ground forces.
the invasion began before dawn on july 10 1943.
despite bad weather the allied troops made it ashore with few casualties.
a new amphibious truck delivered supplies and artillery to the soldiers on the beach.
eight days after the troops came ashore american tanks smashed through enemy lines and captured the western half of the island.
pattons troops then headed east while the british attacked from the south.
by august 17 the germans had evacuated the island.
the attack on sicily created a crisis within the italian government.
the king of italy victor emmanuel and a group of italian generals decided that it was time to depose mussolini.
on july 25 1943 the king invited the dictator to his palace.
my dear duce the king began its no longer any good.
italy has gone to bits.
army morale is at rock bottom.
the soldiers dont want to fight anymore.
you can certainly be under no illusion as to italys feelings with regard to yourself.
at this moment you are the most hated man in italy the king then arrested mussolini and the new italian government began negotiating a surrender to the allies.
following italys surrender however german troops seized control of northern italy including rome and returned mussolini to power.
the germans then took up positions near the heavily fortified town of cassino.

in 1996 his actions earned him a medal of honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty in action on 5 and 6 april 1945.
this made baker one of seven african american world war ii veterans to receive belated recognition for their service.
critical thinking drawing conclusions why were baker s actions so important to the assault on castle aghinolfi.
attack such difficult terrain the allies landed at anzio behind german lines.
instead of retreating however as the allies had hoped the germans surrounded the allied troops near anzio.
it took the allies five months to break through the german lines at cassino and anzio.
finally in late may 1944 the germans retreated.
less than two weeks later the allies captured rome.
fighting in italy continued however for another year.
the italian campaign was one ofthe bloodiest in the war with more than 300 000 allied casualties.
the tehran conference roosevelt wanted to meet with stalin before the allies invaded france.
in late 1943 stalin agreed proposing that roosevelt and churchill meet him in tehran iran.
the leaders reached several agreements.
stalin promised to launch a full scale offensive against the germans when the allies invaded france in 1944.
roosevelt and stalin then agreed to divide germany after the war so that it would never again threaten world peace.
stalin promised that once germany was defeated the soviet union would help the united states against japan.
he also accepted roosevelts proposal of an international peacekeeping organization after the war.

the d day invasion guiding question what if d day had failed and germany had defeated the allies in europe.
after the conference in tehran roosevelt headed to cairo egypt where 1 and churchill continued planning an invasion of france to force german again fight the war on two fronts.
one major decision still had to be made the president had to choose the commander for operation overlord the code name for the invasion.
roosevelt selected general eisenhower.
planning operation overlord hitler had fortified the french coast along the english channel but he d not know when or where the allies would land.
the germans believed tl landing would be in pas de calais the area of france closest to britain.
the allies encouraged this belief by placing dummy equipment along the coast across from calais.
the real target was farther south a 60 mile stre of five beaches along the normandy coast.
the selection of a site for the largest amphibious landing in history wa one ofthe biggest decisions of world war ii.
allied planners considered coastlines from denmark to portugal in search of a sheltered location with firm flat beaches within range of friendly fighter planes in england.
there ad to be enough roads and paths to move jeeps and trucks off the beache 378 and to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of american canadian and british troops set to stream ashore following the invasion.
an airfield and a seaport that the allies could use were also needed.
most important was a reasonable expectation of achieving the element of surprise.
planners also discussed who should lead france after the invasion.
general eisenhower had informed charles de gaulle that the french resistance forces would assist in the liberation of paris but president roosevelt was not sure he trusted de gaulle and refused to recognize him as the official french leader.
by the spring of 1944 more than 1 5 million american soldiers 12 000 airplanes and 5 million tons 4 6 million t of equipment had been sent to england.
only setting the invasion date and giving the command to go remained.
the invasion had to begin at night to hide the ships crossing the english channel.
the ships had to arrive at low tide so that they could see the beach obstacles.
the low tide had to come at dawn so that gunners bombarding the coast could see their targets.
paratroopers who would be dropped behind enemy lines needed a moonlit night to see where to land.
perhaps most important of all was good weather.
a storm would ground the airplanes and high waves would swamp landing craft.
given all these requirements there were only a few days each month to begin the invasion.
the first opportunity was from june 5 to 7 1944.
eisenhowers planning staff referred to the day any operation began by the letter d the invasion date therefore came to be known as d day.
heavy cloud cover strong winds and high waves made june 5 impossible.
the weather was forecast to improve briefly a day later.
the channel would still be rough but the landing ships and aircraft briefly for a short time allied troops from various parts ofthe british coast headed for normandy beaches for the d day invasion.

thousands of shells rained down o the beaches code named utah omaha gold sword and juno the american landing at utah beach went well.
the german defenses were weak and in less than three hours the troops had captured the bead and moved inland suffering fewer than 200 casualties.
on the eastern flank the british and canadian landings also went well.
by the end of the day british and canadian forces were several miles inland.
omaha beach however was a different story.
surrounded at both ends by cliffs that rose wall like from the sea omaha beach was only foui miles long.
the entire beach overlooked a 150 foot high bluff and there were only five ravines leading from the beach to the top of the bluff.
the germans had made full use of the geographic advantage the high bluff gave them.
they dug trenches and built concrete bunkers for machine guns at the top of the cliffs and positioned them to guard the ravines leading to the beach.
under intense german fire the american assault almost disintegrated.
general omar bradley commander of the american forces landing at omaha and utah began making plans to evacuate.
slowly however the american troops began to knock out the german defenses.
more landing craft arrived ramming their way through the obstacles to get to the bead nearly 2 500 americans were either killed or wounded on omaha but by early afternoon bradley received this message troops formerly pinned down on beaches.

the battle of iwo jima on november 24 1944 bombs fell on tokyo.
above the city flew 80 b 29 superfortress bombers that had traveled more than 1 500 miles 2 414 km from new american bases in the mariana islands.
many of their bombs missed the targets.
by the time the b 29s reached japan they did not have enough fuel left to fix their navigational errors or to adjust for high winds.
the pilots needed an island closer to japan so the b 29s could refuel.
american military planners chose iwo jima.
iwo jima was perfectly located roughly halfway between the marianas and japan but its geography was formidable.
it had a dormant volcano at its southern tip and rugged terrain with rocky cliffs jagged ravines and dozens ol caves.
volcanic ash covered the ground.
even worse the japanese had built a vast network of concrete bunkers connected by miles of tunnels.
on february 19 1945 some 60 000 marines landed on iwo jima.
as the troops leaped from the amphtracs they sank up to their ankles in the soft ash and were pounded by japanese artillery.

the bombs would not only explode but would also start fires.
even if the b 29s missed their targets the fires they started would spread to the intended targets.
the use of firebombs was very controversial because the fires would also kill civilians however lemay could think of no other way to destroy japans war production quickly.

wherever i turned my eyes i sawpe seeking air to breathe quoted in american heritage new history of world the firebombing of tokyo killed more than 80 000 people and destro more than 250 000 buildings.
by the end of june 1945 japans six key industrial cities had been firebombed.
by the end of the war the b 29s h firebombed 67 japanese cities.
the invasion of okinawa despite the massive damage that firebombing caused there were few signs ii the spring of 1945 that japan was ready to quit.
many american officials believed the japanese would not surrender until japan had been invaded.
to prepare for the invasion the united states needed a base near japan to stock supplies and build up troops.
iwo jima was small and still too far away.
milit planners chose okinawa only 350 miles 563 km from mainland japan.
american troops landed on okinawa on april 1 1945.
instead of defending the beaches the japanese troops took up positions in the islands rugged mountains.
to dig the japanese out of their caves and bunkers the american troops had to fight their way up steep slopes agai constant machine gun and artillery fire.
more than 12 000 american soldiers sailors and marines died during the fighting but by june 22 1 okinawa had finally been captured.
the terms for surrender shortly after the united states captured okinawa the japanese empero hirohito urged his government to find a way to end the war.
the biggt problem was the american demand for unconditional surrender.
many japanese leaders were willing to surrender but on one condition hirol had to stay in power.
american officials knew that the fate of hirohito was the most impo issue for the japanese.
most americans however blamed the emperor ft war and wanted him removed from power.
president truman was reluct to go against public opinion.
furthermore he knew the united states w almost ready to test a new weapon that might force japan to surrender without any conditions.
the new weapon was the atomic bomb.
the manhattan project in 1939 leo szilard a jewish physicist who had fled nazi persecution learned that german scientists had split the uranium atom.
szilard ha been the first scientist to suggest that splitting the atom might release enormous energy.
worried that the nazis were working on an atomic bomb szilard convinced the worlds best known physicist albert ein to sign a letter szilard had drafted and send it to president roosevelt letter einstein warned that by using uranium extremely powerful be of a new type may be constructed roosevelt responded by setting up a scientific committee to study issue.
in 1941 the committee met with british scientists who were alrc working on an atomic bomb.
the americans then convinced rooseve begin a program to build an atomic bomb.
384 the secret american program to build an atomic bomb was code named the manhattan project and was headed by general leslie r groves.
the first breakthrough came in 1942 when szilard and enrico fermi another physicist built the worlds first nuclear reactor at the university of chicago.
groves then organized a team of engineers and scientists to build an atomic bomb at a secret laboratory in los alamos new mexico.
physicist j robert oppenheimer led the team.
on july 16 1945 they detonated the worlds first atomic bomb in new mexico.
hiroshima and nagasaki even before the bomb was tested american officials began debating how to use it.
admiral william leahy chairman of the joint chiefs of staff opposed using the bomb because it would kill civilians.
he believed an economic blockade and conventional bombing would convince japan to surrender.
secretary of war henry stimson wanted to warn the japanese about the bomb and tell them their emperor could stay in power if they surrendered.
secretary of state james byrnes however wanted to drop the bomb on japan without any warning.
president truman later wrote that he regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubts that it should be used his advisers had warned him to expect massive casualties if the united states invaded japan.
truman believed it was his duty as president to use every weapon available to save american lives.
analyzing primary sources o o nuclear relating to the nucleus of an atom a key figure ofthe nuclear age enrico fermi proved a nuclear reaction could be initiated controlled and stopped.
criticalthinking identifying central ideas why was enrico fermi s work on nuclear reactions so important.
people continue to debate whether president truman s decision to drop atomic bombs on japan was the best way to end world war ii.
m the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base.
if japan does not surrender bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries and unfortunately thousands of civilian lives will be lost having found the bomb we have used it.
we have used it against those who attacked us without warning at pearl harbor against those who have starved and beaten and executed american prisoners of war against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare.
we have used it in order to shorten the agony of war in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young americans s truman radio report to the american people august 9 1945 harry s truman president of the united states it is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at hiroshima and nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against japan.
the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because ofthe effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons william leahy chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening.
my own feeling was that in being the first to use it we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians ofthe dark ages.

the allies threatened japan with prompt and utter destruction if t nation did not surrender but the japanese did not reply.
truman then ordered the military to drop the bomb.
on august 6 1945 a b 29 bomb named enola gay dropped an atomic bomb code named little boy 01 hiroshima an important industrial city.
the bomb destroyed about 63 percent of the city.
between 80 000 ar 120 000 people died instantly and thousands more died later from burn and radiation sickness.
three days later on august 9 the soviet union declared war on japan.
later that day the united states dropped anothe atomic bomb code named fat man on the city of nagasaki killing between 35 000 and 74 000 people.
faced with such massive destructioi and the shock of the soviets joining the war hirohito ordered his government to surrender.
on august 15 1945 v j day japan surrendered.
the long war was over.
putting the enemy on trial in august 1945 the united states britain france and the soviet union created the international military tribunal imt to punish german an japanese leaders for war crimes.
the tribunal held trials in nuremberg germany where hitler had staged nazi party rallies.
twenty two german leaders were prosecuted at the nuremberg tri three were acquitted 7 were given prison sentences and 12 were sentei to death.
trials of lower ranking leaders continued until april 1949 lea to 24 more executions and 107 prison sentences.
similar trials were held in tokyo.
the imt for the far east charged 25 japanese leaders with war crimes.
the allies did not indict hirohito fearing that any attempt to put the emperor on trial would lead to an uprising.
eighteen japanese defendants were sentenced to prison.
the i were sentenced to death by hanging.
386 the trials punished many of the people responsible for world war ii and the holocaust but they were also part of the american plan for building a better world.
as robert jackson chief counsel for the united states at nuremberg said in his opening statement to the court the wrongs we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated so malignant and so devastating that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their being repeated world war ii a turning point the years 1939 1945 were a major turning point in world history.
by the end of world war ii large areas of the worlds great powers britain france germany japan and the soviet union lay devastated.
germany and japan were occupied by foreign armies.
some 25 million people had been killed.
japans empire was gone and the european empires would never fully recover.
over the next three decades nearly all of the subject peoples of the british french and dutch empires would gain their independence.
new countries in africa asia and the middle east were born.
the middle eastern conflict between the new nation of israel and the arab nations was itself a direct result of world war ii.
the war also opened a new era in american history.
the american economy was undamaged and by the mid 1940s it was producing over 35 percent of the entire worlds gross domestic product.
a vast american military force was deployed in europe and asia and it also controlled the worlds first nuclear weapons.
the united states had emerged as the worlds strongest economic and military power.
it was in a position of such strength and dominance that a new term superpower was later coined to describe its relationship to the rest of the world.
only one other country had the potential to rival the united states at the end of the war.
the soviet union although devastated from germanys invasion had built its own enormous army and industrial capacity.
soviet troops were in control of eastern europe and communist ideas posed the only real ideological challenge to american ideas of democracy free enterprise and limited government.
although world war ii had put an end to nazism the struggle had left europe divided and the resulting tensions between former allies would soon lead to a new international conflict known as the cold war.

historian gar alperovitz argues that truman had alternatives to the atomic bomb but chose to use the weapon to pressure stalin and force japan s surrender before the soviets could join the war.
quite simply it is not true that the atomic bomb was used because it was the only way to save the hundreds of thousands or millions of lives as was subsequently claimed.
the readily available options were to modify the surrender terms and or await the shock of the russian attack even if one were to accept the most inflated estimates of lives saved by the atomic bomb the fact remains that it was an act of violent destruction aimed at large concentrations of noncombatants 99 from the decision to use the atomic bomb historian herbert feis argues that truman dropped the bomb to avoid an invasion of japan.
their thoughts about its employment were governed by one reason which was deemed imperative that by using the bomb the agony of war might be ended more quickly.

it matters because through the late 1800s and early 1900s imperialism shifting national boundaries old alliances and nationalist sentiment among european nations set the stage for world war i.
attack on u s ships and american support for the allies eventually caused the united states to enter the war.
the causes of world war i guiding question what political circumstances in europe led to world warl.
in 1914 tensions were building among european nations stemmin from events that dated to the 1860s.
in 1864 while americans fought the civil war the german kingdom of prussia launched th first of a series of wars to unite the various german states into one nation.
by 1871 prussia had united germany and established the german empire which became one of the most powerful nations i the world transforming european politics.
militarism and alliances in 1870 as part of its plan to unify germany prussia forced fran to give up territory along the german border.
as a result france and germany became enemies.
to protect itself germany signed alliances with italy and with the huge empire of austria hungary which controlled much of southeastern europe.
this became known as the triple alliance.
the new alliance alarmed russian leaders who feared that germany intended to expand eastward.
in addition russia and austria eiungary were competing for influence in southeastern europe.
a common interest in opposing germany and austria hungary led russia and france to sign the franco russia alliance in 1894.
under the alliance the two nations promised to come to each other s aid in a war against the triple alliance.
such alliances fostered militarism the strong buildup of armed forces to intimidate and threaten other nations.
over time german militarism led britain to become involved in the alliance 232 system.
britain s policy was to try to prevent one nation from controlling all of europe.
by the late 1800s germany had clearly become europes strongest nation.
in 1898 germany began building a large modern navy.
the buildup threatened the british who rushed to build warships.
by the early 1900s britain and germany were engaged in an arms race.
the race convinced britain to build closer ties with france and russia.
the british refused to sign a formal alliance so the relationship became known as an entente cordiale or friendly understanding.
britain france and russia became known as the triple entente.
imperialism and nationalism by the late 1800s nationalism or a feeling of intense pride in ones homeland had become a powerful idea in europe.
nationalists place primary emphasis on promoting their homelands culture and interests.
they believe in the right of self determination the idea that those who share a national identity should have their own country and government.
in the 1800s nationalism led to a crisis in the balkan region of southeastern europe.
in the 1700s and 1800s imperialism the ruling or controlling of other peoples or nations through annexation military conquest or economic domination was how european powers built empires.
for years the ottoman empire and the austro hungarian empire had ruled the balkans.
but as nationalism spread in the late 1800s and early 1900s national groups such as the south slavs serbs bosnians croats and slovenes began to press for independence.
the serbs who were the first to gain independence formed a nation called serbia between the two empires.
serbia believed that its mission was to unite the south slavs.
russia supported the serbs but austria hungary worked to limit serbias growth.
in 1908 austria hungary annexed bosnia which had belonged to the ottoman empire outraging the serbs.
the annexation demonstrated that austria hungary had no intention of letting the slavic people in its empire become independent.
an assassination brings war in june 1914 archduke franz ferdinand heir to the austro hungarian throne visited the bosnian capital of sarajevo.
as he and his wife rode through the city bosnian revolutionary gavrilo princip rushed their car and shot them dead.
the assassination occurred with the knowledge of serbian officials who hoped to start a war that would damage austria hungary.
austria hungary decided the time had come to crush serbia in order to prevent slavic nationalism from undermining its empire.
knowing an attack on serbia might trigger a war with russia the austrians asked their german allies for support.
austria hungary then issued an ultimatum to the serbian government.
the serbs counted on russia to back them up and the russians in turn counted on france.
on july 28 austria hungary declared war on serbia.
russia immediately mobilized its army including troops stationed on the german border.
within days germany declared war on russia and france.

during world war i both britain and germany produced propaganda posters.
german propaganda was mostly anti russian and did not appeal to americans however while british propaganda did.
criticalthinking analyzing primary sources what message does this poster want to convince the viewer to believe.
propaganda the spreading of ideas about an institution or individual for the purpose of influencing opinion thinking like a n historian determining cause and effect propaganda is a powerful force to influence opinion.
in wartime propaganda can be used to convince people to take sides or participate for a particular cause or reason.
as a historian how much do you think the british propaganda swayed the united states to support the allies in world war i or were other reasons such as business more of a deciding factor.
the united states enters the war guiding question what events motivated the united states tojoin the war.
when world war i began president wilson was determined to keep the united states out of a european conflict.
he immediately declared the united states to be neutral and asked all americans to be impartial in thought as well as in action despite wilsons hopes for neutrality events gradually drew the united states into the war on the side of the allies.
the neutrality debate despite the presidents plea most americans supported one side or the other.
many german americans supported their homeland and many iri americans harbored hostility toward britain but in general public opinic favored the allies.
many americans valued the heritage language and political ideals they shared with britain.
others treasured americas links with france a great friend to america during the revolutionary war.
for more than two years the united states remained neutral.
during this time a great debate began over whether the country should prepare f war.
supporters of the preparedness movement believed that preparing was the best way to make sure the united states was not forced into the conflict.
others disagreed.
in 1915 carrie chapman catt and jane addams leaders of the womens suffrage movement founded the womens peace party.
this organization along with others such as the league to limit armament worked to keep america out of the war.
one select group of americans was decidedly pro british president wilsons cabinet.
only secretary of state william jennings bryan favored neutrality.
the other cabinet members argued forcefully on behalf of brit many u s military leaders also backed britain believing an allied victor was the only way to preserve the worlds balance of power.
british officials worked diligently to win american support.
one method they used was propaganda or information designed to influenc opinion.
the british cut the transatlantic telegraph cable from europe to united states so most war news would be based on british reports.
the american ambassador to britain endorsed many of these reports and american public opinion swayed in favor ofthe allies.
234 companies in the united states also had strong ties to the allies and many american banks invested heavily in an allied victory.
by 1917 american loans to the allies totaled over 2 billion.
although other banks particularly in the midwest where pro german feelings were strongest lent some 27 million to germany the countrys prosperity was intertwined with the allies.
if the allies won the investments would be paid back if not the money might never be repaid.
moving toward war a series of events gradually eroded american neutrality and drew the united states into the war.
shortly after the war began the british blockaded german ports.
they forced neutral merchant ships sailing to europe to land at british ports to be inspected for contraband or goods prohibited from shipment to germany and its allies.
although the u s government protested britains decision the german response angered americans even more.
in february 1915 the germans announced that they would use submarines called u boats to sink without warning any ship they found in the waters around britain.
this decision violated an international treaty signed by germany that banned attacks on civilian ships without warning.
erode to wear away at something until it disappears contraband goods whose importation exportation or possession is illegal analyzing primary sources should the united states stay neutral in world war i.
many americans were divided about whether the united states should remain neutral.
voices spoke out loudly on both sides.
yes no germany is not moving against this country.
she has not been guilty of any aggression against us.
she has taken the lives of a few of our citizens because they got in the way when she was prosecuting a war against another nation and fighting to preserve her existence.

this ultimate necessity must be constantly in our minds in all our controversies with the belligerents.

the attack gave credibility to british propaganda and changed american attitude about the war.
wilson sent an official protest to germany but in mari 1916 a u boat torpedoed a french passenger ship.
wilson then decided to issue one last warning demanding that the german government abandon its methods or risk war with the united states.
germany did not want to strengthen the allies by drawing the united states into the war.

their ideas about planning and management shaped how the government organized the war effort.

these agencies emphasized cooperation between big business and government.
the war industries board wib coordinated the production of war materials.
early problems convinced president wilson to expand the board s powers.
the wib told manufacturers what they could produce allocated raw materials ordered new factory construction and sometimes set prices.
the food administration run by herbert hoover was responsible for increasing food production while reducing civilian consumption.
the agency encouraged families to conserve food and grow their own vegetables in victory gardens.
eat more corn oats and rye products fish and poultry fruits vegetables and potatoes baked boiled and broiled foods eat less wheat meat sugar and fats to save for the army and our allies urged food administration posters.
the fuel administration managed use of coal and oil.

to fund the war effort congress raised income tax rates placed new taxes on corporate profits imposed an extra tax on the profits of arms factories and borrowed over 20 billion through the sale of liberty bonds and victory bonds.
americans who bought bonds were lending money to the government to be repaid with interest in a specified number of years.
mobilizing the workforce the war effort also required the cooperation of workers.
to prevent strikes from disrupting the war effort the government established the national war labor board nwlb in april 1918.
the nwlb often pressured industry to improve wages adopt an eight hour workday and allow unions the right to organize and bargain collectively.
in exchange labor leaders agreed not to disrupt war production.
as a result membership in unions increased by over one million between 1917 and 1919.
with so many men in the military employers were willing to hire women for jobs traditionally held by men.
some 1 million women joined the workforce for the first time and another 8 million switched to better industrial jobs.
women worked in factories shipyards and railroad yards and served as police officers mail carriers and train engineers.
when the war ended however most women returned to their previous jobs or stopped working.
yet the changes demonstrated that women were capable of holding jobs that many had believed only men could do.
desperate for workers henry ford sent agents to the south to recruit african americans.
other companies quickly followed suit.
promises of high wages and plentiful work convinced between 300 000 and 500 000 african americans to move north.
this massive population movement became known as the great migration.
the racial makeup of such cities as chicago new york cleveland and detroit changed greatly.
eventually so did politics in the northern cities where african americans were able to vote.
the war also encouraged other groups to migrate.
between 1917 and 1920 more than 100 000 mexicans migrated into the southwest providing labor for farmers and ranchers.
mexican americans also found new charts graphs to pay for the war the u s government raised taxes and issued bonds.
the government printed posters organized parades and asked movie stars to help promote war bonds.

mexican americans tended o settle in separate neighborhoods called barrios where hey could support one another.
shaping public opinion progressives did not think that organizing the economy was enough to ensure the success of the war effort.
they also believed the government needed to shape public opinion.
soon after congress declared war wilson created the committee on public information cpi to sell the war to the american people.
headed by journalist george creel the cpi recruited advertising executives artists authors songwriters entertainers public speakers and motion picture companies to help sway public opinion in favor ofthe war.
the cpi distributed pamphlets and arranged for thousands of four minute speeches to be delivered at movie theaters and other public places.
some 75 000 speakers known as four minute men urged audiences to support the war in various ways from buying war bonds to reporting draft dodgers to the authorities.
nongovernmental groups also helped raise awareness and funds for the war.
for example the american jewish joint distribution committee raised 63 million in relief funds.
the jewish welfare board set up centers at home and abroad for jewish servicemen.
the supreme court limits free speech in addition to using propaganda the government passed legislation to limit opposition to the war and to fight espionage or spying to acquire government information.
the espionage act of 1917 made it illegal to aid the enemy give false reports or interfere with the war effort.
the sedition act of 1918 made it illegal to speak against the war publicly.
in practice it allowed officials to prosecute anyone who criticized the government.
these two laws led to more than 2 000 convictions.
despite protests the espionage and sedition acts were upheld by the supreme court.
although the first amendment states that congress shall make no law.
abridging the freedom of speech or of the press the supreme court departed from a strict interpretation of the constitution.
in schenck v united states 1919 justice oliver wendell holmes wrote the unanimous opinion.
the court ruled that the government could restrict speech when the speech constituted a clear and present danger.
espionage spying especially to gain government secrets primarysource m the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.
the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that congress has a right to prevent.
it is a question of proximity and degree.
when a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.
from united states supreme court reports 1920.
b reading progress check explaining what were some new agencies that congress established to help manage the wartime economy.
world war i and its aftermath 239 draft to select a person at random for mandatory military service building the military guiding question how were progressive ideals used in preparing the military for war.
progressives did not abandon their ideas when it came to building up the military.
instead they applied those ideas to develop a new system for recruiting a large army volunteers and conscripts when the united states entered the war in 1917 the army and the national guard together had slightly more than 200 000 troops.
many men quickly volunteered but many more were still needed.
many progressives believed that forced military service was a violation of democratic and republican principles.
believing a draft was necessary however congress with wilsons support created a new system called selective service.
instead of having the military run the draft from washington d c the selective service act of 1917 required all men between 21 and 30 to register for the draft.
a lottery randomly determined the order in which they were called before a local draft board in charge of selecting or exempting people from military service.
the thousands of local boards were the heart ofthe system.
the members of the draft boards were civilians from local communities.
progressives believed local people understanding community needs would know which men to draft and would do a far better job than a centralized government bureaucracy.
eventually about 2 8 million americans were drafted.
not all american soldiers were drafted.
approximately 2 million men volunteered for military service.
some had heard stories of german atrocities and wanted to fight back.
others believed democracy was at stake.
many believed they had a duty to respond to their nations call.
although the horrors of war soon became apparent to the american troops their morale remained high helping to ensure victory.
more than 50 000 americans died in combat and over 200 000 were wounded.
another 60 000 soldiers died from disease mostly from the influenza epidemic of 1918 and 1919.
the flu epidemic was not limited to the battlefield.
it spread around the world and made more than a quarter of all americans sick.
the disease killed an estimated 25 to 50 million people worldwide including more than 500 000 americans.
the u s army kept many african american soldiers from combat assigning them to work as cooks laborers and laundrymen.
the 369th regiment however was assigned to the french army and spent 191 days in the frontline trenches.
the entire regiment was awarded the french croix de guerre for gallantry in combat.
criticalthinking comparing and contrasting why do you think the experiences ofthe 369th regiment differed from those of other african american soldiers during world war i.
240 of the nearly 400 000 african americans who were drafted about 42 000 served overseas as combat troops.
african american soldiers encountered discrimination and prejudice in the army where they served in racially segregated units almost always under the supervision of white officers.
despite these challenges many african american soldiers fought with distinction.
for example the african american 92nd and 93rd infantry divisions fought in bitter battles along the western front.
many ofthe soldiers in those divisions won praise from the french commander marshal philippe petain and the united states commander general john pershing.
an estimated 12 000 native americans and about 20 000 puerto ricans served in the armed forces.
thousands of mexican americans also served in the war volunteering for service more than any other minority group in the united states.
some asian immigrants fought on the side of the united states even before they were citizens.
though they faced discrimination many asians served in the u s army with distinction being granted citizenship in recognition of their contributions.
women join the military world war i was the first war in which women officially served in the armed forces although they served only in noncombat positions.
as the military prepared for war in 1917 it faced a severe shortage of clerical workers because so many men were assigned to active duty.
early in 1917 the navy authorized the enlistment of women to meet its clerical needs.
women serving in the navy wore a standard uniform and were assigned the rank of yeoman.
by the end of the war more than 11 000 women had served in the navy.
although most performed clerical duties others served as radio operators electricians pharmacists chemists and photographers.
unlike the navy the army refused to enlist women.
instead it began hiring women as temporary employees to fill clerical jobs.
the only women to actually serve in the army were in the army nurse corps.
women had served as nurses in both the army and the navy since the early 1900s but as auxiliaries.
they were not assigned ranks and were not technically enlisted in the army or navy.
more than 20 000 nurses served in the army nurse corps during the war including more than 10 000 overseas.
g reading progress check synthesizing how did progressive ideas influence the roles of women during world war i.
connections to today women in the military although womens roles in the military during world war i were limited their entry into service paved the way for many advances.
today about 5 percent of general officers in the u s army including the army reserve and the army national guard are women.
in 2008 ann e dunwoody became the first female four star general in army history.

quoted in the american spirit november 3 1918 to protect themselves from artillery troops began digging trenches.
on the western front where german troops fought french british and belgian forces the troops dug a network of trenches that stretched from the english channel to the swiss border.
both sides used barbed wire and a new weapon the machine gun to guard against the enemy.
attacks usually began with a massive artillery barrage.
soldiers then raced across the rough landscape world war i and its aftermath 243 toward enemy trenches.
troops used any weapon available to kill the enemy.
the new style of fighting which both sides eventually utilized resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of men and a stalemate on the western front.
offensive and defensive moves by the allies and the germans failed to be particularly successful.
to protect against poison gas attacks troops carried gas masks similar to these masks worn by american soldiers in 1917 network an interconnected system new technology breaking through enemy lines required new technologies.
the germans first used poison gas in 1915 and the allies soon followed.
gas caused vomiting blindness and suffocation.
both sides developed gas masks to counter fumes.
in 1916 the british introduced the armored tank which could crush barbed wire and cross trenches.
but there were still too few of the slow unreliable machines to revolutionize warfare.
world war i also marked the first use of aircraft in war.
early in the war the germans used giant rigid balloons called zeppelins to drop bombs on british warships in the north sea.
at first airplanes were used to spy on enemy troops and ships.
then the allies equipped them with machine guns and rockets to attack the german zeppelin fleet.
other aircraft carried small bombs to drop on enemy lines.
as technology advanced airplanes shot down other airplanes in battles known as dogfights.
but early military aircraft were difficult to fly and easy to destroy.

in mid september american troops drove back german forces at the battle of saint mihiel.
on september 26 1918 the most massive offensive for the american expeditionary force was launched in the region between the meuse river and the argonne forest.
although the germans inflicted heavy casualties their positions slowly fell to the advancing american troops.
by early november the americans had opened a hole on the eastern flank of the german lines.
all across the western front the germans began to retreat.
the war ends meanwhile a revolution had engulfed austria hungary.
in october 1918 poland hungary and czechoslovakia declared independence.
by early november the governments of the austro hungarian empire and the ottoman empire had surrendered to the allies.
in late october sailors in kiel the main base of the german fleet mutinied.
within days groups of workers and soldiers seized power in other german towns.
the german emperor stepped down and on november 9 germany became a republic.
two days later the government signed an armistice an agreement to stop fighting.
on november 11 1918 the fighting stopped.
h reading progress check determining cause and effect how did the arrival of american troops affect german attitudes about the war.
a flawed peace guiding question why did president wilson s ideas for peace negotiations differ from those of french premier clemenceau and british prime minister lloyd george.
although the fighting had stopped world war i was not over.
in january 1919 delegates from 27 countries traveled to the peace conference at the palace of versailles near paris.
the treaty with germany that resulted came to be called the treaty of versailles.
the conference also negotiated the treaty of saint germain ending the war with austria hungary.
negotiations on the treaty of versailles lasted five months.
the most important participants were the so called big four president wilson of the united states british prime minister david lloyd george french premier georges clemenceau and italian prime minister vittorio orlando.
russian representatives were not invited to the conference because allied leaders refused to recognize lenins government as legitimate.
the fourteen points president wilson arrived in paris in 1919 with a peace plan known as the fourteen points.
it was based on the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities in the first five points wilson proposed to eliminate the causes ofthe war through free trade freedom ofthe seas disarmament an impartial adjustment of colonial claims and open diplomacy.
246 geography connection european borders were redrawn as a result ofworldwarl.
places and regions m zwf was one unusual characteristic ofthe new state of poland.
places and regions how did the regions controlled by russia change in 1919.
the next eight points addressed the right of national self determination the idea that the borders of countries should be based on ethnicity and national identity.
supporters of this idea believed that when borders are not based on national identity nations are more likely to go to war to resolve border disputes.
this principle also meant that no nation should keep territory taken from another nation.
this required the central powers to evacuate all invaded countries and germany to restore the french territory of alsace lorraine taken in 1871.
the fourteenth point called for the creation of a league of nations.
the leagues members would help preserve peace by pledging to respect and protect each others territory and political independence.
wilson was willing to give up his other goals in exchange for support for the league.
the treaty of versailles wilsons popularity in europe put him in a strong negotiating position.
the peace conference decided to use the fourteen points as the basis for negotiations.
but not everyone was impressed by wilsons ideas.
premier clemenceau of france and british prime minister lloyd george wanted to punish the germans for the suffering they had inflicted on the rest of europe.
additionally britain refused to give up its sizable naval advantage by agreeing to wilsons call for freedom of the seas.
the treaty of versailles reluctantly signed by germany on june 28 1919 included many terms designed to punish and weaken germany.
germanys armed forces were greatly reduced and its troops were not allowed west ofthe rhine river.
the treaty also specifically blamed the aggression of germany for the war.
this allowed the allies to demand that germany pay reparations monetary compensation for all of the war damages it had caused.
a commission decided that germany owed the allies about 33 billion.
this sum far exceeded what germany could pay all at once and was intended to keep its economy weak for a long time.
wilson had somewhat better success in promoting national self determination.

in general the majority of people in each new country were from one ethnic group.
but both poland and czechoslovakia were given territory where the majority of the people were german and germany was split in two in order to give poland access to the baltic sea.
this arrangement helped set the stage for a new series of crises in the 1930s.
the treaty of versailles ignored freedom of the seas free trade and wilsons goal of a fair settlement of colonial claims.
no colonial people in asia or africa received independence.
france and britain took over colonial areas in africa and the middle east and japan assumed responsibility for colonies in east asia.
the treaty did however call for the creation of a league of nations.
league members promised to reduce armaments to submit all disputes that endangered the peace to arbitration and to aid any member who was threatened with aggression.

but he had badly underestimated opposition to the league of nations in the senate.
all treaties signed by the united states must be ratified by two thirds of the senate and in november 1918 the democratic party had lost control of the senate.
even though he needed republican support to ratify the treaty wilson refused to take any republican leaders with him to the peace conference.
this ensured that wilsons views prevailed but it also meant that republican concerns were not addressed.
opposition in the senate focused on the league of nations.
one group of senators nicknamed the irreconcilables refused to support the treaty under any circumstances.
they assailed the league as the kind of entangling alliance that george washington and the other founders had warned against.
they believed that joining an international organization endangered american sovereignty.
as a democratic republic the american government was supposed to act based on what its own citizens wanted not what people in other countries wanted.
a larger group of senators known as the reservationists was led by the powerful chairman of the foreign relations committee henry cabot lodge.
the reservationists were willing to support the treaty of versailles if amendments were made to the league of nations.
the reservationists pointed out that the constitution requires congress to declare war.
yet the league of nations could require member states to aid any member who was attacked.
the reservationists argued that this might force the united states into a war without congressional approval.
they agreed to ratify the treaty if it was amended to say that any military action by the united states required the approval of congress.
wilson refused fearing the change would undermine the leagues effectiveness.
wilson decided to take his case directly to the american people.
starting in september 1919 he traveled some 8 000 miles and made more than 30 major speeches in three weeks.
soon afterward he suffered a stroke.
although bedridden wilson still refused to compromise on the treaty.
the senate voted in november 1919 and in march 1920 but both times it refused to give its consent to the treaty.
after wilson left office in 1921 the united states negotiated separate peace treaties with each ofthe central powers.
the league of nations took shape without the united states.
248 the debate had pointed out the pros and cons of international treaties and international organizations.
on the one hand once the united states joined an international organization and signed an international treaty it was bound by those agreements which would limit the nations ability to act independently.
of course the united states could always withdraw from a treaty but when a nation does that too often its credibility is damaged and other nations will no longer trust it to keep its agreements.
on the other hand had the united states joined the league of nations it would have been able to use its power and influence to shape league policies and enforce league actions.
it could have helped promote international cooperation and peace.
in the years ahead many people would argue that the league of nations was ineffective because many powerful nations such as the united states were not members.
world war i a turning point world war i marked an important turning point in world history.
the war had destroyed the german russian and austro hungarian empires and badly weakened britain and france.
all across the world wilsons idea of national self determination began to take hold as people in europes colonies began to work for independence.
the war had also triggered a communist revolution in russia and that development would affect global events for the rest of the twentieth century as a slow motion struggle began between supporters of democratic institutions and free enterprise and supporters of communism and revolution.

the end ofthe wartime economy led to a depression and fears of communism as strikes riots and bombings took place.
an economy in turmoil guidingquestion why did many workers participate in strikes following the war.
after the war ended government agencies removed their controls from the economy.
people raced to buy goods that had been rationed while businesses raised prices they had been forced to keep low.
the result was rapid inflation that greatly increased the cost of living the cost of food clothing shelter and other essentials.
with orders for war materials evaporating factories laid off workers.
returning soldiers found that jobs were scarce.
inflation leads to strikes while workers wanted higher wages to keep up with inflation companies resisted because inflation was also driving up their operating costs.
during the war union membership had increased greatly.
business leaders however were determined to break the power of the unions.
by the end of 1919 more than 3 600 strikes involving more than four million workers had taken place.
the seattle general strike in seattle some 35 000 shipyard workers walked off the job demanding higher wages and shorter hours.
other unions in seattle soon organized a general strike a strike that involves all workers in a community of more than 60 000 people that paralyzed the city for five days.
the strikers returned to work without making any gains but their actions worried many americans because the general strike was a common tactic of communists and some radical groups in europe.
the boston police strike one of the most famous strikes of 1919 occurred in boston where roughly 75 percent ofthe police force walked off the job.
riots and looting forced governor calvin a 250 coolidge to call in the national guard.
when the strikers tried to return to work the police commissioner instead fired them.
despite protests coolidge agreed that the men should be fired declaring there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere anytime coolidges response earned him widespread public support and convinced the republicans to make him their vice presidential candidate in 1920.
the steel strike soon after the police strike an estimated 350 000 steelworkers went on strike for higher pay shorter hours and recognition of their union.
u s steel refused to talk to union leaders and set out to break the union.
it blamed the strike on foreign radicals and called for loyal americans to return to work.
meanwhile the company hired african american and mexican workers as replacements.
clashes between company guards and strikers were frequent.
in gary indiana a riot left 18 strikers dead.
the strike collapsed in 1920 setting back the union cause in the steel industry for more than a decade.
racial unrest postwar economic turmoil also contributed to widespread racial unrest.
many african americans had moved north during the war to take factory jobs.
as people began to be laid off and returning soldiers found it hard to find work and affordable housing many blamed african americans for taking their jobs.
frustration and racism combined to produce violence.
in the summer of 1919 25 race riots broke out across the nation.
the riots began in july when a mob of angry whites burned shops and homes in an african american neighborhood in longview texas.
a week later in washington d c gangs of african americans and whites fought each other for four days before troops got the riots under control.
the worst violence occurred in chicago.
on a hot july day african americans went to a whites only beach.
both sides began throwing stones and an african american teenager drowned as a result.
a full scale riot then erupted.
angry african americans attacked white neighborhoods while whites attacked african american neighborhoods.
the riot lasted for almost two weeks until the government sent in the national guard to impose order.
by the time the rioting ended 38 people had been killed 15 white and 23 african american and more than 500 had been injured.
cost of living the cost of purchasing goods and services essential for survival general strike a strike involving all the workers in a particular geographic location widespread widely diffused or prevalent some strikes became so violent and out of control that the federal government was forced to call in the national guard to impose order.

the race riots of 1919 disillusioned some african americans who felt their wartime contributions had been for nothing.
for others however the wartime struggle for democracy encouraged them to fight for their rights at home.
for the first time african americans organized and fought back.
the naacp experienced a surge in membership after the war and in 1919 it launched a new campaign for a federal law against lynching.
reading progress check determining cause and effect why did the number of strikes increase after the war.
the red scare go 5d8ng question doyou agree or disagree with a mitchell palmer s efforts to prevent a radical revolution in the united states.
since the late 1800s many americans had accused immigrants of importing socialist and communist ideas and had blamed them for labor unrest and violence.
events in russia seemed to justify fears of a communist revolution.
the strikes of 1919 fueled fears that communists or reds might seize power leading to a nationwide panic known as the red scare.
many people were particularly concerned about workers using strikes to start a revolution.
the palmer raids in april the postal service intercepted more than 30 parcels containing homemade bombs addressed to prominent americans.
the next month a parade in cleveland to protest the jailing of american socialist party leader eugene debs turned into a series of riots.
two people were killed and another 40 were injured.
in june eight bombs in eight cities exploded within minutes of one another suggesting a nationwide conspiracy.
one of these bombs damaged the home of united states attorney general a mitchell palmer.
palmer took action establishing a special division within the justice department the general intelligence division which eventually became the federal bureau of investigation fbi.
although evidence pointed to no single group palmers agents targeted the foreign born.
on november 7 1919 palmer ordered a series of raids on offices of the union of russian workers in 12 cities.
less than seven weeks later a transport ship left new york for russia carrying 249 immigrants who had been deported or expelled from the country.
in january 1920 palmer ordered another series of raids on the headquarters of various radical organizations.
nearly 6 000 people were arrested.
palmers raids continued until the spring of 1920 and authorities detained thousands of suspects.
palmers agents often ignored the civil liberties of suspects.
officers entered homes and offices without search warrants.
some suspects were jailed indefinitely and were not allowed to talk to their attorneys.
many of the nearly 600 immigrants who were deported never had a court hearing.
palmer defended his actions authorities those who have control over determining and enforcing what is right or wrong analyzing primary sources primarysource like a prairie fire the blaze of revolution was sweeping over every american institution of law and order a year ago.
it was eating its way into the homes of the american workmen leaping into the belfry ofthe school bell crawling into the sacred corners of american homes burning up the foundations of society w from the case against the reds forum 1920 for a while palmer was regarded as a national hero.
but his raids failed to turn up any hard evidence of revolutionary conspiracy.
the red scare however greatly influenced peoples attitudes during the 1920s.
the new york state legislature expelled five members of the socialist party in january 1920 and within a few months nearly 30 states passed sedition laws making it illegal to join groups advocating revolution.
many linked radicalism with immigrants which led to calls to limit immigration.
the election of 1920 economic problems labor unrest racial tensions and the fresh memories of world war i created a general sense of disillusionment in the united states.
during the 1920 campaign ohio governor james m cox and his running mate assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt ran on a platform of progressive ideals.
president wilson tried to convince the democrats to make the campaign a referendum on the treaty of versailles and the league of nations.
the republican candidate warren g harding called for a return to normalcy arguing that the country needed to return to the days before the progressive era reforms.
harding won the election by a landslide.
many americans hoped to put racial labor and economic troubles behind them and build a more prosperous and stable society.
b reading progress check theorizing do you think that the events of 1919 justified palmer s actions.
why or why not.
warren g harding on a return to normalcy our present need is not heroics but healing not nostrums but normalcy not revolution but bold restoration not agitation but adjustment not surgery but serenity not the dramatic but the dispassionate not submergence in internationality but sustainment in triumphant nationality.

rather it was a series of responses to problems in american societ that had emerged from the growth of industry.
progressives had many different ideas about how to fix the problems they saw in american society.
taking notes key ideas and details organizing as you read about progressivism complete a graphic organizer similar to the one below by filling in the beliefs of progressives.
teks lewsessentiallknoj geajdsi 3c analyze social issues affecting women minorities children immigrants urbanization the social gospel and philanthropy of industrialists continued on the next page who were the progressives.
progressivism was partly a reaction against laissez faire economics and its emphasis on an unregulated market.
progressives generally believed that industrialization and urbanization had created many social problems.
after seeing the poverty of the working class and the filth and crime of urban society reformers began doubting the free markets ability to address those problems.
progressives belonged to both major political parties.
most were urban educated middle class americans.
among their leaders were journalists social workers educators politicians ar members of the clergy.
most agreed that government should take more active role in solving societys problems.
at the same time they doubted that the government in its present form could fix those problems.
they concluded that government had to be fixe before it could be used to fix other problems.
one reason progressives thought they could improve society was their strong faith in science and technology.
the applicatior scientific knowledge had produced the lightbulb the telephone 202 and the automobile.
it had built skyscrapers and railroads.
science and technology had benefited people thus progressives believed using scientific principles could also produce solutions for society.
the muckrakers among the first people to articulate progressive ideas was a group of crusading journalists who investigated social conditions and political corruption.
president theodore roosevelt nicknamed these writers muckrakers because of what he perceived as their obsession with scandal and corruption.
widely circulated cheap newspapers and magazines helped spread the muckrakers ideas.
muckrakers uncovered corruption in many areas.
some such as ida tarbell and charles edward russell concentrated on exposing the unfair practices of large corporations.
other muckrakers targeted government and social problems.
lincoln steffens reported on vote stealing and other corrupt political practices of political machines.
still other muckrakers concentrated on social problems.
in his influential book how the other half lives 1890 jacob riis published photographs and descriptions of the poverty disease and crime that afflicted many immigrant neighborhoods in new york city.
by raising awareness of these problems the muckrakers stimulated calls for reform.
h reading progress check stating what groups of people made up the progressive movement.
reforming government guidingquestion howdid progressives hope to make government more efficient and responsive to citizens.
progressivism included a wide range of reform activities.
different issues led to different approaches and some progressives even took opposing positions on how to address some problems.
they condemned government corruption but did not always agree on the best way to fix the problem.

making government efficient one group of progressives drew its ideas for increasing government efficiency from business.
theories of business efficiency first became popular in the 1890s.
books such as frederick w taylors the principles of scientific management 1911 described how a company could increase efficiency by managing time breaking tasks down into small parts and using standardized tools a scientific approach to business that some progressives wanted to extend to government.
progressives saw corruption and inefficiency in city government.
many municipal leaders traditionally chose political supporters and friends to run city departments even though these people often knew little about managing city services.
progressives supported proposals to reform city government.
one a commission plan divided city government into several departments with each one under an expert commissioners control.
a second a council manager system employed a city manager who was hired by the city council.
in both systems experts play a major role in managing the city.
galveston texas adopted the commission system in 1901.
in other cities political machines were weakened by having officials elected city wide instead of by neighborhoods.
democratic reforms another group of progressives focused on making government more democratic and more responsive to citizens.
many believed that the key to improving government was to make elected officials more responsive and accountable to voters.
wisconsin became a laboratory of democracy under the leadership of its governor robert m la follette who attacked the way political parties ran their conventions.
party bosses controlled the selection of convention delegates and the nomination of candidates.
la follette pressured the state legislature to pass a law requiring parties to hold a direct primary in which all party members could vote for a candidate to run in the general election.
the direct primary soon spread to other states.
other progressives also pushed for additional reforms the initiative the referendum and the recall.
the initiative permits citizens to introduce legislation and requires the legislature to vote on it.
typically citizens have to gather a certain number of signatures on a petition to make the initiative legally binding.
in an indirect initiative the proposed law goes to the legislature first.
if the legislature refuses to act on it it goes on the ballot for the public to vote on it.
a direct initiative goes directly to the public for a vote.
a referendum allows citizens to vote on proposed laws directly.
in some states if the legislature passes certain laws such as a change to taxes the new law has to be approved by the public in a referendum.
referendums are also used to repeal existing laws.
both the referendum and the initiative gave reformers the power to bypass or overrule the legislature if it refused to support something the people wanted.
the idea of the initiative and the referendum was more popular in the west and midwest.
today 26 states allow some form of initiative and or referendum.
since 1904 more than 2000 statewide referendums have been initiated by citizens.
the recall provided voters an option to demand a special election to remove an elected official from office before his or her term had expired.
today nineteen states allow citizens to recall state officials and at least 29 states allow recalls of local officials.
recalls are frequent for local officials.

human systems in what direction did support for woman suffrage generally move throughout the country before 1920.
hundreds of city council members school board members and mayors have been recalled over the over the years but as of 2013 only 20 state legislators have been recalled and only two governors.
progressives also targeted the u s senate.
the u s constitution originally directed each state legislature to elect two senators.
political machines and business interests often influenced these elections.
some senators once elected repaid their supporters with federal contracts and jobs.
to counter corruption in the senate reformers called for the direct election of senators by voters.
in 1912 congress passed a direct election amendment.
in 1913 the amendment was ratified and became the seventeenth amendment to the constitution.
although direct election was meant to end corruption it also removed one of the state legislatures checks on federal power.
h reading progress check summarizing how did progressives hope to solve problems through political reform.
woman suffrage guidingquestion why did the progressives support the woman suffrage movement.
at the first womens rights convention in seneca falls new york in 1848 elizabeth cady stanton convinced the delegates that winning suffrage the right to vote should be a priority.
decades later this right still had not been gained.
it became a major goal for female progressives.
early challenges the woman suffrage movement started slowly.
suffragists were threatened and called unfeminine and immoral.
many ofthe movements supporters were abolitionists as well and in the years before the civil war ending slavery took priority over womens voting rights.
after the civil war congress introduced the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to grant citizenship to african americans and voting rights to african american men.

she found that the male leaders of both movements discriminated against women so she turned to the women s rights movement.
she was the president ofthe national american woman suffrage association from 1892 to 1900.
she lectured constantly on the right of women to vote often to hostile audiences and traveled extensively lobbying state legislators to pass suffrage laws.
her ultimate goal was an amendment to the united states constitution that would recognize a woman s right to vote in every state.
on her 86th birthday in 1906 she attended a dinner in her honor and spoke briefly concluding her remarks with these words failure is impossible.
she was right but did not live to see the nineteenth amendment that gave women the right to vote ratified in 1920 these amendments to give women the right to vote as well.
they were disappointed when established politicians refused.
the debate over these two amendments split the movement into two groups the new york city based national woman suffrage association founded by stanton and susan b anthony in 1869 and the boston based american woman suffrage association led by lucy stone and julia ward howe.
the first group wanted to focus on passing a constitutional amendment.
the second believed that the best strategy was convincing state governments to grant women the right to vote first.
this split weakened the suffrage movement.
by 1900 only wyoming idaho utah and colorado had granted women full voting rights.
building support in 1890 the two groups united to form the national american woman suffrage association nawsa.
the movement still faced the challenge of convincing women to become politically active.
as the progressive movement gained momentum however many women realized that they needed the vote to promote reforms and pass labor laws.
women began organizing events handing out pamphlets and delivering speeches.
many leaders of the suffrage movement were also able to lobby state and federal legislators directly.
lobbying is when you contact a political leader personally explain your concern and try to convince them to vote fora legislation that supports your causes.
often lobbyists promise to support the legislator financially when they run for reelection in return for their support.
to gain influence with legislators and make their lobbying more effective suffrage leaders raised funds for legislators who supported suffrage and campaigned for their election even though they could not actually vote for them.
they also worked to defeat legislators who opposed womens suffrage.
quaker social worker and former nawsa member alice paul founded the national womans party nwp.
the nwp emphasized non violent protest to promote womens right to participate in the democratic process.
its members picketed blocked sidewalks chained themselves to lampposts and went on hunger strikes if arrested.
suffragist rose winslow and several other women including alice paul were arrested for picketing the white house.
after being sentenced to seven months in jail winslow and other women prisoners went on a hunger strike.
lobbying the act of contacting a political leader to explain a concern in order to convince them to vote for a cause many progressives focused on fixing social welfare problems such as child labor.

if this continues very long perhaps i won t be.
all the officers here know we are making this hunger strike so that women fighting for liberty may be considered political prisoners w e don t want women ever to have to do this over again.
rose winslow quoted in jailed for freedom 1920 the hunger strikers were force fed in prison and the story gathered a lot of attention in the press creating a national scandal.
equally disturbing was a police attack on a group of woman protestors that left several women with concussions and broken ribs.
the united states had entered world war i a few months before and president wilson was trying to portray the united states as fighting for freedom and democracy.
as a result the nwps protests may have helped convince wilson to publicly ask congress to pass an amendment giving women the right to vote.
wilson may also have been influenced by the public support that nawsa had given him.
while the nwp had focused on non violent protest the leader of nawsa carrie chapman catt had organized the suffrage movement for one final nationwide push for suffrage.
she used the organizations funds to support politicians who backed suffrage.
she convinced the organization to support president wilsons re election in 1916 and then supported the president when he took the country into war in 1917.
as more states granted women the right to vote congress began to favor a constitutional amendment.
in 1918 the house of representatives passed a woman suffrage amendment.
in the senate however the amendment failed by two votes.
during the midterm elections of 1918 catt used nawsas resources to defeat two antisuffrage senators.
in 1919 the senate passed the amendment by slightly more than the two thirds vote needed.
on august 26 1920 after three fourths of the states had ratified it the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote went into effect.
h reading progress check determining cause and effect what progressive goals did suffragists believe they could achieve if women had the right to vote.
reforming society guiding question what problems did social welfare progressives attempt to reform.
while many progressives focused on reforming the political system others focused on social problems such as crime illiteracy alcohol abuse child labor and the health and safety of americans.
these social welfare progressives created charities to help the poor and disadvantaged.
they also pushed for new laws they hoped would fix social problems.
women were prominent leaders of the social welfare progressives.
most women in the progressive movement came from the middle or upper class and felt a responsibility toward working class women.
the main issues that working class women faced were poverty safety and abuse.
because the culture ofthe time generally expected fathers and husbands to work and provide for their families women and children who lost their husbands and fathers were seen as exceptionally vulnerable and likely to be forced into florence kelley 1859 1932 progressive florence kelley dedicated her life to campaigning for reforms.
while working at chicago s hull house in the 1890s she conducted research that encouraged the passage ofthe first law banning children younger than 14from factory work.
later she contributed to the foundation ofthe united states children s bureau to protect children.
her research on the effects of long workdays on women s health contributed to the supreme court s decision in muller v oregon.
critical thinking making generalizations in what areas did florence kelley s actions contribute to significant reform.
the progressive movement 207 analyzing primary sources jane addams on unsafe working conditions for children f f when the injury of one of the boys resulted in his death we felt quite sure that the owners of the factory would share our horror and remorse and that they would do everything possible to prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy.
to our surprise they did nothing whatever and i made my first acquaintance then with those pathetic documents signed by the parents of working children that they will make no claim for damages resulting from carelessness from twenty years at hull house 1910 dbq drawing conclusions based on this excerpt what insight does addams s description offer about the progressives view of child labor and the conditions in factories.
society also believed that women were more physically vulnerabk than men and for progressives the idea that poor women and their childn might be forced into difficult and dangerous working conditions was an important womens issue.
child labor probably the most emotional progressive issue was the campaign against child labor.
children had always worked on family farms but mines and factories presented more dangerous and unhealthy working conditions.
muckraker john spargos 1906 book the bitter cry ofthe children present detailed evidence of child labor conditions.
it told of coal mines that hired thousands of 9 or 10 year old breaker boys to pick slag out of coal payin them 60 cents for a 10 hour day.
it described how the work bent their backs permanently and often crippled their hands.
reports like these convinced states to pass laws that set a minimum age for employment and established other limits on child labor such as maximum hours children could work.
a the same time many states began passing compulsory education laws requiring young children to be in school instead of at work.
health and safety codes many adult workers also labored in difficult conditions.
factories coal mine and railroads were particularly dangerous.
when workers were injured or killed on the job they and their families received little or no compensation.
progressives joined union leaders to pressure states for workers compensatic laws.
these laws established insurance funds that employers financed.
workers injured in accidents received payments from the funds.
in two cases lochnerv.
new york 1905 and muller v oregon 1908 the u s supreme court addressed governments authority to regulate business to protect workers.
in the lochner case the court ruled that a new york law forbidding bakers to work more than 10 hours a day was unconstitutional saying the state did not have the right to interfere with th liberty of employers and employees.
in the muller case which involved women working in laundries in oregon however the court upheld the states right to limit hours.
the different judgments were based on gender differences.
the court state that healthy mothers were the states concern and therefore the limits on womens working hours did not violate their fourteenth amendment rights.
in the lochner case the court had adhered to a strict construction of the constitution and decided that government did not have the power to interfere in the right of an employer and employee to make a contract.
in the miller case the court had been more activist.
it interpreted the constitution so as to give government the power to regulate the workplace because of perceived public need to keep women safe by treating them differently from men.
on march 25 1911 a tragedy occurred in new york city that led to ne reforms.
a fire on the top floors of the triangle shirtwaist company caused nearly 150 of the factory s 500 workers to lose their lives.
the disaster illustrated that fire precautions and inspections were inadequate.
in response new york created a factory investigating commission and soon passed new laws that reformed the labor code.
some progressives also favored zoning laws as a method of protecting the public.
these laws divided a town or city into zones for commercial residential or other development thereby regulating how land and buildings could be used.
building codes set minimum standards for light 208 air room size and sanitation and required buildings to have fire escapes.
health codes required restaurants and other facilities to maintain clean environments for their patrons.
zoning laws created a constitutional question.
the fifth amendment ofthe constitution says that no one shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation if the government takes something of value from someone it is supposed to pay for it.
as governments began to impose zoning laws on communities to improve sanitation safety and the quality of life individuals and businesses began to complain that they were losing the use of their property.
they argued that the government should compensate them for the loss.
in hadacheck v sebastian 1915 a brick maker argued that he needed clay on his land to make bricks and that zoning laws forcing him to move his kiln deprived him of his fifth amendment rights.
the court disagreed finding that the zoning laws were a constitutional use of a governments police power to protect public health.
in 1922 in pennsylvania coal v mahon however the court narrowed its interpretation.
a coal company owned the rights to mine under a piece of land but a law prohibited mining below land that supported buildings on the surface.
the court agreed that the law had gone too far.
under its fifth amendment rights the coal company had been deprived of its property and was owed compensation.
the case established that the government does not have an unlimited right to regulate property use.
at some point government regulation of property even when done in the public interest does require compensation.
frank leslies illustrated wort i 8 wires a liquors fs the temperance movement gained a key victory in 1917 when congress passed the eighteenth amendment.
prohibition went into effect in 1920 after the amendment was ratified.
criticalthinking summarizing why did the temperance movement push for the prohibition of alcoholic beverages.
the prohibition movement many progressives blamed alcohol for many of societys problems.
society at the time tended to view drinking alcohol as acceptable for men not women and men consumed the vast majority of all the alcohol produced.
as a result social welfare progressives focused on the problems that alcohol abuse created for women.
settlement house workers knew that wages were often spent on alcohol instead of the family and that drunkenness often led to physical abuse illness poverty and abandonment.
from these concerns emerged one ofthe major womens issues of the era the temperance movement which advocated that people stop or at least moderate their alcohol consumption.
women were important leaders of the temperance movement.
in 1874 a group of women formed the womans christian temperance union wctu.
in 1879 frances willard became president of the wctu and held the post for nearly 20 years.
under her leadership the temperance movement grew to a national movement with significant political influence.
in addition to temperance willard convinced the wctu to support womens suffrage and champion many social welfare causes including prison reform equal pay for women protections for children and the eight hour day.
by 1911 the advocate to propose a certain position or viewpoint the progressive movement 209 prohibition laws banning the manufacture transportation and sale of alcoholic beverages skills practice there are many new words in this lesson including initiative referendum primary suffrage prohibition lobbying and others.
discuss the new words with a partner.
if a word reminds you of any past experience tell your partner about the experience.
wctu had nearly a quarter of million members.
in 1893 evangelical protestant ministers formed another group the anti saloon league.
when the temperance movement began it concentrated on reducing alcohol consumption.
later it pressed for prohibition laws banning the manufactu transportation and sale of alcoholic beverages.
despite significant opposition especially from working class voters support for prohibition grew steadily.
by 1916 nineteen states had introduced some form of prohibition on alcohol and leaders of the prohibition movement began to push for a constitutional amendment banning the manufacture transportation or sale of alcohol in all ofthe united states.
in 1919 the amendment was ratified.
it went into effect in january 1920.
progressives versus big business many progressives agreed that big business needed regulation.
some believed the government should break up big companies to restore competition.
this led to the passage of the sherman antitrust act in 1890 others argued that big business was the most efficient way to organize the economy.
they pushed for government to regulate big companies and prevent them from abusing their power.
the interstate commerce commission icc created in 1887 to regulate the railroads was an early example of this kind of thinking.
some activists even went so far as to advocate socialism the idea that the government should own and operate industry for the community.
they wanted the government to buy up large companies especially industries that affected everyone such as railroads and utilities.
at its peak socialism had some national support.
eugene v debs the former leader of the american railway union won nearly a million votes as the american socialist party candidate for president in 1912.
most progressives and most americans however believed in the superiority of the american system of free enterprise.

have you heard statements such as only tall people play basketball well or dogs make better pets than cats.
do you accept these statements at face value or do you stop and consider whether or not they are valid.
look for a conclusion or common element that fits all the facts.
make a generalization from these common elements.
test your generalization to see if you can falsify it.
look for facts to support or disprove it.
learning the skill the statements listed above are called generalizations.
a generalization is a broad statement about a topic.
a generalization takes facts from specific cases and then makes an inference that certain general conclusions can be derived from those facts.
at a minimum to be valid a generalization must be based on accurate information.
let s examine the generalization only tall people play basketball well.
we can find many examples of tall basketball players but there are also many shorter players who excel at this sport.
in other words we can find facts that disprove the generalization.
suppose that you want to make a generalization about the relative danger of airplane travel compared to automobile travel.
first you would collect accident statistics involving airplanes and cars.
your next step would be to classify the information into categories.
then you would look for relationships between these categories.
for example you might put the airplane and automobile statistics in separate categories.
you might also categorize the number of accidents and the number of fatalities.
finally you should make a generalization that is consistent with most of the facts you gathered.
to make and test generalizations follow these steps to make a valid generalization first collect information about a topic.
this information must consist of accurate facts not opinions.
compare and contrast what those facts are telling you.

theodore roosevelt became president at age 42 the youngest person ever to take the office.
in international affairs he believed i social darwinism which held that nations were in competition ar only the strongest would survive.

his first target was j p morgans railroad holding company northern securities.
the company planned an exchange of stock that would merge existing railroad systems creating a monopoly on railroad traffic in the northwest.

unmoved roosevelt proceeded with the case.
in 1904 in northern securities v united states the supreme court ruled that morgans firm had violated the sherman antitrust act.
roosevelt was hailed as a trustbuster and his popularity with the public grew.
northern securities and the commerce clause the supreme courts decision in the northern securities case marked yet another shift in the relationship between the federal government and private business.
article i section 8 of the constitution states that the congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.
it was agreed that the constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate commerce between the states not within a state.
but the definition of what actually constituted interstate commerce was open to interpretation.
in the late 1800s the court had applied a very strict interpretation of the commerce power.
for example when a sugar company gained control of 98 percent of the sugar industry the court ruled in u s v e c.
knight 1894 that the sherman anti trust act could not be applied because the sugar was manufactured within a state.
manufacturing the court said did not involve interstate commerce even though the sugar was sold across state lines.
in the northern securities case the court began broadening its interpretation.
northern securities was based in one state and was simply buying stock in other companies but the court in a narrow 5 4 decision decided the antitrust act could still be applied.
in dissent justice oliver wendell holmes warned that the decision created a slippery slope if the act before us is to be carried out according to what seems to me the logic ofthe argument.
i can see no part ofthe conduct of life with which on similar principles congress might not interfere over time his comment has proved accurate.
it would take many decades and several supreme court decisions but the interpretation ofthe commerce clause of the constitution has been gradually expanded allowing the federal government more and more power to regulate private business.

the progressive movement 213 arbitration settling a dispute by agreeing to accept the decision of an impartial outsider the coal strike of 1902 as president roosevelt believed that it was his job to keep society operating efficiently by helping settle conflicts between different groups and their interests.
in the fall of 1902 he put this belief into practice.
he worked to help resolve a coal strike between mine owners and nearly 150 000 members ofthe united mine workers umw.
the umw wantec increased pay reduced hours and union recognition.
if the strike had dragged on the nation would have faced a coal shortage that could have shut down factories and left many homes unheated.
roosevelt urged the umw and the mine owners to accept arbitration a settlement negotiated by an outside party.
the union agreed to arbitration.
the mine owners refused however until roosevelt threatened to order the army to run the mines.
by intervening in the dispute he took the first step toward establishing the federal government as an honest broker between powerful groups in society.
regulating big business despite his lawsuit against northern securities and his role in the coal strike roosevelt believed that most trusts were good for the economy and that the costs of antitrust action outweighed its benefits.
he agreed with th opponents of trust busting who argued that companies generally formed trusts because it was the most efficient way to do business.
breaking up a trust would make an industry less efficient and drive up costs for the publi furthermore by taking a company to court the government created uncertainty in the industry until the case was resolved.
business leaders would not know how to plan or what to expect and that too would distort the economy and make it less efficient.
roosevelt generally accepted these arguments against antitrust action and he was also keenly aware that americas biggest companies were now competing globally against foreign companies.
u s steel had formed a tru in the united states but it was competing against huge european steel companies in britain france and germany.
standard oil had formed a tri in the united states but it was competing globally against burmah oil in britain today known as bp royal dutch petroleum today known as she oil and many other companies.
antitrust action against an american company might cripple its ability to compete internationally.
as a progressive roosevelt valued efficiency and he believed that the united states had to be a world power militarily and economically in ord to prosper.
but as a progressive he also distrusted large concentrations of power and the potential for corruption and harm to the public good.
so instead of aggressively seeking to break up trusts he proposed to create a federal agency to investigate corporations and publicize the findings.
he believed the most effective way to prevent big business from abusing its power was to keep the public informed.
in 1903 roosevelt convinced congress to create the department of commerce and labor.
the following year this department began investigating u s steel a gigantic holding company that had been createc in 1901.
worried about a possible antitrust lawsuit the companys leader met privately with roosevelt.
they offered to open their files for examination.
in exchange the department of commerce and labor wou privately tell the company about any problems and allow them to fix the problems quietly.
roosevelt accepted this gentlemens agreement as he called it and soon made similar deals with other companies.
these deals 214 gave him the ability to regulate big business without having to sacrifice economic efficiency by breaking up the trusts.
in keeping with his belief in regulation roosevelt pushed the hepburn act through congress in 1906.
the act was intended to strengthen the interstate commerce commission icc by giving it the power to set railroad rates.
at first railroad companies were suspicious of the icc.
however the railroads eventually realized they could work with the commission to set rates and regulations that limited competition and prevented new competitors from entering the industry.
by 1920 the icc had begun setting rates at levels intended to ensure the industrys profits.
by 1905 consumer protection had become a national issue.
as americans read news stories by muckrakers and listened to the concerns of progressive reformers they increasingly felt that the costs of a laissez faire approach to the economy outweighed the benefits.
that year a muckraker journalist named samuel hopkins adams published several articles in colliers magazine describing the patent medicine business.
many companies patented and marketed potions they claimed would cure a variety of ills.
many of these medicines were little more than alcohol colored water and sugar.
others contained caffeine opium cocaine and other dangerous compounds.
consumers had no way to know what they were taking nor did they know whether the medicines worked as claimed.
many americans were equally concerned about the food they ate.
dr w h wiley chief chemist at the united states department of agriculture had issued reports documenting dangerous preservatives including formaldehyde and borax being used in what he called embalmed meat for similar reasons food preparation businesses came under scrutiny.
in 1906 upton sinclair published a novel the jungle based on his close observations of the slaughterhouses of chicago.
the appalling conditions in the meatpacking industry as described by sinclair enraged consumers.
roosevelt and congress responded with the meat inspection act passed in 1906.
it required federal inspection of meat sold through interstate commerce and required the agriculture department to set standards of cleanliness in meatpacking plants.
the pure food and drug act passed on the same day in 1906 prohibited the manufacture sale or shipment of impure or falsely labeled food and drugs.
these two acts marked yet another change in the relationship between government and business.
in both cases the u s department of agriculture usda was given authority to inspect business operations and ensure that products were safe before they could be sold to the public.
initially the bureau of chemistry at the u s department of agriculture was in charge of enforcing the pure food and drug act.
the bureau later became the food and drug administration or fda that continues to regulate food and drugs today.
the benefits ofthe new laws were obvious.
consumers were less likely to become sick and could expect that products actually contained the ingredients on their labels.
the costs of the law as with other regulations ofthe economy meant that companies had to charge more for their products.
putting labels on products cost money and companies passed that on to consumers.
given what wiley had found in peoples food prior to the law many americans and i government leaders thought the costs were worth it.

conservation guiding question why did president roosevelt support conservation.
of all his progressive actions roosevelt may be best remembered for his efforts in the area of environmental conservation.
roosevelt realized that the nations bountiful natural resources were being used up at an alarming rate.
he urged americans to conserve those resources.
roosevelt was an enthusiastic outdoorsman and he valued the countrys minerals animals and rugged terrain.
he cautioned against unregulated use of public lands and argued that conservation should be the guiding principle in managing the united states s natural resources.
in his 1907 annual message to congress roosevelt said t o waste to destroy our natural resources to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness will result in undermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified and developed western land development roosevelt quickly applied his philosophy in the dry western states where farmers and city dwellers competed for scarce water.
in 1902 roosevelt supported passage of the newlands reclamation act.
this act authorized th use of federal funds from public land sales to pay for irrigation and land development projects.
the federal government thus began transforming the wests landscape and economy on a large scale.
roosevelt also backed efforts to save the nations forests.
he supported careful management of the timber resources of the west.
he appointed his close friend gifford pinchot to head the united states forest service established in 1905.
as progressives roosevelt and pinchot both believed that trained experts in forestry and resource management should manage the nations forests.
these professional managers would apply the same scientific standards to the landscape that others were applying to managing cities an industry.
with the presidents support pinchots department drew up regulations to control lumbering on federal lands.
roosevelt also added more than 100 million acres to the protected national forests and established five new national parks and 51 federal wildlife reservations.
roosevelt s legacy president theodore roosevelt changed the role of the federal government.
f used his power in the white house to present his views calling it his bully pulpit.
increasingly americans began looking to the federal government to solve the nations economic and social problems.
under roosevelt the power of the executive branch of government ha dramatically increased.
the interstate commerce commission through t hepburn act could set rates.
the department of commerce and laboi could monitor business.
and the attorney general could rapidly brinj antitrust lawsuits under the expedition act.

taft s reforms guiding question how did president taft s beliefs differ from the progressives beliefs.
roosevelt believed william howard taft his secretary of war was the ideal person to continue his policies.
taft easily secured the republican nomination and won the election of 1908.
the democratic candidate william jennings bryan lost for a third time.
taft angers progressives like many progressives taft believed high tariffs limited competition hurt consumers and protected trusts.
roosevelt had warned him to stay away from tariff reform because it would divide the republican party.
nevertheless taft called congress into special session to lower tariff rates.
the tariff debate did indeed divide the republican party into two groups the progressives who favored tariff reduction and conservative republicans who wanted to maintain high tariffs.
as negotiations dragged on tafts support for tariff reductions waned.
finally he signed into law the payne aldrich tariff which hardly cut tariffs at all and actually raised them on some goods.
progressives felt outraged by tafts decision.
in 1909 taft further angered progressives by replacing roosevelts secretary of the interior james r garfield with richard a ballinger.
garfield was an aggressive conservationist ballinger was a conservative corporate lawyer.
once in office ballinger tried to open nearly a million acres of public lands to private development.
gifford pinchot accused ballinger of planning to give valuable public lands in alaska to a private business group for his own profit.
tafts attorney general investigated the charges and decided they were unfounded.
not satisfied pinchot went to the press and asked congress to investigate.
taft fired pinchot for insubordination or disobedience to authority.
the congressional investigation cleared ballinger.
by the second half of tafts term of office many americans had become so frustrated with him that the congressional elections of 1910 resulted in a sweeping democratic victory.
democrats took the majority in the house and democrats and progressive republicans gained control of the senate from conservative republicans.

critical thinking determining cause and effect why do you think pinchot made accusations against ballinger.
insubordination disobedience to authority taft s achievements despite his political problems taft also had several successes.
although roosevelt was nicknamed the trustbuster taft actually brought twice as mani antitrust cases in four years as his predecessor had in seven.
in other areas tafi also pursued progressive policies.
in 1912 he established the childrens bureau this agency investigated and publicized the problems of child labor.
the ballinger pinchot controversy aside taft was also a dedicated conservationist.
in 1910 taft set up the bureau of mines to monitor the activities of mining companies expand national forests and protect waterpower sites from private development.
the bureau helped make possible many new technologies in the field of mining.
although disturbed by stories of tafts betrayal of his progressivism roosevelt refused to criticize the president.
he soon became impatient.
in 1907 while president roosevelt had approved the purchase ofthe tennessee coal and iron company by u s steel.
in october 1911 taft declared thatth deal violated the sherman antitrust act.
roosevelt believed tafts focus on breaking up trusts was destroying the system of cooperation and regulation that he had seti with big business.
in november 1911 roosevelt publicly criticized taft for this decision.
after roosevelt broke with taft it was only a matter of time before progressives convinced roosevelt to reenter politics.
in late february 1912 roosevelt announced h would enter the presidential campaign of 1912 and attempt to replace taft as the republican nominee for president.
taft disappointed roosevelt who attempted to unseat him in the 1912 republican nomination.

if the federal government wants to tax property it has to make sure the tax is proportionate among the states based on their population.
if a state has 20 percent ofthe people in the country it has to pay 20 percent of the taxes regardless of whether the state is poor or wealthy.
this requirement makes it very difficult for congress to pass direct taxes.
an indirect tax is a tax that someone pays but the tax burden falls on someone else.
for example if a company pays a tax for each car it makes it simply includes that tax in the price of the car.
the person who really pays the tax is the consumer but they pay it indirectly.
sales taxes excise taxes and tariffs are all indirect taxes.
an income tax on wages is also an indirect tax.
it is actually an indirect tax on an employer.
employers know workers have to pay income taxes.
so they have to pay high enough wages that workers will still take the job knowing they will pay income taxes.
if there were no income taxes employers could pay workers less and still get them to take the job.
up until the early 1900s the federal government had raised most of its money using sales taxes excise taxes and tariffs.
as the progressive movement began many progressives began to argue that income taxes were the best way to fund the federal government.
an income tax could be graduated.
you could tax wealthy people at a higher percentage than poor people.
a graduated income tax is sometimes called a progressive tax.
in 1894 congress imposed income taxes on wealthy americans.
the following year the supreme court struck down the income tax law because it was not just a tax on wages but a tax on all types of income.
if a person earned income because they rented property or because they owned stocks that paid dividends they still had to pay the income tax.
the supreme cour declared that an income tax that included income from property was a direct tax not an indirect tax and since it had not been divided proportionately among the states it was unconstitutional.
the courts decision frustrated progressives.
it meant that income taxes could be put on wages and fall on working class americans but that rich people who earned most of their income from property could not be taxed on that income.
soon afterward progressives began pressing for a constitutional amendment that would allow the federal government to tax income no matter its source and without having to divide it proportionate.
among the states.
both president roosevelt and president taft supported the amendment as did many political leaders in both parties.
in february 1913 the 16th amendment allowing for taxes on incomes was ratified by the states.
a little over two months later and only five weeks after taking office president wilson appeared before congress the first president to do so since john adams.
he had come to present his bill to reduce tariffs and introduce a federal income tax.
wilson personally lobbied members of congress to support the tariff reduction bill.
not even roosevelt had taken such an active role in promoting legislation.
in 1913 congress passed the revenue act of 1913 also known as the underwood simmons act and wilson signed it into law.
this law reduced the average tariff on imported goods to about 30 percent of the value of the goods and provided for levying 222 a federal graduated income tax.
the income tax was intended to replace the revenue lost by the tariff reductions.
reforming the banks the united states had not had a central bank since the 1830s.
periodic economic depressions that had occurred after that time had destroyed numerous small banks wiping out many of their customers life savings.
to restore public confidence in the banking system wilson supported a federal reserve system.
banks would have to keep part of their deposits in one of 12 reserve banks providing a cushion against unexpected financial losses.
the federal reserve act of 1913 created the regional reserve banks supervised by a board of governors appointed by the president.
the board could set the interest rates the reserve banks charged other banks thereby indirectly controlling the nations interest rates and the amount of money in circulation.
the federal reserve act became one of the most significant pieces of legislation in american history.
it created an independent agency that began to use monetary policy to manage the nations economy.
monetary policy refers to policies that adjust a nations money supply in order to regulate the economy.
if the federal reserve sets interest rates low businesses and individuals will generally borrow more money.
this increases the amount of money in circulation and causes the economy to grow.
if interest rates are raised people borrow less which slows the economy but also reduces inflation.
generally speaking the goal of monetary policy is to contract the money supply if inflation is too high and expand the money supply if the economy is in a recession and unemployment is too high.
antitrust action during his campaign wilson had promised to restore competition to the economy by breaking up monopolies.
after the election he realized that roosevelt had been right big businesses were more efficient and unlikely to be replaced by smaller more competitive firms.
wilson decided against pursuing the monopolies.
progressives in congress however continued to demand action against big business.
in 1914 at wilsons request congress created the federal trade commission ftc to monitor american business.
the ftc had the power to investigate companies and issue cease and desist orders against those it found to be engaging in unfair trade practices or practices that hurt competition.
if a business disagreed with its rulings it could take the ftc to court.
wilson did not want the ftc to break up big business.
instead it was to work toward limiting unfair trade practices.
he deliberately appointed conservative business leaders as the ftcs first commissioners.
unsatisfied by wilsons approach progressives in congress responded by passing the clayton antitrust act in 1914.
the act outlawed certain practices that restricted competition such as price discrimination or charging different customers different prices.
the passing ofthe clayton antitrust act corrected deficiencies in the sherman antitrust act of 1890.
before the law passed labor unions lobbied congress to exempt unions.
as a result the clayton antitrust act stated that its provisions did not apply to labor organizations or agricultural organizations.
when the bill became law samuel gompers the head ofthe american federation of labor called the act the workers magna carta because it gave unions the right to exist.

before this era most americans did not expect the government to pass laws protecting workers or regulating big business.
in fact many courts had previously ruled the passage of such laws unconstitutional.
by the end of the progressive era however both legal and public opinion ha shifted.
increasingly americans expected the government particularly th federal government to play a more active role in regulating the economy african american leaders such as and solving social problems.

capitalizing on springfield as abraham lincolns hometown and on the centennial of his birthday on february 12 1909 they organized a national conference in springfield to take stock of the progress in emancipation.

african americans were not the only minority group facing discrimination.
jewish people also lived in fear of mob violence.
in 1913 leo frank a jew being tried in atlanta for a murder that the facts proved he did not commit was sentenced to death.
although his sentence was changed to life imprisonment a mob lynched him two years later.
in this context lawyer sigmund livingston started the anti defamation league adl to combat stereotypes and discrimination.

truman was afraid that the miners strikes would drastically reduce the nations energy supply.
he ordered the government t take control of the mines.
he also pressured mine owners to gra the union most of its demands.
truman even stopped a strike tl shut down the nations railroads by threatening to draft the stril workers into the army.
labor unrest and high prices prompted many americans t call for a change.
the republicans seized on these feelings durir 430 the 1946 congressional elections and won control of both houses of congress for the first time since 1930.
the new conservative congress quickly set out to limit the power of organized labor.
in 1947 legislators passed the taft hartley act which outlawed the closed shop or the practice of forcing business owners to hire only union members.
this law also allowed states to pass right to work laws which outlawed union shops shops requiring new workers to join the union.
it prohibited featherbedding or limiting work output in order to create more jobs.
it also banned using union money to support political campaigns.
truman however vetoed the bill arguing that it was a mistake primarysource m it would reverse the basic direction of our national labor policy inject the government into private economic affairs on an unprecedented scale and conflict with important principles of our democratic society.
its provisions would cause more strikes not fewer.

families roughly tripled.
people in all income brackets were experiencing a rapid rise in income.
in 1958 economist john kenneth galbraith published the affluent society in which he claimed that the nations postwar prosperity was a new phenomenon.
galbraith suggested that whereas past societies had an economy of scarcity with limited economic productivity the united states had now created an economy of abundance new business techniques and technology enabled the production of abundant goods and services.
they dramatically raised the u s standard of living.
with more disposable income than ever americans began spending on new consumer goods.
advertising helped fuel the spending spree.

the baby boom the u s birthrate exploded after world war ii.
from 1945 to 1961 mor than 65 million children were born in the united states.
at the height of this baby boom a child was born every seven seconds.
many factors contributed to the baby boom.

also the government encouraged the growth of families by offering generous gi benefits for home purchases.
finally popular culti celebrated pregnancy parenthood and large families.

these employees typically wore a white dress shirt and a tie to work instead of the blue denim work shirts of factory workers and laborers 1956 white collar workers outnumbered blue collar workers for the first t the shift to white collar jobs was partly the result of both new technology and management innovations introduced into the workplac the 1950s the first business computers came on the market.

doing so made each stores operations more efficient and consistent and helped to reduce costs many other corporate leaders also expected conformity rather than freethinking socio ogist david riesman and others criticized this trend.
in his 1950 book the lonely crowd riesman argued that conformity was changing people.
he claimed that people used to judge themselves on the basis of their own values and the esteem of their families.
but now he said the american is said to be shallower freer with his money friendlier more uncertain of himself and his values more demanding of approval.
this attitude of other direction is becoming the typical character of the new middle class in his 1956 book the organization man william h whyte jr attacked the similarity many businesses cultivated in their employees to keep any individual from dominating.

why were the results different from those in previous generations.
teens in every generation seek to separate themselves from their parents.
in that respect the 1950s were just like earlier decades but the results were different for two reasons.
first teens had disposable income that could be spent on entertainment designed specifically for them.
second the new mass media meant that teens around the country could hear the same music or see the same television shows.
the new youth culture became an independent market for the entertainment and advertising industries.
rock n roll in 1951 at a record store in downtown cleveland ohio radio disc jockey alan freed noticed white teenagers buying african american rhythm and blues records and dancing to the music in the store.
freed convinced his manager to put the music on the air and listeners went crazy for it.

with a loud and heavy beat that made it ideal for dancing and lyrics about themes that appealed to young people rock n roll became wildly popular.
teens bought recordings from artists such as buddy holly chuck berry and bill haley and the comets.
in 1956 teenagers found their first rock n roll hero in music and movie star elvis presley.
at first popular television host ed sullivan refused to invite presley to appear on his variety show.
he insisted that rock n roll music was not fit for a family oriented show.
after another show featuring presley upset sullivans high ratings however he relented.
presley owed his popularity as much to his moves as to his music swinging his hips and dancing during his performances in ways that shocked many people.
many adults condemned rock n roll as loud mindless and dangerous.
the city council of san antonio texas banned rock n roll from the jukeboxes at public swimming poo s the rock n roll hits that teens bought in record numbers united them in a world their parents did not share.

as middle class families moved to the suburbs they left behind the poor and less educated.
many city centers deteriorated because they no longer received taxes from their former middle class residents.
cities could no longer provide adequate public transportation housing and other services.

he also refused to testify under oath claiming immunity or freedom from prosecution on the grounds that he had had confidential dealings with president harding.
daugherty was later dismissed by president coolidge.
teapot dome and the other scandals of the harding administration increased americans distrust of the federal government and political leaders.

andrew mellon a successful banker and industrialist was secretary ofthe treasury under president harding and the chief architect of economic policy.
when mellon took office he had three major goals to balance the budget to reduce the governments debt and to cut taxes.
mellon argued that if taxes were lower businesses and some consumers would spend and invest their extra money.
this would cause the economy to grow and americans would earn more money.
the government then would collect more in taxes.
this idea is known today as supply side economics at mellons urging congress dramatically reduced tax rates.
by 1928 congress had reduced the income tax rate most americans paid to 0 5 percent down from 4 percent.
they cut the rate for the wealthiest americans to 25 percent down from 73 percent.
the federal budget fell from 6 4 billion to less than 3 billion in seven years.
secretary of commerce herbert hoover also sought to promote economic growth.
he tried to balance government regulation with his philosophy of cooperative individualism.

many farmers borrowed heavily to buy new land and new machinery to raise more crops.
sales were strong prices were high and farmers prospered.
after the war however european farm output rose and the debt ridden countries of europe had little money to spend on american farm products.
in addition congress passed the fordney mccumber act in 1922 making matters worse by raising tariffs dramatically.
this dampened the american market for foreign goods and sparked a reaction in foreign markets against buying american agricultural products.

smith was the first roman catholic to win a major partys presidential nomination.
he faced a tough challenger as herbert hoover was secretary of commerce and former head of the food administration.
smiths religious beliefs became a campaign issue.
some protestants claimed the catholic church financed smiths campaign and would have inappropriate influence on american politics.
the attacks embarrassed hoover a quaker and he tried to quash them but the charges damaged smiths candidacy.

sometimes the stock market has a long period of 290 rising stock prices or a bull market.
the bull market of the 1920s convinced many to invest in stocks.
by 1929 approximately 10 percent of american households owned stocks.
before the late 1920s stock prices generally reflected their true values.
in the late 1920s however many investors failed to consider a companys earnings and profits.
buyers engaged in speculation or betting the market would continue to climb thus enabling them to sell stock and make money quickly.
many investors bought stocks on margin making only a small cash down payment as low as 10 percent of the price.
with 1 000 an investor could buy a sum of 10 000 worth of stock.
the remaining 9 000 came as an interest bearing loan from the stockbroker.

the following week on october 29 a day that was later dubbed black tuesday prices took the steepest dive yet.
that day more than 16 million shares of stock were sold and the value of the industrial index a measure ofthe value of leading industrial companies dropped by 10 percent.
by mid november the market price of stocks had dropped by more than one third some 30 billion was lost a sum roughly equal to the total wages americans earned in 1929.
although the stock market crash was not the major cause of the depression it undermined the economys ability to overcome other weaknesses.
bank run persistent and heavy demands by a bank s depositors creditors or customers to withdraw money banks begin to close the market crash weakened the nations banks in two ways.
first by 1929 banks had lent billions to stock speculators.
second many banks had invested depositors money in the stock market hoping for high returns.
when stock values collapsed banks lost money on their investments and speculators defaulted on their loans.
having suffered serious losses many banks cut back drastically on loans.
with less credit available consumers and businesses were not able to borrow as much money sending the economy into a recession.
some banks could not absorb the losses they suffered and had to close.
the government did not insure bank deposits so if a bank failed customer.
including even those who did not invest in the stock market lost their savings.
as a growing number of banks closed in 1929 and 1930 a severe crisis of confidence in the banking system further destabilized the economy news of bank failures worried americans.
some depositors made runs on banks thus causing the banks to fail.
a bank run takes place when man depositors decide to withdraw their money at the same time usually out of fear that the bank will collapse.
most banks make a profit by lending money received from depositors and collecting interest on the loans.
the bank keeps only a fraction of depositors money in reserve.
usually that reserve is enough to meet the banks needs.
if too many people withdraw their money however the bank will collapse.
by 1932 about one in four banks in the united states had gone out of business.
h reading progress check determining cause and effect how did the failure of the stock market contribute to larger economic decline.
the roots of the great depression susdsng question what were the underlying conditions that led to the collapse of the us.
the stock market crash played a major role in putting the economy into a recession.
yet the crash would not have led to a long lasting depression if other forces had not been at work.
the roots of the great depression were deeply entangled in the economy of the 1920s.
the uneven distribution of income overproduction was a factor leading to the onset of the great depression.
more efficient machinery increased the production capacity of factories and farms.
most americans did not earn enough to buy up the goods they helped produce.
manufacturing output per person hour rose 32 percent but the average workers wage increased only 8 percent.
in 1929 the top 5 percent of all american households earned 30 percent of the nations income.
in contrast about two thirds of families earned less than 2 500 a year leaving them with little disposable income.
farmers in particular did not share in the prosperity of the 1920s as many had gone into debt to buy land or equipment during world war i when demand for their products was high.
when prices fell they tried to produce even more to pay their debts taxes and living expenses.
prices dropped so low that many farmers went bankrupt and lost their farms.
during the 1920s many americans had purchased high cost items such as refrigerators and cars on the installment plan.
purchasers could make small down payments and pay the remainder of the items price in monthly installments.
paying off such debts eventually forced some buyers to stop making new purchases.
because of the decrease in demand for their products manufacturers in turn cut production and laid off employees.
the slowdown in retail sales reverberated throughout the economy.
when radio sales slumped for example orders for copper wire wood cabinets and glass radio tubes slowed.
montana copper miners minnesota lumberjacks and ohio glassworkers lost jobs.
jobless workers cut purchases further reducing sales.
this put even more americans out of work.

2 analyzing information what effect did the decline in automobile sales have on related industries.
i what caused the economy to collapse.
low interest rates federal reserve kept interest rates low companies borrowed money and expanded more than necessary.
overproduction companies made more goods than could be sold.
uneven distribution of wealth not everyone who wanted consumer goods could afford them.
high tariffs tariffs restricted foreign demand for american goods.
falling demand with too many goods unsold production was cut back and employees were laid off.
stock market speculation low interest rates encouraged borrowing money to speculate endangering bank solvency.

it is the road not to more liberty but to less liberty.
herbert hoover from a speech delivered october 22 1928 dbq analyzing primary sources why did hoover refuse to support government intervention in the economy.
unemployment insurance was nonexistent.
many families had little or no savings.
lost jobs often meant dire circumstances.
in 1930 alone about 26 000 businesses failed.
the loss of export sales many jobs might have been saved if american manufacturers had sold more goods abroad.
as the bull market of the 1920s sped up however u s banks made loans to speculators rather than loans to foreign companies.
loans from u s banks had helped european nations make war reparations and pay down war debts.
they had also secured foreign markets for u s exports.
without these loans from u s banks foreign companies purchased fewer american products.
in 1929 hoover wanted to encourage overseas trade by lowering tariffs.
congress however decided to protect american industry from foreign competition by raising tariffs.
the resulting legislation the hawley smoot tariff raised the average tariff rate to the highest level in american history.
in the end it failed to help american businesses because foreign countries responded by raising their own tariffs.
this meant fewer american products were sold overseas.
by 1932 exports had fallen to less than half the level that they had been in 1929.
a decrease in exports hurt both american companies and farmers.
mistakes by the federal reserve just as consumers were able to buy more goods on credit access to easy money propelled the stock market.
instead of raising interest rates to curb excessive speculation the federal reserve board kept its rates low throughout the 1920s.
the boards failure to raise interest rates significantly helped cause the depression in two ways.
first by keeping rates low the board encouraged member banks to make risky loans.
second the low interest rates led business leaders to think that the economy was still expanding.
as a result they borrowed more money to expand production.
this was a serious mistake because it led to overproduction when sales were falling.
when the depression finally hit companies had to lay off workers to cut costs.
then the federal reserve made another mistake it raised interest rates thus tightening credit.
the economy continued to spiral downward.

the depression grew steadily worse during president hoovers administration.
in 1930 across the nation 1 352 banks suspended operations more than twice the number of bank failures in 1929.
in 1932 alone some 30 000 companies went out of business.
by 1933 roughly one fourth of the workforce was unemployed.
struggling to get by the jobless often went hungry.
when possible they stood in breadlines for free food or lined up outside soup kitchens set up by private groups.
people who could not pay their rent or mortgage lost their homes.
some paralyzed by fear and humiliation did not move and were evicted.
court officers called bailiffs ejected them and their belongings.
throughout the country newly homeless people put up shacks on unused or public lands.
they built shantytowns which they called hoovervilles after the president they blamed for their plight.
in search of work or a better life many homeless unemployed americans began walking hitchhiking or most often riding the rails across the country.
these wanderers called hoboes would sneak past railroad police to slip into open boxcars on freight trains.
hundreds of thousands of people mostly boys and young men wandered from place to place in this way.
the depression also caused many immigrants to return to their native countries.
in some cases this repatriation was voluntary as jobs the great depression begins 295 many americans abandoned their homes as windstorms and drought turned the great plains into a dust bowl.
became scarce.
in other cases repatriation was forced.
the federal government launched repatriation drives to send poor immigrants back to their home countries.
it also stepped up efforts to deport immigrants who had violated the law.
in the southwest federal officials rounded up mexicans often without regard to their citizenship status and forcibly returned them to mexico.
although estimates vary historians believe that the mexican repatriation resulted in somewhere between 500 000 and 2 million people of mexican heritage perhaps more that half of whom were american citizens being making generalizations how does this photo illustrate the depression experience of some americans.

mexicans were probably targeted more than others in part because of racism and in part because of cost.

the dust bowl suspend to cease or stop bailiff minor officer of the courts hobo a homeless and usually penniless wanderer farmers soon faced a new disaster.
the great plains were very dry with high winds.
topsoil was held in place by deep rooted prairie grasses that preserved moisture in times of low rainfall.
the homestead act had and encouraged large scale settlement of the region and as the population grew tractors and combines came into widespread use much of the great plains were extensively deep plowed making the topsoil susceptible to rapid erosion.
deep plowing was not a problem for many decades as the great plains experienced higher than normal rainfall from the late 1800s to the 1920s.
but when crop prices dropped in the 1920s many farmers left their fields uncultivated even as temperatures had begun to climb and rainfall had begun to decline.
in the early 1930s a severe drought hit and there was nothing anchoring the soil or retaining moisture.
the soil turned to dust.
human and physical geographic factors had combined to create a disaster.
winds blew the arid earth aloft blackening the sky for hundreds of miles.
dust buried crops and livestock.
humans and animals caught outdoors sometimes died of suffocation when the dust filled their lungs.
during most of the 1930s an average of 50 dust storms a year hit the plain some great plains farmers managed to hold on to their land but othei were not as lucky.
if their land was mortgaged they had to turn the property over to the banks.

arts and entertainment guiding question in whatways did culture reflect the depression experience.
the hard times of the 1930s led many americans to want to escape their worries.
movies and radio programs grew increasingly popular.
during the 1930s more than 60 million americans went to the movies each week.
child stars delighted viewers and comedies provided a relief from daily worries.
the marx brothers amused audiences in such films as animal crackers.
moviegoers also loved cartoons.
walt disney produced the first feature length animated film snow white and the seven dwarfs in 1937.
serious films often celebrated ordinary people and the values of smalltown america.
in mr smith goes to washington jimmy stewart played a decent but naive senator.
he refuses to compromise his principles and exposes the corruption of some of his colleagues.
although few movies portrayed the hard times of the era dramas tended to show heroes often regular people standing up to corruption or powerful forces.
these films resonated with americans because they offset the feelings of helplessness the depression had caused and also reflected the belief of many people that they were victims of corruption among the wealthy and powerful.
in 1939 mgm produced the wizard of oz a colorful musical that lifted viewers spirits.
that same year vivien leigh and clark gable thrilled audiences in gone with the wind a civil war epic that won nine academy awards.
hattie mcdaniel won best supporting actress becoming the first african american to win an academy award.
while movies captured the imagination radio offered information and entertainment.
tens of millions of people listened to the radio daily.
comedians such as jack benny were popular as were the adventures of superheroes such as the green hornet.
daytime dramas continued their story lines from day to day.
programs such as the guiding light presented the personal struggles of middle class families.
the sponsors were often makers of laundry soaps so the shows were nicknamed soap operas.
radio also exposed listeners to a variety of musical styles.
americans enjoyed hit songs from movies and broadway musicals to swing music to country.
literature and the visual arts also flourished during the 1930s.
writers and artists tried to portray life around them using the homeless and unemployed as their subjects in stories and pictures.
novelists developed new writing techniques.
in the sound and the fury william faulkner shows what characters are thinking and feeling before they speak.
using this stream of consciousness technique he exposes hidden attitudes of the residents of a fictional mississippi county.
perhaps no writer did more than reporter and novelist john steinbeck did to capture the characteristics and issues of the depression.
steinbeck focused on the rural poor particularly agricultural workers and farmers.
he created a sense of realism with rich detailed descriptions showing how people said things and what they and their surroundings looked like.
he focused on how their circumstances were partly the result of the economic system but he also stressed the importance of friendship and family in helping people survive hardship.
steinbecks writings added flesh and blood to journalists reports of poverty and misfortune and evoked both sympathy for his characters and indignation at social injustice.
in the grapes of wrath 1939 steinbeck tells the story of a family fleeing the dust bowl to find a new life in california.
steinbeck had visited the camps of migrant families and sympathized with colleague a person who works in the same or a similar profession soap opera a serial drama on television or radio using melodramatic situations technique a method of achieving a desired aim the great depression begins 297 biography margaret bourke white was life magazine sfirst female photojournalist.

their fears.
in his novel he describes the experiences of the joad family who headed to california after losing their farm.
images were also becoming more influential.
photographers roamed the nation with the new 35 millimeter cameras seeking new subjects.
in 1936 time magazine publisher henry luce introduced life a weekly photojournalism magazine that enjoyed instant success.
the striking pictures of photojournalists dorothea lange and margaret bourke white showed how the great depression affected average americans.
lange photographed homeless people in san francisco and poor migrant agricultural workers in californias central valley.
one of her most famous photos entitled migrant mother 1936 exemplifies the depression eras characteristics and issues.
the photo depicts a sad weary women with seven children who had just sold her cars tires to buy food.
lange also traveled throughout the dust bowl states capturing images of the devastated region.
when the images were collected in a best selling book an american exodus 1939 the state of california responded by setting up camps to shelter migrant workers.
like lange margaret bourke white was a master at using photography to capture the eras ironies and contrasts.
in 1937 life magazine carried one of hei most famous photographs.
it showed a line of poor african american flood victims waiting for help in front of a billboard which declared worlds highes standard of living and showed a white family happily driving a car.
painters of the 1930s included thomas hart benton and grant wood whose styles were referred to as the regionalist school.
their work emphasized traditional american values especially those of the rural midwest and south.
woods best known painting today is american gothic.

why do we study history.
we know things have happened in the past that have shaped the world we live in today.
there are many things we appreciate and other things that we think are wrong.
the purpose of history perhaps more than anything else is to explain why things happened and what changed as a result.
in short understanding history requires you to identify cause and effect relationships.
learning the skill determining cause and effect involves considering why an event occurred.
a cause is an action an event a condition or a decision that makes something else happen.
what happens is the effect.
there are three kinds of causes.
necessary causes are causes that you have to have or the event cannot happen.
a sufficient cause is a cause that all by itself can cause an event.
but it is not the only possible cause.
contributory causes cannot cause an event by themselves but they can help shape the conditions under which it happens.
to determine cause and effect follow these steps ask why an event happened.
list possible reasons for the event.
look at the list.
which causes are necessary.
are they all necessary.
which ones might be sufficient but not needed to explain the event.
which causes only contributed to shaping the event.
look at the timing of the causes.
which ones established conditions far in the past.
these are long range causes.
which ones helped trigger an event once conditions were in place.
these are short term or immediate causes.
to determine effects ask what happened because of this.
or what were the results of this.
