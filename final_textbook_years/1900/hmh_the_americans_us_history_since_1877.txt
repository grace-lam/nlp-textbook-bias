4 chapter 11 the western front 1914 1916 the first time.
verdun feb july 1916 french hold the line in longest battle of the war.
somme 1st battle july nov 1916 disastrous british offensive.
unable to save belgium the allies retreated to the marne river in france where they halted the german advance in september 1914.
after struggling to outflank each other s armies both sides dug in for a long siege.
by the spring of 1915 two parallel systems of deep rat infested trenches crossed france from the belgian coast to the swiss alps.
german soldiers occupied one set of trenches allied soldiers the other.
there were three main kinds of trenches front line support and reserve.
soldiers spent a period of time in each kind of trench.
dugouts or underground rooms were used as officers quarters and command posts.
between the trench complexes lay no man s land a barren expanse of mud pockmarked with shell craters and filled with barbed wire.
periodically the soldiers charged enemy lines only to be mowed down by machine gun fire.
the scale of slaughter was horrific.
during the first battle of the somme which began on july 1 1916 and lasted until mid november the british suffered 60 000 casualties the first day alone.
final casualties totaled about 1 2 million yet only about seven miles of ground changed hands.
this bloody trench warfare in which armies fought for mere yards of ground continued for over three years.
it led to a stalemate wherein neither side could gain an advantage.
f matn idea drawing conclusions sgj why do you think soldiers were rotated in the trenches.
history video j vocabulary emigrate to leave ones country or region to settle in another to move main idea analyzing motives why did the united states begin to favor britain and france.
americans question neutrality in 1914 most americans saw no reason to join a struggle 3 000 miles away.
the war did not threaten american lives or property.
this does not mean however that individual americans were indifferent to who would win the war.
public opinion was strong but divided.
divided loyalties socialists criticized the war as a capitalist and imperialist struggle between germany and england to control markets and colonies in china africa and the middle east.
pacifists such as lawyer and politician william jennings bryan believed that war was evil and that the united states should set an example of peace to the world.
many americans simply did not want their sons to experience the horrors of warfare as a hit song of 1915 conveyed.
i didn t raise my boy to be a soldier i brought him up to be my pride and joy.
who dares to place a musket on his shoulder to shoot some other mother s darling boy millions of naturalized u s citizens followed the war closely because they still had ties to the nations from which they had emigrated.
for example many americans of german descent sympathized with germany.
americans of irish descent remembered the centuries of british oppression in ireland and saw the war as a chance for ireland to gain its independence.
on the other hand many americans felt close to britain because of a common ancestry and language as well as similar democratic institutions and legal systems.
germany s aggressive sweep through belgium increased american sympathy for the allies.
the germans attacked civilians destroying villages cathedrals libraries and even hospitals.
some atrocity stories spread by british propaganda later proved to be false but enough proved true that one american magazine referred to germany as the bully of europe.
more important america s economic ties with the allies were far stronger than its ties with the central powers.
before the war american trade with britain and france was more than double its trade with germany.
during the first two years of the war america s transatlantic trade became even more lopsided as the allies flooded american manufacturers with orders for all sorts of war supplies including dynamite cannon powder submarines copper wire and tubing and armored cars.
the united states shipped millions of dollars of war supplies to the allies but requests kept coming.
by 1915 the united states was experiencing a labor shortage.
y cono m f background trade alliances maintaining neutrality proved difficult for american businesses.
trade with germany became increasingly risky.
shipments were often stopped by the british blockade.
in addition president wilson and others spoke out against german atrocities and warned of the threat that the german empire posed to democracy.
from 1912 to 1917 u s trade relationships with european countries shifted dramatically.
from 1914 on trade with the allies quadrupled while trade with germany fell to near zero.
also by 1917 american banks had loaned 2 3 billion to the allies but only 27 million to the central powers.
many u s leaders including treasury secretary william mcadoo felt that american prosperity depended upon an allied victory.

by how much did total u s exports to europe rise or fall between 1914 and 1917.
what trends does the graph show before the start of the war and during the war.
the first world war 377 i t this image of a u boat crew machine gunning helpless survivors of the lusitania was clearly meant as propaganda.
in fact u boats seldom lingered after an attack.
the war hits home although the majority of americans favored victory for the allies rather than the central powers they did not want to join the allies fight.
by 1917 however america had mobilized for war against the central powers for two reasons to ensure allied repayment of debts to the united states and to prevent the germans from threatening u s shipping.
the british blockade as fighting on land continued britain began to make more use of its naval strength.
it blockaded the german coast to prevent weapons and other military supplies from getting through.
however the british expanded the definition of contraband to include food.
they also extended the blockade to neutral ports and mined the entire north sea.
the results were twofold.
first american ships carrying goods for germany refused to challenge the blockade and seldom reached their destination.
second germany found it increasingly difficult to import foodstuffs and fertilizers for crops.
by 1917 famine stalked the country.
an estimated 750 000 germans starved to death as a result of the british blockade.
americans had been angry at britain s blockade which threatened freedom of the seas and prevented american goods from reaching german ports.
however germany s response to the blockade soon outraged american public opinion.
german u boat response germany responded to the british blockade with a counterblockade by u boats from unterseeboot the german word for a submarine.
any british or allied ship found in the waters around britain would be sunk and it would not always be possible to warn crews and passengers of an attack.
one of the worst disasters occurred on may 7 1915 when a u boat sank the british liner lusitania loo si ta ne a off the southern coast of ireland of the 1 198 persons lost 128 were americans.
the germans defended their action on the grounds that the liner carried ammunition.
despite germany s explanation americans became outraged with germany because of the loss of life american public opinion turned against germany and the central powers.

imperial german el toshivtcrox n c arab chapter 11 a newspaper ad for the lusitania included a warning fromthe german embassy main idea analyzing effects how did the german u boat campaign affect u s public opinion.
despite this provocation president wilson ruled out a military response in favor of a sharp protest to germany.
three months later in august 1915 a u boat sank another british liner the arabic drowning two americans.
again the united states protested and this time germany agreed not to sink any more passenger ships.
but in march 1916 germany broke its promise and torpedoed an unarmed french passenger steamer the sussex.
the sussex sank and about 80 passengers including americans were killed or injured.
once again the united states warned that it would break off diplomatic relations unless germany changed its tactics.
again germany agreed but there was a condition if the united states could not persuade britain to lift its blockade against food and fertilizers germany would consider renewing unrestricted submarine warfare the 1916 election in november 1916 came the u s presidential election.
the democrats renominated wilson and the republicans nominated supreme court justice charles evans hughes.
wilson campaigned on the slogan he kept us out of war.
hughes pledged to uphold america s right to freedom of the seas but also promised not to be too severe on germany.
the election returns shifted from hour to hour.
in fact hughes went to bed believing he had been elected.
when a reporter tried to reach him with the news of wilson s victory an aide said the president can t be disturbed.
well replied the reporter when he wakes up tell him he s no longer president.
the united states declares war wilson campaign button after the election wilson tried to mediate between the warring alliances.
the attempt failed.
in a speech before the senate in january 1917 the president called for a peace without victory.
a peace between equals in which neither side would impose harsh terms on the other.
wilson hoped that all nations would join in a league for peace that would work to extend democracy maintain freedom of the seas and reduce armaments.
german provocation the germans ignored wilson s calls for peace.
germany s leaders hoped to defeat britain by resuming unrestricted submarine warfare.
on january 31 the kaiser announced that u boats would sink all ships in british waters hostile or neutral on sight.
wilson was stunned.
the german decision meant that the united states would have to go to war.
however the president held back saying that he would wait for actual overt acts before declaring war.
main idea i making inferences why did the zimmermann note alarm the u s government.
the overt acts came.
first was the zimmermann note a telegram from the german foreign minister to the german ambassador in mexico that was intercepted by british agents.
the telegram proposed an alliance between mexico and germany and promised that if war with the united states broke out germany would support mexico in recovering lost territory in texas new mexico and arizona.
next came the sinking of four unarmed american merchant ships with a loss of 36 lives.
finally events in russia removed the last significant obstacle to direct u s involvement in the war.
in march the oppressive russian monarchy was alliances during wwi allies central powers australia india austria hungary belgium italy bulgaria british colonies japan germany canada montenegro ottoman empire newfoundland new zealand france portugal french north romania africa french russia colonies serbia great britain south africa greece united states although not all of the countries listed above sent troops into the war they all joined the war on the allied side at various times.
the first world war 379 aajorldstagp revolution in russia at first the russians surprised the germans by mobilizing rapidly.
russian troops advanced quickly into german territory but were turned back at the battle of tannenberg in august 1914.
throughout 1915 the russians endured defeats and continued to retreat.
by the end of 1915 they had suffered about 2 5 million casualties.
the war also caused massive bread shortages in russia.
revolutionaries ousted the czar in march 1917 and established a provisional government.
in november the bolsheviks led by lenin and trotsky overthrew the provisional government.
they set up a communist state and sought peace with the central powers.
replaced with a representative government.
now supporters of american entry into the war could claim that this was a war of democracies against brutal monarchies.
america acts a light drizzle fell on washington on april 2 1917 as senators representatives ambassadors members of the supreme court and other guests crowded into the capitol building to hear president wilson deliver his war resolution.
a personal voice woodrow wilson property can be paid for the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be.
the present german submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.
we are glad to fight for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples.
the world must be made safe for democracy.
we have no selfish ends to serve.
we desire no conquest no dominion.
we seek no indemnities.
it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war.
but the right is more precious than peace.
quoted in american voices congress passed the resolution a few days later.
with the hope of neutrality finally shattered u s troops would follow the stream of american money and munitions that had been heading to the allies throughout the war.
but wilson s plea to make the world safe for democracy wasn t just political posturing.
indeed wilson and many americans truly believed that the united states had to join the war to pave the way for a future order of peace and freedom.
a resolved but anxious nation held its breath as the united states prepared for war.

eddie rickenbacker famous fighter pilot of world war i was well known as a racecar driver before the war.
he went to france as a driver but transferred to the aviation division.
he learned to fly on his own time and eventually joined the u s army air service.
rickenbacker repeatedly fought the dreaded flying circus a german air squadron led by the red baron manfred von richthofen.

america mobilizes the united states was not prepared for war.
only 200 000 men were in service when war was declared and few officers had combat experience.
drastic measures were needed to build an army large and modem enough to make an impact in europe.
the first world war 381 for u s arny nearest recruiting station drafted men line up for service at camp travis in san antonio texas around 1917.
vocabulary separated or isolated from others james montgomery flaggs portrayal of uncle sam became the most famous recruiting poster in american history.
raising an army to meet the government s need for more fighting power congress passed the selective service act in may 1917.
the act required men to register with the government in order to be randomly selected for military service.
by the end of 1918 24 million men had registered under the act.
of this number almost 3 million were called up.
about 2 million troops reached europe before the truce was signed and three fourths of them saw actual combat.
most of the inductees had not attended high school and about one in five was foreign born.
about 400 000 african americans served in the armed forces.
more than half of them served in france.
african american soldiers served in segregated units and were excluded from the navy and marines.
most african americans were assigned to noncombat duties although there were exceptions.
the all black 369th infantry regiment saw more continuous duty on the front lines than any other american regiment.
two soldiers of the 369th henry johnson and needham roberts were the first americans to receive france s highest military honor the croix de guerre the cross of war.
the eight month training period took place partly in the united states and partly in europe.
during this time the men put in 17 hour days on target practice bayonet drill kitchen duty and cleaning up the grounds.
since real weapons were in short supply soldiers often drilled with fake weapons rocks instead of hand grenades or wooden poles instead of rifles.
although women were not allowed to enlist the army reluctantly accepted women in the army corps of nurses but denied them army rank pay and benefits.
meanwhile some 13 000 women accepted noncombat positions in the navy and marines where they served as nurses secretaries and telephone operators with full military rank.
mass production in addition to the vast army that had to be created and trained the united states had to find a way to transport men food and equipment over thousands of miles of ocean.
it was an immense task made more difficult by german submarine activity which by early 1917 had sunk twice as much ship tonnage as the allies had built.
in order to expand its fleet the u s govern ment took four crucial steps.
summarizing how did the united states raise an army for the war.
2 chapter 11 main idea summarizing how did the united states expand its navy so quickly.
first the government exempted many shipyard workers from the draft and gave others a deferred classification delaying their participation in the draft.
second the u s chamber of commerce joined in a public relations campaign to emphasize the importance of shipyard work.
they distributed service flags to families of shipyard workers just like the flags given to families of soldiers and sailors.
they also urged automobile owners to give shipyard employees rides to and from work since streetcars were so crowded.
third shipyards used prefabrication techniques.
instead of building an entire ship in the yard standardized parts were built elsewhere and then assembled at the yard.
this method reduced construction time substantially.
as a result on just one day july 4 1918 the united states launched 95 ships.
fourth the government took over commercial and private ships and converted them for transatlantic war use.
america turns the tide german u boat attacks on merchant ships in the atlantic were a serious threat to the allied war effort.
american vice admiral william s sims convinced the british to try the convoy system in which a heavy guard of destroyers escorted merchant ships back and forth across the atlantic in groups.
by fall of 1917 shipping losses had been cut in half.
the u s navy also helped lay a 230 mile barrier of mines across the north sea from scotland to norway.
the barrier was designed to bottle up the u boats that sailed from german ports and keep them out of the atlantic ocean.
by early 1918 the germans found it increasingly difficult to replace their losses and to staff their fleet with trained submariners.
of the almost 2 million americans who sailed to europe during the war only 637 were lost to u boat attacks.
world war i convoy system merchant ships defensive boundary r i enemy submarine fighting in europe after two and a half years of fighting the allied forces were exhausted and demoralized.
one of the main contributions that american troops made to the allied war effort apart from their numbers was their freshness and enthusiasm.
they were determined to hit the germans hard.
twenty two year old joseph douglas lawrence a u s army lieutenant remarked on the importance of american enthusiasm when he described his first impression of the trenches.
a personal voice joseph douglas lawrence i have never seen or heard of such an elaborate complete line of defense as the british had built at this point.
there was a trench with dugouts every three hundred yards from the front line in ypres back four miles to and including dirty bucket.
everything was fronted with barbed wire and other entanglements.
artillery was concealed everywhere.
railroad tracks narrow and standard gauge reached from the trenches back into the zone of supply.
nothing had been neglected to hold this line save only one important thing enthusiasm among the troops and that was the purpose of our presence.
fighting soldier the aef in 1918 lieutenant joseph d lawrence the first world war 383 fighting over there the american expeditionary force aef led by general john j pershing included men from widely separated parts of the country.
american infantrymen were nicknamed doughboys possibly because of the white belts they wore which they cleaned with pipe clay or dough most doughboys had never ventured far from the farms or small towns where they lived and the sophisticated sights and sounds of paris made a vivid impression.
however doughboys were also shocked by the unexpected horrors of the battlefield and astonished by modern warfare.
new weapons with fighting bogged down in the trenches both the allied and central powers began looking for weapons and tactics to gain an advantage.
although some of these weapons were new others like the machine gun had been so refined that they changed the nature of warfare.
the two most innovative weapons were the tank and the airplane.
together they heralded mechanized warfare or warfare that relies on machines powered by gasoline and diesel engines.
tanks ran on caterpillar treads and were built of steel so that bullets bounced off.
the british first used tanks during the 1916 battle of the somme but not very effectively.
by 1917 the british had learned how to drive large numbers of tanks through barbed wire defenses clearing a path for the infantry.
the early airplanes were so flimsy that at first both sides limited their use to scouting.
after a while the two sides used tanks to fire at enemy planes that were gathering information.
early dogfights or individual air combats like the one described by eddie rickenbacker resembled duels.
pilots sat in their open cockpits and shot at each other with pistols.
because it was hard to fly a plane and shoot a pistol at the same time planes began carrying mounted machine guns.
but the planes propeller blades kept getting in the way of the bullets.
then the germans introduced an interrupter gear that permitted the stream of bullets to avoid the whirring blades.
v v player general john j pershing 1860 1948 when general pershing the commander of the american expeditionary force aef arrived in france he found that the allies intended to use american troops simply as reinforcements.
pershing however urged that the aef operate as an independent fighting force under american command.
pershing believed in aggressive combat and felt that three years of trench warfare had made the allies too defensive.
under pershing american forces helped to stop the german advance ca turing important enemy positions.
after the war pershing was made general of the armies of the united states the highest rank given to an officer.
main idea forming generalizations how did world war i change the nature of warfare.
background when the u s entered the war its air power was weak.
then in july 1917 congress appropriated a hefty 675 million to build an air force.
technology technology at war both sides in world war i used new technology to attack more soldiers from greater distances than ever before.
aircraft and long range guns were even used to fire on civilian targets libraries cathedrals and city districts.
the biggest guns could shell a city from 75 miles.
machine guns firepower increased to 600 rounds per minute.
airships and airplanes one of the most famous wwi planes the british sopwith camel had a front mountecj machine gun for dogfights planes were also loaded with bombs as were the floating gas filled airships called zeppelms meanwhile airplanes were built to travel faster and carry heavy bomb loads.
by 1918 the british had built up a strategic bomber force of 22 000 planes with which to attack german weapons factories and army bases.
observation balloons were used extensively by both sides.
balloons were so important strategically that they were often protected by aircraft flying close by and they became prime targets for rickenbacker and other ace pilots.
main idea analyzing effects what were the physical and psychological effects of this new kind of warfare.
the war introduces new hazards none of the new technologies provided the hoped for advantage.
instead the stalemate continued and led to horrific injuries and hazards.
the fighting men were surrounded by filth lice rats and polluted water that caused dysentery.
they inhaled poison gas and smelled the stench of decaying bodies.
they suffered from lack of sleep.
constant bombardments and other experiences often led to battle fatigue and shell shock a term coined during world war i to describe a complete emotional collapse from which many never recovered.
physical problems included a disease called trench foot caused by standing in cold wet trenches for long periods of time without changing into dry socks or boots.
first the toes would turn red or blue then they would become numb and finally they would start to rot.
the only solution was to amputate the toes and in some cases the entire foot.
a painful infection of the gums and throat called trench mouth was also common among the soldiers.
red cross ambulances often staffed by american volunteers carried the wounded from the battlefield to the hospital.
an american nurse named florence bullard recounted her experience in a hospital near the front in 1918.
a personal voice florence bullard the army is only twelve miles away from us and only the wounded that are too severely injured to live to be carried a little farther are brought here.

by may they were within 50 miles of paris.
the aef arrived just in time to help stop the german advance at cantigny in france.
several weeks later u s troops played a major role in throwing back german attacks at chateau thierry and belleau wood.
in july and august they helped win the second battle of the marne.
the tide had turned against the central powers.
in september u s soldiers began to mount offensives against the germans at saint mihiel and in the meuse argonne area.
for more than a month the allies pushed northward.
in the battle of the argonne forest the americans suffered some 120 000 casualties.
by november however they occupied the hills around sedan france.
american war hero during the fighting in the meuse argonne area alvin york became famous as a war hero.
york sought exemption as a conscientious objector a person who opposes warfare on moral grounds pointing out that the bible says thou shalt not kill.
york eventually decided that it was morally acceptable to fight if the cause was just.
on october 8 1918 armed only with a rifle and a revolver york killed 25 germans and with six other doughboys captured 132 prisoners.
general pershing called him the outstanding soldier of the aef.
for his heroic acts york was promoted to sergeant and awarded the congressional medal of honor.
the collapse of germany on november 3 1918 austria hungary surrendered to the allies.
that same day german sailors mutinied against government authority.
the mutiny spread quickly everywhere in germany groups of soldiers and workers organized revolutionary councils.
on november 9 socialist leaders in the capital berlin established a german republic.
the kaiser gave up the throne.
drawing conclusions how did american forces help the allies win the war.
i although there were no allied soldiers on german territory and no truly decisive battle had been fought the germans were too exhausted to continue fighting.
so at the eleventh hour on the eleventh day in the eleventh month of 1918 germany agreed to a cease fire and signed the armistice or truce that ended the war.
the final toll world war i was the bloodiest war in history up to that time.
deaths numbered about 22 million more than half of them civilians.
in addition 20 million people were wounded and 10 million more became refugees.
the direct economic costs of the war may have been about 338 billion.
the united states lost 48 000 men in battle with another 62 000 dying of disease.
more than 200 000 americans were wounded.
for the allies news of the armistice brought great relief.
private john barkley described the reaction to the news.
a personal voice john l barkley about 9 oclock in the evening we heard wild commotion in the little town.
the french people old and young were running through the streets.
old men and women wed seen sitting around their houses too feeble to move were out in the streets yelling vive la france.
vive la france.
vive iamerica.
down the street came a soldier.
he was telling everybody the armistice had been signed.
i said whats an armistice it sounded like some kind of machine to me.
the other boys around there didnt know what it meant either.
when the official word came through that it meant peace we couldnt believe it.
finally jesse said well kid i guess it really does mean the war is over i said i just cant believe its true but it was.
no hard feelings i across the atlantic americans also rejoiced at the news.
many now expected life to return to normal.
however people found their lives at home changed almost as much as the lives of those who had fought in europe.

winning the war was not a job for american soldiers alone.
as secretary of war newton baker said war is no longer samson with his shield and spear and sword and david with his sling.
it is the conflict of smokestacks now the combat of the driving wheel and the engine.
because world war i was such an immense conflict the entire economy had to be refocused on the war effort the shift from producing consumer goods to producing war supplies was too complicated and important a job for private industry to handle on its own so business and government collaborated in the effort.
in the process the power of government was greatly expanded.
congress gave president wilson direct control over much of the economy including the power to fix prices and to regulate even to nationalize certain war related industries.

the board encouraged companies to use mass production techniques to increase efficiency.
it also urged them to eliminate waste by standardizing products for instance by making only 5 colors of typewriter ribbons instead of 150.
the wib set production quotas and allocated raw materials.
under the wib industrial production in the united states increased by about 20 percent.
however the wib applied price controls only at the wholesale level.
as a result retail prices soared and in 1918 they were almost double what they had been before the war.
corporate profits soared as well especially in such industries as chemicals meatpacking oil and steel.
the wib was not the only federal agency to regulate the economy during the war.
the railroad administration controlled the railroads and the fuel administration monitored coal supplies and rationed gasoline and heating oil.
in addition many people adopted gasless sundays and lightless nights to conserve fuel.
in march 1918 the fuel administration introduced another conservation measure daylight saving time which had first been proposed by benjamin franklin in the 1770s as a way to take advantage of the longer days of summer.
war economy wages in most industries rose during the war years.
hourly wages for blue collar workers those in the metal trades shipbuilding and meatpacking for example rose by about 20 percent.
a household s income however was largely undercut by rising food prices and housing costs.
by contrast stockholders in large corporations saw enormous profits.
one industrial manufacturer the dupont company saw its stock multiply in value 1 600 percent between 1914 and 1918.
by that time the company was earning a 68 mil lion yearly profit.
as a result of the uneven pay between labor and management increasing work hours child labor and dangerously sped up conditions unions boomed.
union membership climbed from about 2 5 million in 1916 to more than 4 million in 1919.
more than 6 000 strikes broke out during the war months.
to deal with disputes between management and labor president wilson established the national war labor board in 1918.
workers who refused to obey board decisions could lose their draft exemptions.
work or fight the board told them.
however the board also worked to improve factory conditions.
it pushed for an eight hour workday promoted safety inspections and enforced the child labor ban.
food administration to help produce and conserve food wilson set up the food administration under herbert hoover.
instead of rationing food he called on people to follow the gospel of the clean plate.
he declared one day a week meatless another sweetless two days wheatless and two other days porkless.

hoover also set a high government price on wheat and other staples.
farmers responded by putting an additional 40 million acres into production.
in the process they increased their income by almost 30 percent.
selling the war once the government had extended its control over the economy it was faced with two major tasks raising money and convincing the public to support the war.
war financing the united states spent about 35 5 billion on the war effort.
the government raised about one third of this amount through taxes including a progressive income tax which taxed high incomes at a higher rate than low incomes a war profits tax and higher excise taxes on tobacco liquor and luxury goods.
it raised the rest through public borrowing by selling liberty loan and victory loan bonds.
the government sold bonds through tens of thousands of volunteers.
movie stars spoke at rallies in factories in schools and on street corners.
as treasury secretary william g mcadoo put it only a friend of germany would refuse to buy war bonds.
jg committee on public information to popularize the war the government set up the nation s first propaganda agency the committee on public information cpi.
propaganda is a kind of biased communication designed to influence people s thoughts and actions.
the head of the cpi was a former muckraking journalist named george creel.
creel persuaded the nation s artists and advertising agencies to create thousands of paintings posters cartoons and sculptures promoting the war.
he recruited some 75 000 men to serve as four minute men who spoke about everything relating to the war the draft rationing bond drives victory gardens and topics such as why we are fighting and the meaning of america.
nor did creel neglect the written word.
he ordered a printing of almost 25 million copies of how the war came to america which included wilson s war message in english and other languages.
he distributed some 75 million pamphlets booklets and leaflets many with the enthusiastic help of the boy summarizing jgj how did the government raise money for the war effort.

creel s propaganda campaign was highly effective.
however while the campaign promoted patriotism it also inflamed hatred and violations of the civil liberties of certain ethnic groups and opponents of the war.
attacks on civil liberties increase early in 1917 president wilson expressed his fears about the consequences of war hysteria.

to fight you must be brutal and ruthless and the spirit of ruthless brutality will enter into the very fiber of our national life infecting congress the courts the policeman on the beat the man in the street.
conformity would be the only virtue and every man who refused to conform would have to pay the penalty.

as soon as war was declared conformity indeed became the order of the day.
attacks on civil liberties both unofficial and official erupted.
main idea developing historical perspective what effect did the war have on the lives of recent immigrants.
anti immigrant hysteria the main targets of these attacks were americans who had emigrated from other nations especially those from germany and austria hungary.
the most bitter attacks were directed against the nearly 2 million americans who had been born in germany but other foreign born persons and americans of german descent suffered as well.
many americans with german names lost their jobs.
orchestras refused to play the music of mozart bach beethoven and brahms.
some towns with german names changed them.

espionage and sedition acts in june 1917 congress passed the espionage act and in may 1918 it passed the sedition act.
under the espionage and sedition acts a person could be fined up to 10 000 and sentenced to 20 years in jail for interfering with the war effort or for saying anything disloyal profane or abusive about the government or the war effort.
like the alien and sedition acts of 1798 these laws clearly violated the spirit of the first amendment.
their passage led to over 2 000 prosecutions for loosely defined antiwar activities of these over half resulted in convictions.
newspapers and magazines that opposed the war or criticized any of the allies lost their mailing privileges.
the house of representatives refused to seat victor berger a socialist congressman from wisconsin because of his antiwar views.

in contrast william monroe trotter founder of the boston guardian believed that victims of racism should not support a racist government.
trotter condemned du bois s accommodationist approach and favored protest instead.
nevertheless despite grievances over continued racial inequality in the united states most african americans backed the war.
main idea making inferences e how did the war open opportunities for african americans.
the great migration in concrete terms the greatest effect of the first world war on african americans lives was that it accelerated the great migration the large scale movement of hundreds of thousands of southern blacks to cities in the north.
this great population shift had already begun before the war in the late 19th century when african americans trickled northward to escape the jim crow south but after the turn of the century the trickle became a tidal wave.
several factors contributed to the tremendous increase in black migration.
first many african americans sought to escape racial discrimination in the south which made it hard to make a living and often threatened their lives.
also a boll weevil infestation aided by floods and droughts had ruined much of the south s cotton fields.
in the north there were more job opportunities.
for example henry ford opened his automobile assembly line to black workers in 1914.
the outbreak of world war i and the drop in european immigration increased job opportunities for african americans in steel mills munitions plants and stockyards.
northern manufacturers sent recruiting agents to distribute free railroad passes through the south.
in addition the publisher of the black owned newspaper chicago defender bombarded southern blacks with articles contrasting dixieland lynchings with the prosperity of african americans in the north.

why do you think the artist has not shown any individual facial features.
the first world war 393 however racial prejudice against african americans also existed in the north.
the press of new migrants to northern cities caused overcrowding and intensified racial tensions.
nevertheless between 1910 and 1930 hundreds of thousands of african americans migrated to such cities as chicago new york and philadelphia.
author richard wright described the great exodus.
a personal voice richard wright 46 we are bitter no more we are leaving.
we are leaving our homes pulling up stakes to move on.
we look up at the high southern sky and remember all the sunshine and all the rain and we feel a sense of loss but we are leaving.
we look out at the wide green fields which our eyes saw when we first came into the world and we feel full of regret but we are leaving.
we scan the kind black faces we have looked upon since we first saw the light of day and though pain is in our hearts we are leaving.
we take one last furtive look over our shoulders to the big house high upon a hill beyond the railroad tracks where the lord of the land lives and we feel glad for we are leaving.
quoted in 12 million black voices women in the war while african americans began new lives women moved into jobs that had been held exclusively by men.
they became railroad workers cooks dockworkers and bricklayers.
they mined coal and took part in shipbuilding.
at the same time women continued to fill more traditional jobs as nurses clerks and teachers.
many women worked as volunteers serving at red cross facilities and encouraging the sale of bonds and the planting of victory gardens.
other women such as jane addams were active in the peace movement.
addams helped found the women s peace party in 1915 and remained a pacifist even after the united states entered the war.
president wilson acknowledged the services of women during the supreme crisis have been of the most signal usefulness and distinction it is high time that part of our debt should be acknowledged.
while acknowledgment of that debt did not include equal pay for equal work it did help bolster public support for woman suffrage.
in 1919 congress finally passed the nineteenth amendment granting women the right to vote.
in 1920 the amendment was ratified by the states.

the first world war 395 supreme cova i schenck v united states 1919 origins of the case charles schenck an official of the u s socialist party distributed leaflets that called the draft a deed against humanity and compared conscription to slavery urging conscripts to assert your rights.
schenck was convicted of sedition and sentenced to prison but he argued that the conviction punishment and even the law itself violated his right to free speech.
the supreme court agreed to hear his appeal.
the ruling a unanimous court upheld schencks conviction stating that under wartime conditions the words in the leaflets were not protected by the right to free speech.
legal reasoning the supreme court s opinion in the schenck case written by justice oliver wendell holmes jr has become famous as a guide for how the first amendment defines the right of free speech.
holmes wrote legal sources legislation 66 the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that congress has a right to prevent.
justice holmes noted that in ordinary times the first amendment might have protected schenck but w hen a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace.
will not be endured.
the analogy that holmes used to explain why schenck could be punished for his words has become probably the best known observation ever made about free speech protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting tire in a theatre and causing a panic.
writing for the court holmes implied that during wartime schenck s leaflet was just that dangerous.

abrams v united states nov 1919 leaflets criticizing the u s expeditionary force in russia are found to be unprotected by the first amendment.
holmes writes a dissenting opinion calling for the free trade of ideas why it mattered during the course of world war i the federal government brought approximately 2 000 prosecutions for violations of the espionage act of 1917 or the sedition act of 1918 the same laws under which it convicted schenck debs and frohwerk.
by the fall of 1919 however holmes had changed his mind.
the case of abrams v united states concerned leaflets that criticized president wilson s capitalistic government for sending troops to put down the russian revolution.
justice holmes joined by justice louis brandeis dissented from the majority of the court which upheld the conviction.
in his dissent holmes emphasized the importance of a free exchange of ideas so that truth will win out in the intellectual marketplace.
his reasoning won him acclaim as a protector of free speech.
the belief that truth will eventually win out in the marketplace of ideas has become important legal justification for promoting freedom of speech.
historical impact disagreements about what kinds of speech are free under the first amendment continue.
during the 1950s when people were jailed for supporting communism and during the vietnam war when war protestors supported draft resistance these issues again reached the supreme court.
the court has also been asked to decide if young people in schools have the same first amendment rights as adults.
in tinker v des moines school district 1969 the court ordered a school to readmit students who had been suspended for wearing black arm bands in protest of the war in vietnam.
this so called symbolic speech such as wearing an armband or burning a draft card or a flag to express an opinion has sparked heated debate.
in texas v johnson 1989 the court by a narrow five to four vote invalidated a law under which a man who burned an american flag to protest reagan administration policies had been convicted.
the decision so outraged some people that members of congress considered amending the constitution to prohibit any physical desecration of the flag.
the amendment did not pass.
our freedoms of expression continue to depend upon the words in the first article of the bill of rights written more than 200 years ago.
eugene debs was arrested for antiwar speeches like the one he gave at this 1916 presidential campaign stop.

fourteen points even before the war was over wilson presented his plan for world peace.
on january 18 1918 he delivered his now famous fourteen points speech before congress.
the points were divided into three groups.
the first five points were issues that wilson believed had to be addressed to prevent another war 1.
there should be no secret treaties among nations.
freedom of the seas should be maintained for all.
tariffs and other economic barriers among nations should be lowered or abolished in order to foster free trade.
arms should be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety thus lessening the possibility of military responses during diplomatic crises.
colonial policies should consider the interests of the colonial peoples as well as the interests of the imperialist powers.
the next eight points dealt with boundary changes.
wilson based these provisions on the principle of self determination along historically established lines of nationality.
in other words groups that claimed distinct ethnic identities were to form their own nation states or decide for themselves to what nations they would belong.
the fourteenth point called for the creation of an international organization to address diplomatic crises like those that had sparked the war.
this league of nations would provide a forum for nations to discuss and settle their grievances without having to resort to war.
the allies reject wilsons plan wilson s naivete about the political aspects of securing a peace treaty showed itself in his failure to grasp the anger felt by the allied leaders.

provisions of the treaty the treaty of versailles var sf established nine new nations including poland czechoslovakia and yugoslavia and shifted the boundaries of other nations.
it carved five areas out of the ottoman empire and gave them to france and great britain as mandates or temporary colonies.
those two allies were to administer their respective mandates until the areas were ready for self rule and then independence.

the treatys weaknesses this treatment of germany weakened the abil ity of the treaty of versailles to provide a lasting peace in europe.
several basic flaws in the treaty sowed the seeds of postwar international problems that even tually would lead to the second world war.
first the treaty humiliated germany.
it contained a war guilt clause forcing germany to admit sole responsibility for starting world war i.
although german militarism had played a major role in igniting the war other european main j nations had been guilty of provoking diplomatic crises before the war.

11 400 chapter 11 in addition for three years the russians had fought on the side of the allies suffering higher casualties than any other nation.
however because russia was excluded from the peace conference it lost more territory than germany did.
the union of soviet socialist republics or soviet union as russia was officially called after 1922 became determined to regain its former territory.
finally the treaty ignored claims of colonized people for self determination as in the case of southeast asia where the vietnamese people were beginning to demand the same political rights enjoyed by people in western nations.
opposition to the treaty when wilson returned to the united states he faced strong opposition to the treaty.
some people including herbert hoover believed it was too harsh.
hoover noted the economic consequences alone will pull down all europe and thus injure the united states.
others considered the treaty a sell out to imperialism because it simply exchanged one set of colonial rulers for another.
some ethnic groups objected to the treaty because the new national boundaries it established did not satisfy their particular demands for self determination.
for example before the war many poles had been under german rule.
now many germans were under polish rule.
debate over the league of nations the main domestic opposition however centered on the issue of the league of nations.
a few opponents believed that the league threatened the u s foreign policy of isolationism.
conservative senators headed by henry cabot lodge were suspicious of the provision for joint economic and military action against aggression even though it was voluntary.
they wanted the constitutional right of congress to declare war included in the treaty.
point counterpoint the league of nations was the worlds best hope for lasting peace president wilson campaigned for the league of nations as necessary to meet the differing and unexpected contingencies that could threaten world peace.
wilson believed that the league would create a forum where nations could talk through their disagreements.
he also hoped it would provide collective security in which nations would respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the league and thereby prevent devastating warfare.
critics complained that membership in the league would limit american independence in international affairs.
however wilson argued that league membership included a moral not a legal obligation that would leave congress free to decide its own course of action.
wilson tried to assure congress as well as the general public that the league was not a straitjacket but a vehicle of life it was also a definite guaranty.

the league of nations posed a threat to u s self determination senator william borah was one of the foremost critics of the treaty of versailles because he objected to u s membership in the league of nations.
borah feared that membership in the league would draw america away from her isolation and into the internal affairs and concerns of europe and involve the united states in foreign wars.
once having surrendered and become a part of the european concerns borah wondered where my friends are you going to stop many opponents also feared that the league would nullify the monroe doctrine by limiting the right of our people to govern themselves free from all restraint legal or moral of foreign powers although wilson argued that the league of nations would have no such power of restraint borah was unconvinced.
he responded to wilsons argument by asking what will your league amount to if it does not contain powers that no one dreams of giving it the first world war 401 i history through film echoes of the great war in the 1920s and 1930s a number of hollywood horror films were influenced by memories of the great war.
the hunchback of notre dame and the phantom of the opera featured men who like many veterans were forced to live with shameful disfigurements.
other films recalled the wars bleak landscapes.
for example parts of the movie frankenstein were filmed on the same sets as all quiet on the western front the famous war film.
james whale who directed frankenstein was a veteran of the war.
like many of his generation he remained profoundly disturbed by the horrors the war had unleashed.

wilson refuses to compromise wilson unwisely ignored the republican majority in the senate when he chose the members of the american delegation.
if he had been more willing to accept a compromise on the league it would have been more likely that the senate would have approved the treaty.

despite ill health wilson set out in september 1919 on an 8 000 mile tour.
he delivered 34 speeches in about 3 weeks explaining why the united states should join the league of nations.

his once powerful voice was no more than a thick whisper.
when the treaty came up for a vote in the senate in november 1919 senator lodge introduced a number of amendments the most important of which qualified the terms under which the united states would enter the league of nations.
it was feared that u s membership in the league would force the united states to form its foreign policy in accord with the league.
although the senate rejected the amendments it also failed to ratify the treaty.
wilson refused to compromise.
i will not play for position he proclaimed.
this is not a time for tactics.
it is a time to stand square.
i can stand defeat i cannot stand retreat from conscientious duty.
the treaty again came up for a vote in march 1920.
the senate again rejected the lodge amendments and again failed to muster enough votes for ratification.
the united states finally signed a separate treaty with germany in 1921 after wilson was no longer president.

the chart on the next page lists decisions made by those who framed the treaty along with alternative decisions and predictions of possible outcomes.
i weaknesses of the treaty of versailles i first the treaty humiliated germany.
the war guilt clause which forced germany to accept i blame for the war and pay financial reparations caused germans of all political viewpoints to detest the treaty.
q second russia which had fought with the allies was excluded from the peace conference.
russia had suffered almost the same number of casualties as germany the two countries had by far the highest casualty rates of the war.
russia lost more territory than germany did.
the union of soviet i socialist republics as russia was called after 1922 grew determined to regain its lost territory.
i third the treaty ignored the claims of colonized people for self determination.
for example the allies dismissed the claims of the vietnamese who wanted freedom from french colonial rule.
identify the decisions.

the failure of prohibition was a sign of cultural conflicts most evident in the nation s cities.
lured by jobs and by the challenge and freedom that the city represented millions of people rode excitedly out of america s rural past and into its urban future.
a 1920s evangelist billy sunday rural and urban differences america changed dramatically in the years before 1920 as was revealed in the 1920 census.
according to figures that year 51 2 percent of americans lived in communities with populations of 2 500 to more than 1 million.
between 1922 and 1929 migration to the cities accelerated with nearly 2 million people leaving farms and towns each year.
cities were the place to be not to get away from said one historian.
the agricultural world that millions of americans left behind was largely unchanged from the 19th century that world was one of small towns and farms bound together by conservative moral values and close social relationships.
yet small town attitudes began to lose their hold on the american mind as the city rose to prominence.
14 chapter 13 i the new urban scene at the beginning of the 1920s new york with a population of 5 6 million people topped the list of big cities.
next came chicago with nearly 3 million and philadelphia with nearly 2 million.
another 65 cities claimed populations of 100 000 or more and they grew more crowded by the day.
life in these booming cities was far different from the slow paced intimate life in america s small towns.
chicago for instance was an industrial powerhouse home to native born whites and african americans immigrant poles irish russians italians swedes arabs french and chinese.
each day an estimated 300 000 workers 150 000 cars and buses and 20 000 trolleys filled the pulsing downtown.
at night people crowded into ornate movie theaters and vaudeville houses offering live variety shows.

16 chapter 13 in the city lonely migrants from the country often ached for home.
throughout the 1920s americans found themselves caught between rural and urban cultures a tug that pitted what seemed to be a safe small town world of close ties hard work and strict morals against a big city world of anonymous crowds moneymakers and pleasure seekers.
the prohibition experiment one vigorous clash between small town and big city americans began in earnest in january 1920 when the eighteenth amendment went into effect.
this amendment launched the era known as prohibition during which the manufacture sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages were legally prohibited.
reformers had long considered liquor a prime cause of corruption.
they thought that too much drinking led to crime wife and child abuse accidents on the job and other serious social problems.
support for prohibition came largely from the rural south and west areas with large populations of native born protestants.
the church affiliated anti saloon league had led the drive to pass the prohibition amendment.
the woman s christian temperance union which considered drinking a sin had helped push the measure through.
at first saloons closed their doors and arrests for drunkenness declined.
but in the aftermath of world war i many americans were tired of making sacrifices they wanted to enjoy life.
most immigrant groups did not consider drinking a sin but a natural part of socializing and they resented government meddling.
eventually prohibition s fate was sealed by the government which failed to budget enough money to enforce the law.
the volstead act established a prohibition bureau in the treasury department in 1919 but the agency was underfunded.
the job of enforcement involved patrolling 18 700 miles of coastline as well as inland borders tracking down illegal stills equipment for distilling liquor monitoring highways for truckloads of illegal alcohol and overseeing all the industries that legally used alcohol to be sure none was siphoned off for illegal purposes.
the task fell to approximately 1 500 poorly paid federal agents and local police clearly an impossible job.
speakeasies and bootleggers to obtain liquor illegally drinkers went underground to hidden saloons and nightclubs known as speakeasies so called because when inside one spoke quietly or easily to avoid detection.
speakeasies could be found everywhere in penthouses cellars office buildings rooming houses tenements hardware stores and tearooms.
to be admitted to a speakeasy one had to present a card or use a password.
inside one would find a mix of fashionable middle class and upper middle class men and women.
before long people grew bolder in getting around the law they learned to distill alcohol and built their own stills.
since alcohol was allowed for medicinal and religious purposes prescriptions a young woman demonstrates one of the means used to conceal alcohol hiding it in containers strapped to ones legs.
niaing it main idea developing historical perspective why do you think the eighteenth amendment failed to eliminate alcohol consumption.
main idea analyzing effects how did criminals take advantage of prohibition.
for alcohol and sales of sacramental wine intended for church services skyrocketed.
people also bought liquor from bootleggers named for a smuggler s practice of carrying liquor in the legs of boots who smuggled it in from canada cuba and the west indies.
the business of evading the law and making a mock of it has ceased to wear any aspects of crime and has become a sort of national sport wrote the journalist h l mencken.
organized crime prohibition not only generated disrespect for the law it also contributed to organized crime in nearly every major city.
chicago became notorious as the home of a1 capone a gangster whose bootlegging empire netted over 60 million a year.
capone took control of the chicago liquor business by killing off his competition.
during the 1920s headlines reported 522 bloody gang killings and made the image of flashy a1 capone part of the folklore of the period.
in 1940 the writer herbert asbury recalled the capone era in chicago.
a personal voice herbert asbury the famous seven ton armored car with the pudgy gangster lolling on silken cushions in its darkened recesses a big cigar in his fat face and a 50 000 diamond ring blazing from his left hand was one of the sights of the city the average tourist felt that his trip to chicago was a failure unless it included a view of capone out for a spin.
the mere whisper here comes al was sufficient to stop traffic and to set thousands of curious citizens craning their necks along the curbing.
gem of the prairie by the mid 1920s only 19 percent of americans supported prohibition.
the rest who wanted the amendment changed or repealed believed that prohibition caused worse effects than the initial problem.
rural protestant americans however defended a law that they felt strengthened moral values.
the eighteenth amendment remained in force until 1933 when it was repealed by the twenty first amendment.
historical spotlight al capone by age 26 al capone headed a criminal empire in chicago which he controlled through the use of bribes and violence.
from 1925 to 1931 capone bootlegged whiskey from canada operated illegal breweries in chicago and ran a network of 10 000 speakeasies.
in 1927 the big fellow as he liked to be called was worth an estimated 100 million.
the end came quickly for capone though.
in 1931 the gangster chief was arrested for tax evasion and went to jail.
that was the only crime of which the authorities were ever able to convict him.
capone was later released from jail but he died several years later at age 48.

the roaring life of the 1920s 437 science and religion clash the evangelist aimee semple mcpherson in 1922 evolution creationism and education there is still great controversy today over the teaching of evolution in the public schools.
some people believe evolution should be taught as the only theory of the origin of life.
some believe the theories of creationism or intelligent design should also be taught.
others want to focus on the debate surrounding evolution.
the issue of what should be taught about the origin of life and who should decide this issue continues to stir up debate.
some have suggested that science and religion are not necessarily incompatible.
they believe that a theory of the origin of life can accommodate both the scientific theory of evolution and religious beliefs.
another bitter controversy highlighted the growing rift between traditional and modern ideas during the 1920s.
this battle raged between fundamentalist religious groups and secular thinkers over the validity of certain scientific discoveries.
american fundamentalism the protestant christian movement grounded in a literal or nonsym bolic interpretation of the bible was known as fun damentalism.
fundamentalists were skeptical of some scientific discoveries and theories they argued that all important knowledge could be found in the bible.
they believed that the bible was inspired by god and that therefore its stories in all their details were true.
their beliefs led fundamentalists to reject the theory of evolution advanced by charles darwin in the 19th century a theory stating that plant and animal species had developed and changed over millions of years.
the claim they found most unbelievable was that humans had evolved from apes.
they pointed instead to the bible s account of creation in which god made the world and all its life forms including humans in six days.
fundamentalism expressed itself in several ways.
in the south and west preachers led religious revivals based on the authority of the scriptures.
one of the most powerful revivalists was billy sunday a baseball player turned preacher who staged emotional meetings across the south.
in los angeles aimee semple mcpherson used hollywood showmanship to preach the word to homesick midwestern migrants and devoted followers of her radio broadcasts.
in the 1920s fundamentalism gained followers who began to call for laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution.
the scopes trial in march 1925 tennessee passed the nation s first law that made it a crime to teach evolution.
immediately the american civil liberties union aclu promised to defend any teacher who would challenge the law.
john t scopes a young biology teacher in dayton tennessee accepted the challenge.
in his biology class scopes read this passage from civic biology we have now learned that animal forms may be arranged so as to begin with the simple one celled forms and culminate with a group which includes man himself.
scopes was promptly arrested and his trial was set for july.
the aclu hired clarence darrow the most famous trial lawyer of the day to defend scopes.
william jennings bryan three time democratic candidate for president and a devout fundamentalist served as a special prosecutor.
there was no real question of guilt or innocence scopes was honest about his action.
the scopes trial was a fight over evolution and the role of science and religion in public schools and in american society.
the trial opened on july 10 1925 and almost overnight became a national sensation.
darrow called bryan as an expert on the bible the contest that everyone had been waiting for.
to handle the throngs of bryan supporters judge raulston moved the court outside to a platform built maple trees.
there before a crowd of several main idea summarizing summarize the beliefs of fundamentalism.
vocabulary culminate to come to completion end under 18 chapter 13 i thousand darrow relentlessly questioned bryan about his beliefs.
bryan stood firm a smile on his face.
a personal voice clarence darrow and william jennings bryan mr darrow you claim that everything in the bible should be literally interpreted mr bryan i believe everything in the bible should be accepted as it is given there.
some of the bible is given illustratively.
for instance ye are the salt of the earth i would not insist that man was actually salt or that he had flesh of salt but it is used in the sense of salt as saving gods people quoted in bryan and darrow at dayton main idea analyzing issues what was the conflict between fundamentalists and those who accepted evolution.
darrow asked bryan if he agreed with bishop james ussher s calculation that according to the bible creation happened in 4004 b c.
had every living thing on earth appeared since that time.
did bryan know that ancient civilizations had thrived before 4004 b c.
did he know the age of the earth.
bryan grew edgy but stuck to his guns.
finally darrow asked bryan do you think the earth was made in six days.
bryan answered not six days of 24 hours.
people sitting on the lawn gasped.
with this answer bryan admitted that the bible might be interpreted in different ways.
but in spite of this admission scopes was found guilty and fined 100.
the tennessee supreme court later changed the verdict on a technicality but the law outlawing the teaching of evolution remained in effect.

f scott fitzgerald the foremost chronicler of the jazz age was the minnesota born writer f scott fitzgerald who in paris new york and later hollywood rubbed elbows with other leading american writers of the day.
in the following passage from tales of the jazz age a collection of short stories by fitzgerald the narrator describes a great city shortly after a victorious war there had been a war fought and won and the great city of the conquering people was crossed with triumphal arches and vivid with thrown flowers of white red and rose.
all through the long spring days the returning soldiers marched up the chief highway behind the strump of drums and the joyous resonant wind of the brasses while merchants and clerks left their bickerings and figurings and crowding to the windows turned their white bunched faces gravely upon the passing battalions.
never had there been such splendor in the great city for the victorious war had brought plenty in its train and the merchants had flocked thither from the south and west with their households to taste of all the luscious feasts and witness the lavish entertainments prepared and to buy for their women furs against the next winter and bags of golden mesh and varicolored slippers of silk and silver and rose satin and cloth of gold.
so gaily and noisily were the peace and prosperity impending hymned by the scribes and poets of the conquering people that more and more spenders had gathered from the provinces to drink the wine of excitement and faster and faster did the merchants dispose of their trinkets and slippers until they sent up a mighty cry for more trinkets and more slippers in order that they might give in barter what was demanded of them.
some even of them flung up their hands helplessly shouting alas.
i have no more slippers.
i have no more trinkets.
may heaven help me for i know not what i shall do.
but no one listened to their great outcry for the throngs were fat too busy day by day the foot soldiers trod jauntily the highway and all exulted because the young men returning were pure and brave sound of tooth and pink of cheek and the young women of the land were virgin and comely both of face and of figure.

some day when trees have shed their leaves and against the morning s white the shivering birds beneath the eaves have sheltered for the night well turn our faces southward love toward the summer isle where bamboos spire the shafted grove and wide mouthed orchids smile.

it later passed the volstead act to enforce the amendment.
0 prohibition as the new ban on alcohol was known became the law of the land in 1920.
due to this ban the amount of alcohol americans consumed was reduced.
however enforcing the law was difficult.
since making transporting and selling alcohol was illegal prohibition gave rise to huge smuggling operations.
large amounts of alcohol slipped into the country through seaports and across the border from canada.
consequently the restrictions also led many people simply to make their own illegal alcohol using homemade equipment.
still others drank alcohol that was intended for use in medicines or other products.
because the liquor business was illegal it became the foundation of great criminal empires and began an era of organized crime.
al capone and other gangsters were able to frighten and pay off the law enforcement agents who threatened them.
capone built a business on the alcohol trade that earned tens of millions of dollars a year.
prohibition continued throughout the 1920s but more and more people questioned whether it was succeeding.

we were tried during a time.
when there was hysteria of resentment and hate against the people of our principles against the foreigner.
i am suffering because i am a radical and indeed i am a radical i have suffered because i was an italian and indeed i am an italian.
if you could execute me two times and if i could be reborn two other times i would live again to do what i have done already.
main idea analyzing events according to vanzetti what were the reasons for his imprisonment.
quoted in the national experience in 1961 new ballistics tests showed that the pistol found on sacco was in fact the one used to murder the guard.
however there was no proof that sacco had actually pulled the trigger.
limiting immigration during the wave of nativist sentiment keep america for americans became the prevailing attitude.
anti immigrant attitudes had been growing in the united states ever since the 1880s when new immigrants began arriving from southern and eastern europe.
many of these immigrants were willing to work for low wages in industries such as coal mining steel production and textiles.
but after world war i the need for unskilled labor in the united states decreased nativists believed that because the united states now had fewer unskilled jobs available fewer immigrants should be let into the country.
nativist feelings were fueled by background on august 23 1977 exactly 50 years after the executions massachusetts governor michael dukakis declared that sacco and vanzetti had not been given a fair trial.
4 chapter 12 the fact that some of the people involved in postwar labor disputes were immigrant anarchists and socialists who many americans believed were actually communists.
racist ideas like those expressed by madison grant an anthropologist at the american museum of natural history in new york city fed people s attitudes.

the klan rises again as a result of the red scare and anti immigrant feelings different groups of bigots used anti communism as an excuse to harass any group unlike themselves.
one such group was the ku klux kian kkk.
the kkk was devoted to 100 percent americanism.
by 1924 kkk membership reached 4 5 million white male persons native born gentile citizens.
the kian also believed in keeping blacks in their place destroying saloons opposing unions and driving roman catholics jews and foreign born people out of the country.
kkk members were paid to recruit new members into their world of secret rituals and racial violence.
though the kian dominated state politics in many states by the end of the decade its criminal activity led to a decrease in power.
the quota system from 1919 to 1921 the number of immigrants had grown almost 600 percent from 141 000 to 805 000 people.
congress in response to nativist pressure decided to limit immigration from certain countries namely those in southern and eastern europe.
the emergency quota act of 1921 set up a quota system.
this system established the maximum number of people who could enter the united states from each foreign country.
the goal of the quota system was to cut sharply european immigration to the united states.
as the charts on page 622 show the system achieved that goal.
as amended in 1924 the law limited immigration from each european nation to 2 percent of the number of its nationals living in the united states in 1890 this provision discriminated against people from eastern and southern europe mostly roman catholics and jews who had not started coming to the united states in large numbers until after 1890.
later the base year was shifted to 1920 in 1927 the law reduced the total number of persons to be admitted in any one year to 150 000.
in addition the law prohibited japanese immigration causing much ill will between the two nations.
japan which had faithfully kept the gentlemen s agreement to limit immigration to the united states negotiated by theodore roosevelt in 1907 expressed anger over the insult.
in 1925 nearly 60 000 ku klux kian members marched along pennsylvania avenue in washington d c.

patterns of immigration 1921 1929 p the map and graph below show the change in immigration patterns resulting from the emergency quota act among other factors.
hundreds of thousands of people were affected.
for example while the number of immigrants from mexico rose from 30 758 in 1921 to 40 154 in 1929 the number of italian immigrants dropped drastically from 222 260 in 1921 to 18 008 in 1929.

the national origins quota system did not apply to immigrants from the western hemisphere however.
during the 1920s about a million canadians and almost 500 000 mexicans crossed the nation s borders.
a time of labor unrest another severe postwar conflict formed between labor and management.
during the war the government wouldn t allow workers to strike because nothing could interfere with the war effort.
the american federation of labor afl pledged to avoid strikes.
however 1919 saw more than 3 000 strikes during which some 4 million workers walked off the job.
employers didn t want to give raises nor did they want employees to join unions.
some employers either out of a sincere belief or because they saw a way to keep wages down attempted to show that union members were planning a revolution.
employers labeled striking workers as communists.
newspapers screamed plots to establish communism.
three strikes in particular grabbed public attention.
the boston police strike the boston police had not been given a raise since the beginning of world war i.
among their many grievances was that they had been denied the right to unionize.
when representatives asked for a raise and were fired the remaining policemen decided to strike.
massachusetts governor calvin coolidge called out the national guard.
he said there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere any time.
the strike ended but members weren t allowed to return to work new policemen were hired instead.
people praised coolidge for saving boston if not the nation from communism and anarchy.
in the 1920 election he became warren g harding s vice presidential running mate.
i i strikers included working women tailors who fought for improved working conditions.
the steel mill strike workers in the steel mills wanted the right to negotiate for shorter working hours and a living wage.
they also wanted union recognition and collective bargaining rights.
in september 1919 the u s steel corporation refused to meet with union representatives.
in response over 300 000 workers walked off their jobs.
steel companies hired strikebreakers employees who agreed to work during the strike and used force.
striking workers were beaten by police federal troops and state militias.
then the companies instituted a propaganda campaign linking the strikers to communists.
in october 1919 negotiations between labor and management produced a deadlock.
president woodrow wilson made a written plea to the combative negotiators.
a personal voice woodrow wilson at a time when the nations of the world are endeavoring to find a way of avoiding international war are we to confess that there is no method to be found for carrying on industry except the very method of war.

the steel companies agreed to an eight hour day but the steelworkers remained without a union.
j politics of the roaring twenties 417 i john llewellyn lewis 1880 1969 john l lewis was born in the little mining town of lucas iowa.
his family had traditionally been concerned with labor rights and benefits.
lewis grew up with a fierce determination to fight for what he believed companies owed their employees decent working conditions and a fair salary.
as he said years later i have pleaded your case not in the tones of a feeble mendicant beggar asking alms but in the thundering voice of the captain of a mighty host demanding the rights to which free men are entitled the coal miners strike unionism was more successful in america s coalfields.
in 1919 the united mine workers of america organized since 1890 got a new leader john l lewis.
in protest of low wages and long workdays lewis called his union s members out on strike on november 1 1919.
attorney general palmer obtained a court order sending the miners back to work.
lewis then declared it over but he quietly gave the word for it to continue.
in defiance of the court order the mines stayed closed another month.
then president wilson appointed an arbitrator or judge to put an end to the dispute.
the coal miners received a 27 percent wage increase and john l lewis became a national hero.
the miners however did not achieve a shorter workday and a five day workweek until the 1930s.
labor movement loses appeal in spite of limited gains the 1920s hurt the labor movement badly.
over the decade union membership dropped from more than 5 million to around 3 5 million.
membership declined for several reasons much of the work force consisted of immigrants willing to work in poor conditions since immigrants spoke a multitude of languages unions had difficulty organizing them farmers who had migrated to cities to find factory jobs were used to relying on themselves and most unions excluded african americans.
by 1929 about 82 000 african americans or less than 1 percent of their population held union memberships.
by contrast just over 3 percent of all whites were union members.
however african americans joined some unions like the mine workers longshoremen s and railroad porters unions.
in 1925 a philip randolph founded the brotherhood of sleeping car porters to help african americans gain a fair wage.
while america s attitude toward unions was changing so too was its faith in the presidency.

industries such as textile and steel manufacturing made very little profit.
mining and farming actually suffered losses.
farmers were deeply in debt because they had borrowed money to buy land and machinery so that they could produce more crops during world war i.
when european agriculture bounced back after the war the demand for u s crops fell as did prices.

the decade of the 1920s had brought about many technological and economic changes.
and yet the coolidge era was built on paradox the president stood for economy and a frugal way of life but he was favored by a public who had thrown all care to the wind.
life definitely seemed easier and more enjoyable for hundreds of thousands of americans.

politics of the roaring twenties 427 tracing themes economic opportunity the courage to take risks the confidence to rely on one s self the strength to stand in the face of despair and the resourcefulness to make the most of opportunity these are all qualities often considered distinctly american.
freedom requires individuals to discover or create opportunities for themselves.
however the government has also played a key role in distributing and creating economic opportunities.

homesteading even before 1763 americans looked toward the untamed west in search of greater wealth and freedom.
in the 1830s the mormons went west to escape religious as well as economic persecution.
the government helped to expand economic opportunities for whites by first clearing the land of its native inhabitants relocating them to reservations or killing them.
as the nation claimed ownership of the land it also gave it away.
the homestead act of 1862 provided free of charge 160 acres of public land to anyone 21 years of age or older or the head of a family who had inhabited the land for five years and had improved it.
this provided americans a chance to be independent and self sufficient if they would work hard.
from 1862 until 1900 between 400 000 and 600 000 families were provided homesteads.
immigration while many people have come to the u s seeking political and religious freedom economic opportunity has also been a key reason for immigration.
in 1905 for instance almost half a million people from southern and eastern europe migrated to the united states in search of economic freedom and opportunity as well as to escape religious persecution.
many found work at menial jobs for low pay but still were able to save enough money to eventually open their own businesses.
chapter 12 equality of opportunity and affirmative action in the 1960s and 1970s groups pressed for changes in the law to remove barriers to economic opportunity.
laws such as the civil rights act of 1964 were passed to prevent discrimination against women and racial and ethnic minorities in order to provide equity in educational and business opportunities.
as well affirmative action policies were designed to remedy effects of past discrimination.
the term affirmative action first used by lyndon b johnson in 1965 includes efforts to give work and educational opportunities to members of historically disadvantaged groups.
some have labeled affirmative action reverse discrimination while others view it as a means to counterbalance continued discrimination that the law has been unable to prevent.
computers and internet startups in recent years many of the brightest college students have chosen to study computer science in hopes of landing a high paying job.
alternatively independent minded computer experts might become entrepreneurs people who start and run their own businesses.
for an initial period of several months to several years an entrepreneur may work upwards of 70 or 80 hours each week yet the business will have no income.
since the late 1990s both groups have increasingly looked to the internet for opportunities.
entrepreneurs seek money making opportunities as they develop ways to expand the capabilities of this developing technology.
in turn the growth of internet based businesses creates jobs for people who have specialized computer skills.

martha gellhorn arrived in madrid in 1937 to cover the brutal civil war that had broken out in spain the year before.
hired as a special correspondent for collier s weekly she had come with very little money and no special protection.
on assignment there she met the writer ernest hemingway whom she later married.
to gellhorn a young american writer the spanish civil war was a deadly struggle between tyranny and democracy.
for the people of madrid it was also a daily struggle for survival.

main idea identifying problems why did the new democracies set up after world war i fail.
i main idea summarizing what are the characteristics of a totalitarian state.
failures of the world war i peace settlement instead of securing a just and secure peace the treaty of versailles caused anger and resentment.
germans saw nothing fair in a treaty that blamed them for starting the war.
nor did they find security in a settlement that stripped them of their overseas colonies and border territories.
these problems overwhelmed the weimar republic the democratic government set up in germany after world war i.
similarly the soviets resented the carving up of parts of russia.
see map chapter 11 p.
the peace settlement had not fulfilled president wilson s hope of a world safe for democracy.
new democratic governments that emerged in europe after the war floundered.
without a democratic tradition people turned to authoritarian leaders to solve their economic and social problems.
the new democracies collapsed and dictators were able to seize power.
some had great ambitions.
joseph stalin transforms the soviet union in russia hopes for democracy gave way to civil war resulting in the establishment of a communist state officially called the soviet union in 1922.
after v i lenin died in 1924 joseph stalin whose last name means man of steel took control of the country.
stalin focused on creating a model communist state.
in so doing he made both agricultural and industrial growth the prime economic goals of the soviet union.
stalin abolished all privately owned farms and replaced them with collectives large government owned farms each worked by hundreds of families.
stalin moved to transform the soviet union from a backward rural nation into a great industrial power.
in 1928 the soviet dictator outlined the first of several five year plans to direct the industrialization.
all economic activity was placed under state management.
by 1937 the soviet union had become the world s second largest industrial power surpassed in overall production only by the united states.
the human costs of this transformation however were enormous.
in his drive to purge or eliminate anyone who threatened his power stalin did not spare even his most faithful supporters.
while the final toll will never be known historians estimate that stalin was responsible for the deaths of 8 million to 13 million people.
millions more died in famines caused by the restructuring of soviet society.
by 1939 stalin had firmly established a totalitarian government that tried to exert complete control over its citizens.

benito mussolini the rise of fascism in italy while stalin was consolidating his power in the soviet union benito mussolini was establishing a totalitarian regime in italy where unemployment and inflation produced bitter strikes some communist led.
alarmed by these threats the middle and upper classes demanded stronger leadership.
mussolini took advantage of this situation.
a powerful speaker mussolini knew how to appeal to italy s wounded national pride.
he played on the fears of economic collapse and communism.
in this way he won the support of many discontented italians.
by 1921 mussolini had established the fascist party.
fascism fash iz em stressed nationalism and placed the interests of the state above those of individuals.
to strengthen the nation fascists argued power must rest with a single strong leader and a small group of devoted party members.
the latin fasces a bundle of rods tied around an ax handle had been a symbol of unity and authority in ancient rome.
in october 1922 mussolini marched on rome with thousands of his followers whose black uniforms gave them the name black shirts.
when important government officials the army and the police sided with the fascists the italian king appointed mussolini head of the government.
calling himself ii duce or the leader mussolini gradually extended fascist control to every aspect of italian life.
tourists marveled that ii duce had even made the trains run on time.
mussolini achieved this efficiency however by crushing all opposition and by making italy a totalitarian state.

530 chapter 16 summarizing what were the key ideas and goals that hitler presented in mein kampf.
aground according to hitler there were three garman empires the holy roman empire the german empire of w 1918 and the third reich.
the faces of totalitarianism fascist italy nazi germany communist soviet union extreme nationalism militaristic expansionism charismatic leader private property with strong government controls anticommunist extreme nationalism and racism militaristic expansionism forceful leader private property with strong government controls anticommunist create a sound communist state and wait for world revolution revolution by workers eventual rule by working class state ownership of property the nazis take over germany in germany adolf hitler had followed a path to power similar to mussolini s.
at the end of world war i hitler had been a jobless soldier drifting around germany.
in 1919 he joined a struggling group called the national socialist german workers party better known as the nazi party.
despite its name this party had no ties to socialism.
hitler proved to be such a powerful public speaker and organizer that he quickly became the party s leader.
calling himself der fuhrer the leader he promised to bring germany out of chaos.
in his book mein kampf my struggle hitler set forth the basic beliefs of nazism that became the plan of action for the nazi party.
nazism nagslz om the german brand of fascism was based on extreme nationalism.
hitler who had been born in austria dreamed of uniting all german speaking people in a great german empire.
hitler also wanted to enforce racial purification at home.
in his view germans especially blue eyed blond haired aryans formed a master race that was destined to rule the world.
inferior races such as jews slavs and all nonwhites were deemed fit only to serve the aryans.
a third element of nazism was national expansion.
hitler believed that for germany to thrive it needed more lebensraum or living space.
one of the nazis aims as hitler wrote in mein kampf was to secure for the german people the land and soil to which they are entitled on this earth even if this could be accomplished only by the might of a victorious sword.
jg the great depression helped the nazis come to power.
because of war debts and dependence on american loans and investments germany s economy was hit hard.
by 1932 some 6 million germans were unemployed.
many men who were out of work joined hitler s private army the storm troopers or brown shirts.
the german people were desperate and turned to hitler as their last hope.
by mid 1932 the nazis had become the strongest political party in germany.
in january 1933 hitler was appointed chancellor prime minister.
once in power hitler quickly dismantled germany s democratic weimar republic.
in its place he established the third reich or third german empire.
according to hitler the third reich would be a thousand year reich it would last for a thousand years.

location what countries were aggressors during this period.
movement notice the size and location of italy and of japan with respect to the country each invaded.
what similarities do you see.
militarists gain control in japan halfway around the world nationalistic military leaders were trying to take control of the imperial government of japan.
these leaders shared in common with hitler a belief in the need for more living space for a growing population.
ignoring the protests of more moderate japanese officials the militarists launched a surprise attack and seized control of the chinese province of manchuria in 1931.
within several months japanese troops controlled the entire province a large region about twice the size of texas that was rich in natural resources.
the watchful league of nations had been established after world war i to prevent just such aggressive acts.
in this greatest test of the league s power representatives were sent to manchuria to investigate the situation.
their report condemned japan who in turn simply quit the league.
meanwhile the success of the manchurian invasion put the militarists firmly in control of japan s government.
aggression in europe and africa the failure of the league of nations to take action against japan did not escape the notice of europe s dictators.
in 1933 hitler pulled germany out of the league.
in 1935 he began a military buildup in violation of the treaty of versailles.
a year later he sent troops into the rhineland a german region bordering france and belgium that was demilitarized as a result of the treaty of versailles.
the league did nothing to stop hitler.
main idea analyzing motives why did japan invade manchuria.
background military government had centuries old roots in japan.
the shogun lords of the middle ages had been military leaders.
i 532 chapter 16 main idea summarizing what foreign countries were involved in the spanish civil war.
meanwhile mussolini began building his new roman empire.
his first target was ethiopia one of africa s few remaining independent countries.
by the fall of 1935 tens of thousands of italian soldiers stood ready to advance on ethiopia.
the league of nations reacted with brave talk of collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression.
when the invasion began however the league s response was an ineffective economic boycott little more than a slap on italy s wrist.
by may 1936 ethiopia had fallen.
in desperation haile selassie the ousted ethiopian emperor appealed to the league for assistance.
nothing was done.
it is us today he told them.
it will be you tomorrow.
civil war breaks out in spain in 1936 a group of spanish army officers led by general francisco franco rebelled against the spanish republic.
revolts broke out all over spain and the spanish civil war began.
the war aroused passions not only in spain but throughout the world.
about 3 000 americans formed the abraham lincoln battalion and traveled to spain to fight against franco.
we knew we just knew recalled martha gellhorn that spain was the place to stop fascism.
among the volunteers were african americans still bitter about mussolini s invasion of ethiopia the year before.
such limited aid was not sufficient to stop the spread of fascism however.
the western democracies remained neutral.
although the soviet union sent equipment and advisers hitler and mussolini backed franco s forces with troops weapons tanks and fighter planes.
the war forged a close relationship between the german and italian dictators who signed a formal alliance known as the rome berlin axis.
after a loss of almost 500 000 lives franco s victory in 1939 established him as spain s fascist dictator.
once again a totalitarian government ruled in europe.
spotlight historical african americans stand by ethiopians when mussolini invaded ethiopia many europeans and americans especially african americans were outraged.
almost overnight african americans organized to raise money for medical supplies and a few went to fight in ethiopia.
years later the ethiopian emperor haile selassie shown above said of these efforts we can never forget the help ethiopia received from negro americans during the terrible crisis.
it moved me to know that americans of african descent did not abandon their embattled brothers but stood by us a french journalist escapes from spain to france with a child he rescued from a street battle.
fighting would soon engulf not only france but the rest of europe and parts of asia.
world war looms 5 the united states responds cautiously 1 i most americans were alarmed by the international conflicts of the mid 1930s but believed that the united states should not get involved.
in 1928 the united states had signed the kellogg briand pact.
the treaty was signed by 62 countries and declared that war would not be used as an instrument of national policy.
yet it did not include a plan to deal with countries that broke their pledge.
the pact was therefore only a small step toward peace.
americans cling to isolationism in the early 1930s a flood of books argued that the united states had been dragged into world war i by greedy bankers and arms dealers.
public outrage led to the creation of a congressional committee chaired by north dakota senator gerald nye that held hearings on these charges.
the nye committee fueled the controversy by documenting the large profits that banks and manufacturers made during the war.
as the furor grew over these merchants of death americans became more determined than ever to avoid war.
antiwar feeling was so strong that the girl scouts of america changed the color of its uniforms from khaki to green to appear less militaristic.
americans growing isolationism eventually had an impact on president roosevelt s foreign policy.
when he had first taken office in 1933 roosevelt felt comfortable reaching out to the world in several ways.
he officially recognized the soviet union in 1933 and agreed to exchange ambassadors with moscow.
he continued the policy of nonintervention in latin america begun by presidents coolidge and hoover with his good neighbor policy and withdrew armed forces stationed there.
in 1934 roosevelt pushed the reciprocal trade agreement act through congress.
this act lowered trade barriers by giving the president the power to make trade agreements with other nations and was aimed at reducing analyzing political cartoons only way we can save her during the late 1930s americans watched events in europe with growing alarm.
dictators were destroying democratic systems of government throughout europe and dragging the continent into war.

534 chapter 16 tariffs by as much as 50 percent.
in an effort to keep the united states out of future wars beginning in 1935 congress passed a series of neutrality acts.
the first two acts outlawed arms sales or loans to nations at war.
the third act was passed in response to the fighting in spain.
this act extended the ban on arms sales and loans to nations engaged in civil wars.
neutrality breaks down despite congressional efforts to legislate neutrality roosevelt found it impossible to remain neutral.
when japan launched a new attack on china in july 1937 roosevelt found a way around the neutrality acts.
because japan had not formally declared war against china the president claimed there was no need to enforce the neutrality acts.
the united states continued sending arms and supplies to china.
a few months later roosevelt spoke out strongly against isolationism in a speech delivered in chicago.
he called on peace loving nations to quarantine or isolate aggressor nations in order to stop the spread of war.
a personal voice franlkin delano roosevelt the peace the freedom and the security of 90 percent of the population of the world is being jeopardized by the remaining 10 percent who are threatening a breakdown of all international order and law.
surely the 90 percent who want to live in peace under law and in accordance with moral standards that have received almost universal acceptance through the centuries can and must find some way to preserve peace.
quarantine speech october 5 1937 at last roosevelt seemed ready to take a stand against aggression that is until isolationist newspapers exploded in protest accusing the president of leading the nation into war.
roosevelt backed off in the face of criticism but his speech did begin to shift the debate.
for the moment the conflicts remained over there.

the paris peace conference following world war i had created the relatively small nation of austria out of what was left of the austro hungarian empire.
the majority of austria s 6 million people were germans who favored unification with germany.
on march 12 1938 german troops marched into austria unopposed.
a day later germany announced that its anschluss or union with austria was complete.
the united states and the rest of the world did nothing.
bargaining for the sudetenland hitler then turned to czechoslovakia.
about 3 million german speaking people lived in the western border regions of czechoslovakia called the sudetenland.
the mountainous region formed czechoslovakia s main defense against german attack.
hitler wanted to annex czechoslovakia in order to provide more living space for germany as well as to control its important natural resources.
hitler charged that the czechs were abusing the sudeten germans and he began massing troops on the czech border.
the u s correspondent william shirer then stationed in berlin wrote in his diary the nazi press is full of hysterical headlines.
some examples women and children mowed down by czech armored cars or bloody regime new czech murders of germans.
early in the crisis both france and great britain promised to protect czechoslovakia.
then just when war seemed inevitable hitler invited french premier edouard daladier and british prime minister neville chamberlain to meet with him in munich.
when they arrived the fuhrer declared that the annexation of the sudetenland would be his last territorial demand.
in their eagerness to avoid war daladier and chamberlain chose to believe him.

chamberlain s satisfaction was not shared by winston churchill chamberlain s political rival in great britain.
in churchill s view by signing the munich agreement daladier and chamberlain had adopted a shameful policy of appeasement or giving up principles to pacify an aggressor.
as churchill bluntly put it britain and france had to choose between war and dishonor.
they chose dishonor.
they will have war.
nonetheless the house of commons approved chamberlain s policy toward germany and churchill responded with a warning.

after all an attack on poland might bring germany into conflict with the soviet union poland s eastern neighbor.
at the same time such an attack would most likely provoke a declaration of war from france and britain both of whom had promised military aid to poland.
the result would be a two front war.
fighting on two fronts had exhausted germany in world war i.
surely many thought hitler would not be foolish enough to repeat that mistake.
as tensions rose over poland stalin surprised everyone by signing a nonaggression pact with hitler.
once bitter enemies on august 23 1939 fascist germany and communist russia now committed never to attack each other.
germany and the soviet union also signed a second secret pact agreeing to divide poland between them.

to accomplish this the nazis condemned to slavery and death not only the jews but other groups that they viewed as inferior or unworthy or as enemies of the state.
after taking power in 1933 the nazis had concentrated on silencing their political opponents communists socialists liberals and anyone else who spoke out against the government.
once the nazis had eliminated these enemies they turned against other groups in germany.

families were often separated sometimes like the weissmanns forever.
nazi concentration camps were originally set up to imprison political opponents and protesters.
the camps were later turned over to the ss who expanded the concentration camp and used it to warehouse other undesirables.
life in the camps was a cycle of hunger humiliation and work that almost always ended in death.
the prisoners were crammed into crude wooden barracks that held up to a thousand people each.
they shared their crowded quarters as well as their meager meals with hordes of rats and fleas.
hunger was so intense recalled one survivor that if a bit of soup spilled over prisoners would converge on the spot dig their spoons into the mud and stuff the mess into their mouths.
inmates in the camps worked from dawn to dusk seven days a week until they collapsed.
those too weak to work were killed.
some like rudolf reder endured.
he was one of only two jews to survive the camp at belzec poland.
a personal voice rudolf reder the brute schmidt was our guard he beat and kicked us if he thought we were not working fast enough.

thirty or 40 of us were shot every day.
a doctor usually prepared a daily list of the weakest men.

to mass slaughter and starvation they would add a third method of killing murder by poison gas.
mass exterminations as deadly as overwork starvation beatings and bullets were they did not kill fast enough to satisfy the nazis.
the germans built six death camps in poland.
the first chelmno began operating in 1941 before the meeting at wannsee.
each camp had several huge gas chambers in which as many as 12 000 people could be killed a day.
when prisoners arrived at auschwitz the largest of the death camps they had to parade by several ss doctors.
with a wave of the hand the doctors separated those strong enough to work from those who would die that day.
both groups were told to leave all their belongings behind with a promise that they would be returned later.
those destined to die were then led into a room outside the gas chamber and were told to undress for a shower.
to complete the deception the prisoners were even sasr prisoners were required to wear color coded triangles on their uniforms.

this orderly mass extermination was sometimes carried out to the accompaniment of cheerful music played by an orchestra of camp inmates who had temporarily been spared execution.
at first the bodies were buried in huge pits.
at belzec rudolf reder was part of a 500 man death brigade that labored all day he said either at grave digging or emptying the gas chambers.

quoted in never again at some camps to try to cover up the evidence of their slaughter the nazis installed huge crematoriums or ovens in which to burn the dead.
at other camps the bodies were simply thrown into a pit and set on fire.
gassing was not the only method of extermination used in the camps.
prisoners were also shot hanged or injected with poison.
still others died as a result of horrible medical experiments carried out by camp doctors.
some of these victims were injected with deadly germs in order to study the effect of disease on different groups of people.
many more were used to test methods of sterilization a subject of great interest to some nazi doctors in their search for ways to improve the master race.

two days after hitler invaded poland president roosevelt spoke reassuringly to americans about the outbreak of war in europe.
a personal voice franklin delano roosevelt this nation will remain a neutral nation but i cannot ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well.
even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind or his conscience.
i have said not once but many times that i have seen war and i hate war.
as long as it is my power to prevent there will be no blackout of peace in the u s radio speech september 3 1939 although roosevelt knew that americans were still deeply committed to staying out of war he also believed that there could be no peace in a world controlled by dictators.
franklin d roosevelt the united states musters its forces as german tanks thundered across poland roosevelt revised the neutrality act of 1935.
at the same time he began to prepare the nation for the struggle he feared lay just ahead.
moving cautiously away from neutrality in september of 1939 roosevelt persuaded congress to pass a cash and carry provision that allowed warring nations to buy u s arms as long as they paid cash and transported them in their own ships.
providing the arms roosevelt argued would help france and britain defeat hitler and keep the united states out of the war.
isolationists attacked roosevelt for his actions.
however after six weeks of heated debate congress passed the neutrality act of 1939 and a cash and carry policy went into effect 550 chapter 16 analyzing political cartoons j carving it up the three axis nations germany italy and japan were a threat to the entire world.
they believed they were superior and more powerful than other nations especially democracies.

what do you think the artist means by showing hitler doing the carving.
mi analyzing effects 4 what impact did the outbreak fwar in europe hav on u s foreign and defense policy.
the axis threat the united states cash and carry policy began to look like too little too late.
by summer 1940 france had fallen and britain was under siege.
roosevelt scrambled to provide the british with all aid short of war.
by june he had sent britain 500 000 rifles and 80 000 machine guns and in early september the united states traded 50 old destroyers for leases on british military bases in the caribbean and newfoundland.
british prime minister winston churchill would later recall this move with affection as a decidedly unneutral act.
on september 27 americans were jolted by the news that germany italy and japan had signed a mutual defense treaty the tripartite pact.
the three nations became known as the axis powers.
the tripartite pact was aimed at keeping the united states out of the war.
under the treaty each axis nation agreed to defend the others in case of attack.
if the united states were to declare war on any one of the axis powers it would face its worst military nightmare a two ocean war with fighting in both the atlantic and the pacific.
building u s defenses meanwhile roosevelt asked congress to increase spending for national defense.
in spite of years of isolationism nazi victories in 1940 changed u s thinking and congress boosted defense spending.
congress also passed the nation s first peacetime military draft the selective training and service act.
under this law 16 million men between the ages of 21 and 35 were registered.
of these 1 million were to be drafted for one year but were only allowed to serve in the western hemisphere.
roosevelt himself drew the first draft numbers as he told a national radio audience this is a most solemn ceremony.

roosevelt runs for a third term in 1940 roosevelt decided to break the tradition of a two term presidency begun by george washington and run for reelection.
to the great disappointment of isolationists roosevelt s republican opponent wendell willkie supported roosevelt s policy of aiding britain.
at the same time both candidates vowed to keep the nation out of war.
with so little difference between them the majority of voters chose the candidate they knew best.
roosevelt was reelected with nearly 55 percent of the votes.
world war looms the great arsenal of democracy not long after the election president roosevelt told his radio audience during a fireside chat that it would be impossible to negotiate a peace with hitler.
no man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it.
he warned that if britain fell the axis powers would be left unchallenged to conquer the world at which point he said all of us in all the americas would be living at the point of a gun.
to pre vent such a situation the united states had to help defeat the axis threat by turn ing itself into what roosevelt called the great arsenal of democracy.
the lend lease plan by late 1940 however britain had no more cash to spend in the arsenal of democracy.
roosevelt tried to help by suggesting a new vocabulary plan that he called a lend lease policy.
under this plan the president would lend lease to grant use or lease arms and other supplies to any country whose defense was vital to the or occupation of j under the terms of united states.
a contract roosevelt compared his plan to lending a garden hose to a neighbor whose house was on fire.
he asserted that this was the only sensible thing to do to prevent the fire from spreading to your own property.
isolationists argued bit terly against the plan but most americans favored it and congress passed the lend lease act in march 1941.
p o counterpoint the united states should not become involved in european wars still recovering from world war i and struggling with the great depression many americans believed their country should remain strictly neutral in the war in europe.
representative james f oconnor voiced the countrys reservations when he asked dare we set america up and commit her as the financial and military blood bank of the rest of the world oconnor maintained that the united states could not right every wrong or police the world the aviator charles lindbergh stated his hope that the future of america not be tied to these eternal wars in europe lindbergh asserted that americans should fight anybody and everybody who attempts to interfere with our hemisphere however he went on to say our safety does not lie in fighting european wars.
it lies in our own internal strength in the character of the american people and american institutions like many isolationists lindbergh believed that democracy would not be saved by the forceful imposition of our ideals abroad but by example of their successful operation at home.

the united states must protect democracies throughout the world as the conflict in europe deepened interventionists embraced president franklin d roosevelts declaration that when peace has been broken anywhere peace of all countries everywhere is in danger roosevelt emphasized the global character of 20th century commerce and communication by noting every word that comes through the air every ship that sails the sea every battle that is fought does affect the american future roosevelt and other political leaders also appealed to the nations conscience.
secretary of state cordell hull noted that the world was face to face.
with an organized ruthless and implacable movement of steadily expanding conquest in the same vein undersecretary of state sumner welles called hitler a sinister and pitiless conqueror who has reduced more than half of europe to abject serfdom after the war expanded into the atlantic roosevelt declared it is time for all americans to stop being deluded by the romantic notion that the americas can go on living happily and peacefully in a nazi dominated world he added let us not ask ourselves whether the americas should begin to defend themselves after the first attack.
or the twentieth attack.
the time for active defense is now i 552 chapter 16 n main idea drawing conclusions g why did roosevelt take one unneutral step after another to assist britain and the soviet union in 1941.
supporting stalin britain was not the only nation to receive lend lease aid.
in june 1941 hitler broke the agreement he had made in 1939 with stalin not to go to war and invaded the soviet union.
acting on the principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend roosevelt began sending lend lease supplies to the soviet union.
some americans opposed providing aid to stalin roosevelt however agreed with winston churchill who had said if hitler invaded hell the british would be prepared to work with the devil himself.
german wolf packs providing lend lease aid was one thing but to ensure the safe delivery of goods to britain and to the soviet union supply lines had to be kept open across the atlantic ocean.
to prevent delivery of lend lease shipments hitler deployed hundreds of german submarines u boats to attack supply ships.
from the spring through the fall of 1941 individual surface attacks by individual u boats gave way to what became known as the wolf pack attack.
at night groups of up to 40 submarines patrolled areas in the north atlantic where convoys could be expected.
wolf packs were successful in sinking as much as 350 000 tons of shipments in a single month.
in june 1941 president roosevelt granted the navy permission for u s warships to attack german u boats in self defense.
by late 1943 the submarine menace was contained by electronic detection techniques especially radar and by airborne antisubmarine patrols operating from small escort aircraft carriers.
science k technology german wolf packs on october 17 1940 near rockall west of ireland a british convoy sc 7 shown below was attacked by a german wolf pack.
the convoy was outlined clearly against a moonlit sky making the merchant ships easy prey.
at the start of the war the british had too few warships to escort the convoys.
alatof ftart n am aai a tanker burns and sinks in the atlantic ocean after being torpedoed by a german u boat.
german aircraft could patrol 1 000 miles out to sea to scout for convoys.
the germans used radios to summon u boats into a fighting wolf pack.
convoys pinned their hopes on finding u boats using asdic sonar apparatus that could detect submerged submarines.
u boats used hydrophonic equipment to pick up the sound of convoy propellers up to 100 miles away.
worw war looms hideki tojo 1884 1948 u s newspapers described hideki tojo as smart hard boiled resourceful and contemptuous of theories sentiments and negotiations the nazi press in germany praised tojo as a man charged with energy thinking clearly and with a single purpose to a british paper tojo was the son of satan whose single purpose was unleashing all hell on the far east.
in japan however tojo was looked up to as a man whose decisive leadership was a signal for the nation to rise and administer a great shock to the anti axis powers fdr plans for war although roosevelt was popular his foreign policy was under constant attack.
american forces were seriously underarmed.
roosevelt s august 1941 proposal to extend the term of draftees passed in the house of representatives by only one vote.
with the army provided for roosevelt began planning for the war he was certain would come.
the atlantic charter while congress voted on the extension of the draft roosevelt and churchill met secretly at a summit aboard the battleship uss augusta.
although churchill hoped for a military commitment he settled for a joint declaration of war aims called the atlantic charter.
both countries pledged the following collective security disarmament self determination economic cooperation and freedom of the seas.
roosevelt disclosed to churchill that he couldn t ask congress for a declaration of war against germany but he would wage war and do everything to force an incident.
the atlantic charter became the basis of a new document called a declaration of the united nations.
the term united nations was suggested by roosevelt to express the common purpose of the allies those nations that had fought the axis powers.
the declaration was signed by 26 nations four fifths of the human race observed churchill.
shoot on sight after a german submarine fired on the u s destroyer greer in the atlantic on september 4 1941 roosevelt ordered navy commanders to respond.
when you see a rattlesnake poised to strike the president explained you crush him.
roosevelt ordered the navy to shoot the german submarines on sight.
two weeks later the pink star an american merchant ship was sunk off greenland.
in mid october a u boat torpedoed the u s destroyer kearny and 11 lives were lost.
days later german u boats sank the u s destroyer reuben fames killing more than 100 sailors.
america has been attacked roosevelt announced grimly.
the shooting has started.
and history has recorded who fired the first shot.
as the death toll mounted the senate finally repealed the ban against arming merchant ships.
a formal declaration of a full scale war seemed inevitable.
japan attacks the united states the united states was now involved in an undeclared naval war with hitler.
however the attack that brought the united states into the war came from japan.
japan s ambitions in the pacific germany s european victories created new opportunities for japanese expansionists.
japan was already in control of manchuria in july 1937 hideki tojo he d ke to jo chief of staff of japan s kwantung army launched the invasion into china.
as french dutch and british colonies lay unprotected in asia japanese leaders leaped at the opportunity to unite east asia under japanese control by seizing the colonial lands.
by 1941 the british were too busy fighting hitler to block japanese expansion.
only the u s and its pacific islands remained in japan s way.

main idea analyzing causes why did the united states enter into an undeclared shooting war with germany in fall 1941.
554 chapter 16 main idea i analyzing issues e how was oil a source of conflict between japan and the united states.
the japanese began their southward push in july 1941 by taking over french military bases in indochina now vietnam cambodia and laos.
the united states protested this new act of aggression by cutting off trade with japan.
the embargoed goods included one japan could not live without oil to fuel its war machine.
japanese military leaders warned that without oil japan could be defeated without its enemies ever striking a blow.
the leaders declared that japan must either persuade the united states to end its oil embargo or seize the oil fields in the dutch east indies.
this would mean war.
peace talks are questioned shortly after becoming the prime minister of japan hideki tojo met with emperor hirohito.
tojo promised the emperor that the japanese government would attempt to preserve peace with the americans.
but on november 5 1941 tojo ordered the japanese navy to prepare for an attack on the united states.
the u s military had broken japan s secret communication codes and learned that japan was preparing for a strike.
what it didn t know was where the attack would come.
late in november roosevelt sent out a war warning to military commanders in hawaii guam and the philippines.
if war could not be avoided the warning said the united states desires that japan commit the first overt act.
and the nation waited.
the peace talks went on for a month.
then on december 6 1941 roosevelt received a decoded message that instruct ed japan s peace envoy to reject all american peace proposals.
this means war roosevelt declared.
the attack on pearl harbor early the next morning a japanese dive bomber swooped low over pearl harbor the largest u s naval base in the pacific.

the surprise raid had sunk or damaged 21 ships including 8 battleships nearly the whole u s pacific fleet.
more than 300 aircraft were severely damaged or destroyed.
these losses constituted greater damage than the u s navy had suffered in all of world war i.
by chance three aircraft carriers at sea escaped the disaster.
their survival would prove crucial to the war s outcome.

i never wanted to have to fight this war on two fronts roosevelt told his wife.
we haven t the navy to fight in both the atlantic and the pacific so we will have to build up the navy and the air force and that will mean that we will have to take a good many defeats before we can have a victory the next day president roosevelt addressed congress.

the united states was at peace with that nation and at the solicitation of japan was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the pacific q it will be recorded that the distance of hawaii from japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago japan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the pacific area.

americans join the war effort the japanese had attacked pearl harbor with the expectation that once americans had experienced japan s power they would tremble with fear and shrink from further conflict.
but if americans were trembling it was with rage not fear.
american patriotism drove citizens to incredible acts of bravery and sacrifice on the battlefields of europe and the pacific as well as at home.

i was seventeen.
even the 5 million who volunteered for military service however were not enough to face the challenge of an all out war on two global fronts europe and the pacific.
the selective service system expanded the draft and eventually provided another 10 million soldiers to meet the armed forces needs.
the volunteers and draftees reported to military bases around the country for eight weeks of basic training.
in this short period seasoned sergeants did their best to turn raw recruits into disciplined battle ready gis.
army chief of staff general george marshall the leader of the armed forces mobilization effort ensured that american soldiers were well equipped and properly trained.
marshall also played an important role in developing the nation s military strategy.
expanding the military the military s work force needs were so great that marshall pushed for the formation of a women s auxiliary army corps waac.
there are innumerable duties now being performed by soldiers that can be done better by women marshall said in support of a bill to establish the women s auxiliary army corps.
under this bill women volunteers would serve in noncombat positions.
despite opposition from some members of congress who scorned the bill as the silliest piece of legislation they had ever seen the bill establishing the waac became law on may 15 1942.
the law gave the waacs an official status and salary but few of the benefits granted to male soldiers.
in july 1943 after thousands of women had enlisted the u s army dropped the auxiliary status and granted wacs full u s army benefits.
wacs worked as nurses ambulance drivers radio operators electricians and pilots nearly every duty not involving direct combat.
recruiting and discrimination for many minority groups especially african americans native americans mexican americans and asian americans the war created new dilemmas.
restricted to racially segregated neighborhoods and reservations and denied basic citizenship rights some members of these groups ques tioned whether this was their war to fight.
why die for democracy for some foreign country when we don t even have it here.

on receiving his draft notice an african american responded unhappily just carve on my tombstone here lies a black man killed fighting a yellow man for the protection of a white man the united states in world war ii 5l dramatic contributions despite discrimination in the military more than 300 000 mexican americans joined the armed forces.
while mexican americans in los angeles made up only a tenth of the city s population they suffered a fifth of the city s wartime casualties.
about one million african americans also served in the military.
african american soldiers lived and worked in segregated units and were limited mostly to noncombat roles.
after much protest african americans did finally see combat beginning in april 1943.
asian americans took part in the struggle as well.
more than 13 000 chinese americans or about one of every five adult males joined the armed forces.
in addition 33 000 japanese americans put on uniforms.
of these several thousand volunteered to serve as spies and interpreters in the pacific war.
during battles wrote an admiring officer they crawled up close enough to be able to hear japanese officers commands and to make verbal translations to our soldiers.
some 25 000 native americans enlisted in the armed services too including 800 women.
their willingness to serve led the saturday evening post to comment we would not need the selective service if all volunteered like indians.
a production miracle early in february 1942 american newspapers reported the end of automobile production for private use.
the last car to roll off an automaker s assembly line was a gray sedan with victory trim that is without chrome plated parts.
this was just one more sign that the war would affect almost every aspect of life.
rapid mobilization president roosevelt recognized the importance of quickly mobilizing domestic industry.
the federal government spent tens of billions of dollars on weapons and supplies following the outbreak of war.
roosevelt set the ambitious goal of building 60 000 new planes in 1942 and 125 000 more the next year.
he asked for 120 000 new tanks in the same period.
he also created a series of agencies to regulate what factories produced what prices they charged and how the nation s raw materials would be used.
roosevelt also established the national war labor board to resolve disputes between labor and management in the best interest of the war effort.
the industrial response within weeks of the shutdown in production the nation s automobile plants had been retooled to produce tanks planes boats and main idea contrasting a how did the american response to the japanese raid on pearl harbor differ from japanese expectations.

a maker of mechanical pencils turned out bomb parts.
a bedspread manufacturer made mosquito netting.
a soft drink company converted from filling bottles with liquid to filling shells with explosives.
meanwhile shipyards and defense plants expanded with dizzying speed.
by the end of 1942 industrialist henry j kaiser had built seven massive new shipyards that turned out liberty ships cargo carriers tankers troop transports and baby aircraft carriers at an astonishing rate.
late that year kaiser invited reporters to way one in his richmond california shipyard to watch as his workers assembled hull 440 a liberty ship in a record breaking four days.

how could such a ship be built so fast.
kaiser used prefabricated or factory made parts that could be quickly assembled at his shipyards.
equally important were his workers who worked at record speeds.
labors contribution when the war began defense contractors warned the selective service system that the nation did not have enough workers to meet both its military and its industrial needs.
they were wrong.
by 1944 despite the draft nearly 18 million workers were laboring in war industries three times as many as in 1941.
more than 6 million of these new workers were women.
at first war industries feared that most women lacked the necessary stamina for factory work and were reluctant to hire them.
but once women proved they could operate welding torches or riveting guns as well as men employers could not hire enough of them especially since women earned only about 60 percent as much as men doing the same jobs.
defense plants also hired more than 2 million minority workers during the war years.
like women minorities faced strong prejudice at first.
before the war 75 percent of defense contractors simply refused to hire african americans while another 15 percent employe them only in menial jobs.
negroes will be considered only as janitors declared the general manager of north american aviation.
it is the company policy not to employ them as mechanics and aircraft workers.
g during the war women took many jobs previously held by men.
in this 1943 photo a young woman is seen operating a hand drill in nashville tennessee.
the united states in world war ii 5i to protest such discrimination both in the military and in industry a philip randolph president and founder of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters and the nation s most respected african american labor leader organized a march on washington.
randolph called on african americans everywhere to come to the capital on july 1 1941 and to march under the banner we loyal colored americans demand the right to work and fight for our country.
fearing that the march might provoke white resentment or violence president roosevelt called randolph to the white house and asked him to back down.
i m sorry mr president the labor leader said the march cannot be called off.
roosevelt then asked how many people do you plan to bring.
randolph replied one hundred thousand mr.
roosevelt was stunned.
even half that number of african american protesters would be far more than washington still a very segregated city could feed house and transport.
in the end it was roosevelt not randolph who backed down.
in a philip randolph return for randolph s promise to cancel the march the president issued an execu in 1942 tive order calling on employers and labor unions to provide for the full and equi table participation of all workers in defense industries without discrimination because of race creed color or national origin.
history through filing hollywood helps mobilization in the aftermath of pearl harbor hollywood churned out war oriented propaganda films.
heroic movies like mission to moscow and song of russia glorified americas new wartime ally the soviet union.
on the other hand hiss and boo films stirred up hatred against the nazis.
in this way movies energized people to join the war effort.
as the war dragged on people grew tired of propaganda and war themes.
hollywood responded with musicals romances and other escapist fare designed to take filmgoers away from the grim realities of war if only for an hour or two.
hitler beast of berlin produced in 1939 was one of the most popular hiss and boo films.
viewing audiences watched in rage as the nazis conducted one horrible act after another.
moviemakers also turned out informational films.
the most important of these films the why we fight series were made by the great director frank capra.

566 chapter 17 main idea summarizing j why did president roosevelt create the osrd and what did it do.
main idea identifying problems what basic problems were the opa and wpb boated to solve.
of scientists that same year in 1941 roosevelt created the office of scientific research and development osrd to bring scientists into the war e ort.
e osrd spurred improvements in radar and sonar new technologies or ocating submarines underwater.
it encouraged the use of pesticides like ddt to ig t insects.
as a result u s soldiers were probably the first in history to be relatively free from body lice.
the osrd also pushed the development of miracle drugs such as penicillin that saved countless lives on and off the battlefield.
the most significant achievement of the osrd however was the secret development of a new weapon the atomic bomb.
interest in such a weapon began in 1939 after german scientists succeeded in splitting uranium atoms releasing an enormous amount of energy.
this news prompted physicist and german refugee albert einstein to write a letter to president roosevelt warning that the germans could use their discovery to construct a weapon of enormous destructive power.
roosevelt responded by creating an advisory committee on uranium to study the new discovery.
in 1941 the committee reported that it would take from three to five years to build an atomic bomb.
hoping to shorten that time the osrd set up an intensive program in 1942 to develop a bomb as quickly as possible.
because much of the early research was performed at columbia university in manhattan the manhattan project became the code name for research work that extended across the country.
1 the federal government takes control as war production increased there were fewer consumer products available for purchase.
much factory production was earmarked for the war.
with demand increasing and supplies dropping prices seemed likely to shoot upwards.
economic controls roosevelt responded to this threat by creating the office of price administration opa.
the opa fought inflation by freezing prices on most goods.
congress also raised income tax rates and extended the tax to millions of people who had never paid it before.
the higher taxes reduced consumer demand on scarce goods by leaving workers with less to spend.
in addition the government encouraged americans to use their extra cash to buy war bonds.
as a result of these measures inflation remained below 30 percent about half that of world war i for the entire period of world war ii.
besides controlling inflation the government needed to ensure that the armed forces and war industries received the resources they needed to win the war.
the war production board wpb assumed that responsibility.
the wpb decided which companies would convert from peacetime to wartime production and allocated raw materials to key industries.
the wpb also organized drives to collect scrap iron tin cans paper rags and cooking fat for recycling into war goods.
across america children scoured attics cellars garages vacant lots and back alleys looking for useful junk.
during one five month long paper drive in chicago schoolchildren collected 36 million pounds of old paper about 65 pounds per child.
dy winning american support american leaders were well aware that public support was vital to the success of the war effort.
in june 1942 the government created the office of war information owi.
this agency was responsible for spreading propaganda to influence the thoughts feelings and actions of the pub lie in favor of the war effort.
the owi produced dozens of posters and films during the war.
many of these evoked a positive vision of the united states and encouraged americans to help the war effort.
for example they encouraged men to join the armed forces and women to take jobs in war industries.
the owi also issued stark warnings to the public about the dangers they faced.
another technique was to show the harmful outcomes of improper actions such as sharing sensitive military information.
the united states in world war ii 567 patriotism inspires sacrifice at home world war ii made demands of every american.
life in the home changed significantly as citizens did their part to help the cause of victory in europe and the pacific.
conserving food and other goods meeting the food needs of the military took top priority in the united states.
one way to grow more food was to plant victory gardens.
americans armed with a few simple tools some seed and fertilizer and a patriotic spirit farmed small plots of land to overcome food shortages.
in small towns and large cities any spare piece of land was likely to be used to grow food.
many victory gardens were small and humble but the combined efforts of millions of americans produced big results.
in 1943 the nation s 20 million victory gardens yielded an astounding 8 million tons of produce.
however victory gardens alone could not fulfill all of the nation s food needs.
some foods could not be grown in home gardens and there were shortages of other products as well.
as a result the opa set up a system for rationing or establishing fixed allotments of goods deemed essential for the military.
under this system households received ration books with coupons to be used for buying such scarce goods as meat shoes sugar coffee and gasoline.
most americans willingly accepted rationing as a personal contribution to the war effort.
inevitably some cheated by hoarding scarce goods or by purchasing them through the black market where rationed items could be bought illegally at inflated prices without coupons.
however the penalties for breaking the rules could be severe.
investing in victory as you previously read another way that americans supported the war effort was by buying war bonds.
the money invested by ordinary citizens helped pay for the vast quantities of ships aircraft and other weaponry being produced in american factories.
by war s end 85 million americans had purchased war bonds raising over 185 billion.
patriotic americans also invested their time volunteering for organizations such as the red cross and the victory corps.
they made bandages knitted socks and collected books to be sent to the troops abroad.
celebrities also volunteered to promote the sale of war bonds and other wartime endeavors.
while people tightened their belts and gave where they could at home millions of other americans put their lives on the line in battles on the other side of the world.

for an acting class his final exam was to be a performance of a death scene.
mcgrath knew his lines perfectly.
but as he began the final farewell he broke out in a sweat and bolted off the stage.
suddenly he had a flashback to a frozen meadow in belgium during the battle of the bulge in 1945.
three german tanks were spraying his platoon with machine gun fire.

he calls out to me.

the united states and britain join forces now that we are as you say in the same boat british prime minister winston churchill wired president roosevelt two days after the pearl harbor attack would it not be wise for us to have another conference and the sooner the better.
roosevelt responded with an invitation for churchill to come at once.
so began a remarkable alliance between the two nations.

war plans prime minister churchill arrived at the white house on december 22 1941 and spent the next three weeks working out war plans with president roosevelt and his advisors.
believing that germany and italy posed a greater threat than japan churchill convinced roosevelt to strike first against hitler.
once the allies had gained an upper hand in europe they could pour more resources into the pacific war.
by the end of their meeting roosevelt and churchill had formed in churchilps words a very strong affection which grew with our years of comradeship.
when churchill reached london he found a message from the president waiting for him.
it is fun roosevelt wrote in the message to be in the same decade with you.
the battle of the atlantic after the attack on pearl harbor hitler ordered submarine raids against ships along america s east coast.
the german aim in the battle of the atlantic was to prevent food and war materials from reaching great britain and the soviet union.
britain depended on supplies from the sea.
the 3 000 mile long shipping lanes from north america were her lifeline.
hitler knew that if he cut that lifeline britain would be starved into submission.
for a long time it looked as though hitler might succeed in his mission.
unprotected american ships proved to be easy targets for the germans.
in the first four months of 1942 the germans sank 87 ships off the atlantic shore.
seven months into the year german wolf packs had destroyed a total of 681 allied ships in the atlantic.
something had to be done or the war at sea would be lost.
the allies responded by organizing their cargo ships into convoys.
convoys were groups of ships traveling together for mutual protection as they had done in the first world war.
the convoys were escorted across the atlantic by destroyers equipped with sonar for detecting submarines underwater.
they were also accompanied by airplanes that used radar to spot u boats on the ocean s surface.
with this improved tracking the allies were able to find and destroy german u boats faster than the germans could build them.
in late spring of 1943 admiral karl doenitz the commander of the german u boat offensive reported that his losses had reached an unbearable height.
at the same time the united states launched a crash shipbuilding program by early 1943 140 liberty ships were produced each month.
launchings of allied ships began to outnumber sinkings.
by mid 1943 the tide of the battle of the atlantic had turned.
a happy churchill reported to the house of commons that june was the best month at sea from every point of view we have ever known in the whole 46 months of the war.
analyzing causes why had the tide turned in the battle of the atlantic by 570 chapter 17 main idea synthesizing what two key decisions determined the final outcome at stalingrad.
eastern front and the mediterranean by the winter of 1943 the allies began to see victories on land as well as sea.
the first great turning point came in the battle of stalingrad.
the battle of stalingrad the germans had been fighting in the soviet union since june 1941.
in november 1941 the bitter cold had stopped them in their tracks outside the soviet cities of moscow and leningrad.
when spring came the german tanks were ready to roll.
in the summer of 1942 the germans took the offensive in the southern soviet union.
hitler hoped to capture soviet oil fields in the caucasus mountains.
he also wanted to wipe out stalingrad a major industrial center on the volga river.
see map page 572.
the german army confidently approached stalingrad in august 1942.
to reach the volga and take stalingrad is not so difficult for us one german soldier wrote home.
victory is not far away.
the luftwaffe the german air force prepared the way with nightly bombing raids over the city.
nearly every wooden building in stalingrad was set ablaze.
the situation looked so desperate that soviet officers in stalingrad recommended blowing up the city s factories and abandoning the city.
a furious stalin ordered them to defend his namesake city no matter what the cost.
for weeks the germans pressed in on stalingrad conquering it house by house in brutal hand to hand combat.
by the end of september they controlled nine tenths of the city or what was left of it.
then another winter set in.
the soviets saw the cold as an opportunity to roll fresh tanks across the frozen landscape and begin a massive counterattack.
the soviet army closed around stalingrad trapping the germans in and around the city and cutting off their supplies.
the germans situation was hopeless but hitler s orders came stay and fight.
i won t go back from the volga.
the fighting continued as winter turned stalingrad into a frozen wasteland.
we just lay in our holes and froze knowing that 24 hours later and 48 hours later we should be shivering precisely as we were now wrote a german soldier benno zieser.
but there was now no hope whatsoever of relief and that was the worst thing of all.
the german commander surrendered on january 31 1943.
two days later his starving troops also surrendered.
in defending stalingrad the soviets lost a total of 1 100 000 soldiers more than all american deaths during the entire war.
despite the staggering death toll the soviet victory marked a turning point in the war.
from that point on the soviet army began to move westward toward germany.
history video battle of stalingrad 7 dazed starved and freezing these german soldiers were taken prisoner after months of struggle.
but they were the lucky ones.
more than 230 000 of their comrades died in the battle of stalingrad.
v american journalist ernie pyle shown here in 1944 was one of the most famous war correspondents of world war ii.
the north african front while the battle of stalingrad raged stalin pressured britain and america to open a second front in western europe.
he argued that an invasion across the english channel would force hitler to divert troops from the soviet front.
churchill and roosevelt didn t think the allies had enough troops to attempt an invasion on european soil.
instead they launched operation torch an invasion of axis controlled north africa commanded by american general dwight d eisenhower.
in november 1942 some 107 000 allied troops the great majority of them americans landed in casablanca oran and algiers in north africa.
from there they sped eastward chasing the afrika korps led by general erwin rommel the legendary desert fox.
after months of heavy fighting the last of the afrika korps surrendered in may 1943.
british general harold alexander sent a message to churchill reporting that all enemy resistance has ceased.
we are masters of the north african shores.
american war correspondent ernie pyle caught the mood of the victorious troops.
a personal voice ernie pyle 66 this colossal german surrender has done more for american morale here than anything that could possibly have happened.
winning in battle is like winning at poker or catching lots of fish.
as a result the hundreds of thousands of americans in north africa now are happy men ernie s war the best of ernie pyle s world war ii dispatches main idea summarizing what was the outcome of the north african campaign.
main idea analyzing effects what were the results of the italian campaign.
the italian campaign even before the battle in north africa was won roosevelt churchill and their commanders met in casablanca.
at this meeting the two leaders agreed to accept only the unconditional surrender of the axis powers.
that is enemy nations would have to accept whatever terms of peace the allies dictated.
the two leaders also discussed where to strike next.
the americans argued that the best approach to victory was to assemble a massive invasion fleet in britain and to launch it across the english channel through france and into the heart of germany.
churchill however thought it would be safer to first attack italy.
the italian campaign got off to a good start with the capture of sicily in the summer of 1943.
stunned by their army s collapse in sicily the italian government forced dictator benito mussolini to resign.
on july 25 1943 king victor emmanuel iii summoned ii duce italian for the leader to his palace stripped him of power and had him arrested.
at this moment the king told mussolini you are the most hated man in italy.
italians began celebrating the end of the war.
their cheers were premature.
hitler was determined to stop the allies in italy rather than fight on german soil.
one of the hardest battles the allies encountered in europe was fought less than 40 miles from rome.
this battle bloody anzio lasted four months until the end of may 1944 and left about 25 000 allied and 30 000 axis casualties.
during the year after anzio german armies continued to put up strong resistance.
the effort to free italy did not succeed until 1945 when germany itself was close to collapse.
heroes in combat among the brave men who fought in italy were pilots of the all black 99th pursuit squadron the tuskegee airmen.
in sicily the squadron registered its first victory against an enemy aircraft and went on to more impressive strategic strikes against the german forces throughout italy.
the tuskegee airmen won two distinguished unit citations the military s highest commendation for their outstanding aerial combat against the german luftwaffe.
another african american unit to distinguish itself was the famous 92nd infantry division nicknamed the buffaloes.
in just six months of fighting in europe the buffaloes won 7 legion of merit awards 65 silver stars and 162 bronze stars for courage under fire.
like african americans most mexican americans served in segregated units.
seventeen mexican american soldiers were awarded the congressional medal of honor.
an all chicano unit company e of the 141st regiment 36th division became one of the most decorated of the war.
japanese americans also served in italy and north africa.
at the urging of general delos emmons the army created the 100th battalion which consisted of 1 300 hawaiian niser the word nisei refers to american citizens whose parents had emigrated from japan.
the 100th saw brutal eombatand became known as the purple hear.
later he 100th was merged into the all nisei 442nd regiments combat team.
it became the most decorated unit in y on may 31 1943 the 99th pursuit squadron the first group of african american pilots trained at the tuskegee institute arrived in north africa.

after v e day a grateful marshall wrote to ike saying you have been selfless in your actions always sound and tolerant in your judgments and altogether admirable in the courage and wisdom of your military decisions.
you have made history great history for the good of mankind in 1953 dwight d eisenhower became president of the united states.
the allies liberate europe even as the allies were battling for italy in 1943 they had begun work on a dramatic plan to invade the normandy region of northern france and free western europe from the nazis.
general dwight d eisenhower commanded operation overlord as the plan was called.
he selected general omar bradley to lead the american forces participating in the mission.
from this point on bradley commanded all u s ground troops invading europe from the west.
d day under eisenhower s direction in england the allies gathered a force of nearly 3 million british american and canadian troops and mountains of military equipment and supplies.
to keep their plans secret the allies set up a huge phantom army with its own headquarters and equipment.
in radio messages they knew the germans could read allied commanders sent orders to this make believe army to attack the french port of calais 150 miles away where the english channel is narrowest.
as a result hitler maintained a large army at calais.
the allied invasion was originally set for june 5 but bad weather forced a delay.
banking on a forecast for clearing skies eisenhower gave the go ahead for d day june 6 1944 the first day of the invasion.
shortly after midnight three divisions parachuted down behind german lines.

u historical spotlight audie murphy near the end of the second world war audie murphy became famous as the most decorated american soldier of the war.
he received 24 medals from the united states including the congressional medal of honor.
he was also awarded three medals by france and one more by belgium.
born in kingston texas murphy enlisted in the army in 1942.
he served in north africa and europe and in 1944 he rose to the rank of second lieutenant.
his most impressive act of bravery occurred in january 1945 near colmar france when in the midst of a furious german attack he jumped onto a burning tank destroyer and killed about 50 axis troops with his machine gun.
although wounded in the leg he rallied his troops to retake the ground the germans had gained earlier in the day.

hitler responded with a desperate last gasp offensive.
he ordered his troops to break through the allied lines and to recapture the belgian port of antwerp.
this bold move the fuhrer hoped would disrupt the enemy s supply lines and demoralize the allies.
on december 16 under cover of dense fog eight german tank divisions broke through weak american defenses along an 80 mile front.
hitler hoped that a victory would split american and british forces and break up allied supply lines.
tanks drove 60 miles into allied territory creating a bulge in the lines that gave this desperate last ditch offensive its name the battle of the bulge.

the japanese defense the japanese threw their entire fleet into the battle of leyte gulf.
they also tested a new tactic the kamikaze ka mtka ze or suicide plane attack in which japanese pilots crashed their bomb laden planes into allied ships.
kamikaze means divine wind and refers to a legendary typhoon that saved japan in 1281 by destroying a mongol invasion.
in the philippines 424 kamikaze pilots embarked on suicide missions sinking 16 ships and damaging another 80.
americans watched these terrifying attacks with a strange mixture of respect and pity according to vice admiral charles brown.
you have to admire the devotion to country demonstrated by those pilots recalled seaman george marse.
yet when they were shot down rescued and brought aboard our ship we were surprised to find the pilots looked like ordinary scared young men not the wide eyed fanatical devils we imagined them to be.
despite the damage done by the kamikazes the battle of leyte gulf was a disaster for japan.
in three days of battle it lost 3 battleships 4 aircraft carriers 13 cruisers and almost 500 planes.

four days later they had captured mount suribachi the islands highest point but the battle for iwo jima would rage on for four more weeks.

582 chapter 17 j main idea drawing conclusions why was okinawa a significant island in the war in the pacific.
iwo jima after retaking much of the philippines and liberating the american prisoners of war there the allies turned to iwo jima an island that writer william manchester later described as an ugly smelly glob of cold lava squatting in a surly ocean.
iwo jima which means sulfur island in japanese was critical to the united states as a base from which heavily loaded bombers might reach japan.
it was also perhaps the most heavily defended spot on earth with 20 700 japanese troops entrenched in tunnels and caves.
more than 6 000 marines died taking this desolate island the greatest number in any battle in the pacific to that point.
only 200 japanese survived.
just one obstacle now stood between the allies and a final assault on japan the island of okinawa.
the battle for okinawa in april 1945 u s marines invaded okinawa.
the japanese unleashed more than 1 900 kamikaze attacks on the allies during the okinawa campaign sinking 30 ships damaging more than 300 more and killing almost 5 000 seamen.
once ashore the allies faced even fiercer opposition than on iwo jima.
by the time the fighting ended on june 21 1945 more than 7 600 americans had died.
but the japanese paid an even ghastlier price 110 000 lives in defending okinawa.
this total included two generals who chose ritual suicide over the shame of surrender.
a witness to this ceremony described their end a simultaneous shout and a flash of the sword.
and both generals had nobly accomplished their last duty to their emperor the battle for okinawa was a chilling foretaste of what the allies imagined the invasion of japan s home islands would be.
churchill predicted the cost would be a million american lives and half that number of british lives.
c the atomic bomb ends the war the taking of iwo jima and okinawa opened the way for an invasion of japan.
however allied leaders knew that such an invasion would become a desperate struggle.
japan still had a huge army that would defend every inch of homeland.
president truman saw only one way to avoid an invasion of japan.
he decided to use a powerful new weapon that had been developed by scientists working on the manhattan project the atomic bomb.
the manhattan project led by general leslie groves with research directed by jewish american scientist j robert oppenheimer the development of the atomic bomb was not only the most ambitious scientific enterprise in history it was also the best kept secret of the war.
at its peak more than 600 000 americans were involved in the project although few knew its ultimate purpose.
even truman did not learn about it until he became president.
the first test of the new bomb took place on the morning of july 16 1945 in an empty expanse of desert near alamogordo new mexico.
a blinding flash which was visible 180 miles away was followed by a deafening roar as a tremendous shock wave rolled across the trembling desert.
otto frisch a scientist on the project described the huge mushroom cloud that rose over the desert as a red hot elephant standing balanced on its trunk.
the bomb worked.
douglas macarthur 1880 1964 douglas macarthur was too arrogant and prickly to be considered a regular guy by his troops.
but he was arguably the most brilliant allied strategist of world war ii.
for every american soldier killed in his campaigns the japanese lost ten.
he was considered a real hero of the war both by the military and by the prisoners on the philippines whom he freed.
macarthur took more territory with less loss of life observed journalist john gunther than any military commander since darius the great king of persia 522 486 b c.
the united states in world war ii 58 president truman now faced a difficult decision.
should the allies use the bomb to bring an end to the war.
truman did not hesitate.
on july 25 1945 he ordered the military to make final plans for dropping two atomic bombs on japanese targets.
a day later the united states warned japan that it faced prompt and utter destruction unless it surrendered at once.
japan refused.
truman later wrote the final decision of where and when to use the atomic bomb was up to me.
let there be no mistake about it.
i regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubt that it should be used.
hiroshima and nagasaki on august 6 a b 29 bomber named enola gay released an atomic bomb codenamed little boy over hiroshima an important japanese military center.
forty three seconds later almost every building in the city collapsed into dust from the force of the blast.
hiroshima had ceased to exist.
still japan s leaders hesitated to surrender.
three days later a second bomb code named fat man was dropped on nagasaki leveling half the city.
by the end of the year an estimated 200 000 people had died as a result of injuries and radiation poisoning caused by the atomic blasts.

then he ordered them to draw up papers to end the war.
on september 2 formal surrender ceremonies took place on the u s battleship missouri in tokyo bay.
today the guns are silent said general macarthur in a speech marking this historic moment.
the skies no longer rain death the seas bear only commerce men everywhere walk upright in the sunlight.
the entire world is quietly at peace.
counterpoint the only way to end the war against japan was to bomb the japanese mainland many advisors to president truman including secretary of war henry stimson had this point of view.
they felt the bomb would end the war and save american lives.
stimson said the face of war is the face of death some scientists working on the bomb agreed even more so as the casualty figures from iwo jima and okinawa sank in.
are we to go on shedding american blood when we have available a means to a steady victory.
they petitioned.
if we can save even a handful of american lives then let us use this weapon now.
two other concerns pushed americans to use the bomb.
some people feared that if the bomb were not dropped the project might be viewed as a gigantic waste of money.
the second consideration involved the soviet union.
tension and distrust were already developing between the western allies and the soviets.
some american officials believed that a successful use of the atomic bomb would give the united states a powerful advantage over the soviets in shaping the postwar world.
thinking critically connect to history summarizing what were the main arguments for and against dropping the atomic bomb on japan.
connect to today evaluating decisions do you think the united states was justified in using the bomb against the japanese.
in a paragraph explain why or why not.
japans staggering losses were enough to force japans surrender many of the scientists who had worked on the bomb as well as military leaders and civilian policymakers had doubts about using it.
dr leo szilard a jewish hungarian born physicist who had helped president roosevelt launch the project and who had a major role in developing the bomb was a key figure opposing its use.
a petition drawn up by szilard and signed by 70 other scientists argued that it would be immoral to drop an atomic bomb on japan without fair warning.
many supported staging a demonstration of the bomb for japanese leaders perhaps by exploding one on a deserted island near japan to convince the japanese to surrender.
supreme allied commander general dwight d eisenhower agreed.
he maintained that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary to save american lives and that japan was already defeated.
ike told secretary of war henry stimson i was against it the bomb on two counts.
first the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing.
second i hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.
rebuilding begins t why was rsevelt anxious tomake concessions to stalin concerning ttlefate of pstwar germany.
with japan s surrender the allies turned to the challenge of rebuilding war torn nations.
even before the last guns fell silent they began thinking about principles that would govern the postwar world.
the yalta conference in february 1945 as the allies pushed toward victory in europe an ailing roosevelt had met with churchill and stalin at the black sea resort city of yalta in the soviet union.
stalin graciously welcomed the president and the prime minister and the big three as they were called toasted the defeat of germany that now seemed certain.
for eight grueling days the three leaders discussed the fate of germany and the postwar world.
stalin his country devastated by german forces favored a harsh approach he wanted to keep germany divided into occupation zones areas controlled by allied military forces so that germany would never again threaten ix jk history video the atomic bomb he soviet union.
when churchill strongly disagreed roosevelt acted as a mediator.
he was irepared to make concessions to stalin for two reasons.
first he hoped that the bviet union would stand by its commitments to join the war against japan that vas still waging in the pacific.
the first test of the atom bomb was still five nonths away.
second roosevelt wanted stalin s support for a new world peace eeping organization to be named the united nations.
the united states in world war ii 585 the historic meeting at yalta produced a series of compromises.
to pacify stalin roosevelt convinced churchill to agree to a temporary division of germany into four zones one each for the americans the british the soviets and the french.
churchill and roosevelt assumed that in time all the zones would be brought together in a reunited germany.
for his part stalin promised tree and unfettered elections in poland and other soviet occupied eastern european countries.
stalin also agreed to join in the war against japan.
that struggle was expected to continue for another year or more.
in addition he agreed to participate in an international conference to take place in april in san francisco.
there roosevelt s dream of a united nations un would become a reality.
the nuremberg war trials besides geographic division germany had another price to pay for its part in the war.
the discovery of hitler s death camps led the allies to put 24 surviving nazi leaders on trial for crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and war crimes.
the trials were held in the southern german town of nuremberg.
at the nuremberg trials the defendants included hitler s most trusted party officials government ministers military leaders and powerful industrialists.
as the trial began u s supreme court justice robert jackson explained the significance of the event.
a personal voice justice robert jackson the wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated so malignant and so devastating that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their being repeated.
it is hard now to perceive in these miserable men.
the power by which as nazi leaders they once dominated much of the world and terrified most of it.
merely as individuals their fate is of little consequence to the world.
what makes this inquest significant is that these prisoners represent sinister influences that will lurk in the world long after their bodies have returned to dust.
they are living symbols of racial hatreds of terrorism and violence and of the arrogance and cruelty of power.
civilization can afford no compromise with the social forces which would gain renewed strength if we deal ambiguously or indecisively with the men in whom those forces now precariously survive.
quoted in opening address to the nuremberg war crimes trial main idea summarizing what decisions did roosevelt churchill and stalin make at the yalta conference.
war criminals on trial 1945 1949 each defendant at the nuremberg trials was accused of one or more of the following crimes crimes against the peace planning and waging an aggressive war war crimes acts against the customs of warfare such as the killing of hostages and prisoners the plundering of private property and the destruction of towns and cities crimes against humanity the murder extermination deportation or enslavement of civilians 586 chapter 17 1 was only following orders 99 defendants at the nuremberg trials in the end 12 of the 24 defendants were sentenced to death and most of the remaining were sent to prison.
in later trials of lesser leaders nearly 200 more nazis were found guilty of war crimes.
still many people have argued that the trials did not go far enough in seeking out and punishing war criminals.
many nazis who took part in the holocaust did indeed go free.
yet no matter how imperfect the trials might have been they did establish an important principle the idea that individuals are responsible for their own actions even in times of war.
nazi executioners could not escape punishment by claiming that they were merely following orders.
the principle of individual responsibility was now firmly entrenched in international law.
the occupation of japan japan was occupied by u s forces under the command of general douglas macarthur.
in the early years of the occupation more than 1 100 japanese from former prime minister hideki tojo to lowly prison guards were arrested and put on trial.
seven including tojo were sentenced to death.
in the philippines in china and in other asian battlegrounds additional japanese officials were tried for atrocities against civilians or prisoners of war.
during the seven year american occupation macarthur reshaped japan s economy by introducing free market practices that led to a remarkable economic recovery.
macarthur also worked to transform japan s government.
he called for a new constitution that would provide for woman suffrage and guarantee basic freedoms.
in the united states americans followed these changes with interest.
the new york times reported that general macarthur.
has swept away an autocratic regime by a warrior god and installed in its place a democratic government presided over by a very human emperor and based on the will of the people as expressed in free elections.
the japanese apparently agreed.
to this day their constitution is known as the macarthur constitution.

but these technological developments have also had far reaching applications in peacetime.
because the innovations were originally intended for the battlefield they were developed quickly and with a narrow purpose.
however their applications during peacetime have led to life enhancing benefits that will extend far into the 21st century.

the writer and poet maya angelou was a teenager living in san francisco when the united states got involved in world war ii.
the first change she noticed was the disappearance of the city s japanese population.
the second change was an influx of workers including many african americans from the south.
san franciscans she noted maintained that there was no racism in their city by the bay.
but angelou knew differently.
a personal voice maya angelou 66 a story went the rounds about a san ranciscan white matron who refused to sit beside a negro civilian on the streetcar even after he made room for her on the seat.
her explanation was that she would not sit beside a draft dodger who was a negro as well.
she added that the least he could do was fight for his country the way her son was fighting on iwo jima.
the story said that the man pulled his body away from the window to show an armless sleeve.
he said quietly and with great dignity then ask your son to look around for my arm which i left over there 99 i know why the caged bird sings twice a patriot ex private obie bartlett lost left arm marl hmm released dec i94i now at work welding in a west coast shipyard at the end of the war returning veterans even those who weren t disabled had like many to begin dealing with the very real issues of reentry and adjustment to a society minority veterans that offered many opportunities but still had many unsolved problems.
obfe ba tlett was twice a patriot and was still opportunity and adjustment second class citizen.
in contrast to the great depression world war ii was a time of opportunity for millions of americans.
jobs abounded and despite rationing and shortages people had money to spend.
at the end of world war ii the nation emerged as the world s dominant economic and military power.
590 chapter 17 economic gains the war years were good ones for working people.
as defense industries boomed unemployment fell to a low of 1 2 percent in 1944.
even with price and wage controls average weekly pay adjusted for inflation rose 10 percent during the war.
and although workers still protested long hours overtime and night shifts they were able to save money for the future.
some workers invested up to half their paychecks in war bonds.
farmers also prospered during the war.
unlike the depression years when farmers had battled dust storms and floods the early 1940s had good weather for growing crops.
farmers benefited from improvements in farm machinery and fertilizers and reaped the profits from rising crop prices.
as a result crop production increased by 50 percent and farm income tripled.
before the war ended many farmers could pay off their mortgages.
women also enjoyed employment gains during the war although many lost their jobs when the war ended.
over 6 million women had entered the work force for the first time boosting the percentage of women in the total work force to 35 percent.
a third of those jobs were in defense plants which offered women more challenging work and better pay than jobs traditionally associated with women such as as waitressing clerking and domestic service.
with men away at war many women also took advantage of openings in journalism and other professions.
the war really created opportunities for women said winona espinosa a wife and mother who became a riveter and bus driver during the war.
it was the first time we got a chance to show that we could do a lot of things that only men had done before.
vocabulary migration the act of moving from one country or region to another 1 man idea analyzing causes a how did world war ii cause the u s population to shift.
the war gave women the chance to prove they could be just as productive as men.
but their pay usually did not reflect their productivity.
population shifts in addition to revamping the economy the war triggered one of the greatest mass migrations in american history.
americans whose families had lived for decades in one place suddenly uprooted themselves to seek work elsewhere.
more than a million newcomers poured into california between 1941 and 1944.
towns with defense industries saw their populations double and even triple sometimes almost overnight.
as shown in the map to the right african americans left the south for cities in the north in record numbers.

the united states in world war ii attending pennsylvania state college under the gl bill of rights william oskay jr paid 28 a month for the trailer home in which you see him working.
social adjustments families adjusted to the changes brought on by war as best they could.
with millions of fathers in the armed forces mothers struggled to rear their children alone.
many young children got used to being left with neighbors or relatives or in child care centers as more and more mothers went to work.
teenagers left at home without parents sometimes drifted into juvenile delinquency.
and when fathers finally did come home there was often a painful period of readjustment as family members got to know one another again.
the war helped create new families too.
longtime sweethearts as well as couples who barely knew each other rushed to marry before the soldier or sailor was shipped overseas.
in booming towns like seattle the number of marriage licenses issued went up by as much as 300 percent early in the war.
a new yorker observed in 1943 on fridays and saturdays the city hall area is blurred with running soldiers sailors and girls hunting the license bureau floral shops ministers blood testing laboratories and the legal aid society.
in 1944 to help ease the transition of returning servicemen to civilian life congress passed the servicemen s readjustment act better known as the gi bill of rights.
this bill provided education and training for veterans paid for by the federal government.
just over half the returning soldiers or about 7 8 million veterans attended colleges and technical schools under the gi bill.
the act also provided federal loan guarantees to veterans buying homes or farms or starting new businesses.
main idea analyzing effects how did the war affect families and personal lives.
discrimination and reaction despite the opportunities that opened up for women and minorities during the war old prejudices and policies persisted both in the military and at home.
civil rights protests african americans made some progress on the home front.
during the war thousands of african americans left the south.
the majority moved to the midwest where better jobs could be found.
between 1940 and 1944 the percentage of african americans working in skilled or semiskilled jobs rose from 16 to 30 percent.
592 chapter 17 main idea analyzing causes gj what caused the race riots in the 1940s.
mexican americans also experienced prejudice dur violent summer of 1943 los angeles exploded wherever african americans moved however discrimination presented tough hurdles.
in 1942 civil rights leader james farmer founded an interracial organization called the congress of racial equality core to confront urban segregation in the north.
that same year core staged its first sit in at a segregated chicago restaurant.
as african american migrants moved into already overcrowded cities tensions rose.
in 1943 a tidal wave of racial violence swept across the country.
the worst conflict erupted in detroit on a hot sunday afternoon in june.
what started as a tussle between blacks and whites at a beach on the detroit river mushroomed into a riot when white sailors stationed nearby joined the fray.
the fighting raged for three days fueled by false rumors that whites had murdered a black woman and her child and that black rioters had killed 17 whites.
by the time president roosevelt sent federal troops to restore order 9 whites and 25 blacks lay dead or dying.
the violence of 1943 revealed to many americans black and white alike just how serious racial tensions had become in the united states.
by 1945 more than 400 committees had been established by american communities to improve race relations.
progress was slow but african americans were determined not to give up the gains they had made.
cj tension in los angeles ing the war years.
in the in anti mexican zoot suit riots.
the zoot suit was a style of dress adopted by mexican american youths as a symbol of their rebellion against tradition.
it consisted of a long jacket and pleated pants.
broad brimmed hats were often worn with the 09 h 1 suits.
the riots began when 11 sailors in los angeles reported that they had been attacked by zoot suit wear ing mexican americans.
this charge triggered violence involving thousands of servicemen and civilians.
mobs poured into mexican neighborhoods and grabbed any zoot suiters they could find.
the attackers ripped off their victims clothes and beat them senseless.
the riots lasted almost a week and resulted in the beating of hundreds of mexican american youth and other minorities.
despite such unhappy experiences with racism many mexican americans believed that their sacrifices during wartime would lead to a better future.
a personal voice manuel de la raza this war.
is doing what we in our mexican american movement had planned to do in one generation.
it has shown those across the tracks that we all share the same problems.
it has shown them what the mexican american wiii do what responsibility he will take and what leadership qualities he will demonstrate.
after this struggle the status of the mexican americans will be different.

arkansas rohwer jerome on march 3 1942 a japanese american mother carries her sleeping daughter during their relocation to an internment camp.
internment of japanese americans after pearl harbor government officials began to fear that people of german italian and japanese descent would help the enemy.
italians and germans who had immigrated to the united states but not yet completed the citizenship process were considered enemy aliens.
many were forced to register and carry identification cards.
in addition the government restricted certain areas which enemy aliens were not allowed to enter or remain in.
such restrictions placed a huge burden on those living or working in these areas.
thousands of germans and italians were placed in prison camps.
but the worst treatment was reserved for japanese americans.
this sense of fear and uncertainty following pearl harbor caused a wave of prejudice against japanese americans.
early in 1942 the war department called for the mass evacuation of all japanese americans from hawaii.
general delos emmons the military governor of hawaii resisted the order because 37 percent of the people in hawaii were japanese americans.
to remove them would have destroyed the islands economy and hindered u s military operations there.
however he was eventually forced to order the internment or confinement of 1 444 japanese americans 1 percent of hawaii s japanese american population.
on the west coast however panic and prejudice ruled the day.
in california only 1 percent of the people were japanese but they constituted a minority large enough to stimulate the prejudice of many whites without being large enough to effectively resist internment.
newspapers whipped up anti japanese sentiment by running ugly stories attacking japanese americans.
on february 19 1942 president roosevelt signed executive order 9066 requiring the removal of people of japanese ancestry from california and parts of washington oregon and arizona.
based on military recommendations he justified this step as necessary for national security.
in the following weeks the army rounded up some 110 000 japanese americans and shipped them to ten hastily constructed remote relocation centers euphemisms for prison camps.
594 chapter 17 main idea analyzing motives why did president roosevelt order the internment of japanese americans.
about two thirds were nisei or japanese people born in this country of parents who emigrated from japan.
thousands of nisei had already joined the armed forces and to ted nakashima an architectural draftsman from seattle the evacuation seemed utterly senseless.
a personal voice ted nakashima there are electricians plumbers draftsmen mechanics carpenters painters farmers every trade men who are able and willing to do all they can to lick the axis.
were on this side and we want to help.
why wont america let us.
from new republic magazine june 15 1942 no specific charges were ever filed against japanese americans and no evidence of subversion was ever found.
faced with expulsion terrified families were forced to sell their homes businesses and all their belongings for less than their true value.
japanese americans fought for justice both in the courts and in congress.
the initial results were discouraging.
in 1944 the supreme court decided in korematsu v united states that the government s policy of evacuating japanese americans to camps was justified on the basis of military necessity.
see pages 596 597.
after the war however the japanese american citizens league 0acl pushed the government to compensate those sent to the camps for their lost property.
in 1965 congress authorized the spending of 38 million for that purpose less than a tenth of japanese americans actual losses.
the j acl did not give up its quest for justice.
in 1978 it called for the payment of reparations or restitution to each individual that suffered internment.
a decade later congress passed and president ronald reagan signed a bill that promised 20 000 to every japanese american sent to a relocation camp.
when the checks were sent in 1990 a letter from president george bush accompanied them in which he stated we can never fully right the wrongs of the past.
but we can take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to japanese americans during world war ii.

analyzing effects what effect did world war ii have on american families.
think about the role of women in families and the economy the relationship between the races the impact of the federal government on society the united states in world war ii 595 korematsu v united states 1944 origins of the case following the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 u s military officials argued that japanese americans posed a threat to the nation s security.
based on recommendations from the military president franklin roosevelt issued executive order 9066 which gave military officials the power to limit the civil rights of japanese americans.
military authorities began by setting a curfew for japanese americans.
later they forced japanese americans from their homes and moved them into detention camps.
fred korematsu was convicted of defying the military order to leave his home.
at the urging of the american civil liberties union aclu korematsu appealed that conviction.
the ruling the court upheld korematsus conviction and argued that military necessity made internment constitutional.
legal reasoning executive order 9066 was clearly aimed at one group of people japanese americans.
korematsu argued that this order was unconstitutional because it was based on race.
writing for the court majority justice hugo black agreed that all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect.
however in this case he said the restrictions were based on a military imperative and not group punishment based on antagonism to those of japanese origin.
as such justice black stated that the restrictions were constitutional.
compulsory exclusion of large groups.
except under circumstances of direct emergency and peril is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions.
but when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger.
99 justice frank murphy however dissented he opposed the majority.
he believed that military necessity was merely an excuse that could not conceal the racism at the heart of the restrictions.
this exclusion ought not to be approved.
such exclusion goes over the very brink of constitutional power and falls into the ugly abyss of racism 99 two other justices also dissented but korematsu s conviction stood.
legal sources legislation u s constitution fifth amendment 1791 no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law executive order 9066 1942 i hereby authorize and direct the secretary of war to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he may determine from which any or all persons may be excluded related cases hirabayashi v united states june 1943 the court upheld the conviction of a japanese american man for breaking curfew.
the court argued that the curfew was within congressional and presidential authority.
ex parte endo december 1944 the court ruled that a japanese american girl whose loyalty had been clearly established could not be held in an internment camp.
596 chapter 17 why it mattered about 110 000 japanese americans were forced into internment camps as shown above during world war ii.
many had to sell their businesses and homes at great loss.
thousands were forced to give up their possessions.
in the internment camps japanese americans lived in a prison like setting under constant guard.
the court ruled that these government actions did not violate people s rights because the restrictions were based on military necessity rather than on race.
but the government treated german americans and italian americans much differently.
in those instances the government identified potentially disloyal people but did not harass the people it believed to be loyal.
by contrast the government refused to make distinctions between loyal and potentially disloyal japanese americans.
historical impact in the end the internment of japanese americans became a national embarrassment.
in 1976 president gerald r ford repealed executive order 9066.
a president clinton presents fred korematsu with a presidential medal of freedom during a ceremony at the white house on january 15 1998.
similarly the court s decision in korematsu became an embarrassing example of court sanctioned racism often compared to the decisions on dred scott 1857 and plessy v ferguson 1896.
in the early 1980s a scholar conducting research obtained copies of government documents related to the hirabayashi and korematsu cases.
the documents showed that the army had lied to the court in the 1940s.
japanese americans had not posed any security threat.
korematsu s conviction was overturned in 1984.
hirabayashi s conviction was overturned in 1986.
in 1988 congress passed a law ordering reparations payments to surviving japanese americans who had been detained in the camps.

following the description is a summary that condenses and also clarifies key information.
sacrifice and struggle at home i world war ii made demands of every american.
allied soldiers sailors and pilots risked life and i limb so that others could enjoy freedom the women children and men who remained in the united i states also played a key role in ensuring success overseas.
millions of americans contributed to the war effort by taking jobs in factories or offices.
in addition men women and children did their part at home to help the united states win the war.
meeting the food needs of the military took top priority in the united states.
the planting of victory gardens was one way in which americans filled these needs.
victory gardens planted at home i allowed more commercially produced food to be sent from farms to troops overseas.
victory gardens i alone did not solve all the nation s food needs.
some foods could not be produced in home gardens and there was simply not enough of certain products to go around.
as a result the united states began rationing food shortly after the nation entered the war.
during the war the government rationed products such as coffee butter sugar and meat.
each member of the family received a ration book which entitled that person to a certain amount of certain foods.
i the shortage of materials such as metal glass rubber and gasoline during the war also changed life for americans.
gasoline was rationed.
americans helped meet the demand for other materials by holding scrap drives in which citizens collected waste materials of all sorts that might be i used in the war efforts.
empty tin cans bits of rubber and glass anything that could be useful was salvaged.
even women s silk and nylon stockings were recycled to make parachutes.

8 chapter 15 franklin d roosevelt key players main idea summarizing what plans did roosevelt make in the four months while he waited to take office.
electing franklin delano roosevelt although the republicans renominated president hoover as their candidate they recognized he had little chance of winning.
too many americans blamed hoover for doing too little about the depression and wanted a new president.
the democrats pinned their hopes on franklin delano roosevelt known popularly as fdr the two term governor of new york and a distant cousin of former president theodore roosevelt.
as governor fdr had proved to be an effective reform minded leader working to combat the problems of unemployment and poverty.
unlike hoover roosevelt possessed a can do attitude and projected an air of friendliness and confidence that attracted voters.
indeed roosevelt won an overwhelming victory capturing nearly 23 million votes to hoover s nearly 16 million.
in the senate democrats claimed a nearly two thirds majority.
in the house they won almost three fourths of the seats their greatest victory since before the civil war.
waiting for roosevelt to take over four months would elapse between roosevelt s victory in the november election and his inauguration as president in march 1933.
the 20th amendment which moved presidential inaugurations to january was not ratified until february 1933 and did not apply to the 1932 election.
fdr was not idle during this waiting period however.
he worked with his team of carefully picked advisers a select group of professors lawyers and journalists that came to be known as the brain trust.
roosevelt began to formulate a set of policies for his new administration.
this program designed to alleviate the problems of the great depression became known as the new deal a phrase taken from a campaign speech in which roosevelt had promised a new deal for the american people.
new deal policies focused on three general goals relief for the needy economic recovery and financial reform.
the hundred days on taking office the roosevelt administration launched a period of intense activity known as the hundred days lasting from march 9 to june 16 1933.
during this period congress passed more than 15 major pieces of new deal legislation.
these laws and others that followed significantly expanded the federal government s role in the nation s economy eleanor roosevelt 1884 1962 a niece of theodore roosevelt and a distant cousin of her husband franklin eleanor roosevelt lost her parents at an early age.
she was raised by a strict grandmother.
as first lady she often urged the president to take stands on controversial issues.
a popular public speaker eleanor was particularly interested in child welfare housing reform and equal rights for women and minorities.
in presenting a booklet on human rights to the united nations in 1958 she said where after all do human rights begin.
in the world of the individual person the neighborhood the school the factory farm or office where he works 1882 1945 born into an old wealthy new york family franklin delano roosevelt entered politics as a state senator in 1910 and later became assistant secretary of the navy.
in 1921 he was stricken with polio and became partially paralyzed from the waist down.
he struggled to regain the use of his legs and he eventually learned to stand with the help of leg braces.
roosevelt became governor of new york in 1928 and because he would not allow bodily disability to defeat his will he went on to the white house in 1933.
always interested in people roosevelt gained greater compassion for others as a result of his own physical disability.
the new deal 489 were the only thing we have to fear is fear itself99 franklin delano rooseve roosevelt s first step as president was to carry out reforms in banking and finance.
by 1933 widespread bank failures had caused most americans to lose faith in the banking system.
on march 5 one day after taking office roosevelt declared a bank holiday and closed all banks to prevent further withdrawals.
he persuaded congress to pass the emergency banking relief act which authorized the treasury department to inspect the country s banks.
those that were sound could reopen at once those that were insolvent unable to pay their debts would remain closed.
those that needed help could receive loans.
this measure revived public confidence in banks since customers now had greater faith that the open banks were in good financial shape.
an important fireside chat on march 12 the day before the first banks to reopen president roosevelt gave the first of his many fireside chats radio talks about issues of public concern explaining in clear simple language his new deal measures.
these informal talks made americans feel as if the president were talking directly to them.
in his first chat president roosevelt explained why the nation s welfare depended on public sup lt port of the government and the banking system.
we have provided the machinery to restore our financial system he said and it is up to you to support and make it work.
the president explained that when too many people demanded their savings in cash banks would fail.
this was not because banks were weak but because even strong banks could not meet such heavy demands.
over the next few weeks many americans returned their savings to banks.
franklin d roosevelt holds his dog fala and talks to a young family friend.
regulating banking and finance one monetary policy that the government enacted to resolve the bank crisis was to end the gold standard.
the trend toward fiat money or paper money backed not by gold or silver but by a government guarantee of value had started during the civil war.
in 1879 however the country returned to a gold standard.
the bank failures of the early 1930s were due in part to this standard when the federal reserve was unable to provide enough liquid currency to allow banks to meet customers demands for cash.
thus in 1933 roosevelt completed the shift from a gold standard to fiat money.
congress took another step to reorganize the banking system by passing the glass steagall act of 1933 which established the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.
the fdic provided federal insurance for individual bank accounts of up to 5 000 reassuring millions of bank customers that their money was safe.
it also required banks to act cautiously with their customers money.
congress and the president also worked to regulate the stock market in which people had lost faith because of the crash of 1929.
the federal securities act passed in may 1933 required corporations to provide complete information on all stock offerings and made them liable for any misrepresentations.
in june of 1934 congress created the securities and exchange commission sec to regulate the stock market.
one goal of this commission was to prevent people with inside information about companies from rigging the stock market for their own profit.
in addition roosevelt persuaded congress to approve a bill allowing the manufacture and sale of some alcoholic beverages.
the bill s main purpose was to raise gov ernment revenues by taxing alcohol.
by the end of 1933 the passage of the 21st amendment had repealed prohibition altogether.
main idea evaluating leadership how successful was fdrs fireside chat.
chapter 15 helping the american people while working on banking and financial matters the roosevelt administration also implemented programs to provide relief to farmers perhaps the hardest hit by the depression.
it also aided other workers and attempted to stimulate economic recovery.
rural assistance the agricultural adjustment act aaa sought to raise crop prices by lowering production which the government achieved by paying farmers to leave a certain amount of every acre of land unseeded.
the theory was that reduced supply would boost prices.
in some cases crops were too far advanced for the acreage reduction to take effect.
as a result the government paid cotton growers 200 million to plow under 10 million acres of their crop.
it also paid hog farmers to slaughter 6 million pigs.
this policy upset many americans who protested the destruction of food when many people were going hungry.
it did however help raise farm prices and put more money in farmers pockets.
an especially ambitious program of regional development was the tennessee valley authority tva established on may 18 1933.
see geography spotlight on page 520.
focusing on the badly depressed tennessee river valley the tva renovated five existing dams and constructed 20 new ones created thousands of jobs and provided flood control hydroelectric power and other benefits to an impoverished region.
main idea analyzing effects how did new deal programs affect various regions of the united states.
providing work projects the administration also established programs to provide relief through work projects and cash payments.
one important program the civilian conservation corps ccc put young men aged 18 to 25 to work building roads developing parks planting trees and helping in soil erosion and flood control projects.
by the time the program ended in 1942 almost 3 million young men had passed through the ccc.
the ccc paid a small wage 30 a month of which 25 was automatically sent home to the worker s family.
it also supplied free food and uniforms and lodging in work camps.
many of the camps were located on the great plains where within a period of eight years the men of the ccc planted more than 200 million trees.
this tremendous reforestation program was aimed at preventing another dust bowl.
the public works administration pwa created in june 1933 as part of the national industrial recovery act nira provided money to states to create jobs chiefly in the construction of schools and other community buildings.
when these programs failed to make a sufficient dent in unemployment president roosevelt established the civil works administration in november 1933.
it provided 4 million immediate jobs during the winter of 1933 1934.
although some critics of the cwa claimed that the programs were make work projects and a waste of money the cwa built 40 000 schools and paid the salaries of more than 50 000 schoolteachers in america s rural areas.
it also built more than half a million miles of roads.
civilian conservation corps the ccc provided almost 3 million men aged 18 25 with work and wages between 1933 and 1942.
the men lived in work camps under a strict regime.
the majority of the camps were racially segregated.
by 1938 the ccc had an 11 percent african american enrollment.
accomplishments of the ccc include planting over 3 billion trees developing over 800 state parks and building more than 46 000 bridges.
the new deal 491 jkl history video the national recovery administration 7 promoting fair practices the nira also sought to promote industrial growth by establishing codes of fair practice for individual industries.
it created the national recovery administration nra which set prices of many products and established standards.
the aim of the nra was to promote recovery by interrupting the trend of wage cuts falling prices and layoffs.
the economist gardiner c means attempted to justify the nra by stating the goal of industrial planning.
a personal voice gardiner c means the national recovery administration was created in response to an overwhelming demand from many quarters that certain elements in the making of industrial policy should no longer be left to the market place and the price mechanism but should be placed in the hands of administrative bodies.
the making of industrial policy the codes of fair practice had been drafted in joint meetings of businesses and representatives of workers and consumers.
these codes both limited production and established prices.
because businesses were given new concessions workers made demands.
congress met their demands by passing a section of the nira guaranteeing workers right to unionize and to bargain collectively.
jdj many businesses and politicians were critical of the nra.
charges arose that the codes served large business interests.
there were also charges of increasing code violations.
i main idea evaluating how did the new deal support labor organizations.
yconom f backgrounds deficit spending john maynard keynes an influential british economist promoted the idea of deficit spending to stimulate economic recovery.
in his view a country should spend its way out of a depression by putting money into the hands of consumers.
this would make it possible for them to buy goods and services and thus fuel economic growth.
therefore even if a government has to go deeply into debt it should spend great amounts of money to help get the economy growing again.
when the great depression began many considered keyness ideas to be revolutionary.
food clothing and shelter a number of new deal programs concerned housing and home mortgage problems.
the home owners loan corporation holc provided government loans to homeowners who faced foreclosure because they couldn t meet their loan payments.
in addition the 1934 national housing act created the federal housing administration fha.
this agency continues to furnish loans for home mortgages and repairs today.
another program the federal emergency relief administration fera was funded with 500 million to provide direct relief for the needy.
half of the money was given to the states as direct grants in aid to help furnish food and clothing to the unemployed the aged and the ill.
the rest was distributed to states to support work relief programs for every 3 within the state program fera donated 1.
harry hopkins who headed this program believed that whereas money helped people buy food it was meaningful work that enabled them to gain confidence and self respect.
the new deal comes under attack by the end of the hundred days millions of americans had benefited from the new deal programs.
as well the public s confidence in the nation s future had rebounded.
although president roosevelt agreed to a policy of deficit spend spending more money than the government receives in rev enue he did so with great reluctance.
he regarded deficit spending as a necessary evil to be used only at a time of great economic crisis.
nevertheless the new deal did not end the depression and opposition grew among some parts of the population.
chapter 15 analyzing political cartoons changing course with hopes of lessening opposition to his programs roosevelt proposed a court reform bill that would essentially have allowed him to pack the court with judges supportive of the new deal.

skillbuilder analyzing political cartoons 1.
what compass did roosevelt want to change.
how does the cartoonist portray fdrs attitude regarding his power as president.
main idea contrasting how did liberal and conservative critics differ in their opposition to the new deal.
liberal critics argued that the new deal did not go far enough to help the poor and to reform the nation s economic system.
conservative critics argued that roosevelt spent too much on direct relief and used new deal policies to control business and socialize the economy.
many critics believed the new deal interfered with the workings of a free market economy jy the supreme court reacts by the mid 1930s conservative opposition to the new deal had received a boost from two supreme court decisions.
in 1935 the court struck down the nira as unconstitutional.
it declared that the law gave legislative powers to the executive branch and that the enforcement of industry codes within states went beyond the federal government s constitutional powers to regulate interstate commerce.
the next year the supreme court struck down the aaa on the grounds that agriculture is a local matter and should be regulated by the states rather than by the federal government.
fearing that further court decisions might dismantle the new deal president roosevelt proposed in february 1937 that congress enact a court reform bill to reorganize the federal judiciary and allow him to appoint six new supreme court justices.
most observers saw this bill as a clumsy effort to pack the supreme court with friendly justices and a dangerous attempt to upset the constitutional balance of power.
some of the supreme court s rulings had been based on the belief that the executive branch had usurped too much legislative power.
the court reform bill would further shift the relationship between the branches by allowing the executive to use legislation to interfere with judicial independence.
as it turned out the president got his way without reorganizing the judiciary.
in 1937 an elderly justice retired and roosevelt appointed the liberal hugo s black shifting the balance of the court.
rulings of the court began to favor the new deal.
over the next four years because of further resignations roosevelt was able to appoint seven new justices.
three fiery critics in 1934 some of the strongest conser vative opponents of the new deal banded together to form an organization called the american liberty league.
the american liberty league opposed new deal measures that it believed violated respect for the rights of individuals and property.
three of the toughest critics the president faced however were three men who expressed views that appealed to poor americans charles coughlin dr francis townsend and huey long.
father charles coughlin speaks to a radio audience in 1935.
every sunday father charles coughlin a roman catholic priest from a suburb of detroit broadcast radio sermons that combined economic political and religious ideas.
initially a supporter of the new deal coughlin soon turned against roosevelt.
he favored a guaranteed annual income and the nationalization of banks.
at the height of his popularity father coughlin claimed a radio audience of as many as 40 45 million people but his increasingly anti semitic anti jewish views eventually cost him support.
another critic of new deal policies was dr francis townsend a physician and health officer in long beach california.
he believed that roosevelt wasn t doing enough to help the poor and elderly so he devised a pension plan that would provide monthly benefits to the aged.
the plan found strong backing among the elderly thus undermining their support for roosevelt.
perhaps the most serious challenge to the new deal came from senator huey long of louisiana.
like coughlin long was an early supporter of the new deal but he too turned against roosevelt.
eager to win the presidency for himself long proposed a nationwide social program called share our wealth.
under the banner every man a king he promised something for everyone.
a personal voice huey long 4 4 we owe debts in america today public and private amounting to 252 billion.
that means that every child is born with a 2 000 debt tied around his neck.
we propose that children shall be born in a land of opportunity guaranteed a home food clothes and the other things that make for living including the right to education 99 record 74 congress session 1 long s program was so popular that by 1935 he boasted of having perhaps as many as 27 000 share our wealth clubs and 7 5 million members.
that same year however at the height of his popularity long was assassinated by a lone gunman.
as the initial impetus of the new deal began to wane president roosevelt started to look ahead.

the president was prodded in this direction by his wife eleanor roosevelt a social reformer who combined her deep humanitarian impulses with great political skills.
eleanor roosevelt traveled the country observing social conditions and reminding the president about the suffering of the nation s people.
she also urged him to appoint women to government positions.
reelecting fdr the second new deal was under way by the time of the 1936 presidential election.
the republicans nominated alfred landon the governor of kansas while the democrats of course nominated president roosevelt for a second term.
the election resulted in an overwhelming victory for the democrats who won the presidency and large majorities in both houses.
the election marked the first time that most african americans had voted democratic rather than republican and the first time that labor unions gave united support to a presidential candidate.

improving labor and other reforms in a speech to congress in january 1935 the president declared when a man is convalescing from an illness wisdom dictates not only cure of the symptoms but also removal of their cause.
during the second new deal roosevelt with the help of congress brought about important reforms in the areas of labor relations and economic security for retired workers.
see the chart on page 500.
improving labor conditions in 1935 the supreme court declared the nira unconstitutional citing that the federal government had violated legislative authority reserved for individual states.
one of the first reforms of the second new deal was passage of the national labor relations act.
more commonly called the wagner act after its sponsor senator robert f wagner of new york the act reestablished the nira provision of collective bargaining.
the federal government again protected the right of workers to join unions and engage in collective bargaining with employers.
the wagner act also prohibited unfair labor practices such as threatening workers firing union members and interfering with union organizing.
the act set up the national labor relations board nlrb to hear testimony about unfair practices and to hold elections to find out if workers wanted union representation.
in 1938 congress passed the fair labor standards act which set maximum hours at 44 hours per week decreasing to 40 hours after two years.
it also set minimum wages at 25 cents an hour increasing to 40 cents an hour by 1945.

retirement 1935 social security administration provided a pension for retired workers and their spouses and aided people with disabilities.
pter 15 f the social security act one of the most important achievements of the new deal was creating the social security system.
the social security act passed in 1935 was created by a committee chaired by secretary of labor frances perkins.
the act had three major parts old age insurance for retirees 65 or older and their spouses.
the insurance was a supplemental retirement plan.
half of the funds came from the worker and half from the employer.
although some groups were excluded from the system it helped to make retirement comfortable for millions of people.

the unemployment system was funded by a federal tax on employers.
it was administered at the state level.
the initial payments ranged from 15 to 18 per week.
main idea drawing conclusions jey whom did social security help.
aid to families with dependent children and people with disabilities.
the aid was paid for by federal funds made available to the states.
although the social security act was not a total pension system or a complete welfare system it did provide substantial benefits to millions of americans expanding and regulating utilities the second new deal also included laws to promote rural electrification and to regulate public utilities.
in 1935 only 12 6 percent of american farms had electricity.
roosevelt established under executive order the rural electrification administration rea which financed and worked with electrical cooperatives to bring electricity to isolated areas.
by 1945 48 percent of america s farms and rural homes had electricity.
that figure rose to 90 percent by 1949.
the public utility holding company act of 1935 took aim at financial corruption in the public utility industry.
it outlawed the ownership of utilities by multiple holding companies a practice known as the pyramiding of holding companies.
lobbyists for the holding companies fought the law fiercely and it proved extremely difficult to enforce.
as the new deal struggled to help farmers and other workers overcome the great depression it assisted many different groups in the nation including women african americans and native americans.

the new deal 501 clor c decis o vs nlrb v jones and laughlin steel corp 1937 origins of the case in 1936 the jones and laughlin steel corporation was charged with intimidating union organizers and firing several union members.
the national labor relations board nlrb found the company guilty of unfair labor practices and ordered it to rehire the workers with back pay.
the ruling the supreme court ruled that congress had the power to regulate labor relations and confirmed the authority of the nlrb.
legal reasoning in the 1935 national labor relations act or wagner act congress claimed that its authority to regulate labor relations came from the commerce clause of the constitution.
jones and laughlin steel argued that its manufacturing business did not involve interstate commerce it operated a plant and hired people locally.
the court disagreed.
although production itself may occur within one state it said production is a part of the interstate flow of commerce.
if labor unrest at a steel mill would create burdens and obstructions to interstate commerce then congress has the power to prevent labor unrest at the steel mill.
the court also explained that the act went no further than to safeguard the right of employees to self organization and to select representatives for collective bargaining.
departing from earlier decisions the court affirmed that these are fundamental rights.

s why it mattered the 1935 wagner act was one of the most important pieces of new deal legislation.
conservative justices on the supreme court however thought new deal legislation increased the power of the federal government beyond what the constitution allowed.
by the time the jones and laughlin case reached the court in 1937 the court had already struck down numerous new deal laws.
it appeared to many as if the wagner act was doomed.
in february 1937 roosevelt announced a plan to appoint enough justices to build a court majority in favor of the new deal.
critics immediately accused roosevelt of trying to pack the supreme court thus crippling the constitution s system of checks and balances.
two months later the court delivered its opinion in jones and laughlin and at about the same time upheld other new deal legislation as well.
most historians agree that the court s switch was not a response to roosevelt s court packing plan which already seemed destined for failure.
nevertheless the decision resolved a potential crisis.
i choosing to work despite the strike a storekeeper at the jones and laughlin steel corporation tries to pass through picket lines.
historical impact the protection that labor unions gained by the wagner act helped them to grow quickly.
union membership among non farm workers grew from around 12 percent in 1930 to around 31 percent by 1950.
this increase helped improve the economic standing of many working class americans in the years following world war ii.
most significantly jones and laughlin greatly broadened congress s power.
previously neither the federal nor the state governments were thought to have sufficient power to control the large corporations and holding companies doing business in many states.
now far beyond the power to regulate interstate commerce congress had the power to regulate anything essential or appropriate to that function.
for example federal laws barring discrimination in hotels and restaurants rest on the court s allowing congress to decide what is an essential or appropriate subject of regulation.
more recently the court has placed tighter limits on congress s power to regulate interstate commerce.
in united states v lopez 1995 the court struck down a law that banned people from having handguns near a school.
the court said congress was not justified in basing this law on its power to regulate interstate commerce.

pedro j gonzalez came to this country from mexico in the early 1920s and later became a united states citizen.
as the first spanish language disc jockey in los angeles gonzalez used his radio program to condemn discrimination against mexicans and mexican americans who were often made scapegoats for social and economic problems during the depression.
for his efforts gonzalez was arrested jailed and deported on trumped up charges.
later in life he reflected on his experiences.
i a personal voice pedro j gonzalez seeing how badly they treated mexicans back in the days of my youth i could have started a rebellion.
but now there could be a cultural understanding so that without firing one bullet we might understand each other.
we mexicans were here before they anglos were and we are not as they still say undesirables or wetbacks they say we come to this land and its not our home.
actually its the other way around quoted in the los angeles times december 9 1984 pedro j gonzalez became a hero to many mexican americans and a symbol of mexican cultural pride.
his life reflected some of the difficulties faced by mexicans and other minority groups in the united states during the new deal era.
the new deal brings new opportunities in some ways the new deal represented an important opportunity for minorities and women but what these groups gained was limited.
long standing patterns of prejudice and discrimination continued to plague them and to prevent their full and equal participation in national life.
women make their mark one of the most notable changes during the new deal was the naming of several women to important government positions frances perkins became america s first female cabinet member.

president roosevelt encouraged by his wife eleanor and seeking the support of women voters also appointed two female diplomats and a female federal judge.
however women continued to face discrimination in the workplace from male workers who believed that working women took jobs away from men.
a gallup poll taken in 1936 reported that 82 percent of americans said that a wife should not work if her husband had a job.
additionally new deal laws yielded mixed results.
the national recovery administration for example set wage codes some of which set lower minimum wages for women.
the federal emergency relief administration and the civil works administration hired far fewer women than men and the civilian conservation corps hired only men.
in spite of these barriers women continued their movement into the workplace.
although the overall percentage of women working for wages increased only slightly during the 1930s the percentage of married women in the workplace grew from 11 7 percent in 1930 to 15 6 percent in 1940.
in short widespread criticism of working women did not halt the long term trend of women working outside the home.
african american activism the 1930s witnessed a growth of activism by african americans.
one notable figure was a philip randolph who organized the country s first all black trade union the brotherhood of sleeping car porters.
his work and that of others laid the groundwork for what would become the civil rights movement.
african americans take leadership roles during the new deal roosevelt appointed more than 100 african americans to key positions in the government.
mary mcleod bethune an educator who dedicated herself to promoting opportunities for young african americans was one such appointee.
hired by the president to head the division of negro affairs of the national youth administration bethune worked to ensure that the nya hired african american administrators and provided job training and other benefits to minority students.
bethune also helped organize a black cabinet of influential african americans to advise the roosevelt administration on racial issues.
among these figures were william h hastie and robert c weaver both appointees to roosevelt s department of interior.
never before had so many african americans had a voice in the white house.
eleanor roosevelt played a key role in opening doors for african americans in government.
she was also instrumental in bringing about one of the most dramatic cultural events of the key playefl frances perkins 1882 1965 as a student at mount holyoke college frances perkins attended lectures that introduced her to social reform efforts.

historical spotlight deportation of mexican americans the president fails to support civil rights despite efforts to promote racial equality roosevelt was never committed to full civil rights for african americans.
he was afraid of upsetting white democratic voters in the south an important segment of his supporters.
he refused to approve a federal antilynching law and an end to the poll tax two key goals of the civil rights movement.
further a number of new deal agencies clearly discriminated against african americans including the nra the ccc and the tva.
these programs gave lower wages to african americans and favored whites.
african americans recognized the need to fight for their rights and to improve conditions in areas that the new deal ignored.
in 1934 they helped organize the southern tenant farmers union which sought to protect the rights of tenant farmers and sharecroppers both white and black.
in the north the union created tenants groups and launched campaigns to increase job opportunities.
in general however african americans supported the roosevelt administration and the new deal generally seeing them as their best hope for the future.
as one man recalled roosevelt touched the temper of the black community.

q native americans gain support native americans received strong government support from the new deal.
in 1924 native americans had received full citizenship by law.
in 1933 president roosevelt appointed john collier as commissioner of indian affairs.
collier helped create the indian reorganization act of 1934.
this act was an extreme change in government policy.
it moved away from assimilation and toward native american autonomy.
it also helped to restore some reservation lands to tribal ownership.
the act mandated changes in three areas economic native american lands would belong to an entire tribe.
this provision strengthened native american land claims by prohibiting the government from taking over unclaimed reservation lands and selling them to people other than native americans.
cultural the number of boarding schools for native american children was reduced and children could attend school on the reservations.
political tribes were given permission to elect tribal councils to govern their reservations.
some native americans who valued their tribal traditions hailed the act as an important step forward.
others who had become more americanized as individual landowners under the previous dawes act objected because they were tired of white people telling them what was good for them.
fdr creates the new deal coalition although new deal policies had mixed results for minorities these groups generally backed president roosevelt.
in fact one of fdr s great achievements was to create the new deal coalition an alignment of diverse groups dedicated to supporting the democratic party.
the coalition included southern whites various urban groups african americans and unionized industrial workers.
as a result democrats dominated national politics throughout the 1930s and 1940s.
labor unions flourish as a result of the wagner act and other prolabor legislation passed during the new deal union members enjoyed better working conditions and increased bargaining power.
in their eyes president roosevelt was a friend of labor.
labor unions donated money to roosevelt s reelection campaigns and union workers pledged their votes to him.
between 1933 and 1941 union membership grew from less than 3 million to more than 10 million.
unionization especially affected coal miners and workers in mass production industries such as the automobile rubber and electrica industries.
it was in these industries too that a struggle for dominance within the labor movement began to develop.

main idea union membership soars a ben shahn poster from the late 1930s boasted of the rise in union membership.
the american federation of labor afl had traditionally been restricted to the craft unions such as carpenters and electricians.
most of the afl leaders opposed industrywide unions that represented all the workers in a given industry such as automobile manufacturing.
frustrated by this position several key labor leaders including john l lewis of the united mine workers of america and david dubinsky of the international ladies garment workers formed the committee for industrial organization to organize industrial unions.
the committee rapidly signed up unskilled and semiskilled workers and within two years it succeeded in gaining union recognition in the steel and automobile industries.
in 1938 the committee for industrial organization was expelled from the afl and changed its name to the congress of industrial organizations cio.
this split lasted until 1955.
labor disputes one of the main bargaining tactics of the labor movement in the 1930s was the sit down strike.
instead of walking off their jobs workers remained inside their plants but they did not work.
this prevented the factory owners from carrying on production with strikebreakers or scabs.
some americans disapproved of the sit down strike calling it a violation of private property.
nonetheless it proved to be an effective bargaining tool.
not all labor disputes in the 1930s were peaceful.
perhaps the most dramatic incident was the clash at the republic steel plant in chicago on memorial day 1937.
police attacked striking steelworkers outside the plant.

fdr wins in 1936 urban voters were another important component of the new deal coalition.
support for the democratic party surged especially in large northern cities such as new york boston philadelphia and chicago.
these and other cities had powerful city political organizations that provided services such as jobs in exchange for votes.
in the 1936 election president roosevelt carried the nation s 12 largest cities.
support for president roosevelt came from various religious and ethnic groups roman catholics jews italians irish and polish and other slavic peoples as well as from african americans.

its the first time in my recollection that a president ever got up and said tm interested in and aim to do somethin for the workin man just knowin that for once.
there was a man to stand up and speak for him a man that could make what he felt so plain nobody could doubt he meant it has made a lot of us feel a sight lot better even when there wasnt much to eat in our homes quoted in these are our lives k coal miner zeno santinello shakes hands with franklin d roosevelt as he campaigns in elm grove west virginia in 1932.
fdr was extremely popular among working class americans.
far more important than his personal popularity however was the impact of the policies he initiated.
even today reforms begun under the new deal continue to influence american politics and society.
new deal reforms endure during his second term in office president roosevelt hinted at plans to launch a third new deal.
in his inaugural address the president exclaimed i see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day.
i see one third of a nation ill housed ill clad ill nourished.
however fdr did not favor deficit spending.
more importantly by 1937 the economy had improved enough to convince many americans that the depression was finally ending.
although economic troubles still plagued the nation president the new deal 5 roosevelt faced rising pressure from congress to scale back new deal programs which he did.
as a result industrial production dropped again and the number of unemployed increased from 7 7 million in 1937 to 10 4 million in 1938.
by 1939 the new deal was effectively over and roosevelt was increasingly concerned with events in europe particularly hitler s rise to power in germany.
supporters and critics of the new deal over time opinions about the new deal have ranged from harsh criticism to high praise.
most conservatives think president roosevelt s policies made the federal government too large and too powerful.
they believe that the government stifled free enterprise and individual initiative.
liberal critics in contrast argue that president roosevelt didn t do enough to socialize the economy and to eliminate social and economic inequalities.
supporters of the new deal contend however that the president struck a reasonable balance between two extremes unregulated capitalism and overregulated socialism and helped the country recover from its economic difficulties.
one of roosevelt s top advisers made this assessment of the president s goals.
main idea analyzing issues 4 why did industrial production drop and unemployment go up again in 1938.
a personal voice rexford tugwell he had in mind a comprehensive welfare concept infused with a stiff tincture of morality.
he wanted all americans to grow up healthy and vigorous and to be practically educated.
he wanted business men to work within a set of understood rules.
beyond this he wanted people free to vote to worship to behave as they wished so long as a moral code was respected and he wanted officials to behave as though office were a public trust.
quoted in redeeming the time p o counterpoint the new deal transformed the way american government works supporters of the new deal believe that it was successful.
many historians and journalists make this judgment by using the economic criterion of creating jobs.
the new republic for example argued that the shortcomings of the wpa are insignificant beside the gigantic fact that it has given jobs and sustenance to a minimum of 1 400 000 and a maximum of 3 300 000 persons for five years some historians stress that the new deal was more than a temporary solution to a crisis.
professor a.
a berle stated that human beings cannot indefinitely be sacrificed by millions to the operation of economic forces according to the historian william e luechtenburg it is hard to think of another period in the whole history of the republic that was so fruitful or of a crisis that was met with as much imagination to pulitzer prize winning historian allan nevins the new deal was a turning point in which the u s government assumed a greater responsibility for the economic welfare of its citizens.

many more problems have been created than solved by the new deal critics of the new deal believe that it failed to reach its goals.
the historian barton j bernstein accepted the goals of the new deal but declared that they were never met.
to him the new deal failed to raise the impoverished it failed to redistribute income and it failed to extend equality in senator robert a tafts opinion many more problems have been created than solved by the new deal.
he maintained whatever else has resulted from the great increase in government activity it has certainly had the effect of checking private enterprise completely.
this country was built up by the constant establishment of new business and the expansion of old businesses.
in the last six years this process has come to an end because of government regulation and the development of a tax system which penalizes hard work and success senator taft claimed that the government should gradually withdraw from the business of lending money and leave that function to private capital under proper regulation 516 chapter 15 expanding governments role in the economy the roosevelt administration expanded the power of the federal government giving it and particularly the president a more active role in shaping the economy.
it did this by infusing the nation s economy with millions of dollars by creating federal jobs by attempting to regulate supply and demand and by increasing the government s active participation in settling labor and management disputes.
the federal government also established agencies such as the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the securities and exchange commission sec to regulate banking and investment activities.
although the new deal did not end the great depression it did help reduce the suffering of thousands of men women and children by providing them with jobs food and money.
it also gave people hope and helped them to regain a sense of dignity.
the expansion during the new deal also affected the relationship between the federal government and state governments.
federal officials attempted to involve the states in new deal programs.
federal aid to the states increased from 217 million in 1932 to 2 billion in 1935.
with these funds state governments increased relief spending and began providing new services.
some critics felt that the size of government at both the federal and state levels was getting out of hand.
they believed the expansion threatened the basic character of the nation.
supporters on the other hand believed this change brought a welcome shift from the laissez faire policies of the 1920s.
the federal government had to go deeply into debt to provide jobs and aid to the american people.
the federal deficit increased to 2 9 billion in fiscal year 1934.
as a result of the cutbacks in federal spending made in 1937 1938 the deficit dropped to 100 million.
but the next year it rose again to 2 9 billion.
what really ended the depression however was the massive amount of spending by the federal government for guns tanks ships airplanes and all the other equipment and supplies the country needed for the world war ii effort.
during the war the deficit reached a high of about 54 5 billion in 1943.

iow f thety protecting workers rights one of the areas in which new deal policies have had a lasting effect is the protection of workers rights.
new deal legislation such as the wagner act and the fair labor standards act set standards for wages and hours banned child labor and ensured the right of workers to organize and to bargain collectively with employers.
today the national labor relations board nlrb created under the wagner act continues to act as a mediator in labor disputes between unions and employers.
banking and finance new deal programs established new policies in the area of banking and finance.
the securities and exchange commission sec created in 1934 continues to monitor the stock market and enforce laws regarding the sale of stocks and bonds.
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic created by the glass steagall act of 1933 has shored up the banking system by reassuring individual depositors that their savings are protected against loss in the event of a bank failure.
today individual accounts in united states federal banks are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation for up to 250 000.
social security today the social security system continues to rely on mandatory contributions paid by workers through payroll deductions and by employers.
the money is invested in a trust fund from which retirement benefits are later paid.
however several problems have surfaced.
for example benefits have expanded and americans live longer than they did in 1935.
also the ratio of workers to retirees is shrinking fewer people are contributing to the system relative to the number who are eligible to receive benefits.
the long range payment of benefits may be in jeopardy because of the large number of recipients.
continuing disagreement about how to address the costs has prevented legislative action.
social and environmental effects new deal economic and financial reforms including the creation of the fdic the sec and social security have helped to stabilize the nation s finances and economy.
although the nation still experiences economic downturns known as recessions people s savings are insured and they can receive unemployment compensation if they lose their jobs.
social security one of the most important legacies of the new deal has been that the federal government has assumed some responsibility for the social welfare of its citizens.
under president roosevelt the government undertook the creation of a social security system that would help a large number of needy americans receive some assistance.
the social security act provides an old age insurance program an unemployment compensation system and aid to people with disabilities and families with dependent children.
it has had a major impact on the lives of millions of americans since its founding in 1935.
the rural scene new deal policies also had a significant impact on the nation s agriculture.
new deal farm legislation set quotas on the production of crops such as wheat to control surpluses.
under the second agricultural adjustment act passed in 1938 loans were made to farmers by the commodity credit corporation.
the value of a loan was determined by the amount of a farmer s surplus crops and the parity price a price intended to keep farmers income steady.
establishing agricultural price supports set a precedent of federal aid to farmers that continued into the 2000s.
other government programs such as rural electrification helped to improve conditions in rural america.
a social security poster proclaims the benefits of the system for those who are 65 or older.
main idea developing historical perspective why was the establishment of the social security system such an important part of the new deal.
518 chapter 15 main idea analyzing effects how did new deal programs benefit and harm the environment.
the environment americans also continue to benefit from new deal efforts to protect the environment.
president roosevelt was highly committed to conservation and promoted policies designed to protect the nation s natural resources.
the civilian conservation corps planted trees created hiking trails and built fire lookout towers.
the soil conservation service taught farmers how to conserve the soil through contour plowing terracing and crop rotation.
congress also passed the taylor grazing act in 1934 to help reduce grazing on public lands.
such grazing had contributed to the erosion that brought about the dust storms of the 1930s.
the tennessee valley authority tva harnessed water power to generate electricity and to help prevent disastrous floods in the tennessee valley.
the government also added to the national park system in the 1930s established new wildlife refuges and set aside large wilderness areas.
on the other hand government sponsored stripmining and coal burning caused air land and water pollution.
the new deal legacy has many dimensions.
it brought hope and gratitude from some people for the benefits and protections they received.
it also brought anger and criticism from those who believed that it took more of their money in taxes and curtailed their freedom through increased government regulations.
the deficit spending necessary to fund new deal programs grew immensely as the nation entered world war ii.

gordon parks shown here in 1968 discussing the movie version of his autobiographical gordon parks the well known photographer author and filmmaker was a 16 year old high school student in the fall of 1929.
he supported himself as a busboy at the exclusive minnesota club where prosperous club members spoke confidently about the economy.
parks too looked forward to a bright future.
then came the stock market crash of october 1929.
in his autobiography parks recalled his feelings at the time.
a personal voice gordon parks i couldnt imagine such financial disaster touching my small world it surely concerned only the rich.
but by the first week of november.
i was without a job.
all that next week i searched for any kind of work that would prevent my leaving school.
again it was were firing not hiring.
i went to school and cleaned out my locker knowing it was impossible to stay on.
a piercing chill was in the air as i walked back to the rooming house a choice of weapons the crash of 1929 and the depression that followed dealt a crushing blow to the hopes and dreams of millions of americans.
the high flying prosperity of the 1920s was over.
hard times had begun.
economic troubles on the horizon as the 1920s advanced serious problems threatened economic prosperity.
though some americans became wealthy many more could not earn a decent living.
important industries struggled and farmers grew more crops and j raised more livestock than they could sell at a profit.
both consumers and farmers were steadily going deeper into debt.
as the decade drew to a close these slippages in the economy signaled the end of an era.
chapter 14 main idea identifying problems what industrial weakness signaled a declining economy in the 1920s.
industries in trouble the superficial prosperity of the late 1920s shrouded weaknesses that would signal the onset of the great depression.
key basic industries such as railroads textiles and steel had barely made a profit.
railroads lost business to new forms of transportation trucks buses and private automobiles for instance.
mining and lumbering which had expanded during wartime were no longer in high demand.
coal mining was especially hard hit in part due to stiff competition from new forms of energy including hydroelectric power fuel oil and natural gas.
by the early 1930s these sources supplied more than half the energy that had once come from coal.
even the boom industries of the 1920s automobiles construction and consumer goods weakened.
one important economic indicator that declined during this time was housing starts the number of new dwellings being built.
when housing starts fall so do jobs in many related industries such as furniture manufacturing and lumbering.
farmers need a lift perhaps agriculture suffered the most.
during world war i prices rose and international demand for crops such as wheat and corn soared.
farmers had planted more and taken out loans for land and equipment.
however demand fell after the war and crop prices declined by 40 percent or more.
farmers boosted production in the hopes of selling more crops but this only depressed prices further.
between 1919 and 1921 annual farm income declined from 10 billion to just over 4 billion.
farmers who had gone into debt had difficulty in paying off their loans.
many lost their farms when banks foreclosed and seized the property as payment for the debt.
as farmers began to default on their loans many rural banks began to fail.
auctions were held to recoup some of the banks losses.
congress tried to help out farmers with a piece of legislation called the mcnary haugen bill.
this called for federal price supports for key products such as wheat corn cotton and tobacco.
the government would buy surplus crops at guaranteed prices and sell them on the world market.
president coolidge vetoed the bill twice.
he commented farmers have never made money.
i don t believe we can do much about it.
consumers have less money to spend as farmers incomes fell they bought fewer goods and services but the problem was larger.
by the late 1920s i v onom f background uneven income distribution 1929 the 1920s were an era that favored big business.
life was good for the rich.
they made up just 0 1 percent of the population and had yearly incomes of more than 100 000.
conversely much of the population had to scrape to get by.
many earned so little that everyone in the family including children had to work.
nearly 80 percent of all families had no savings.
1 999 and under 65 2 000 4 999 29 source historical statistics of the united states colonial times to 1970 10 000 and over 1 9 999 5 000 5 americans were buying less mainly because of rising prices stagnant wages unbalanced distribution of income and overbuying on credit in the preceding years.
production had also expanded much faster than wages resulting in an ever widening gap between the rich and the poor.
living on credit although many americans appeared to be prosperous during the 1920s in fact they were living beyond their means.
they often bought goods on credit an arrangement in which consumers agreed to buy now and pay later for purchases.
this was often in the form of an installment plan usually in monthly payments that included interest charges.
by making credit easily available businesses encouraged americans to pile up a large consumer debt.
many people then had trouble paying off their growing debts.
faced with debt consumers cut back on spending.
uneven distribution of income during the 1920s the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.
between 1920 and 1929 the income of the wealthiest 1 percent of the population rose by 75 percent compared with a 9 percent increase for americans as a whole.
more than 70 percent of the nation s families earned less than 2 500 per year then considered the minimum amount needed for a decent standard of living.
even families earning twice that much could not afford many of the household products that manufacturers produced.
economists estimate that the average man or woman bought a new outfit of clothes only once a year.
scarcely half the homes in many cities had electric lights or a furnace for heat.
only one city home in ten had an electric refrigerator.
this unequal distribution of income meant that most americans could not participate fully in the economic advances of the 1920s.
many people did not have the money to purchase the flood of goods that factories produced.
the prosperity of the era rested on a fragile foundation.
jeu main idea forming generalizations what did the experience of farmers and consumers at this time suggest about the health of the economy.
hoover takes the nation we in america are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before.
herbert hoover although economic disaster was around the corner the election of 1928 took place in a mood of apparent national prosperity.
this election pitted republican candidate herbert hoover against democrat alfred e smith.
the election of 1928 hoover the secretary of commerce under harding and coolidge was a mining engineer from iowa who had never run for public office.
smith was a career politician who had served four terms as governor of new york.
he was personable and enjoyed being in the limelight unlike the quiet and reserved hoover.
still hoover had one major advantage he could point to years of prosperity under republican administrations since 1920.
many americans believed him when he declared we in america are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before.
it was an overwhelming victory for hoover.
the message was clear most americans were happy with republican leadership.
dreams of riches in the stock market by 1929 some economists had warned of weaknesses in the economy but most americans chapter 14 vocabulary stock a share of ownership in a company main idea analyzing events how did speculation and margin buying cause stock prices to rise.
maintained the utmost confidence in the nation s economic health.
in increasing numbers those who could afford to invested in the stock market.
the stock market had become the most visible symbol of a prosperous american economy.
then as now the dow jones industrial average was the most widely used barometer of the stock market s health.
the dow is a measure based on the stock prices of 30 representative large firms trading on the new york stock exchange.
through most of the 1920s stock prices rose steadily.
the dow had reached a high of 381 points nearly 300 points higher than it had been five years earlier.
eager to take advantage of this bull market a period of rising stock prices americans rushed to buy stocks and bonds.
one observer wrote it seemed as if all economic law had been suspended and a new era opened up in which success and prosperity could be had without knowledge or industry.
by 1929 about 4 million americans or 3 percent of the nation s population owned stocks.
many of these investors were already wealthy but others were average americans who hoped to strike it rich.
however the seeds of trouble were taking root.
people were engaging in speculation that is they bought stocks and bonds on the chance of a quick profit while ignoring the risks.
many began buying on margin paying a small percentage of a stock s price as a down payment and borrowing the rest.
with easy money available to investors the unrestrained buying and selling fueled the market s upward spiral.
the government did little to discourage such buying or to regulate the market.
in reality these rising prices did not reflect companies worth.
worse if the value of stocks declined people who had bought on margin had no way to pay off the loans.
the trend of buying on margin troubled the governing board of the federal reserve system which serves as the nation s central bank.
the federal reserve board sets monetary policy in order to promote healthy economic activity.
in the late 1920s the board decided to make it harder for brokers to offer margin loans to investors.
their strategy was partly successful at least at first.
borrowing from banks decreased but large corporations began providing brokers with the cash to make margin loans.
as a result the run up of the stock market continued despite the board s shift in monetary policy.

i new york stock exchange in the twenty first century the new york stock exchange nyse remains at its core what it has been since it opened its doors in 1792 the nations premier marketplace for the buying and selling of stocks.
there stockbrokers known as members take orders from their customers to buy and sell shares of stock in any one of more than 3 000 companies.
to execute their customers orders the members offer and receive bids in what resembles a loud and fast paced auction.
in general customers submit two types of orders.
a limit order tells the broker to buy or sell only if the stock reaches a certain price.
a market order tells the broker to execute a transaction immediately no matter what the price.
despite remaining close to its roots the nyse is today undergoing perhaps the most significant changes in its long history in large part due to the use of computers and the internet.
i a pen and paper operation in the 1920s orders to buy or sell a stock arrived at brokers telephone booths located around the edge of the trading floor.
they were then carried by hand or sent by pneumatic tube to the trading post where that stock would be traded.
nyse employees called reporters had to record every transaction.
for each new sale they wrote out a slip of paper containing the stocks abbreviation the number of shares and the price and then transmitted it to the ticker room.
market information was typed into a keyboard that converted the keystrokes into electrical impulses that drove the clattering print wheels in ticker machines along the network.
people would read the current display at the trading posts.
technological changes with the introduction of computer technology the activities of the exchange are less and less centered on human interaction.
for example some 99 percent of trades on the nyse now go through an electronic database known as the super display book system.
with this system a trade can be completed in milliseconds.
further electronic communications networks now allow individuals to buy and sell stocks themselves over the internet at a fraction of what it would cost to use a specialist.
such innovation has prompted some to insist that all future trading will be done via computers thus eliminating the need for physical exchanges such as the nyse.

shareholders frantically tried to sell before prices plunged even lower.
the number of shares dumped that day was a record 16 4 million.
additional millions of shares could not find buyers.
people who had bought stocks on credit were stuck with huge debts as the prices plummeted while others lost most of their savings.
the damage was widespread and catastrophic.
while the sell offs of earlier days had affected mainly the stocks of weaker businesses the collapse on black tuesday affected the stock of even the most solid companies.
during october the stock market dropped in value by about 16 billion nearly one half of the market s pre crash value.
by mid november investors had lost about 30 billion an amount equal to how much america spent in world war i.

financial collapse main idea analyzing effects what happened to ordinary workers during the great depression.
the stock market crash signaled the beginning of the great depression the period from 1929 to 1940 in which the economy plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed.
the crash alone did not cause the great depression but it hastened the collapse of the economy and made the depression more severe.
bank and business failures after the crash many people panicked and withdrew their money from banks.
but some couldn t get their money because the banks had invested it in the stock market.
in 1929 600 banks closed.
by 1933 11 000 of the nation s 25 000 banks had failed.
because the government did not protect or insure bank accounts millions of people lost their savings accounts.
the great depression hit other businesses too.
between 1929 and 1932 the gross national product the nation s total output of goods and services was cut nearly in half from 104 billion to 59 billion.
approximately 90 000 businesses went bankrupt.
among these failed enterprises were once prosperous automobile and railroad companies.
as the economy plunged into a tailspin millions of workers lost their jobs.
unemployment leaped from 3 percent 1 6 million workers in 1929 to 25 percent 13 million workers in 1933.
one out of every four workers was out of a job.
those who kept their jobs faced pay cuts and reduced hours.
not everyone fared so badly of course.
before the crash some speculators had sold off their stocks and made money.
joseph p kennedy the father of future president john f kennedy was one who did.

j worldwide shock waves the united states was not the only country gripped by the great depression.
much of europe for example had suffered throughout the 1920s.
european countries trying to recover from the ravages of world war i faced high war debts.
in addition germany had to pay war reparations payments to compensate the allies for the damages germany had caused.
the great depression compounded these problems by limiting america s ability to import european goods.
this made it difficult to sell american farm products and manufactured goods abroad.

in 1930 congress passed the hawley smoot tariff act which established the highest protective tariff in united states history.
it was designed to protect american farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition.
yet it had the opposite effect.
by reducing the flow of goods into the united states the tariff prevented other countries from earning american currency to buy american goods.
the tariff made unemployment worse in industries that could no longer export goods to europe.
many countries retaliated by raising their own tariffs.
within a few years world trade had fallen more than 40 percent.
jy causes of the great depression although historians and economists differ on the main causes of the great depression most cite a common set of factors among them tariffs and war debt policies that cut down the foreign market for american goods a crisis in the farm sector the availability of easy credit an unequal distribution of income these factors led to falling demand for consumer goods even as newly mechanized factories produced more products.
the federal government contributed to the crisis by keeping interest rates low thereby allowing companies and individuals to borrow easily and build up large debts.
some of this borrowed money was used to buy the stocks that later led to the crash.
at first people found it hard to believe that economic disaster had struck.
in november 1929 president hoover encouraged americans to remain confident about the economy.

the dust bowl the drought that began in the early 1930s wreaked havoc on the great plains a result of physical and human geographic factors.
drought is a part of a weather cycle naturally occurring on the great plains every few decades.
by the 1930s however careless agricultural practices had left the region vulnerable.
farmers from texas to north dakota had used tractors to break up the grasslands and plant millions of acres of new farmland.
plowing had removed the thick protective layer of prairie grasses.
farmers had then exhausted the land through overproduction of crops.
when the drought and winds began little vegetation was left to hold the soil down.
wind scattered the topsoil exposing sand and grit underneath.

although some people feared that hard times would undermine moral values those concerns were largely unfounded.
in main idea analyzing causes bj why did so many men leave their homes during the depression.
general americans believed in traditional values and emphasized the importance of family unity.
at a time when money was tight many families entertained themselves by staying at home and playing board games such as monopoly invented in 1933 and listening to the radio.
nevertheless the economic difficulties of the great depression put severe pressure on family life.
making ends meet was a daily struggle and in some cases families broke apart under the strain.
men in the streets many men had difficulty coping with unemployment because they were accustomed to working and supporting their families.
every day they would set out to walk the streets in search of jobs.
as frederick lewis allen noted in since yesterday men who have been sturdy and self respecting workers can take unemployment without flinching for a few weeks a few months even if they have to see their families suffer but it is different after a year.

some men became so discouraged that they simply stopped trying.
some even abandoned their families.
during the great depression as many as 300 000 transients or hoboes as they were called wandered the country hitching rides on railroad boxcars and sleeping under bridges.
these hoboes of the 1930s mainly men would occasionally turn up at homeless shelters in big cities.
the novelist thomas wolfe described a group of these men in new york city.
spotlight historical hobo symbols hoboes shared a hidden language that helped them meet the challenges of the road.
over time a set of symbols developed for hoboes to alert each other as to where they could get food or work or a place to sleep and what houses to avoid.

you cant go home again during the early years of the great depression there was no federal system of direct relief cash payments or food provided by the government to the poor.
some cities and charity services did offer relief to those who needed it but the benefits were meager.

this was the most generous relief offered by any city but it was still well below the amount needed to feed a family.
women struggle to survive women worked hard to help their families survive adversity during the great depression.
many women canned food and sewed clothes.
they also carefully managed household budgets.

many women also worked outside the home though they usually received less money than men did.
as the depression wore on however working women became the targets of enormous resentment.
many people believed that women especially married women had no right to work when there were men who were unemployed.
the great depression begins 475 if i leave my mother it will mean one less in the early 1930s some cities refused to hire married women as schoolteachers.
many americans assumed that women were having an easier time than men during the great depression because few were seen begging or standing in bread lines.
as a matter of fact many women were starving to death in cold attics and rooming houses.
as one writer pointed out women were often too ashamed to reveal their hardship.

poor diets and a lack of money for health care led to serious health problems.
milk consumption declined across the country and clinics and hospitals reported a dramatic rise in malnutrition and diet related diseases such as rickets.
at the same time child welfare programs were slashed as cities and states cut their budgets in the face of dwindling resources.
falling tax revenues also caused school boards to shorten the school year and even close schools.
by 1933 some 2 600 schools across the nation had shut down leaving more than 300 000 students out of school.
thousands of children went to work instead they often labored in sweatshops under horrendous conditions.

people often gave food clothing and a place to stay to the needy.

hoover tries to reassure the nation after the stock market crash of october 1929 president herbert hoover tried to reassure americans that the nations economy was on a sound footing.
any lack of confidence in the economic future is foolish he declared.
in his view the important thing was for americans to remain optimistic and to go about their business as usual.
americans believed depressions were a normal part of the business cycle.
according to this theory periods of rapid economic growth were naturally followed by periods of depression.
the best course in a slump many experts believed was to do nothing and let the economy fix itself.
hoover took a slightly different position.
he felt that government could play a limited role in helping to solve problems.
hoover s philosophy herbert hoover had been an engineer and he put great faith in the power of reason.
he was also a humanitarian as he made clear in one of his last speeches as president.
a personal voice herbert hoover our first objective must be to provide security from poverty and want.
we want to see a nation built of home owners and farm owners.
we want to see their savings protected.
we want to see them in steady jobs.
we want to see more and more of them insured against death and accident unemployment and old age.
we want them all secure 99 challenge to liberty october 1936 main idea summarizing what were some of hoovers key convictions about government.
like many americans of the time hoover believed that one of government s chief functions was to foster cooperation between competing groups and interests in society.
if business and labor were in a conflict for example government should step in and help them find a solution that served their mutual interests.
this cooperation must be voluntary rather than forced he said.
government s role was to encourage and facilitate cooperation not to control it.
on the other hand americans also valued rugged individualism the idea that people should succeed through their own efforts.
they should take care of themselves and their families rather than depend on the government to bail them out.
thus hoover opposed any form of federal welfare or direct relief to the needy.
he believed that handouts would weaken people s self respect and moral fiber.
his answer to the needy was that individuals charities and local organizations should pitch in to help care for the less fortunate.
the federal government should direct relief measures but not through a vast federal bureaucracy.
such a bureaucracy he said would be too expensive and would stifle individual liberties jy however when the depression took hold moral fiber wasn t what people were worried about.
hoover s response shocked and frustrated suffering americans.
hoover takes cautious steps hoover s political philosophy caused him to take a cautious approach to the depression.
soon after the stock market crash he called together key leaders in the fields of business banking and labor.
he urged them to work together to find solutions to the nation s economic woes and to act in ways that would not make a bad situation worse.
for example he asked employers not to cut wages or lay off workers and he asked labor leaders not to demand higher wages or go on strike.
he also created a special organization to help private charities generate contributions for the poor.
none of these steps made much of a difference.
a year after the crash the economy was still shrinking and unem ployment was still rising.
more companies went out of business soup kitchens became a common sight and general misery continued to grow.
shantytowns arose in every city and hoboes continued to roam.
v ey playr herbert hoover 1874 1964 born to a quaker family in iowa herbert hoover was orphaned at an early age.
his life was a rags to riches story.
he worked his way through stanford university and later made a fortune as a mining engineer and consultant in china australia europe and africa.
during and after world war i he coordinated u s relief efforts in europe earning a reputation for efficiency and humanitarian ideals.

looking downstream colorado river showing the immense concrete forms of boulder dam boulder dam one project that hoover approved did make a difference.
years earlier when hoover served as secretary of commerce one of his earliest proposed initiatives was the construction of a dam on the colorado river.
aiming to minimize federal intervention hoover proposed to finance the dam s construction by using profits from sales of the electric power that the dam would generate.
he also helped to arrange an agreement on water rights among the seven states of the colorado river basin arizona california colorado nevada new mexico utah and wyoming.
by the time the massive project won congressional approval in 1928 as part of a 700 million public works program hoover had been elected to the white house.
in the fall of 1929 nearly one year into his presidency hoover was finally able to authorize construction of boulder dam later called hoover dam.
at 726 ft high and 1 244 ft long it would be the world s tallest dam and the second largest.
in addition to providing electricity and flood control the dam also provided a regular water supply which enabled the growth of california s massive agricultural economy.

in the 1930 congressional elections the democrats took advantage of anti hoover sentiments to win more seats in congress.
as a result of that election the republicans lost control of the house of representatives and saw their majority in the senate dwindle to one vote.
as americans grew more and more frustrated by the depression they expressed their anger in a number of ways.
farmers stung by low crop prices burned their corn and wheat and dumped their milk on highways rather than sell it at a loss.
some farmers even declared a farm holiday and refused to work their fields.
a number blocked roads to prevent food from getting to market hoping that food shortages would raise prices.
some farmers also used force to prevent authorities from foreclosing on farms.
by 1930 people were calling the shantytowns in american cities hoovervilles a direct slap at the presidents policies.
homeless people called the newspapers they wrapped themselves in hoover blankets.
empty pockets turned inside out were hoover flags.
many americans who had hailed hoover as a great humanitarian a few years earlier now saw him as a cold and heartless leader.

criticism of the president and his policies continued to grow.

hoover takes action as time went on and the depression deepened president hoover gradually softened his position on government intervention in the economy and took a more activist approach to the nation s economic troubles.
hoover backs cooperatives in hoover s view boulder dam was a model of how the federal government could encourage cooperation.
his attempts to relieve the depression involved negotiating agreements among private entities again reflecting his belief in small government.
for example he backed the creation of the federal farm board an organization of farm cooperatives.
the farm board was intended to raise crop prices by helping members to buy crops and keep them off the market temporarily until prices rose.
in addition hoover tried to prop up the banking system by persuading the nation s largest banks to establish the national credit corporation.
this organization loaned money to smaller banks which helped them stave off bankruptcy.
direct intervention by late 1931 however many people could see that these measures had failed to turn the economy around.
with a presidential election looming hoover appealed to congress to pass a series of measures to reform banking provide mortgage relief and funnel more federal money into business investment.
in 1932 hoover signed into law the federal home loan bank act which lowered mortgage rates for homeowners and allowed farmers to refinance their farm loans and avoid foreclosure.
it was not until hoover s time in office was over that congress passed the glass steagall banking act which separated investment from commercial banking and would congress hoped prevent another crash.
hoover s most ambitious economic measure however was the reconstruction finance corporation rfc approved by congress in january 1932.
it authorized up to 2 billion for emergency financing for banks life insurance companies railroads and other large businesses.
hoover believed that the money would trickle down to the average citizen through job growth and higher wages.
many critics questioned this approach they argued that the program would benefit only corporations and that the poor still needed direct relief.
hungry people could not wait for the benefits to trickle down to their tables.
in its first five months of operation the rfc loaned more than 805 million to large corporations but business failures continued.
the rfc was an unprecedented example of federal involvement in a peacetime economy but in the end it was too little too late.

that spring between 10 000 and 20 000 world war i veterans and their families arrived in washington d c from various parts of the country.
they called themselves the bonus expeditionary force or the bonus army.
the patman bill denied led by walter waters an unemployed cannery worker from oregon the bonus army came to the nation s capital to support a bill under debate in congress.
the patman bill authorized the government to pay a bonus to world war i veterans who had not been compensated adequately for their wartime service.
this bonus which congress had approved in 1924 was supposed to be paid out in 1945 in the form of cash and a life insurance policy but congressman wright patman believed that the money an average of 500 per soldier should be paid immediately.
hoover thought that the bonus marchers were communists and persons with criminal records rather than veterans.
he opposed the legislation but he respected the marchers right to peaceful assembly.
he even provided food and supplies so that they could erect a shantytown within sight of the capitol.
on june 17 however the senate voted down the patman bill.
hoover then called on in 1932 these veterans from muncie indiana decided to remain in the capital until their bonus was paid to them.

two people were shot and many were injured.
most americans were stunned and outraged at the government s treatment of the veterans.
once again president hoover s image suffered and now an election was nearing.
in november hoover would face a formidable opponent the democratic candidate franklin delano roosevelt.
when roosevelt heard about the attack on the bonus army he said to his friend felix frankfurter well felix this will elect me.

the passage below summarizes hoover s approach to halting the great depression.
qin 1929 the american stock market crashed sending the country into economic upheaval.
panicked americans withdrew their life savings from banks.
banks ran out of money and many had to close.
cash became scarce and people stopped buying goods.
businesses closed and laid off workers.
farms failed.
unemployment and homelessness soared.
president hoover was faced with a dilemma.
he could provide federal aid and support laws and programs to help people or he could encourage local organizations to help.
q as a republican hoover wanted to limit government s role in controlling the economy.
qhe believed that government should seek to avoid direct involvement in the lives of individuals and businesses.
hoover believed that federal aid to the needy would make people too dependent on government.
so rather than create new laws to assist the poor and homeless hoover encouraged churches and private charities to aid people in need.
he also encouraged businesses not to lay off workers or cut wages.
this strategy earned hoover the reputation as a do nothing president because many people felt he should have done more to stop the effects of the great depression.
unemployment hunger and homelessness grew.
eventually hoover softened his stance against government relief.
in the early 1930s he created numerous public works projects government funded programs to assist individuals families or communities in need.
hoover also urged congress to pass legislation to provide loans to banks insurance companies and other institutions.

sam gordon had been married less than a year when he was shipped overseas in july 1943.
as a sergeant in the united states army he fought in belgium and france during world war ii.
arriving back home in november 1945 sam nervously anticipated a reunion with his family.
a friend donald katz described sam s reactions.
a personal voice donald katz sam bulled through the crowd and hailed a taxi.
the cab motored north through the warm autumn day as he groped for feelings appropriate to being back home alive from a terrible war.
he was nearly panting under the weight of fear.

father of a child ive never seen at all.
home fires sam gordon met his daughter susan for the first time the day he returned home from the war and he went to work the next morning.
like many other young couples the gordons began to put the nightmare of the war behind them and to return to normality.
gis returned home to their families after world war ii with new hope but also with new problems.
readjustment and recovery by the summer of 1946 about 10 million men and women had been released from the armed forces.
veterans like sam gordon along with the rest of american society settled down to rebuild their lives.
634 chapter 19 r main idea the impact of the gl bill to help ease veterans return to civilian life.
congress passed the servicemen s readjustment act or the gl bill of rights in 1944.
in addition to encouraging veterans to get an education by paying part of their tuition the gl bill guaranteed them a year s worth of unemployment benefits while job hunting.
it also offered low interest federally guaranteed loans.
millions of young families used these benefits to buy homes and farms or to establish businesses.
housing crisis in 1945 and 1946 returning veterans faced a severe housing shortage.
many families lived in cramped apartments or moved in with relatives.
in response to this housing crisis developers like william levitt and henry kaiser used efficient assembly line methods to mass produce houses.
levitt who bragged that his company could build a house in 16 minutes offered homes in small residential communities surrounding cities called suburbs for less than 7 000.
levitt s first postwar development rows of standardized homes built on treeless lots was located on new york s long island and named levittown.
these homes looked exactly alike and certain zoning laws ensured that they would stay the same.
despite their rigid conformity americans loved the openness and small town feel to the planned suburbs.
with the help of the gl bill many veterans and their families moved in and cultivated a new lifestyle.
redefining the family tension created by changes in men s and women s roles after the war contributed to a rising divorce rate.
traditionally men were the breadwinners and heads of households while women were expected to stay home and care for the family.
during the war however about 8 million women 75 percent of whom were married entered the paid work force.
these women supported their families and made important household decisions.
many were reluctant to give up their newfound independence when their husbands returned.
although most women did leave their jobs by 1950 more than a million war marriages had ended in divorce.
economic readjustment after world war ii the united states converted from a wartime to a peacetime economy.
the u s government immediately canceled war contracts totaling 35 billion.
within ten days of japans surrender more than a million defense workers were laid off.
unemployment increased as veterans joined laid off defense workers in the search for jobs.
at the peak of postwar unemployment in march 1946 nearly 3 million people were seeking work.
rising unemployment was not the nation s only postwar economic problem however.
during the war the office of price administration opa had halted inflation by imposing maximum prices on goods.
when these controls ended on june 30 1946 prices skyrocketed.
in the next two weeks the cost of consumer products soared 25 percent double the increase of the previous three years.
in some cities consumers stood in long lines hoping to buy scarce items such as sugar coffee and beans.
prices continued to rise for the next two years until the supply of goods caught up with the demand.
while prices spiraled upward many american workers also earned less than they had earned during the war.
to halt runaway inflation and to help the nation convert to a peacetime economy congress eventually reestablished controls similar to the wartime controls on prices wages and rents.
the suburbs were a mass phenomenon even on moving day.
identifying problems fh what problems did americans face after world war ii.
the postwar boom 631 a dynamic economy remarkable recovery most economists who had forecast a postwar depression were proved wrong because they had failed to consider consumers pent up accumulation of needs and wants.
people had gone without many goods for so long that by the late 1940s with more than 135 billion in savings from defense work service pay and investments in war bonds americans suddenly had money to spend.
they snatched up everything from automobiles to houses.
bill contributed to this period of prosperity by aiding veterans in purchasing homes and businesses.
after a brief period of postwar economic readjustment the american economy boomed.
the demand for goods and services outstripped the supply and increased production which created new jobs.
judging from the graphs shown left many americans prospered in the 1950s in what the economist john kenneth galbraith called the affluent society.
the cold war also contributed to economic growth.

president trumans inheritance when harry s truman suddenly became president after franklin d roosevelts death in 1945 he asked roosevelts widow eleanor whether there was anything he could do for her.
she replied is there anything we can do for you.
for you are the one in trouble now.
in many ways president truman was in trouble.
a personal voice harry s truman i dont know whether you fellows ever had a load of hay fall on you but when they told me yesterday what had happened roosevelts death i felt like the moon the stars and all the planets had fallen on me.
excerpt from a speech april 13 1945 despite his lack of preparation for the job truman was widely viewed as honorable down to earth and self confident.
most important of all he had the ability to make difficult decisions and to accept full responsibility for their consequences.
as the plaque on his white house desk read the buck stops here.
truman faced two huge challenges dealing with the rising threat of communism as discussed in chapter 26 and restoring the american economy to a strong footing after the war s end.
6 636 chapter 19 main idea summarizing cj what actions did president truman take to avert labor strikes.
truman faces strikes one economic problem that truman had to address was strikes.
facing higher prices and lower wages 4 5 million discontented workers including steelworkers coal miners and railroad workers went on strike in 1946.
although he generally supported organized labor truman refused to let strikes cripple the nation.
he threatened to draft the striking workers and to order them as soldiers to stay on the job.
he authorized the federal government to seize the mines and he threatened to take control of the railroads as well.
truman appeared before congress and asked for the authority to draft the striking railroad workers into the army.
before he could finish his speech the unions gave in.
enough disgusted by shortages of goods rising inflation and labor strikes americans were ready for a change.
the republicans asked the public had enough.
voters gave their answer at the polls in the 1946 congressional elections the republican party won control of both the senate and the house of representatives for the first time since 1928.
the new 80th congress ignored truman s domestic proposals.
in 1947 congress passed the taft hartley act over truman s veto.
this bill overturned many rights won by the unions under the new deal.
historical spotlight vocabulary discrimination treatment based n class or category rather than individual merit social unrest persists problems arose not only in the economy but in the very fabric of society.
after world war ii a wave of racial violence erupted in the south.
many african americans particularly those who had served in the armed forces during the war demanded their rights as citizens.
truman supports civil rights truman put his presidency on the line for civil rights.
i am asking for equality of opportunity for all human beings he said and if that ends up in my failure to be reelected that failure will be in a good cause.
in 1946 truman created a president s commission on civil rights.
following the group s recommendations truman asked congress for several measures including a federal antilynching law a ban on the poll tax as a voting requirement and a permanent civil rights commission.
congress refused to pass these measures or a measure to integrate the armed forces.
as a result truman himself took action.
in july 1948 he issued an executive order for integration of the armed forces calling for equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces without regard to race color religion or national origin.
in addition he ordered an end to discrimination in the hiring of government employees.
the supreme court also ruled that the lower courts could not bar in 1947 jackie robinson joined the brooklyn dodgers angering some fans but winning the hearts and respect of many others.
jackie robinson jackie robinson took a brave step when he turned the brooklyn dodgers into an integrated baseball team in 1947.
but he and the country had a long way to go.
unhappy fans hurled insults at robinson from the stands.

the 1948 election although many americans blamed truman for the nation s inflation and labor unrest the democrats nominated him for president in 1948.
to protest truman s emphasis on civil rights a number of southern democrats who became known as dixiecrats formed the states rights democratic party and nominated their own presidential candidate governor j strom thurmond of south carolina.
discontent reigned at the far left of the democratic spectrum as well.
the former vice president henry a wallace led his supporters out of mainstream democratic ranks to form a more liberal progressive party.
as the election approached opinion polls gave the republican candidate new york governor thomas e dewey a comfortable lead.
refusing to believe the polls truman poured his energy into the campaign.
first he called the republican dominated congress into a special session.
he challenged it to pass laws supporting such elements of the democratic party platform as public housing federal aid to education a higher minimum wage and extended social security coverage.
not one of these laws was passed.

a r deal after his victory truman continued proposing an ambitious economic program.
truman s fair deal an extension of roosevelt s new deal included proposals for a nationwide system of compulsory health insurance and a crop subsidy system to provide a steady income for farmers.
in congress some northern democrats joined dixiecrats and republicans in defeating both measures.
in other instances however truman s ideas prevailed.
congress raised the hourly minimum wage from 40 cents to 75 cents extended social security coverage to about 10 million more people and initiated flood control and irrigation projects.
congress also provided financial support for cities to clear out slums and build 810 000 housing units for low income families jy vocabulary slush fund a fund often designated for corrupt practices such as bribery republicans take the middle road despite these social and economic victories truman s approval rating sank to an all time low of 23 percent in 1951.
the stalemate in the korean war and the rising tide of mccarthyism which cast doubt on the loyalty of some federal employees became overwhelming issues.
truman decided not to run for reelection.
the democrats nominated the intellectual and articulate governor adlai stevenson of illinois to run against the republican candidate general dwight d eisenhower known popularly as ike.
i like ike.
during the campaign the republicans accused the democrats of plunder at home and blunder abroad.
to fan the anti communist hysteria that was sweeping over the country republicans raised the specter of the rise of communism in china and eastern europe.
they also criticized the growing power of the federal government and the alleged bribery and corruption among truman s political allies.
eisenhower s campaign hit a snag however when newspapers accused his running mate california senator richard m nixon of profiting from a secret slush fund set up by wealthy supporters.
nixon decided to reply to the charges.
in an emotional speech to an audience of 58million now known as the checkers speech he exhibited masterful use of a new medium television.

in november 1952 eisenhower won 55 percent of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral college votes while the republicans narrowly captured congress.
walking the middle of the road president eisenhower s style of governing differed from that of the democrats.
his approach which he called dynamic conservatism was also known as modern republicanism.
he called for government to be conservative when it comes to money and liberal when it comes to human beings.
eisenhower followed a middle of the road course and avoided many controver sial issues but he could not completely sidestep a persistent domestic issue civil rights that gained national attention due to court rulings and acts of civil disobedience in the mid 1950s.
the most significant judicial action occurred in 1954 when the supreme court ruled in brown v board of education of topeka that public schools must be racially integrated.
see page 708.
in a landmark act of civil disobedience a year later a black seamstress named rosa parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man.
her arrest sparked a boycott of the entire montgomery alabama bus system.
the civil rights movement had entered a new era.
although eisenhower did not assume leadership on civil rights issues he accomplished much on the domestic scene.
shortly after becoming president eisenhower pressed hard for programs that would bring around a balanced budget and a cut in taxes.
during his two terms ike s administration raised the minimum wage extended social security and unemployment benefits increased funding for public housing and backed the creation of interstate highways and the department of health education and welfare.
his popularity soared and he won reelection in 1956.

quoted in the fifties a womens oral history after world war ii ended americans turned their attention to their families and jobs.
the economy prospered.
new technologies and business ideas created fresh opportunities for many and by the end of the decade americans were enjoying the highest standard of living in the world.
the american dream of a happy and successful life seemed within the reach of many people.
j i the organization and the organization man during the 1950s businesses expanded rapidly.
by 1956 the majority of americans no longer held blue collar or industrial jobs.
instead more people worked in higher paid white collar positions clerical managerial or professional occupations.
unlike blue collar workers who manufactured goods for sale white collar workers tended to perform services in fields like sales advertising insurance and communications.
the dream woman of the 1950s was depicted in advertising and on tv as doing constant housework but always with a smile.
the postwar boom 6i conglomerates many white collar workers performed their services in large corporations or government agencies.
some of these corporations continued expanding by forming conglomerates.
a conglomerate is a major corporation that includes a number of smaller companies in unrelated industries.
for example one conglomerate international telephone and franchises in the decades since ray kroc opened his first mcdonalds restaurant shown below franchising has become all but a way of life in the united states.
today there are thousands of franchised companies with almost 750 000 franchise establishments throughout the country.
officials estimate that franchises account for nearly one third of all u s retail sales.
american franchises provide a wide array of goods and services from car maintenance to hair care.
in an attempt to tap into the international market hundreds of u s companies have established overseas franchises.
the franchise with perhaps the greatest global reach is the one that started it all.
in addition to its more than 14 000 u s franchises mcdonalds now operates over 33 000 franchises in 118 countries around the world.
telegraph itt whose original business was communications bought car rental companies insurance companies and hotel and motel chains.
through this diversification or investment in various areas of the economy itt tried to protect itself from declines in individual industries.
other huge parent companies included american telephone and telegraph xerox and general electric.
franchises in addition to diversifying another strategy for business expansion franchising developed at this time.
a franchise is a company that offers similar products or services in many locations.
franchise is also used to refer to the right sold to an individual to do business using the parent company s name and the system that the parent company developed.
fast food restaurants developed some of the first and most successful franchises.
mcdonald s for example had its start when the mcdonald brothers developed unusually efficient service based on assembly line methods at their small drive in restaurant in san bernardino california.
they simplified the menu featured 15 cent hamburgers and mechanized their kitchen.
salesman ray kroc paid the mcdonalds 2 7 million for the franchise rights to their hamburger drive in.
in april 1955 he opened his first mcdonald s restaurant in des plaines illinois where he further improved the assembly line process and introduced the trademark arches that are now familiar all over the world.
j main idea comparing how were conglomerates and franchises alike and how were they different.
a personal voice ray kroc it requires a certain kind of mind to see the beauty in a hamburger bun.
yet is it any more unusual to find grace in the texture and softly curved silhouette of a bun than to reflect lovingly on the.
arrangements and textures and colors in a butterfly s wings.
not if you view the bun as an essential material in the art of serving a great many meals fast.
quoted in the fifties social conformity while franchises like mcdonald s helped standardize what people ate some american workers found themselves becoming standardized as well.
employees who were well paid and held secure jobs in thriving companies sometimes paid a price for economic advancement a loss of their individuality.
in general businesses did not want creative thinkers rebels or anyone who would rock the corporate boat.
7 i 642 chapter 19 main idea analyzing effects what effects did the climate in many corporations have on some workers.
in the organization man a book based on a classic 1956 study of suburban park forest illinois and other communities william h whyte described how the new large organizations created company people.
companies would give personality tests to people applying for jobs to make sure they would fit in the corporate culture.
companies rewarded employees for teamwork cooperation and loyalty and so contributed to the growth of con formity which whyte called belongingness.
despite their success a number of workers questioned whether pursuing the american dream exacted too high a price conformity replaced individuality.
the suburban lifestyle though achieving job security did take a psychological toll on some americans who resented having to repress their own personalities it also enabled people to provide their families with the so called good things in life.
most americans worked in cities but fewer and fewer of them lived there.
new highways and the availability and affordability of automobiles and gasoline made commuting possible.
by the early 1960s every large city in the united states was surrounded by suburbs.
of the 13 million new homes built in the 1950s 85 percent were built in the suburbs.
for many people the suburbs embodied the american dream of an affordable single family house good schools a safe healthy environment for children and congenial neighbors just like themselves.
the baby boom as soldiers the organization man had to step lively to keep up with the joneses.
returned from world war ii and settled into family life they contributed to an unprecedented population explosion known as the baby boom.
during the late 1940s and through the early 1960s the birthrate number of live births per 1 000 people in the united states soared.
at the height of the baby boom in 1957 one american infant was born every seven seconds a total of 4 308 000 that year.

the postwar boom 6 contributing to the size of the baby boom generation were many factors including reunion of husbands and wives after the war decreasing marriage age desirability of large families confidence in continued economic prosperity and advances in medicine.
the baby boom affected the nation s educational system.
during the decade 10 million new students entered elementary school.
the sharp increase in enrollment caused overcrowding and teacher shortages in many parts of the country.
the baby boom affected the american economy as well by increasing demand for certain consumer goods.
for instance in 1958 toy sales alone reached 1 25 billion.
also larger families created demand for larger cars.
in this way the increased demand caused by the baby boom contributed to the prosperity of the 1950s.
advances in medicine and childcare in the early 20th century diseases such as typhoid fever and polio main idea analyzing effects how did the baby boom affect american life in the 1950s.
jonas salk 1914 1995 one of the most feared diseases in the 1950s was polio the disease that had partially paralyzed president franklin d roosevelt.
polio afflicted 58 000 american children in 1952 killing some and making others reliant on crutches wheelchairs or iron lungs machines that helped people with paralyzed chest muscles to breathe.
in the early 1950s dr jonas salk at right in photo above a jewish scientist developed a vaccine to prevent the disease and the government sponsored a free inoculation program for children.
the vaccine was extremely effective.
by 1974 thanks to salks vaccine and a new oral vaccine developed by dr albert sabin only seven new polio cases were reported in the country.
claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children.
the need to prevent this loss of life led to the discovery of drugs to fight these diseases.
the worst year on record for polio was 1952 when more than 57 000 people contracted the disease.
three years later dr jonas salk developed a new polio vaccine.
many parents raised their children according to guidelines devised by the author and pediatrician dr benjamin spock.
his common sense book of baby and child care published in 1946 sold nearly 10 million copies during the 1950s.
in it he advised parents not to spank or scold their children and suggested family meetings in which children could express themselves.
womens roles during the 1950s the role of homemaker and mother was glorified in popular magazines movies and tv programs such as father knows best and the adventures of ozzie and harriet.
time magazine described the homemaker as the key figure in all suburbia the thread that weaves between family and community the keeper of the suburban dream.
in contrast to the ideal portrayed in the media however some women like carol freeman were not happy with their roles they felt isolated bored and unfulfilled.
according to one survey in the 1950s more than one fifth of suburban wives were dissatisfied with their lives.
betty friedan author of the groundbreaking 1963 book about women and society the feminine mystique described the problem.
background the percentage of women college students in the 1950s was smaller than in the 1920s.
a personal voice betty friedan for the first time in their history women are becoming aware of an identity crisis in their own lives a crisis which has grown worse with each succeeding generation.
i think this is the crisis of women growing up a turning point from an immaturity that has been called femininity to full human identity.
the feminine mystique the number of women working outside the home rose steadily during the decade.
by 1960 almost 40 percent of mothers with children between ages 6 and 17 held paying jobs.
5 644 chapter 19 main idea contrasting how did womens roles and opportunities in the 1950s differ from womens roles today.
history through but having a job didn t necessarily contribute to a woman s happiness.
a woman s career opportunities tended to be limited to fields such as nursing teaching and office support which paid less than other professional and business positions did.
women also earned less than men for comparable work.
although increasing numbers of women attended four year colleges they generally received little financial academic or psychological encouragement to pursue their goals jjy leisure in the fifties most americans of the 1950s had more leisure time than ever before.
employees worked a 40 hour week and earned several weeks vacation per year.
people owned more labor saving devices such as washing machines clothes dryers dishwashers and power lawn mowers which allowed more time for leisure activities.
fortune magazine reported that in 1953 americans spent more than 30 billion on leisure goods and activities.
americans also enjoyed a wide variety of recreational pursuits both active and passive.
millions of people participated in such sports as fishing bowling hunting boating and golf.
more fans than ever attended baseball basketball and football games others watched professional sports on television.
americans also became avid readers.
they devoured books about cooking religion do it yourself projects and homemaking.
they also read mysteries romance novels and fiction by popular writers such as ernest hemingway john steinbeck daphne du maurier and j d salinger.
book sales doubled due in part to a thriving paperback market.
the circulation of popular magazines like reader s digest and sports illustrated steadily rose from about 148 million to more than 190 million readers.
sales of comic books also reached a peak in the mid 1950s.
3 d comics and 3 d movies were two of the many fads that mesmerized the nation in the 1950s.
southern california and the automobile no state has exemplified automania in the u s more than california.
by the late 1990s californians owned more cars held more drivers licenses and traveled more miles on their roads than the people of any other state.
the center of this automobile culture is the metropolitan area of los angeles.
contributing to the importance of the automobile is southern californias suburban lifestyle.
this dependence on cars has contributed to problems of air pollution and traffic jams.
but california is addressing these problems by reviving public transportation systems and promoting the use of electric cars that produce no pollution.
the automobile culture during world war ii the u s government had rationed gasoline to curb inflation and conserve supplies.
after the war however an abundance of both imported and domestically produced petroleum the raw material from which gasoline is made led to inexpensive plentiful fuel for consumers.
easy credit terms and extensive advertising persuaded americans to buy cars in record numbers.
in response new car sales rose from 6 7 million in 1950 to 7 9 million in 1955.
the total number of private cars on the road jumped from 40 million in 1950 to over 60 million in 1960.
automania suburban living made owning a car a necessity.
most of the new suburbs built in formerly rural areas did not offer public transportation and people had to drive to their jobs in the cities.
in addition many of the schools stores synagogues churches and doctors and dentists offices were not within walking distance of suburban homes.
the interstate highway system the more cars there were the more roads were needed.
automania spurred local and state governments to construct roads linking the major cities while connecting schools shopping centers and workplaces to residential suburbs.
the interstate highway act which president eisenhower signed in 1956 authorized the building of a nationwide highway network 41 000 miles of expressways.
the new roads in turn encouraged the development of new suburbs farther from the cities.
interstate highways also made high speed long haul trucking possible which contributed to a decline in the commercial use of railroads.
towns along the new highways prospered while towns along the older smaller roads experienced hard times.
the system of highways also helped unify and homogenize the nation.
as john keats observed in his 1958 book the insolent chariots our new roads with their ancillaries the motels filling stations and restaurants advertising eats have made it possible for you to drive from brooklyn to los angeles without a change of diet scenery or culture.
with access to cars affordable gas and new highways more and more americans hit the road.
they flocked to mountains lakes national parks historic sites and amusement parks for family vacations.
disneyland which opened in california in july 1955 attracted 3 million visitors the next year.
mobility takes its toll as the automobile industry boomed it stimulated production and provided jobs in other areas such as drive in movies restaurants and shopping malls.
yet cars also created new problems for both society and the environment.
noise and exhaust polluted the air.
automobile accidents claimed more lives every year.
traffic jams raised people s stress levels and heavy use damaged the roads.
because cars made it possible for americans to live in suburbs many upper class and middle class whites left the crowded cities.
jobs and businesses eventually followed them to the suburbs.
public transportation declined and poor people in the inner cities were often left without jobs and vital services.

the postwar boom consumerism unbound now.
in a full console at only 299 95 zenith revolutionary toptummf by the mid 1950s nearly 60 percent of americans were members of the middle class about twice as many as before world war ii.
they wanted and had the money to buy increasing numbers of products.
consumerism buying material goods came to be equated with success.
new products one new product after another appeared in the marketplace as various industries responded to consumer demand.
newsweek magazine reported in 1956 that hundreds of brand new goods have become commonplace overnight.
consumers purchased electric household appliances such as washing machines dryers blenders freezers and dishwashers in record numbers.
with more and more leisure time to fill people invested in recreational items.
they bought televisions tape recorders and the new hi fi high fidelity record players.
they bought casual clothing to suit their suburban lifestyles and power lawn mowers barbecue grills swimming pools and lawn decorations for their suburban homes.
how does kitchen a in the 1950s advertisers made keeping up with the joneses a way of life for consumers.
planned obsolescence in addition to creating new products manufacturers began using a marketing strategy called planned obsolescence.
in order to encourage consumers to purchase more goods manufacturers purposely designed products to become obsolete that is to wear out or become outdated in a short period of time.
carmakers brought out new models every year urging consumers to stay up to date.
because of planned obsolescence americans came to expect new and better products and they began to discard items that were sometimes barely used.
some observers commented that american culture was on its way to becoming a throwaway society.
buy now pay later many consumers made their purchases on credit and therefore did not have to pay for them right away.
the diner s club issued the first credit card in 1950 and the american express card was introduced in 1958.
in addition people bought large items on the installment plan and made regular payments over a fixed time.

loans for buying a house and automobile loans worked the same way.
during the decade the total private debt grew from 73 billion to 179 billion.
instead of saving money americans were spending it confident that prosperity would continue.
the advertising age the advertising industry capitalized on this runaway consumerism by encouraging even more spending.
ads were everywhere in newspapers and magazines on radio and television and on billboards along the 648 chapter 19 highways prompting people to buy goods that ranged from cars to cereals to cigarettes.
advertisers spent about 6 billion in 1950 by 1955 the figure was up to 9 billion.
since most americans had satisfied their basic needs advertisers tried to convince them to buy things they really didn t need.
a personal voice vance packard on may 18 1956 the new york times printed a remarkable interview with a young man named gerald stahl executive vice president of the package designers council.
he stated 4psychiatrists say that people have so much to choose from that they want help they will like the package that hypnotizes them into picking it he urged food packers to put more hypnosis into their package designing so that the housewife will stick out her hand for it rather than one of many rivals.
mr stahl has found that it takes the average woman exactly twenty seconds to cover an aisle in a supermarket if she doesnt tarry so a good package design should hypnotize the woman like a flashlight waved in front of her eyes.
the hidden persuaders more and more ad executives and designers turned to psychology to create new strategies for selling.
advertisers appealed to people s desire for status and belongingness and strived to associate their products with those values.
television became a powerful new advertising tool.

in 1960 advertisers spent a total of 1 6 billion for television ads.

the first regular broadcasts beginning in 1949 reached only a small part of the east coast and offered only two hours of programs per week.
post world war ii innovations such as microwave relays which could transmit television waves over long distances sent the television industry soaring.
by 1956 the federal communications commission fcc the government agency that regulates and licenses television telephone telegraph radio and other communications industries had allowed 500 new stations to broadcast.
this period of rapid expansion was the golden age of television entertainment and entertainment in the 1950s often meant comedy.
milton berle attracted huge audiences with the texaco star theater and lucille ball and desi arnaz s early situation comedy i love lucy began its enormously popular run in 1951.
at the same time veteran radio broadcaster edward r murrow introduced two innovations on the scene news reporting with his program see it now 1951 1958 and interviewing with person to person 1953 1960.
westerns sports events and original dramas shown on playhouse 90 and studio one offered entertainment variety.
children s programs such as the mickey mouse club and the howdy doody show attracted loyal young fans.
american businesses took advantage of the opportunities offered by the new television industry.
advertising expenditures on tv which were 170 million in 1950 reached nearly 2 billion in 1960.
sales of tv guide introduced in 1953 quickly outpaced sales of other magazines.

complete ready to heat individual meals on disposable aluminum trays tv dinners made it easy for people to eat without missing their favorite shows.
historical spotlight tv quiz shows beginning with the 64 000 question in 1955 television created hit quiz shows by adopting a popular format from radio and adding big cash prizes.
the quiz show twenty one made a star of a shy english professor named charles van doren.
he rode a wave of fame and fortune until 1958 when a former contestant revealed that to heighten the dramatic impact producers had been giving some of the contestants the right answers.
a scandal followed when a congressional subcommittee confirmed the charges.

he died in a car accident at age 24.
stereotypes and gunslingers not everyone was thrilled with television though.
critics objected to its effects on children and its stereotypical portrayal of women and minorities.
women did in fact appear in stereotypical roles such as the ideal mothers of father knows best and the adventures of ozzie and harriet.
male characters outnumbered women characters three to one.
african americans and latinos rarely appeared in television programs at all.
television in the 1950s portrayed an idealized white america.
for the most part it omitted references to poverty diversity and contemporary conflicts such as the struggle of the civil rights movement against racial discrimination.
instead it glorified the historical conflicts of the western frontier in hit shows such as gunsmoke and have gun will travel.
the level of violence in these popular shows led to ongoing concerns about the effect of television on children.
in 1961 federal communications commission chairman newton minow voiced this concern to the leaders of the television industry.

i can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland speech to the national association of broadcasters washington d c may 9 1961 radio and movies although tv turned out to be wildly popular radio and movies survived.
but instead of competing with television s mass market for drama and variety shows radio stations turned to local programming of news weather music and community issues.
the strategy paid off.
during the decade radio advertising rose by 35 percent and the number of radio stations increased by 50 percent.
from the beginning television cut into the profitable movie market.
in 1948 18 500 movie theaters had drawn nearly 90 million paid admissions per week.
as more people stayed home to watch tv the number of moviegoers decreased by nearly half.
as early as 1951 producer david selznick worried about hollywood it ll never come back.
it ll just keep on crumbling until finally the wind blows the last studio prop across the sands.
but hollywood did not crumble and blow away.
instead it capitalized on the advantages that movies still held over television size color and stereophonic sound.
stereophonic sound which surrounded the viewer was introduced in 1952.
by 1954 more than 50 percent of movies were in color.
by contrast color television which became available that year did not become widespread until the main idea evaluating do you think the rise of television had a positive or a negative effect on americans.

next eca e in 1953 20th century fox introduced cinemascope which projected a wide angle image on a broad screen.
the industry also tried novelty features smell o vision and aroma rama piped smells into the theaters to coincide with events shown on the screen.
three dimensional images viewed through special glasses supplied by the theaters appeared to leap into the audience.
a subculture emerges although the mass media found a wide audience for their portrayals of mostly white popular culture dissenting voices rang out throughout the 1950s.
the messages of the beat movement in literature and of rock n roll in music clashed with the tidy suburban view of life and set the stage for the counterculture that would burst forth in the late 1960s.
the beat movement centered in san francisco los angeles and new york city s greenwich village the beat movement expressed the social and literary nonconformity of artists poets and writers.
the word beat originally meant weary but came to refer as well to a musical beat.
followers of this movement called beats or beatniks lived nonconformist lives.
they tended to shun regular work and sought a higher consciousness through zen buddhism music and sometimes drugs.
many beat poets and writers believed in imposing as little structure as possible on their artistic works which often had a free open form.
they read their poetry aloud in coffeehouses and other gathering places.
the beat movement produced some significant literary works such as allen ginsberg s long free verse poem howl published in 1956 and jack kerouac s novel on the road published in 1957.
this novel describes a nomadic search across america for authentic experiences people and values.
a personal voice jack kerouac t he only people for me are the mad ones the ones who are mad to live mad to talk mad to be saved the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing but burn burn burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.
on the road main idea analyzing causes ft why do you think many young americans were attracted to the beat movement.
some saw their rebellious attitudes as a threat to traditional american values.
look magazine proclaimed there s nothing really new about the beat philosophy.
it consists merely of the average american s value scale turned inside out.
the goals of the beat are not watching tv not wearing gray flannel not owning a home in the suburbs and especially not working.
nonetheless the beatnik attitudes way of life and literature attracted the attention of the media and fired the imaginations of many college students cy novelist jack kerouac s on the road published in 1957 sold over 500 000 copies.
african americans and rock if roll while beats expressed themselves in unstructured literature musicians in the 1950s added electronic instruments to traditional blues music creating rhythm and blues.
in 1951 a cleveland ohio radio disc jockey named alan freed was among the first to play the music.
this audience was mostly white but the music usually was produced by african american musicians.
freed s listeners responded enthusiastically and freed began promoting the new music that grew out of rhythm and blues and country and pop.
he called it rock n roll and it reflected a reaction by 1950s youth against the conformity that marked the postwar era.
the postwar boom chuck berry is as much known for his duck walk as for his electric guitar playing heard on hit records including johnny b goode and maybellene rock n roll in the early and mid 1950s richard penniman chuck berry bill haley and his comets and especially elvis presley brought rock n roll to a frantic pitch of popularity among the newly affluent teens who bought their records.
the music s heavy rhythm simple melodies and lyrics featuring love cars and the problems of being young captivated teenagers across the country.
elvis presley the unofficial king of rock n roll first developed his musical style by singing in church and listening to gospel country and blues music on the radio in memphis tennessee.
when he was a young boy his mother gave him a guitar and years later he paid four dollars of his own money to record two songs in 1953.
sam phillips a rhythm and blues producer discovered presley and produced his first records.
in 1955 phillips sold presley s contract to rca for 35 000.
presley s live appearances were immensely popular and 45 of his records sold over a million copies including heartbreak hotel hound dog all shook up don t be cruel and burning love.
although look magazine dismissed him as a wild troubadour who wails rock n roll tunes flails erratically at a guitar and wriggles like a peep show dancer presley s rebellious style captivated young audiences.
girls screamed and fainted when he performed and boys tried to imitate him.
not surprisingly many adults condemned rock n roll.
they believed that the new music would lead to teenage delinquency and immorality.
in a few cities rock n roll concerts were banned.
but despite this controversy television and radio exposure helped bring rock n roll into the mainstream and it became more acceptable by the end of the decade.
record sales which were 189 million in 1950 grew with the popularity of rock n roll reaching 600 million in 1960.
main idea making inferences based on elvis presleys song titles what do you think were teenagers concerns in the 1950s.
history through music hound dog a rock n roll crossover few examples highlight the influence african americans had on rock n roll and the lack of credit and compensation they received for their efforts more than the story of willie mae big mama thornton.
in 1953 she recorded and released the song hound dog to little fanfare.
she received a mere 500 in royalties.
only three years later elvis presley recorded a version of the tune which sold millions of records.
despite her contributions thornton reaped few rewards and struggled her entire career to make ends meet.

656 chapter 19 the racial gap african american music had inspired the birth of rock n roll and many of the genre s greatest performers were like berry and penniman african americans.
in other musical genres singers nat king cole and lena horne singer and actor harry belafonte and many others paved the way for minority representation in the entertainment fields.
musicians like miles davis sonny rollins charlie parker dizzy gillespie and thelonius monk played a style of music characterized by the use of improvisation called jazz.
these artists entertained audiences of all races.
but throughout the 1950s african american shows were mostly broadcast on separate stations.
by 1954 there were 250 radio stations nationwide aimed specifically at african american listeners.
african american stations were part of radio s attempt to counter the mass popularity of television by targeting specific audiences.
these stations also served advertisers who wanted to reach a large african american audience.
but it was the black listeners who had fewer television sets than whites and did not find themselves reflected in mainstream programming who appreciated the stations most.

as a novelist essayist and playwright he eloquently portrayed the struggles of african americans against racial injustice and discrimination.
he wrote a letter to his young nephew to mark the 100th anniversary of emancipation although in his words the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon.
a personal voice james baldwin 66 tjhese innocent and well meaning people your countrymen have caused you to be born under conditions not very far removed from those described for us by charles dickens in the london of more than a hundred years ago.
this innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which in fact it intended that you should perish.
you were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason 99 james baldwin the fire next time for many americans the 1950s were a time of unprecedented prosperity.

between the end of world war ii and 1960 nearly 5 million african americans moved from the rural south to urban areas 660 chapter 19 main idea analyzing effects what effect did white flight have on americas cities.
the urban crisis prompted by the white flight had a direct impact on poor whites and nonwhites.
the cities lost not only people and businesses but also the property they owned and income taxes they had paid.
city governments could no longer afford to properly maintain or improve schools public transportation and police and fire departments and the urban poor suffered.
the inner cities while poverty grew rapidly in the decaying inner cities many suburban americans remained unaware of it.
some even refused to believe that poverty could exist in the richest most powerful nation on earth.

the other america in main idea analyzing effects w why were tempts at urban renewal viewed as less than successful.
urban renewal most african americans native americans and latinos xxx the cities had to live in dirty crowded slums.
one proposed solution to the housing problem in inner cities was urban renewal.
the national housing act of 1949 was passed to provide a decent home and a suitable living environment for every american family.
this act called for tearing down rundown neighborhoods and constructing low income housing.
later the nation s leaders would create a new cabinet position housing and urban development hud to aid in improving conditions in the inner city.
although dilapidated areas were razed parking lots shopping centers highways parks and factories were constructed on some of the cleared land and there was seldom enough new housing built to accommodate all the displaced people.

mexicans seek employment many mexicans had become u s citizens during the 19th century when the united states had annexed the southwest after the war with mexico.
large numbers of mexicans had also crossed the border to work in the united states during and after world war i.
when the united states entered world war ii the shortage of agricultural laborers spurred the federal government to initiate in 1942 a program in which mexican braceros bre sar bs or hired hands were allowed into the united states to harvest crops.
hundreds of thousands of braceros entered the united states on a short term basis between 1942 and 1947.
when their employment was ended the braceros were expected to return to mexico.
however many remained in the united states illegally.
in addition hundreds of thousands of mexicans entered the country illegally to escape poor economic conditions in mexico.

the longoria incident one of the more notorious instances of prejudice against mexican americans involved the burial of felix longoria.
longoria was a mexican american war hero killed in the philippines.
the only undertaker in his texas hometown refused to provide longoria s family with funeral services.

native americans also took the initiative to improve their lives.
in 1944 they established the national congress of american indians.
the congress had two main goals 1 to ensure for native americans the same civil rights that white americans had and 2 to enable native americans on reservations to retain their own customs.
during world war ii over 65 000 native americans left their reservations for military service and war work.
as a result they became very aware of discrimination.
when the war ended native americans stopped receiving family allotments and wages.
outsiders also grabbed control of tribal lands primarily to exploit their deposits of minerals oil and timber.
the termination policy in 1953 the federal government announced that it would give up its responsibility for native american tribes.
this new approach known as the termination policy eliminated federal economic support discontinued the reservation system and distributed tribal lands among individual native americans.
in response to the termination policy the bureau of indian affairs began a voluntary relocation program to help native americans resettle in cities.
the termination policy was a dismal failure however.
although the bureau of indian affairs helped relocate 35 000 native americans to urban areas during the 1950s they were often unable to find jobs in their new locations because of poor training and racial prejudice.
they were also left without access to medical care when federal programs were abolished.
in 1963 the termination policy was abandoned.
native americans like the man above received job training from the bureau of indian affairs to help them settle in urban areas.

one american s story camella teoli was just 12 years old when she began working in a lawrence massachusetts textile mill to help support her family.
soon after she started a machine used for twisting cotton into thread tore off part of her scalp.
the young italian immigrant spent seven months in the hospital and was scarred for life.
three years later when 20 000 lawrence mill workers went on strike for higher wages camella was selected to testify before a congressional committee investigating labor conditions such as workplace safety and underage workers.
when asked why she had gone on strike camella answered simply because i didn t get enough to eat at home.
she explained how she had gone to work before reaching the legal age of 14.
a mill workers on strike in 1912 in lawrence massachusetts a personal voice camella teoli i used to go to school and then a man came up to my house and asked my father why i didnt go to work so my father says i dont know whether she is 13 or 14 years old.
so the man say you give me 4 and i will make the papers come from the old country italy saying that you are 14.
so my father gave him the 4 and in one month came the papers that i was 14.
i went to work and about two weeks later got hurt in my head.
at congressional hearings march 1912 after nine weeks of striking the mill workers won the sympathy of the nation as well as five to ten percent pay raises.
stories like camella s set off a national investigation of labor conditions and reformers across the country organized to address the problems of industrialization.
four goals of progressivism at the dawn of the new century middle class reformers addressed many of the problems that had contributed to the social upheavals of the 1890s.
journalists and writers exposed the unsafe conditions often faced by factory workers including 306 chapter 9 vocabulary temperance refraining from alcohol consumption main idea analyzing motives 4 why did the prohibition movement appeal to so many women.
women and children.
intellectuals questioned the dominant role of large corporations in american society.
political reformers struggled to make government more responsive to the people.
together these reform efforts formed the progressive movement which aimed to restore economic opportunities and correct injustices in american life.
even though reformers never completely agreed on the problems or the solutions each of their progressive efforts shared at least one of the following goals protecting social welfare promoting moral improvement creating economic reform fostering efficiency protecting social welfare many social welfare reformers worked to soften some of the harsh conditions of industrialization.
the social gospel and settlement house movements of the late 1800s which aimed to help the poor through community centers churches and social services continued during the progressive era and inspired even more reform activities.
the young men s christian association ymca for example opened libraries sponsored classes and built swimming pools and handball courts.
the salvation army fed poor people in soup kitchens cared for children in nurseries and sent slum brigades to instruct poor immigrants in middle class values of hard work and temperance.
in addition many women were inspired by the settlement houses to take action.
florence kelley became an advocate for improving the lives of women and children.
she was appointed chief inspector of factories for illinois after she had helped to win passage of the illinois factory act in 1893.
the act which prohibited child labor and limited women s working hours soon became a model for other states.
promoting moral improvement other reformers felt that morality not the workplace held the key to improving the lives of poor people.
these reformers wanted immigrants and poor city dwellers to uplift themselves by improving their personal behavior.
prohibition the banning of alcoholic beverages was one such program.
prohibitionist groups feared that alcohol was undermining american morals.
founded in cleveland in 1874 the woman s christian temperance union wctu spearheaded the crusade for prohibition.
members advanced their cause by entering saloons singing praying and urging saloonkeepers to stop selling alcohol.
as momentum grew the union was transformed by frances willard from a small midwestern religious group in 1879 to a national organization.
boasting 245 000 members by 1911 the wctu became the largest women s group in the nation s history.
wctu members followed willard s do everything slogan and began opening kindergartens for immigrants visiting inmates in prisons and asylums and working for florence kelley 1859 1932 the daughter of an antislavery republican congressman from pennsylvania florence kelley became a social reformer whose sympathies lay with the powerless especially working women and children.
during a long career kelley pushed the government to solve americas social problems.
in 1899 kelley became general secretary of the national consumers league where she lobbied to improve factory conditions.
why kelley pointedly asked while campaigning for a federal child labor law are seals bears reindeer fish wild game in the national parks buffalo and migratory birds all found suitable for federal protection but not children in the 1890s carry nation worked for prohibition by walking into saloons scolding the customers and using her hatchet to destroy bottles of liquor.
307 historical spotlight anti saloon league quietly founded by progressive women in 1895 the anti saloon league called itself the church in action against the saloon whereas early temperance efforts had asked individuals to change their ways the anti saloon league worked to pass laws to force people to change and to punish those who drank.
the anti saloon league endorsed politicians who opposed demon rum no matter which party they belonged to or where they stood on other issues.
it also organized statewide referendums to ban alcohol.
between 1900 and 1917 voters in nearly half of the states mostly in the south and the west prohibited the sale production and use of alcohol.
individual towns city wards and rural areas also voted themselves dry suffrage.
the wctu reform activities like those of the settlement house movement provided women with expanded public roles which they used to justify giving women voting rights.
sometimes efforts at prohibition led to trouble with immigrant groups.
such was the case with the anti saloon league founded in 1895.
as members sought to close saloons to cure society s problems tension arose between them and many immigrants whose customs often included the consumption of alcohol.
additionally saloons filled a number of roles within the immigrant community such as cashing paychecks and serving meals.
creating economic reform as moral reformers sought to change individual behavior a severe economic panic in 1893 prompted some americans to question the capitalist economic system.
as a result some americans especially workers embraced socialism.
labor leader eugene v debs who helped organize the american socialist party in 1901 commented on the uneven balance among big business government and ordinary people under the free market system of capitalism.
a personal voice eugene v debs competition was natural enough at one time but do you think you are competing today.
many of you think you are competing.
against whom.
against oil magnate john d rockefeller.
about as i would if i had a wheelbarrow and competed with the santa fe railroad from here to kansas city.
debs his life writings and speeches though most progressives distanced themselves from socialism they saw the truth of many of debs s criticisms.
big business often received favorable treatment from government officials and politicians and could use its economic power to limit competition.
journalists who wrote about the corrupt side of business and public life in mass circulation magazines during the early 20th century became known as muckrakers milk rak r.
the term refers to john bunyan s pilgrim s progress in which a character is so busy using a rake to clean up the muck of this world that he does not raise his eyes to heaven.
in her history of the standard oil company a monthly serial in mcclure s magazine the writer ida m tarbell described the company s cutthroat methods of eliminating competition.
mr rockefeller has systematically played with loaded dice tarbell charged and it is doubtful if there has been a time since 1872 when he has run a race with a competitor and started fair.
fostering efficiency many progressive leaders put their faith in experts and scientific principles to make society and the workplace more efficient.
in defending an oregon law that limited women factory and laundry workers to a ten hour day lawyer louis d brandeis paid little attention to legal argument.
instead he focused on data produced by social scientists documenting the high costs of long working hours for both the individual and society.
this type of argument the brandeis brief would become a model for later reform litigation within industry frederick winslow taylor began using time and motion studies to improve efficiency by breaking manufacturing tasks into simpler parts taylorism became a management fad as industry reformers applied these scientific management studies to see just how quickly each task could be performed 8 chapter 9 main idea j evaluating ey what contribution did muckrakers make to the reform movement.
main idea contrasting contrast the goals of scientific management with other progressive reforms.
however not all workers could work at the same rate and although the introduction of the assembly lines did speed up production the system required people to work like machines.
this caused a high worker turnover often due to injuries suffered by fatigued workers.
to keep automobile workers happy and to prevent strikes henry ford reduced the workday to eight hours and paid workers five dollars a day.
this incentive attracted thousands of workers but they exhausted themselves.
as one homemaker complained in a letter to henry ford in 1914 that 5 is a blessing a bigger one than you know but oh they earn it.
such efforts at improving efficiency an important part of progressivism targeted not only industry but government as well.
everybody will be able to afford a car and about everyone will have one henry ford 1909 cleaning up local government cities faced some of the most obvious social problems of the new industrial age.
in many large cities political bosses rewarded their supporters with jobs and kick backs and openly bought votes with favors and bribes.
efforts to reform city politics stemmed in part from the desire to make government more efficient and more responsive to its constituents.
but those efforts also grew from distrust of immigrants participation in politics.
reforming local government natural disasters sometimes played an important role in prompting reform of city governments.
in 1900 a hurricane and tidal wave almost demolished galveston texas.
the politicians on the city council botched the huge relief and rebuilding job so badly that the texas legislature appointed a five member commission of experts to take over.
each expert took charge of a different city department and soon galveston was rebuilt.
this success prompted the city to adopt the commission idea as a form of government and by 1917 500 cities had followed galveston s example.
another natural disaster a flood in dayton ohio in 1913 led to the widespread adoption of the council manager form of government.
staunton virginia had already pioneered this system in which people elected a city council to make laws.
the council in turn appointed a manager typically a person with training and experience in public administration to run the city s departments.
by 1925 managers were administering nearly 250 cities.
the progressive era 309 reform mayors in some cities mayors such as hazen pin8 ee.
michigan 1890 1897 and tom johnson of cleveland ohio 1901 1909 introduced progressive reforms without changing how government was organized concentrating on economics pingree instituted a fairer tax structure ow ered fares for public transportation rooted out corruption and set up a system of work relief for the unemployed.
detroit city workers built schools parks and a municipal lighting plant.
johnson was only one of 19 socialist mayors who worked to institute progressive reforms in america s cities.
in general these mayors focused on dismissing corrupt and greedy private owners of utilities such as gasworks waterworks and transit lines and converting the utilities to publicly owned enterprises.
johnson believed that citizens should play a more active role in city government.
he held meetings in a large circus tent and invited them to question officials about how the city was managed.
dj main idea summarizing how did city government change during the progressive era.
james s hogg texas governor 1891 1895 among the most colorful of the reform governors was james s hogg of texas.
hogg helped to drive illegal insurance companies from the state and championed antitrust legislation.
his chief interest however was in regulating the railroads.
he pointed out abuses in rates noting for example that it cost more to ship lumber from east texas to dallas than to ship it all the way to nebraska.
a railroad commission established largely as a result of his efforts helped increase milling and manufacturing in texas by lowering freight rates.
reform at the state level local reforms coincided with progressive efforts at the state level.
spurred by progressive governors many states passed laws to regulate railroads mines mills telephone companies and other large businesses.
reform governors under the progressive republican leadership of robert m la follette wisconsin led the way in regulating big business.
fighting bob la follette served three terms as governor before he entered the u s senate in 1906.
he explained that as governor he did not mean to smash corporations but merely to drive them out of politics and then to treat them exactly the same as other people are treated.
la follette s major target was the railroad industry.
he taxed railroad property at the same rate as other business property set up a commission to regulate rates and forbade railroads to issue free passes to state officials.
other reform governors who attacked big business interests included charles b aycock of north carolina and james s hogg of texas.
protecting working children as the number of child workers rose dramatically reformers worked to protect workers and to end child labor.
businesses hired children because they performed unskilled jobs for lower wages and because children s small hands made them more adept at handling small parts and tools.
immigrants and rural migrants often sent their children to work because they viewed their children as part of the family economy.
often wages were so low for adults that every family member needed to work to pull the family out of poverty.
in industrial settings however children were more prone to accidents caused by fatigue.
many developed serious health problems and suffered from stunted growth.
e formed in 1904 the national child labor committee sent investigators to gather evidence of children working in harsh conditions.
they then organized exhibitions with photographs and statistics to dramatize the children s plight.
they were joined by labor union members who argued that child labor lowered wages for all workers.
these groups pressured analyzing causes ej why did reformers seek to end child labor.
310 chapter 9 history through images of child labor in 1908 lewis hine quit his teaching job to document child labor practices.
hines photographs and descriptions of young laborers some only three years old were widely distributed and displayed in exhibits.
his compelling images of exploitation helped to convince the public of the need for child labor regulations.
hine devised a host of clever tactics to gain access to his subjects such as learning shop managers schedules and arriving during their lunch breaks.
while talking casually with the children he secretly scribbled notes on paper hidden in his pocket.
national politicians to pass the keating owen act in 1916.
the act prohibited the transportation across state lines of goods produced with child labor.
two years later the supreme court declared the act unconstitutional due to interference with states rights to regulate labor.
reformers did however succeed in nearly every state by effecting legislation that banned child labor and set maximum hours.
efforts to limit working hours the supreme court sometimes took a more sympathetic view of the plight of workers.
in the 1908 case of muller v oregon louis d brandeis assisted by florence kelley and josephine goldmark persuasively argued that poor working women were much more economically insecure than large corporations.
asserting that women required the state s protection against powerful employers brandeis convinced the court to uphold an oregon law limiting women to a ten hour workday.
other states responded by enacting or strengthening laws to reduce womens hours of work.
a similar brandeis brief in bunting v oregon in 1917 persuaded the court to uphold a ten hour workday for men.
progressives also succeeded in winning workers compensation to aid the families of workers who were hurt or killed on the job.
beginning with maryland in 1902 one state after another passed legislation requiring employers to pay benefits in death cases.
the progressive era 311 reforming elections in some cases ordinary citizens won state reforms.
william s u ren prompted his state of oregon to adopt the secret ballot the initiative the referendum and the recall.
the initiative allows voters to put a proposed law on the ballot for public approval.
then voters instead of the legislature accepted or rejected the initiative by referendum a vote on the initiative.
the recall enabled voters to remove public officials from elected positions by forcing them to face another election before the end of their term if enough voters asked for it.
by 1920 20 states had adopted at least one of these procedures.
in 1899 minnesota passed the first mandatory statewide primary system.
this enabled voters instead of political machines to choose candidates for public office through a special popular election.
about two thirds of the states had adopted some form of direct primary by 1915.
direct election of senators it was the success of the direct primary that paved the way for the seventeenth amendment to the constitution.
before 1913 each state s legislature had chosen its own united states senators which put even more power in the hands of party bosses and wealthy corporation heads.
to force senators to be more responsive to the public progressives pushed for the popular election of senators.
at first the senate refused to go along with the idea but gradually more and more states began allowing voters to nominate senatorial candidates in direct primaries.
as a result congress approved the seventeenth amendment in 1912.
its ratification in 1913 made direct election of senators the law of the land j each of these measures was designed to make politicians more accountable to voters and to give americans more of a voice.
as a whole they have become powerful tools with which voters can influence public policy.
additionally government reform drew increased numbers of women into public life.
it also focused renewed attention on the issue of woman suffrage.

in 1879 susette la flesche a young omaha woman traveled east to translate into english the sad words of chief standing bear whose ponca people had been forcibly removed from their homeland in nebraska.
later she was invited with chief standing bear to go on a lecture tour to draw attention to the ponca s situation.
a personal voice susette la flesche we are thinking men and women.
we have a right to be heard in whatever concerns us.
your government has driven us hither and thither like cattle.
your government has no right to say to us go here or go there and if we show any reluctance to force us to do its will at the point of the bayonet.
do you wonder that the indian feels outraged by such treatment and retaliates although it will end in death to himself quoted in bright eyes susette la flesche la flesche testified before congressional committees and helped win passage of the dawes act of 1887 which allowed individual native americans to claim reservation land and citizenship rights.
her activism was an example of a new role for american women who were expanding their participation in public life.
women in the work force before the civil war married middle class women were generally expected to devote their time to the care of their homes and families.
by the late 19th century however only middle class and upper class women could afford to do so.
poorer women usually had no choice but to work for wages outside the home.
farm women on farms in the south and the midwest women s roles had not changed substantially since the previous century.
in addition to household tasks such as cooking making clothes and laundering farm women handled a host of other chores such as raising livestock.
often the women had to help plow and plant the fields and harvest the crops.
women in industry as better paying opportunities became available in towns and especially cities women had new options for finding jobs even though men s labor unions excluded them from membership.
at the turn of the century the progressive era 313 sow thety telephone operators manually connect phone calls in 1915 i i telephone operators today when americans use the telephone an automated voice often greets them with instructions about which buttons to press.
in the 19th century every telephone call had to be handled by a telephone operator a person who connected wires through a switchboard.
young men the first telephone operators proved unsatisfactory.
patrons complained that the male operators used profane language and talked back to callers.
women soon largely replaced men as telephone operators and were willing to accept the ten do i lar weekly wage.
department stores advertised shopping by telephone as a convenience.
one ad in the chicago telephone book of 1904 declared every telephone order inquiry or request will be quickly and intelligently cared for the ad pictured a line of female telephone operators.
one out of five american women held jobs 25 percent of them worked in manufacturing.
the garment trade claimed about half of all women industrial workers.
they typically held the least skilled positions however and received only about half as much money as their male counterparts or less.
many of these women were single and were assumed to be supporting only themselves while men were assumed to be supporting families.
women also began to fill new jobs in offices stores and classrooms.
these jobs required a high school education and by 1890 women high school graduates outnumbered men.
moreover new business schools were preparing bookkeepers and stenographers as well as training female typists to operate the new machines.
ay domestic workers many women without formal education or industrial skills contributed to the economic survival of their families by doing domestic work such as cleaning for other families.
after almost 2 million african american women were freed from slavery poverty quickly drove nearly half of them into the work force.
they worked on farms and as domestic workers and migrated by the thousands to big cities for jobs as cooks laundresses scrubwomen and maids.
altogether roughly 70 percent of women employed in 1870 were servants.
unmarried immigrant women also did domestic labor especially when they first arrived in the united states.
many married immigrant women contributed to the family income by taking in piecework or caring for boarders at home.
main idea analyzing causes what kinds of job opportunities prompted more women to complete high school.
women lead reform dangerous conditions low wages and long hours led many female industrial workers to push for reforms.
their ranks grew after 146 workers mostly jewish and italian immigrant girls died in a 1911 fire in the triangle shirtwaist factory in new york city.
middle and upper class women also entered the public sphere.
by 1910 women s clubs at which these women discussed art or literature were nearly half a million strong.
these clubs sometimes grew into reform groups that addressed issues such as temperance or child labor.
women in higher education many of the women who became active in public life in the late 19th century had attended the new women s colleges.
vassar 314 chapter 9 main idea analyzing effects what social and economic effects did higher education have on women.
college with a faculty of 8 men and 22 women accepted its first students in 1865.
smith and wellesley colleges followed in 1875.
though columbia brown and harvard colleges refused to admit women each university established a separate college for women.
although women were still expected to fulfill traditional domestic roles women s colleges sought to grant women an excellent education.
in her will smith college s founder sophia smith made her goals clear.
a personal voice sophia smith it is my desire to furnish for my own sex means and facilities for education equal to those which are afforded now in our college to young men.
it is not my design to render my sex any the less feminine but to develop as fully as may be the powers of womanhood furnish women with means of usefulness happiness honor now withheld from them.
quoted in alma mater by the late 19th century marriage was no longer a woman s only alternative.
many women entered the work force or sought higher education.
in fact almost half of college educated women in the late 19th century never married retaining their own independence.
many of these educated women began to apply their skills to needed social reforms.
women and reform uneducated laborers started efforts to reform workplace health and safety.
the participation of educated women often strengthened existing reform groups and provided leadership for new ones.
because women were not allowed to vote or run for office women reformers strove to improve conditions at work and home.
their social housekeeping targeted workplace reform housing reform educational improvement and food and drug laws.
in 1896 african american women founded the national association of colored women or nacw by merging two earlier organizations.
josephine ruffin identified the mission of the african american women s club movement as the moral education of the race with which we are identified.
the nacw managed nurseries reading rooms and kindergartens.
after the seneca falls convention of 1848 women split over the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments which granted equal rights including the right to vote to african american men but excluded women.
susan b anthony a leading proponent of woman suffrage the right to vote said i would sooner cut off my right hand than ask the ballot for the black man and not for women.
in 1869 anthony and elizabeth cady stanton had founded the national women suffrage association nwsa which united with another group in 1890 to suffragists recruit supporters for a march.
become the national american woman suffrage association or nawsa.
other prominent leaders included lucy stone and julia ward howe the author of the battle hymn of the republic.
woman suffrage faced constant opposition.
the liquor industry feared that women would vote in support of prohibition while the textile industry worried that women would vote for restrictions on child labor.
many men simply feared the changing role of women in society.
a three part strategy for suffrage suffragist leaders tried three approaches to achieve their objective.
first they tried to convince state legislatures to grant women the right to vote.
they achieved a victory in the territory of wyoming in 1869 and by the 1890s utah colorado and idaho had also granted voting rights to women.
after 1896 efforts in other states failed.
second women pursued court cases to test the fourteenth amendment which declared that states denying their male citizens the right to vote would lose congressional representation.
weren t women citizens too.
in 1871 and 1872 susan b anthony and other women tested that question by attempting to vote at least 150 times in ten states and the district of columbia.
the supreme court ruled in 1875 that women were indeed citizens but then denied that citizenship automatically conferred the right to vote.
third women pushed for a national constitutional amendment to grant women the vote.

when muckraking journalist upton sinclair began research for a novel in 1904 his focus was the human condition in the stock yards of chicago.
sinclair intended his novel to reveal the breaking of human hearts by a system that exploits the labor of men and women for profits.
what most shocked readers in sinclair s book the jungle 1906 however was the sickening conditions of the meatpacking industry.
a personal voice upton sinclair there would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor in the dirt and sawdust where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption tuberculosis germs.
there would be meat stored in great piles in rooms.
and thousands of rats would race about on it.
a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.
these rats were nuisances and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them they would die and then rats bread and meat would go into the hoppers together.

the young president soon met several challenges to his assertion of federal power.
trustbusting by 1900 trusts legal bodies created to hold stock in many companies controlled about four fifths of the industries in the united states.
some trusts like standard oil had earned poor reputations with the public by the use of unfair business practices.
many trusts lowered their prices to drive competitors out of the market and then took advantage of the lack of competition to jack prices up even higher.
although congress had passed the sherman antitrust act in 1890 the act s vague language made enforcement difficult.
as a result nearly all the suits filed against the trusts under the sherman act were ineffective.
president roosevelt did not believe that all trusts were harmful but he sought to curb the actions of those that hurt the public interest.
the president concentrated his efforts on filing suits under the sherman antitrust act.
in 1902 roosevelt made newspaper headlines as a trustbuster when he ordered the justice department to sue the northern securities company which had established a monopoly over northwestern railroads.
in 1904 the supreme court dissolved the company.
although the roosevelt administration filed 44 antitrust suits winning a number of them and breaking up some of the trusts it was unable to slow the merger movement in business.

analyzing 71 the lion tamer the progressive era 319 coal strike when 140 000 coal miners in pennsylvania went on strike and demanded a 20 percent raise a nine hour workday and the right to organize a union the mine operators refused to bargain.
five months into t e stn e coa reserves ran low.
roosevelt seeing the need to intervene called hot si es o e white house to talk and eventually settled the strike.
irked by the extraor mary stupidity and bad temper of the mine operators he later confessed that only the dignity of the presidency had kept him from taking one owner by the seat of t e breeches and tossing him out of the window.
faced with roosevelt s threat to take over the mines the opposing sides finally agreed to submit their differences to an arbitration commission a third party that would work with both sides to mediate the dispute.
in 1903 the commission issued its compromise settlement.
the miners won a 10 percent pay hike and a shorter nine hour workday.
with this however they had to give up their demand for a closed shop in which all workers must belong to the union and their right to strike during the next three years.

an orderiy way with the help of experts such as those on the arbitra theodore roosevelt tion commission.
jep railroad regulation roosevelt s real goal was federal regulation.
in 1887 congress had passed the interstate commerce act which prohibited wealthy railroad owners from colluding to fix high prices by dividing the business in a given area.
the interstate commerce commission icc was set up to enforce the new law but had little power.
with roosevelt s urging congress passed the elkins act in 1903 which made it illegal for railroad officials to give and shippers to receive rebates for using particular railroads.
the act also specified that railroads could not change set rates without notifying the public.
the hepburn act of 1906 strictly limited the distribution of free railroad passes a common form of bribery.
it also gave the icc power to set maximum railroad rates.
although roosevelt had to compromise with conservative senators who opposed the act its passage boosted the government s power to regulate the railroads.
main idea analyzing effects what was significant about the way the 1902 coal strike was settled.
vocabulary collude to act together secretly to achieve an illegal or deceitful purpose health and the environment president roosevelt s enthusiasm and his considerable skill at compromise led to laws and policies that benefited both public health and the environment.
he wrote we recognize and are bound to war against the evils of today.
the remedies are partly economic and partly spiritual partly to be obtained by laws and in greater part to be obtained by individual and associated effort.
regulating foods and drugs after reading the jungle by upton sinclair roosevelt responded to the public s clamor for action.
he appointed a commission of experts to investigate the meatpacking industry.
the commission issued a scathing report backing up sinclair s account of the disgusting conditions in the industry.
true to his word in 1906 roosevelt pushed for passage of the meat inspection act which dictated strict cleanliness requirements for meatpacken and created the program of federal meat inspection that was in use until it wa replaced by more sophisticated techniques in the 1990s.
the compromise that won the act s passage however left the government paying for the inspections and did not require companies to label their cannec goods with date of processing information.
the compromise also granted meat packers the right to appeal negative decisions in court.
0 chapter 9 government workers inspect meat as it moves through the packinghouse.
a typical late 19th century product advertisement.
pure food and drug act before any federal regulations were established for advertising food and drugs manufacturers had claimed that their products accomplished everything from curing cancer to growing hair.
in addition popular children s medicines often contained opium cocaine or alcohol.
in response to concerns about these practices as well as the harmful preservatives that manufacturers added to food congress passed the pure food and drug act in 1906 which halted the sale of contaminated foods and medicines and called for truth in labeling.
although this act did not ban harmful products outright its requirement of truthful labels reflected the progressive belief that given accurate information people would act wisely.
along with the meat inspection act the pure food and drug act reflects the continuation of the changing relationship between the federal government and private businesses during this period.
this act marks the first general pure food and drug law at the federal level.
the government s bureau of chemistry which later became the food and drug administration took responsibility for enforcement of the law.
unfortunately enforcement met with mixed results.
on the whole the law helped to protect consumers by improving product standards and reducing confusion about the benefits and dangers of various products.
however some critics point out that the law reduced marketplace competition by forcing out smaller producers.
also efforts to regulate the patent medicine industry were largely unsuccessful until new legislation was passed in 1938.
conservation and natural resources before roosevelt s presidency the federal government had paid very little attention to the nation s natural resources.
in 1872 yellowstone national park was established as the country s first national park and the u s forest bureau was formed in 1887.
the government also set aside 45 million acres of timberlands for a national forest reserve.
despite such measures the government mostly stood by while private interests gobbled up the shrinking wilderness.
main idea comparing what similarities did the meat inspection act and pure food and drug act share.
chapter 9 in the late 19th century americans had shortsightedly exploited their natural environment.
pioneer farmers leveled the forests and plowed up the prairies.
ranchers allowed their cattle to overgraze the great plains.
coal companies cluttered the land with refuse from mines.
lumber companies ignored the effect of their logging operations on flood control and neglected to plant trees to replace those they had cut down.
cities dumped untreated sewage and industrial wastes into rivers poisoning the streams and creating health hazards.
conservation measures roosevelt condemned the view that america s resources were endless and made conservation a primary concern.
john muir a naturalist and writer with whom roosevelt camped in california s yosemite national park in 1903 persuaded the president to set aside 148 million acres of forest reserves.
roosevelt also set aside 1 5 million acres of water power sites and another 80 million acres of land that experts from the u s geological survey would explore for mineral and water resources.
roosevelt also established more than 50 wildlife sanctuaries and several national parks.
true to the progressive belief in using experts in 1905 the president named gifford pinchot as head of the u s forest service.
a professional conservationist pinchot had administrative skill as well as the latest scientific and technical information.
he advised roosevelt to conserve forest and grazing lands by keeping large tracts of federal land exempt from private sale.
conservationists like roosevelt and pinchot however did not share the views of muir who advocated complete preservation of the wilderness.
instead conservation to them meant that some wilderness areas would be preserved while others would be developed for the common good.
indeed roosevelt s federal water projects transformed some dry wilderness areas to make agriculture possible.

2 human environment interaction describe the effects of roosevelts conservation efforts o and the impact he had on the environment.
the progressive era historical spotlight act money from the sale of public lands in the west funded large scale irrigation projects such as the roosevelt dam in arizona and the shoshone dam in wyoming.
the newlands act established the precedent that the federal government would manage the precious water resources of the west.
roosevelt and civil rights main idea summarizing summarize roosevelts approach to environmental problems.
yosemite national park the naturalist john muir visited the yosemite region of central california in 1868 and made it his home base for a period of six years while he traveled throughout the west.
muir was the first to suggest that yosemites spectacular land formations had been shaped by glaciers.
today the parks impressive cliffs waterfalls lakes and meadows draw sports enthusiasts and tourists in all seasons.
roosevelt s concern for the land and its inhabitants was not matched in the area of civil rights.
though roosevelt s father had supported the north his mother martha may well have been the model for the southern belle scarlett o hara in margaret mitchell s famous novel gone with the wind.
in almost two terms as president roosevelt like most other progressives failed to support civil rights for african americans.
he did however support a few individual african americans.
despite opposition from whites roosevelt appointed an african american as head of the charleston south carolina customhouse.
in another instance when some whites in mississippi refused to accept the black postmistress he had appointed he chose to close the station rather than give in.
in 1906 however roosevelt angered many african americans when he dismissed without question an entire regiment of african american soldiers accused of conspiracy in protecting others charged with murder in brownsville texas.
as a symbolic gesture roosevelt invited booker t washington to dinner at the white house.
washington head of the tuskegee normal and industrial institute an all black training school was then the african american leader most respected by powerful whites.
washington faced opposition however from other african civil rights leaders gather at the 1905 niagara falls conference.

persistent in his criticism of washington s ideas du bois renewed his demands for immediate social and economic equality for african americans.
in his 1903 book the souls of black folk du bois wrote of his opposition to washington s position.
a personal voice w e b du bois so far as mr washington preaches thrift patience and industrial training for the masses we must hold up his hands and strive with him.
but so far as mr washington apologizes for injustice north or south does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting belittles the emasculating effects of caste distinctions and opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds so far as he the south or the nation does this we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.
the souls of black folk du bois and other advocates of equality for african americans were deeply upset by the apparent progressive indifference to racial injustice.
in 1905 they held a civil rights conference in niagara falls and in 1909 a number of african americans joined with prominent white reformers in new york to found the naacp the national association for the advancement of colored people.
the naacp which had over 6 000 members by 1914 aimed for nothing less than full equality among the races.
that goal however found little support in the progressive movement which focused on the needs of middle class whites.
the two presidents who followed roosevelt also did little to advance the goal of racial equality.

ironically du bois had retreated to a position others saw as dangerously close to that of booker t washington.
arguing for a separate economy for african americans du bois made a distinction which white rejected between enforced and voluntary segregation.
by mid century du bois was outside the mainstream of the civil rights movement.
his work remained largely ignored until after his death in 1963 i t i i 1.

coined by president theodore roosevelt the term muckraker alludes to the english author john bunyan s famous 17th century religious allegory the pilgrim s progress which features a character too busy raking up the muck to see a heavenly crown held over him.
the originally negative term soon was applied to many writers whose reform efforts roosevelt himself supported.
the muckraking movement spilled over from journalism as writers such as upton sinclair made use of the greater dramatic effects of fiction.
ida m tarbell ida m tarbells the history of the standard oil company exposed the ruthlessness with which john d rockefeller had turned his oil business into an all powerful monopoly.
her writing added force to the trustbusting reforms of the early 20th century.
here tarbell describes how standard oil used lower transportation rates to drive out smaller refineries such as hanna baslington and company.
mr hanna had been refining since july 1869.
some time in february 1872 the standard oil company asked for an interview with him and his associates.
they wanted to buy his works they said.
but we don t want to sell objected mr hanna.
you can never make any more money in my judgment said mr rockefeller.
you can t compete with the standard.
we have all the large refineries now.
if you refuse to sell it will end in your being crushed.
hanna and baslington were not satisfied.
they went to see.
general devereux manager of the lake shore road.
they were told that the standard had special rates that it was useless to try to compete with them.
general devereux explained to the gentlemen that the privileges granted the standard were the legitimate and necessary advantage of the larger shipper over the smaller general devereux says they recognised the propriety of his excuse.
they certainly recognised its authority.
they say that they were satisfied they could no longer get rates to and from cleveland which would enable them to live and reluctantly sold out.
it must have been reluctantly for they had paid 75 000 for their works and had made thirty per cent a year on an average on their investment and the standard appraiser allowed them 45 000.

below is a section from an article steffens wrote to expose voter fraud in philadelphia.
the police are forbidden by law to stand within thirty feet of the polls but they are at the box and they are there to see that the republican political machine s orders are obeyed and that repeaters whom they help to furnish are permitted to vote without intimidation on the names they the police have supplied.
the editor of an anti machine paper who was looking about for himself once told me that a ward leader who knew him well asked him into a polling place.
i ll show you how it s done he said and he had the repeaters go round and round voting again and again on the names handed them on slips.
the business proceeds with very few hitches there is more jesting than fighting.
violence in the past has had its effect and is not often necessary nowadays but if it is needed the police are there to apply it.
lincoln steffens the shame of the cities 1904 upton sinclair upton sinclairs chief aim in writing the jungle was to expose the shocking conditions that immigrant workers endured.
the public however reacted even more strongly to the novels revelations of unsanitary conditions in the meatpacking industry.
serialized in 1905 and published in book form one year later the jungle prompted a federal investigation that resulted in passage of the meat inspection act in 1906.
jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour and how they would rub it up with baking soda to take away the smell and sell it to be eaten on free lunch counters also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed giving to any sort of meat fresh or salted whole or chopped any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.

early in the 20th century americans interest in the preservation of the country s wilderness areas intensified.
writers proclaimed the beauty of the landscape and new groups like the girl scouts gave city children the chance to experience a different environment.
the desire for preservation clashed with business interests that favored unrestricted development.
gifford pinchot pin shcf head of the u s forest service under president roosevelt took a middle ground.
he believed that wilderness areas could be scientifically managed to yield public enjoyment while allowing private development.
a personal voice gifford pinchot 66 the american people have evidently made up their minds that our natural resources must be conserved.
that is good.
but it settles only half the question.
for whose benefit shall they be conserved for the benefit of the many or for the use and profit of the few.
there is no other question before us that begins to be so important or that will be so difficult to straddle as the great question between special interest and equal opportunity between the privileges of the few and the rights of the many between government by men for human welfare and government by money for profit.
the fight for conservation president roosevelt a fellow conservationist favored pinchot s multi use land program.
however when he left office in 1909 this approach came under increasing pressure from business people who favored unrestricted commercial development.
gifford pinchot taft becomes president after winning the election in 1904 roosevelt pledged not to run for reelection in 1908.

he received little credit for his accomplishments however.
his legal victories such as busting 90 trusts in a four year term did not bolster his popularity.
indeed the new president confessed in a letter to roosevelt that he never felt like the president.
when i am addressed as mr.
president taft wrote i turn to see whether you are not at my elbow.
the cautious taft hesitated to use the presidential bully pulpit to arouse public opinion.
nor could he subdue troublesome members of his own party.
tariffs and conservation posed his first problems.
the payne aldrich tariff taft had campaigned on a platform of lowering tariffs a staple of the progressive agenda.
when the house passed the payne bill which lowered rates on imported manufactured goods the senate proposed an alternative bill the aldrich bill which made fewer cuts and increased many rates.
amid cries of betrayal from the progressive wing of his party taft signed the payne aldrich tariff a compromise that only moderated the high rates of the aldrich bill.
this angered progressives who believed taft had abandoned progressivism.
the president made his difficulties worse by clumsily attempting to defend the tariff calling it the best tariff bill the republican party ever passed.
difficult pkcisions controlling resources historically conservationists such as gifford pinchot have stood for the balanced use of natural resources preserving some and using others for private industry.

main idea analyzing issues how did tafts appointee richard ballinger anger conservationists.
disputing public lands next taft angered conservationists by appointing as his secretary of the interior richard a ballinger a wealthy lawyer from seattle.
ballinger who disapproved of conservationist controls on western lands removed 1 million acres of forest and mining lands from the reserved list and returned it to the public domain.
when a department of the interior official was fired for protesting ballinger s actions the fired worker published a muckraking article against ballinger in collier s weekly magazine.
pinchot added his voice.
in congressional testimony he accused ballinger of letting commercial interests exploit the natural resources that rightfully belonged to the public.
president taft sided with ballinger and fired pinchot from the u s forest service.
the republican party splits taft s cautious nature made it impossible for him to hold together the two wings of the republican party progressives who sought change and conservatives who did not.
the republican party began to fragment.
problems within the party republican conservatives and progressives split over taft s support of the political boss joseph cannon house speaker from illinois.
a rough talking tobacco chewing politician uncle joe often disregarded seniority in filling committee slots.
as chairman of the house rules committee which decides what bills congress considers cannon often weak ened or ignored progressive bills.
reform minded republicans decided that their only alternative was to strip cannon of his power.
with the help of democrats they succeeded in march 1910 with a resolution that called for the entire house to elect the committee on rules and excluded the speaker from membership in the committee.

as chief justice taft wrote that in my present life i dont remember that i ever was president however americans remember taft for among many other things initiating in 1910 the popular presidential custom of throwing out the first ball of the major league baseball season.
by the midterm elections of 1910 however the republican party was in shambles with the progressives on one side and the old guard on the other.
voters voiced concern over the rising cost of living which they blamed on the payne aldrich tariff.
they also believed taft to be against conservation.
when the republicans lost the election the democrats gained control of the house of representatives for the first time in 18 years.
the bull moose party after leaving office roosevelt headed to africa to shoot big game.
he returned in 1910 to a hero s welcome and responded with a rousing speech proposing a new nationalism under which the federal government would exert its power for the welfare of the people.
by 1912 roosevelt had decided to run for a third term as president.
the primary elections showed that republicans wanted roosevelt but taft had the advantage of being the incumbent that is the holder of the office.
at the republican convention in june 1912 taft supporters maneuvered to replace roosevelt delegates with taft delegates in a number of delegations.
republican progressives refused to vote and formed a new third party the progressive party.
they nominated roosevelt for president.
the progressive party became known as the bull moose party after roosevelt s boast that he was as strong as a bull moose.

one american sstory.
on march 3 1913 the day of woodrow wilson s inauguration 5 000 woman suffragists marched through hostile crowds in washington d c alice paul and lucy burns the parade s organizers were members of the national american woman suffrage association nawsa.
as police failed to restrain the rowdy gathering and congressmen demanded an investigation paul and burns could see the momentum building for suffrage.
by the time wilson began his campaign for a second term in 1916 the nawsa s president carrie chapman catt saw victory on the horizon.
catt expressed her optimism in a letter to her friend maud wood park.
a personal voice carrie chapman catt i do feel keenly that the turn of the road has come.
i really believe that we might pull off a campaign which would mean the vote within the next six years if we could secure a board of officers who would have sufficient momentum confidence and working power in them.

letter to maud wood park monetary policy federal reserve system nineteenth amendment carrie chapman catt catt called an emergency suffrage convention in september 1916 and invited president wilson who cautiously supported suffrage.
he told the convention there has been a force behind you that will be triumphant and for which you can afford.
to wait they did have to wait but within four years the passage of the suffrage amendment became the capstone of the progressive movement.
chapter 9 wilson wins financial reforms like theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson claimed progressive ideals but he had a different idea for the federal government.
he believed in attacking large concentrations of power to give greater freedom to average citizens.
as president wilson moved to enact his program the new freedom and planned his attack on what he called the triple wall of privilege the trusts tariffs and high finance vocabulary injunction a court order prohibiting a party from a specific course of action main idea summarizing what was the impact of the two antitrust measures.
wilsons background wilson grew up in the south during the civil war and reconstruction.
the son of a presbyterian minister he received a strict upbringing.
before entering politics wilson worked as a lawyer a history professor and later as president of princeton university.
in 1910 he became governor of new jersey where he supported progressive legislation such as a direct primary workers compensation and the regulation of public utilities and railroads.
two key antitrust measures without the watchful.
resolute interference of the government wilson said there can be no fair play between individuals and such powerful institutions as the trusts.
freedom today is something more than being let alone.
during wilsons administration congress enacted two key antitrust measures.
the first the clayton antitrust act of 1914 sought to strengthen the sherman antitrust act of 1890.
the clayton act prohibited corporations from acquiring the stock of another if doing so would create a monopoly if a company violated the law its officers could be prosecuted.
the clayton act also specified that labor unions and farm organizations not only had a right to exist but also would no longer be subject to antitrust laws.
therefore strikes peaceful picketing boycotts and the collection of strike benefits became legal.
in addition injunctions against strikers were prohibited unless the strikers threatened damage that could not be remedied.
samuel gompers president of the american federation of labor afl saw great value to workers in the clayton act.
he called it a magna carta for labor referring to the english document signed in 1215 in which the english king recognized that he was bound by the law and that the law granted rights to his subjects.
the second major antitrust measure the federal trade commission act of 1914 set up the federal trade commission ftc.
this watchdog agency was given the power to investigate possible violations of regulatory statutes to require periodic reports from corporations and to put an end to a number of unfair business practices.
under wilson the ftc administered almost 400 cease and desist orders to companies engaged in illegal activity.
critics of antitrust laws contend that the federal government should not regulate private businesses.
they argue that such regulation punishes the businesses that have been most successful in outperforming their competition leading to inefficiency.
they believe such regulation also needlessly consumes government resources.
supporters argue that such regulation is necessary to ensure that markets stay competitive.
a new tax system in an effort to curb the power of big business wilson worked to lower tariff rates knowing that supporters of big business hadnt allowed such a reduction under taft.
wilson lobbied hard in 1913 for the underwood act which would substantially reduce tariff rates for the first time since the civil war.
he summoned congress to a special session to plead his case and established a precedent of delivering the state of the union message in person.
businesses lobbied too looking to block tariff reductions.
when manufacturing lobbyists people hired by manufacturers to present their case to government officials descended on the capital to urge senators to vote no passage seemed unlikely.
wilson denounced the lobbyists and urged voters to monitor their senators votes.
because of the new president s use of the bully pulpit the senate voted to cut tariff rates even more deeply than the house had done.
sow thefr deregulation in recent years the railroad airline and telecommunications industries have all been deregulated or permitted to compete without government control.
it is hoped that this will improve their efficiency and lower prices.
during the progressive era reformers viewed regulation as a necessary role of government to ensure safety and fairness for consumers as well as industrial competitors.
opponents of regulation however believed that government regulation caused inefficiency and high prices.
modern critics of deregulation argue that deregulated businesses may skimp on safety.
they may also neglect hard to serve populations such as elderly poor or disabled people while competing for more profitable customers.
the progressive era 333 revenue from individual federal income tax 1915 1995 total sources historical statistics of the united states statistical abstract of the united states 1987 1995 1999 skillbuilder interpreting graphs 1.
about what year did income tax revenues first begin to rise sharply.
about how much revenue did the income tax bring in 1995.
federal income tax with lower tariff rates the federal government had to replace the revenue that tariffs had previously supplied.
ratified in 1913 the sixteenth amendment legalized a federal income tax which provided revenue by taxing individual earnings and corporate profits.
under this graduated tax larger incomes were taxed at higher rates than smaller incomes.
the tax began with a modest tax on family incomes over 4 000 and ranged from 1 percent to a maximum of 6 percent on incomes over 500 000.
initially few congressmen realized the potential of the income tax but by 1917 the government was receiving more money on the income tax than it had ever gained from tariffs.
today income taxes on corporations and individuals represent the federal governments main source of revenue.
federal reserve system next wilson turned his attention to financial reform.
the nation needed a way to strengthen the ways in which banks were run as well as a way to quickly adjust the amount of money in circulation.
both credit availability and money supply had to keep pace with the economy.
wilson s solution was to establish a decentralized private banking system under federal control.
the federal reserve act of 1913 divided the nation into 12 districts and established a central bank in each district.
these banker s banks then served the other banks within the district.
the federal reserve banks could issue new paper currency in emergency situations and member banks could use the new currency to make loans to their customers.
federal reserve banks could transfer funds to member banks in trouble saving the banks from closing and protecting customers savings.
this marked the emergence of monetary policy in which changes are made to the money supply in order to influence the economy.
by 1923 roughly 70 percent of the nation s banking resources were part of the federal reserve system.
one of wilson s most enduring achievements this system still serves as the basis of the nation s banking system.
women win suffrage while wilson pushed hard for reform of trusts tariffs and banking determined women intensified their push for the vote.
the educated native born middle class women who had been active in progressive movements had grown increasingly impatient about not being allowed to vote.
as of 1910 women had federal voting rights only in wyoming utah colorado washington and idaho.
determined suffragists pushed on however.
they finally saw success come within reach as a result of three developments the increased activism of local groups the use of bold new strategies to build enthusiasm for the movement and the rebirth of the national movement under carrie chapman catt.
local suffrage battles the suffrage movement was given new strength by growing numbers of college educated women.
two massachusetts organiza tions the boston equal suffrage association for good government and the college equal suffrage league used door to door campaigns to reach potential main idea evaluating why were tariff reform and the federal reserve system important.

vocabulary appease pacify by granting concessions supporters.
founded by radcliffe graduate maud wood park the boston group spread the message of suffrage to poor and working class women.
members also took trolley tours where at each stop crowds would gather to watch the unusual sight of a woman speaking in public.
many wealthy young women who visited europe as part of their education became involved in the suffrage movement in britain.
led by emmeline pankhurst british suffragists used increasingly bold tactics such as heckling government officials to advance their cause.
inspired by their activism american women returned to the united states armed with similar approaches in their own campaigns for suffrage.
catt and the national movement susan b anthony s successor as president of nawsa was carrie chapman catt who served from 1900 to 1904 and resumed the presidency in 1915.
when catt returned to nawsa after organizing new york s women suffrage party she concentrated on five tactics 1 painstaking organization 2 close ties between local state and national workers 3 establishing a wide base of support 4 cautious lobbying and 5 gracious ladylike behavior.
although suffragists saw victories the greater number of failures led some suffragists to try more radical tactics.
lucy burns and alice paul formed their own more radical organization the congressional union and its successor the national woman s party.
they pressured the federal government to pass a suffrage amendment and by 1917 paul had organized her followers to mount a round the clock picket line around the white house.
some of the picketed were arrested jailed and even force fed when they attempted a hunger strike.
these efforts and america s involvement in world war i finally made suffrage inevitable.
patriotic american women who headed committees knitted socks for soldiers and sold liberty bonds now claimed their overdue reward for supporting the war effort.
in 1919 congress passed the nineteenth amendment granting women the right to vote.
the amendment won final ratification in august 1920 72 years after women had first convened and demanded the vote at the seneca falls convention in 1848.
the limits of progressivism despite wilson s economic and political reforms he disappointed progressives who favored social reform.
in particular on racial matters wilson s southern prejudices led him to appease conservative southern democratic voters but disappoint his northern white and black supporters.
he placed segregationists in charge of federal agencies thereby expanding racial segregation in the federal government the military and washington d c wilson and civil rights like roosevelt and taft wilson retreated on civil rights once in office.
during the presidential campaign of 1912 he won the support of the naacp s black intellectuals and white liberals by promising to treat blacks equally and to speak out against lynching.
emmeline pankhurst american women struggling for suffrage received valuable tutoring from their english counterparts whose bold maneuvers had captured media coverage.
the noted british suffragist emmeline pankhurst who helped found the national womens social and political union often engaged in radical tactics.
pankhurst and other suffragists staged parades organized protest meetings endured hunger strikes heckled candidates for parliament and spat on policemen who tried to quiet them.
they were often imprisoned for their activities before parliament granted them the right to vote in 1928.
the progressive era 335 history through architecture from splendor to simplicity the progressive movement which influenced numerous aspects of society also impacted the world of american architecture.
one of the most prominent architects of the time was frank lloyd wright who studied under the renowned designer louis sullivan.
in the spirit of progressivism wright sought to design buildings that were orderly efficient and in harmony with the world around them.
architecture of the gilded age featured ornate decoration and detail as seen here in this victorian style house built between 1884 and 1886.
wright rejected these showy and decorative styles in favor of more simplistic designs.
wright s prairie style design features a low horizontal and well defined structure made predominantly of wood concrete brick and other simple materials.
shown here is the robie house 1909 one of wright s most famous prairie style structures which incorporates these architectural qualities.

as president however wilson opposed federal antilynching legislation arguing that these crimes fell under state jurisdiction.
in addition the capitol and the federal offices in washington d c which had been desegregated during reconstruction resumed the practice of segregation shortly after wilson s election.
wilson appointed to his cabinet fellow white southerners who extended segregation.
secretary of the navy josephus daniels for example proposed at a cabinet meeting to do away with common drinking fountains and towels in his department.
according to an entry in daniels s diary president wilson agreed because he had made no promises in particular to negroes except to do them justice.
segregated facilities in the president s mind were just.
african americans and their liberal white supporters in the naacp felt betrayed.
oswald garrison villard a grandson of the abolitionist william lloyd garrison wrote to wilson in dismay the colored men who voted and worked for you in the belief that their status as american citizens was safe in your hands are deeply cast down.
wilson s response that he had acted in the interest of the negroes and with the approval of some of the most influential negroes i know only widened the rift between the president and some of his former supporters 336 chapter 9 on november 12 1914 the president s reception of an african american delegation brought the confrontation to a bitter climax.
william monroe trotter editor in chief of the guardian an african american boston newspaper led the delegation.
trotter complained that african americans from 38 states had asked the president to reverse the segregation of government employees but that segregation had since increased.
trotter then commented on wilson s inaction.
a personal voice william monroe trotter only two years ago you were heralded as perhaps the second lincoln and now the afro american leaders who supported you are hounded as false leaders and traitors to their race.

across the elbe the americans spotted soviet soldiers who signaled for them to cross over.
when the americans reached the opposite bank their joy turned to shock.
they saw to their horror that the bank was covered with dead civilians victims of bombing raids.
a personal voice joseph polowsky 66 here we are tremendously exhilarated and theres a sea of dead.
the platoon leader was much moved.
he said joe lets make a resolution with these russians here and also the ones on the bank this would be an important day in the lives of the two countries.

these differences created a climate of icy tension that plunged the two countries into a bitter rivalry.
602 chapter 18 i main idea analyzing causes what caused the tension between the soviet union and the united states after the war.
under soviet communism the state controlled all property and economic activity while in the capitalistic american system private citizens controlled almost all economic activity.
in the american system voting by the people elected a president and a congress from competing political parties in the soviet union the communist party established a totalitarian government with no opposing parties.
the united states was furious that joseph stalin the leader of the soviet union had been an ally of hitler for a time.
stalin had supported the allies only after hitler invaded the soviet union in june 1941.
in some ways the americans and soviets became more suspicious of each other during the war.
stalin resented the western allies delay in attacking the germans in europe.
such an attack he thought would draw part of the german army away from the soviet union.
relations worsened after stalin learned key players harry s truman 1884 1972 harry s truman the son of a missouri livestock trader did not seem destined for greatness.
when he graduated from high school in 1901 he drifted from job to job.
after world war i he invested in a mens clothing store but the business failed.
discouraged by his business failure truman sought a career in politics.
as a politician his blunt and outspoken style won both loyal friends and bitter enemies.
as president his decisiveness and willingness to accept responsibility for his decisions the buck stops here read a sign on his desk earned him respect that has grown over the years.
joseph stalin 1879 1953 as a young revolutionary iosif vissarionovich dzhugashvili took the name stalin which means man of steel in russian.
his father was a failed shoemaker and an alcoholic.
his mother helped support the family as a washerwoman.
stalin is credited with turning the soviet union into a world power but at a terrible cost to its citizens.
he ruled with terror and brutality and saw enemies everywhere even among friends and supporters.
he subdued the population with the use of secret police and labor camps and he is believed to have been responsible for the murder of millions of soviets.
states had kept of the atomic that the united its development bomb secret.
the united nations in spite of these problems hopes for world peace were high at the end of the war.
the most visible symbol of these hopes was the united nations un.
on april 25 1945 the representatives of 50 nations met in san francisco to establish this new peacekeeping body.
after two months of debate on june 26 1945 the delegates signed the charter establishing the un.
ironically even though the un was intended to promote peace it soon became an arena in which the two superpowers competed.
both the united states and the soviet union used the un as a forum to spread their influence over others.
truman becomes president for the united states the key figure in the early years of conflict with the soviets was president harry s truman.
on april 12 1945 truman had suddenly become president when franklin roosevelt died.
this former missouri senator had been picked as roosevelt s running mate in 1944 he had served as vice president for just a few months before roosevelt s death during his term as vice president truman had not been included in top nolicv decisions.
he had not even known that the united states was developing an atomic bomb.
many americans doubted truman s ability to serve as president.
but truman was honest and had a willingness to make tough decisrons quahties that he would need desperately during his presidency.
cold war conflicts 61 i i i i i t the potsdam conference truman s test as a diplomat came in july 1945 when the big three the united states great britain and the soviet union met at the final wartime conference at potsdam near berlin.
the countries that participated were the same ones that had been present at yalta in february 1945.
stalin still represented the soviet union.
clement attlee replaced churchill as britain s representative mid conference because churchill s party lost a general election.
and harry truman took roosevelt s place.
at yalta stalin had promised roosevelt that he would allow free elections that is a vote by secret ballot in a multiparty system in poland and other parts of eastern europe that the soviets occupied at the end of the war.
by july 1945 however it was clear that stalin would not keep this promise.
the soviets prevented free elections in poland and banned democratic parties.
tension mounts stalin s refusal to allow free elections in poland convinced truman that u s and soviet aims were deeply at odds.
truman s goal in demanding free elections was to spread democracy to nations that had been under nazi rule.
he wanted to create a new world order in which all nations had the right of self determination.
bargaining at potsdam at the yalta conference the soviets had wanted to take reparations from germany to help repay soviet wartime losses.
now at potsdam truman objected to that.
after hard bargaining it was agreed that the soviets british americans and french would take reparations mainly from their own occupation zones within germany.
truman also felt that the united states had a large economic stake in spreading democracy and free trade across the globe.
u s industry boomed during the war making the united states the economic leader of the world.
to continue growing american businesses wanted access to raw materials in eastern europe and they wanted to be able to sell goods to eastern european countries.
soviets tighten their grip on eastern europe the soviet union had also emerged from the war as a nation of enormous economic and military strength.
however unlike the united states the soviet union had suffered heavy devastation on its own soil.
soviet deaths from the war have been estimated at 20 million half of whom were civilians.
as a result the soviets felt justified in their claim to eastern europe.
by dominating this region the soviets felt they could stop future invasions from the west.
i i i main idea analyzing causes what did stalin do to make president truman distrust him.
aims versus soviet aims in europe the united states wanted to.
the soviets wanted to.
create a new world order in which all nations had the right of self determination gain access to raw materials and markets for its industries rebuild european governments to ensure stability and to create new markets for american goods reunite germany believing that europe would be more secure if germany were productive encourage communism in other countries as part of the worldwide struggle between workers and the wealthy rebuild its war ravaged economy using eastern europe s industrial equipment and raw materials control eastern europe to balance u s influence in western europe keep germany divided and weak so that it would never again threaten the soviet union skillbuilder interpreting charts 1.

stalin installed communist governments in czechoslovakia hungary romania and poland.
these countries became known as satellite nations countries dominated by the soviet union.
in early 1946 stalin gave a speech announcing that communism and capitalism were incompatible and that another war was inevitable.
united states establishes a policy of containment faced with the soviet threat american officials decided it was time in truman s words to stop babying the soviets.
in february 1946 george f kennan an american diplomat in moscow proposed a policy of containment.
by containment he meant taking measures to prevent any extension of communist rule to other countries.
this policy began to guide the truman administration s foreign policy.
europe was now divided into two political regions a mostly democratic western europe and a communist eastern europe.

cold war in europe the conflicting u s and soviet aims in eastern europe led to the cold war a conflict between the united states and the soviet union in which neither nation directly confronted the other on the battlefield.
the cold war would dominate global affairs and u s foreign policy from 1945 until the breakup of the soviet union in 1991.
the truman doctrine the united states first tried to contain soviet influence in greece and turkey.
britain was financially supporting both nations resistance to growing communist influence in the region.
however britain s economy had been badly hurt by the war and the formerly wealthy nation could no longer afford to give aid.
it asked the united states to take over the responsibility.
president truman accepted the challenge.
on march 12 1947 truman asked congress for 400 million in economic and military aid for greece and turkey.
in a statement that became known as the truman doctrine he declared that it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.
congress agreed with truman and decided that the doctrine was essential to keeping soviet influence from spreading.
between 1947 and 1950 the united states sent 400 million in aid to turkey and greece greatly reducing the danger of communist takeover in those nations.
the marshall plan like postwar greece western europe was in chaos.
most of its factories had been bombed or looted.
millions of people were living in refugee camps while european governments tried to figure out where to resettle them.
to make matters worse the winter of 1946 1947 was the bitterest in several centuries.
the weather severely damaged crops and froze rivers cutting off water transportation and causing a fuel shortage.
in june 1947 secretary of state george marshall proposed that the united states provide aid to all european nations that needed it saying that this move was directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and chaos.
the marshall plan revived european hopes.
over the next four years 16 countries received some 13 billion in aid.
by 1952 western europe was flourishing and the communist party had lost much of its appeal to voters.
vocabulary subjugation bringing under control background the marshall plan also benefited the united states.

as a result the american economy continued its wartime boom.
606 chapter 18 j main idea analyzing effects what were effects of the berlin airlift.
the superpowers struggle over germany as europe began to get back on its feet the united states and its allies clashed with the soviet union over the issue of german reunification.
at the end of world war ii germany was divided into four zones occupied by the united states great britain and france in the west and the soviet union in the east.
in 1948 britain france and the united states decided to combine their three zones into one nation.
the western part of berlin which had been occupied by the french british and americans was surrounded by soviet occupied territory.
see map page 605.
although the three nations had a legal right to unify their zones they had no written agreement with the soviets guaranteeing free access to berlin by road or rail.
stalin saw this loophole as an opportunity.
if he moved quickly he might be able to take over the part of berlin held by the three western powers.
in june 1948 stalin closed all highway and rail routes into west berlin.
as a result no food or fuel could reach that part of the city.
the 2 1 million residents of the city had only enough food to last for approximately five weeks.
the berlin airlift the resulting situation was dire.
in an attempt to break the blockade american and british officials started the berlin airlift to fly food and supplies into west berlin.
for 327 days planes took off and landed every few minutes around the clock.
in 277 000 flights they brought in 2 3 million tons of supplies everything from food fuel and medicine to christmas presents that the planes crews bought with their own money.
west berlin survived because of the airlift.
in addition the mission to aid berlin boosted american prestige around the world.
by may 1949 the soviet union realized it was beaten and lifted the blockade.
beginning in june 1948 planes bringing tons of food and other supplies to west berlin landed every few minutes.

first lieutenant philip day jr vividly remembers his first taste of battle in korea.
on the morning of july 5 1950 philip day spotted a column of eight enemy tanks moving toward his company.
a personal voice philip day jr i was with a 75 mm recoilless rifle team.
lets see i shouted if we can get one of those tanks we picked up the gun and moved it to where we could get a clean shot.
i dont know if we were poorly trained.
but we set the gun on the forward slope of the hill.
when we fired the recoilless blast blew a hole in the hill which instantly covered us in mud and dirt.
when we were ready again we moved the gun to a better position and began banging away.
i swear we had some hits but the tanks never slowed down.
in a little less than two hours 30 north korean tanks rolled through the position we were supposed to block as if we hadnt been there 77 quoted in the korean war pusan to chosin only five years after world war ii ended the united states became embroiled in a war in korea.
the policy of containment had led the united states into battle to halt communist expansion.
in this conflict however the enemy was not the soviet union but north korea and china.
china becomes a communist country for two decades chinese communists had struggled against the nationalist government of chiang kai shek chang kf shek.
the united states supported chiang.
between 1945 and 1949 the american government sent the nationalists approximately 3 billion in aid.
cold war conflicts ruled in southern and eastern china relied heavily on aid from united states ruled in northern china struggled with inflation and a failing economy suffered from weak leadership and poor relied heavily on financial aid from soviet union attracted peasants with promises of land reform benefited from experienced guerrilla army and a morale highly motivated leadership many americans were impressed by chiang kai shek and admired the courage and determination that the chinese nationalists showed in resisting the japanese during the war.
however u s officials who dealt with chiang held a different view.
they found his government inefficient and hopelessly corrupt.
furthermore the policies of chiang s government undermined nationalist support.
for example the nationalists collected a grain tax from farmers even during the famine of 1944.
when city dwellers demonstrated against a 10 000 percent increase in the price of rice chiang s secret police opened fire on them.
in contrast the communists led by mao zedong mou dzitdong gained strength throughout the country.
in the areas they controlled communists worked to win peasant support.
they encouraged peasants to learn to read and they helped to improve food production.
as a result more and more recruits flocked to the communists red army.
by 1945 much of northern china was under communist control.
renewed civil war as soon as the defeated japanese left china at the end of world war ii cooperation between the nationalists and the communists ceased.
civil war erupted again between the two groups.
in spite of the problems in the nationalist regime american policy favored the nationalists because they opposed communism.
from 1944 to 1947 the united states played peacemaker between the two groups while still supporting the nationalists.
however u s officials repeatedly failed to negotiate peace.
truman refused to commit american soldiers to back up the nationalists although the united states did send 2 billion worth of military equipment and supplies.
the aid wasn t enough to save the nationalists whose weak military leader f ship and corrupt abusive practices drove the peasants to the communist side.

takeover in china 610 chapter 18 main idea analyzing events j how did korea become a divided nation after world war ii.
america reacts to communist takeover the american public was stunned that china had become communist.
containment had failed.
in congress conservative republicans and democrats attacked the truman administration for supplying only limited aid to chiang.
if containing communism was important in europe they asked why was it not equally important in asia.
the state department replied by saying that what had happened in china was a result of internal forces.
the united states had failed in its attempts to influence these forces such as chiang s inability to retain the support of his people.
trying to do more would only have started a war in asia a war that the united states wasn t prepared to fight.
some conservatives in congress rejected this argument as a lame excuse.
they claimed that the american government was riddled with communist agents.
like wildfire american fear of communism began to burn out of control and the flames were fanned by events in korea the next year.
the korean war japan had taken over korea in 1910 and ruled it until august 1945.

its government headed by syngman rhee was based in seoul korea s traditional capital.
simultaneously the communists formed the democratic people s republic of korea in the north.
kim ii sung led its government which was based in pyongyang.
w soon after world war ii the united states had cut back its armed forces in south korea.
as a result by june of 1949 there were only 500 american troops there.
the soviets concluded that the united states would not fight to defend south korea.
they prepared to back north korea with tanks airplanes and money in an attempt to take over the entire peninsula.
north korea attacks south korea on june 25 1950 north korean forces swept across the 38th parallel in a surprise attack on south korea.
the conflict that followed became known as the korean war.
within a few days north korean troops had penetrated deep into south korea.
south korea called on the united nations to stop the north korean invasion.
when the matter came to a vote in the un security council the soviet union was not there.
the soviets were boycotting the council in protest over the presence of nationalist china taiwan.
thus the soviets could not veto the un s plan of military action.
the vote passed.
president truman believed that south korea was where the united states had to apply the containment policy and take a stand against communist aggression.
on june 27 he ordered troops stationed in japan to support the south korean.
he also sent an american fleet into the waters between taiwan and china.
taiwan in 1949 chiang kai shek and other nationalist leaders retreated to the island of taiwan which lies about 100 miles off the southeast coast of the chinese mainland.
there the united states helped set up a nationalist government the republic of china.
from 1949 through the 1960s the united states poured millions of dollars of aid into the taiwanese economy.
during the 1970s a number of nations including the united states decided to end diplomatic relations with taiwan and established ties with communist china.

macarthur s plan had saved his army from almost certain defeat.
the un army chased the retreating north korean troops across the 38th parallel into north korea.
in late november un troops approached the yalu river the border between north korea and china.
it seemed as if korea was about to become a single country again.
the chinese fight back the chinese however had other ideas.
communist china s foreign minister zhou en lai warned that his country would not stand idly by and let the americans come to the border meaning the yalu river.
in late november 1950 300 000 chinese troops joined the war on the side of north korea.
the chinese wanted north korea as a communist buffer state to protect their northeastern provinces that made up manchuria.
they also felt threatened by the american fleet that lay off their coast.
the fight between north korea and south korea had escalated into a war in which the main opponents were the chinese communists and the americans.
by sheer force of numbers the chinese drove the un troops southward.
at some points along the battlefront the chinese outnumbered un forces ten to one.
by early january 1951 all un and south korean troops had been pushed out of north korea.

as general omar n bradley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said an all out conflict with china would be the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time and with the wrong enemy.
instead of attacking china the un and south korean forces began to advance once more using the u s eighth army led by matthew b ridgway as a spearhead.
by april 1951 ridgway had retaken seoul and had moved back up to the 38th parallel.
the situation was just what it had been before the fighting began.
macarthur versus truman not satisfied with the recapture of south korea macarthur continued to urge the waging of a full scale war against china.
certain that his views were correct macarthur tried to go over the president s head.
he spoke and wrote privately to newspaper and magazine publishers and especially to republican leaders.
macarthur s superiors informed him that he had no authority to make decisions of policy.
despite repeated warnings to follow orders macarthur continued to criticize the president.
president truman who as president was commander in chief of the armed forces and thus macarthur s boss was just as stubborn as macarthur.
truman refused to stand for this kind of behavior.
he wanted to put together a settlement of the war and could no longer tolerate a military commander who was trying to sabotage his policy.
on april 11 1951 truman made the shocking announcement that he had fired macarthur.
many americans were outraged over their hero s downfall.
a public opinion poll showed that 69 percent of the american public backed general macarthur.
when macarthur returned to the united states he gave an address to congress an honor usually awarded only to heads of government.
new york city honored him with a ticker tape parade.
in his closing remarks to congress macarthur said old soldiers never die they just fade away.

after macarthur s moment of public glory passed the truman administration began to make its case.

truce talks began in july 1951.
the opposing sides reached agreement on two points the location of the cease fire line at the existing battle line and the establishment of a demilitarized zone between the opposing sides.
negotiators spent another year wrangling over the exchange of prisoners.
finally in july 1953 the two sides signed an armistice ending the war.
at best the agreement was a stalemate.
on the one hand the north korean invaders had been pushed back and communism had been contained without the use of atomic weapons.
on the other hand korea was still two nations rather than one.
on the home front the war had affected the lives of ordinary americans in many ways.
it had cost 54 000 american lives and 67 billion in expenditures.
the high cost of this unsuccessful war was one of many factors leading americans to reject the democratic party in 1952 and to elect a republican administration under world war ii hero dwight d eisenhower.
in addition the korean war increased fear of communist aggression and prompted a hunt for americans who might be blamed for the communist gains.

tony kahn made the neighbors uncomfortable because they thought his father gordon kahn was a communist.
in 1947 gordon kahn was a successful screenwriter.
however when a congressional committee began to investigate communists in hollywood kahn was blacklisted named as unfit to hire.
in 1951 gordon kahn was asked to testify before the committee.
to save himself he simply had to name others as communists but he refused.
rather than face the congressional committee he fled to mexico.
tony kahn remembers how the cold war hurt him and his family.
a personal voice tony kahn the first time i was called a communist i was four years old.
ill never forget the look in our neighbors eyes when i walked by.
i thought it was hate.
i was too young to realize it was fear.
from the cold war comes home tony kahn the members of the kahn family were among thousands of victims of the anti communist hysteria that gripped this country in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
by the end of the period no one was immune from accusations.
fear of communist influence the postwar years were a tense time in the united states.
many americans worried about the nation s security.
the soviet domination of eastern europe and the communist takeover of china shocked the american public fueling a fear that communism would spread around the world.
in addition at the height of world war ii about 80 000 americans claimed membership in the communist party.
for several years concern had been growing about possible communist influence in american government.
thus the domestic events of the period intensified cold war tensions already worrying many americans.
616 chapter 18 main idea drawing conclusions fiy how did the loyalty review board pose a threat to civil liberties.
loyalty review board strongly anti communist republicans began to accuse truman of being soft on communism.
consequently in march 1947 president truman issued an executive order setting up the federal employee loyalty program which included the loyalty review board.
its purpose was to investigate government employees and to dismiss those who were found to be disloyal to the u s government.
the u s attorney general drew up a list of 91 subversive organizations membership in any of these groups was grounds for suspicion.
from 1947 to 1951 government loyalty boards investigated 3 2 million employees and dismissed 212 as security risks.
another 2 900 resigned rather than face an investigation that they felt violated their constitutional rights.
individuals under investigation were not allowed to see the evidence against them.
the house un american activities committee other agencies investigated possible communist influence both inside and outside the u s government.
the most famous of these was the house un american activities committee huac.
huac first made headlines in 1947 when it began to investigate communist influence in the movie industry.
the committee believed that communists were sneaking propaganda into films.
the committee pointed to the pro soviet films made during world war ii when the soviet union had been a united states ally.
huac subpoenaed 43 witnesses from the hollywood film industry in september 1947.
many of the witnesses were friendly supporting the accusation that communists had infiltrated the film industry.
for example the movie star gary cooper said he had turned down quite a few scripts because i thought they were tinged with communistic ideas.
however when asked which scripts he meant cooper couldn t remember their titles.
ten unfriendly witnesses were called to testify but refused.
these men known as the hollywood ten decided not to cooperate because they believed that the hearings were unconstitutional.
because the hollywood ten refused to answer questions they were sent to prison.
in response to the hearings hollywood executives instituted a blacklist a list of people whom they condemned for having a communist background.
people who were blacklisted approximately 500 actors writers producers and directors had their careers ruined because they could no longer work jy the mccarran act as hollywood tried to rid itself of communists congress decided that truman s loyalty review board did not go far enough.
in 1950 congress passed the mccarran internal security act.
this made it unlawful to plan any action that might lead to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship in the united states.
truman vetoed the bill saying in a free country we punish men for the crimes they commit but never for the opinions they have.
but congress enacted the law over truman s veto.

analysts soon deciphered enough to learn that soviet spies had infiltrated all levels of the u s government.
the 3 000 decrypted messages that make up the venona papers declassified in 1995 confirm that 349 u s residents maintained a covert relationship with the soviet union.
it is now clear that these individuals delivered classified information to the soviets that severely hampered u s efforts during the cold war.
the suspicions of huac and others of communist spies in the united states were well founded however their extreme methods intensified the fear and tension of the era.
spy cases stun the nation two spy cases added to fear that was spreading like an epidemic across the country.
one case involved a former state department official named alger hiss.
alger hiss in 1948 a former communist spy named whittaker chambers accused alger hiss of spying for the soviet union.
to support his charges chambers produced microfilm of government documents that he claimed had been typed on hiss s typewriter.
too many years had passed for government prosecutors to charge hiss with espionage but a jury convicted him of perjury for lying about passing the documents and sent him to jail.
a young conservative republican congressman named richard nixon gained fame for pursuing the charges against hiss.
within four years of the highly publicized case nixon was elected vice president of the united states.
hiss claimed that he was innocent and that chambers had forged the documents used against him.
however in the 1990s soviet cables released by the national security agency seemed to prove hiss s guilt.
television making news historians of popular culture believe that the early 1950s were the best years of television.
most programs were filmed live and had a fresh unrehearsed look.
along with variety shows early television presented some of the best serious drama of the age.
since the 1950s television has also become a major vehicle for reporting the news.
not only does television report the news it also has increasingly helped to shape it.
618 chapter 18 the main idea analyzing causes why did the cases of alger hiss and the rosenbergs heighten the anticommunist mood of americans.
1967 by 1967 american support for the vietnam war had plummeted as millions of tv viewers witnessed the horrors of war on the nightly news.
rosenbergs another spy case rocked the nation even more than the hiss case partially because of international events occurring about the same time.
on september 3 1949 americans learned that the soviet union had exploded an atomic bomb.
most american experts had predicted that it would take the soviets three to five more years to make the bomb.
people began to wonder if communist supporters in the united states had leaked the secret of the bomb.
this second spy case seemed to confirm that suspicion.
in 1950 the german born physicist klaus fuchs admitted giving the soviet union information about america s atomic bomb.
the information probably enabled soviet scientists to develop their own atomic bomb years earlier than they would have otherwise.
implicated in the fuchs case were ethel and julius rosenberg minor activists in the american communist party.
when asked if they were communists the rosenbergs denied the charges against them and pleaded the fifth amendment choosing not to incriminate themselves.
they claimed they were being persecuted both for being jewish and for holding radical beliefs.
the rosenbergs were found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death.
in pronouncing their sentence judge irving kaufman declared their crime worse than murder.
to him they were directly responsible for one of the deadliest clashes of the cold war.
jg a personal voice irving kaufman i believe your conduct in putting into the hands of the russians the a bomb years before our best scientists predicted russia would perfect the bomb has already caused in my opinion the communist aggression in korea.
quoted in the unquiet death of julius and ethel rosenberg 1974 the watergate scandal that toppled richard nixons presidency in 1974 played to a rapt tv audience.
during the senate hearings in 1973 the televised testimony of john dean the presidents counsel had convinced two out of three americans that the president had committed a crime.

mccarthy launches his witch hunt the most famous anti communist activist was senator joseph mccarthy a republican from wisconsin.
during his first three years in the senate he had acquired a reputation for being an ineffective legislator.
by january 1950 he real ized that he was going to need a winning issue in order to be reelected in 1952.
looking for such an issue mccarthy charged that communists were taking over the government creating a sensation that intensified cold war tensions.
mccarthys tactics taking advantage of people s concerns about commu nism mccarthy made one unsupported accusation after another.
these attacks on suspected communists in the early 1950s became known as mccarthyism.
since that time mccarthyism has referred to the unfair tactic of accusing people of dis loyalty without providing evidence.
at various times mccarthy claimed to have in his hands the names of 57 81 and 205 communists in the state department.
he never actually produced a single name.
he also charged that the democratic party vocabuiary was guilty of 20 years of treason for allowing communist infiltration into the infiltration the government.
he was always careful to do his name calling only in the senate act of penetrating where he had legal immunity that protected him from being sued for slander.

by 1953 39 states had passed laws making it illegal to advocate the violent overthrow of the government even though such laws clearly violated the constitutional right of free speech.
across the nation cities and towns passed similar laws.

race for the h bomb the scientists who developed the atomic bomb had suspected since 1942 that it was possible to create an even more destructive thermonuclear weapon the hydrogen bomb or h bomb.
they estimated that such a bomb would have the force of 1 million tons of tnt 67 times the power of the bomb dropped on hiroshima.
but they argued vehemently about the morality of creating such a destructive weapon.
despite such concerns the united states entered into a deadly race with the soviet union to see which country would be the first to produce an h bomb.
on november 1 1952 the united states won the race when it exploded the first h bomb.
however the american advantage lasted less than a year.
in august 1953 the soviets exploded their own thermonuclear weapon.

get the facts i from your civil defense director coursc on fallout tlm the policy of brinkmanship by the time both countries had the h bomb dwight d eisenhower was president.
his secretary of state john foster dulles was staunchly anti communist.
for dulles the cold war was a moral crusade against communism.
dulles proposed that the united states could prevent the spread of communism by promising to use all of its force including nuclear weapons against any aggressor nation.
the willingness of the united states under president eisenhower to go to the edge of all out war became known as brinkmanship.
under this policy the united states trimmed its army and navy and expanded its air force which would deliver the bombs and its buildup of nuclear weapons.
the soviet union followed suit.
the threat of nuclear attack was unlike any the american people had ever faced.
even if only a few bombs reached their targets millions of civilians would die.
schoolchildren like annie dillard practiced air raid procedures and some families built underground fallout shelters in their back yards.
fear of nuclear war became a constant in american life for the next 30 years.
the cold war spreads around the world as the nation shifted to a dependence on nuclear arms the eisenhower administration began to rely heavily on the recently formed central intelligence agency cia for information.
the cia used spies to gather information abroad.
the cia also began to carry out covert or secret operations to weaken or overthrow governments unfriendly to the united states.
covert actions in the middle east and latin america one of the cia s first covert actions took place in the middle east.

in 1953 the cia gave several million dollars to anti mossadegh supporters.
the cia wanted the pro american shah of iran who had recently been forced to flee to return to power.
the plan worked.
the shah returned to power and turned over control of iranian oil fields to western companies.
in 1954 the cia also took covert actions in guatemala a central american country just south of mexico.
eisenhower believed that guatemala s government had communist sympathies because it had given more than 200 000 acres of american owned land to peasants.
in response the cia trained an army which invaded guatemala.
the guatemalan army refused to defend the president and he resigned.
the army s leader then became dictator of the country.
the warsaw pact in spite of the growing tension between the superpowers u s soviet relations seemed to thaw following the death of joseph stalin in 1953.
the soviets recognized west germany and concluded peace treaties with austria and japan.
however in 1955 when west germany was allowed to rearm and join nato the soviet union grew fearful.
it formed its own military alliance known as the warsaw pact.

main idea analyzing effects what were the results of the suez war.
the suez war in 1955 the same year in which the geneva summit took place great britain and the united states agreed to help egypt finance construction of a dam at aswan on the nile river.
however gamal abdel nasser egypt s head of government tried to play the soviets and the americans against each other by improving relations with each one in order to get more aid.
in 1956 after learning that nasser was making deals with the soviets dulles withdrew his offer of a loan.
angered nasser responded by nationalizing the suez canal the egyptian waterway that was owned by france and great britain.
the french and the british were outraged.
egyptian control of the canal also affected israel.
nasser refused to let ships bound for israel pass through the canal even though the canal was supposed to be open to all nations.
great britain france and israel responded by sending troops.
the three countries seized the mediterranean end of the canal.
the un quickly stepped in to stop the fighting.
it persuaded great britain france and israel to withdraw.
however it allowed egypt to keep control of the canal.
c the eisenhower doctrine the soviet union s prestige in the middle east rose because of its support for egypt.
to counterbalance this development president eisenhower issued a warning in january 1957.
this warning known as the eisenhower doctrine said that the united states would defend the middle east against an attack by any communist country.
in march congress officially approved the doctrine.

he favored a policy of peaceful coexistence in which two powers would compete economically and scientifically.
the space race in the competition for international prestige the soviets leaped to an early lead in what came to be known as the space race.
on october 4 1957 they launched sputnik the world s first artificial satellite.
sputnik traveled around the earth at 18 000 miles per hour circling the globe every 96 minutes.
its launch was a triumph of soviet technology.
the sputnik launch caused great concern in the united states.
it signaled that the soviets had surpassed american scientists in terms of technical skill and knowledge.
many americans worried this would translate into better more accurate weaponry.
the united states was quick to respond to the sputnik challenge and promptly poured money into their own space program.
on january 31 1958 the united states successfully launched its first satellite.
they also established a new agency the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to take charge of the nation s space exploration efforts.
the american people also took a hard look at their educational system.
many wondered whether a decline in the nation s schools had enabled the soviet union to surpass the united states in technological achievement.
in response to this concern congress in 1958 passed the national defense education act which provided hundreds of millions of dollars for public education.
a u 2 is shot down following the rejection of eisenhower s open skies proposal at the 1955 geneva summit conference the cia began making secret high altitude flights over soviet territory.
the plane used for these missions was the u 2 which could fly at high altitudes without detection.
as a u 2 passed over the soviet union its infrared cameras took detailed photographs of troop movement and missile sites.
by 1960 however many u s officials were nervous about the u 2 program for two reasons.
first the existence and purpose of the u 2 was an open secret among some members of the american press.
second the soviets had been aware of the flights since 1958.
626 chapter 18 background after 18 months francis gary powers was released from the soviet union in exchange for soviet agent rudolf abel who had been convicted of spying in the united states.

the soviets sentenced powers to ten years in prison.

the soviets had evidence however and eisenhower finally had to admit it.
khrushchev demanded an apology for the flights and a promise to halt them.
eisenhower agreed to stop the u 2 flights but he would not apologize.
