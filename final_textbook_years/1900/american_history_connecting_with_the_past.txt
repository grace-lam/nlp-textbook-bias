758 chapter 28 under the leadership of george meany.
relations between the leaders of the former afl and the former cio were not always comfortable.
cio leaders believed correctly that the afl hierarchy was dominating the relationship.
afl leaders were suspicious of what they considered the radical past of the cio leadership.
even so the union of the two great labor movements of the 1930s survived and gradually tensions subsided.
success bred corruption in some union bureaucracies.
in 1957 the powerful teamsters union became the subject of a congressional investigation and its president david beck was charged with misappropriation of union funds.
beck ultimately stepped down to be replaced by jimmy hoffa whom government investigators pursued for nearly a decade before finally winning a conviction against him for tax evasion in 1967.
the united mine workers the union that had spearheaded the industrial movement in the 1930s similarly became tainted by suspicions of corruption and by violence.
john l lewiss last years as head of the union were plagued with scandals and dissent within the organization.
his successor tony boyle was ultimately convicted of complicity in the 1969 murder of the leader of a dissident faction within the union.
while the labor movement enjoyed significant success in winning better wages and benefits for workers already organized in strong unions the majority of laborers who were as total represented by unions in millions 25 afl cio afl cio 20 independent unions tinted area 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 2001 workers represented by unions 1920 2001 this chart shows the number of workers represented by unions over an eighty year period.
note the dramatic rise in the unionized workforce during the 1930s and 1940s the slower but still significant rise in the 1960s and 1970s and the steady decline that began in the 1980s.
the chart in fact understates the decline of unionized labor in the postwar era since it shows union membership in absolute numbers and not as a percentage of the rapidly growing workforce.
why did unions cease recruiting new members successfully in the 1970s and why did they begin losing members in the 1980s.
limited gains for unorganized workers yet unorganized made fewer advances.
total union membership remained relatively stable throughout the 1950s at about 16 million and while this was in part a result of a shift in the workforce from blue collar to white collar jobs it was also a result of new obstacles to organization.
the 1947 taft hartley act and the state right to work laws that it created made it more difficult to form or even sustain many unions.
the cio launched a major organizing drive in the south shortly after world war ii targeting the poorly paid workers in textile mills in particular.
but operation dixie as it was called was a failure as were most other organizing drives for at least thirty years after world war ii.
the explosion of science and technology in 1961 time magazine selected as its man of the year not a specific person but the american scientist the choice was an indication of the widespread fascination with which americans viewed science and technology.
but it was also a sign of the remarkable and remarkably rapid scientific and technological advances in many areas during the postwar years.
medical breakthroughs a particularly important advance in medical science was the development of new antibacterial drugs capable of fighting infections that in the past had been all but untreatable.
the development of antibiotics had its origins in the discoveries of louis pasteur and jules francois joubert.
working antibiotics in france in the 1870s they produced the first conclusive evidence that virulent bacterial infections could be defeated by other more ordinary bacteria.
using their discoveries the english physician joseph lister revealed the value of antiseptic solutions in preventing infection during surgery.
but the practical use of antibacterial agents to combat disease did not begin until many decades later.
in the 1930s scientists in germany france and england demonstrated the power of so called sulfa drugs drugs derived from an antibacterial agent known as sulfanilamide which could be used effectively to treat streptococcal blood infections.
new sulfa drugs were soon being developed at an astonishing rate and were steadily improved with dramatic results in treating what had once been a major cause of death.
in 1928 in the meantime alexander fleming an english medical researcher accidentally discovered the antibacterial properties of an organism that he named penicillin.
there was ittle progress in using penicillin to treat human illness how penicillin ever until a group of researchers at oxford university directed by howard florey the affluent society 759 and ernest chain learned how to produce stable potent penicillin in sizable enough quantities to make it a practical weapon against bacterial disease.
the first human trials of the new drug in 1941 were dramatically successful but progress toward the mass availability of penicillin was stalled in england because of world war ii.
american laboratories took the next crucial steps in developing methods for the mass production and commercial distribution of penicillin which became widely available to doctors and hospitals around the world by 1948.
since then a wide range of new antibiotics of highly specific character have been developed so that bacterial infections are now among the most successfully treated of all human illnesses.
there was also dramatic progress in immunization.
the first great triumph was the development of the smallpox vaccine by the english researcher edward jenner in the late eighteenth century.
a vaccine effective against typhoid was developed by an english bacteriologist almorth wright in 1897 and was in wide use by world war i vaccination against tetanus became widespread in many countries just before and during world war ii.
medical scientists also developed a vaccine bcg against another major killer tuberculosis in the 1920s but controversy over its safety stalled its adoption especially in the united states for many years.
it was not widely used in the united states until after world war ii when it largely eliminated tuberculosis.
viruses are much more difficult to prevent and treat than bacterial infections and progress toward vaccines against viral infections except for smallpox was relatively slow.
not until the 1930s when scientists discovered how to grow viruses in laboratories in tissue cultures could researchers study them with any real effectiveness.
gradually they discovered how to produce forms of a virus incapable of causing a disease but capable of triggering antibodies in vaccinated people that would protect them from contracting the disease.
an effective vaccine against yellow fever was developed in the late 1930s and one against some forms of influenza one of the great killers of the first half of the twentieth century appeared in 1945.
a particularly dramatic postwar triumph was the development of a vaccine against polio.
in 1954 the american scien salk vaccine tist jonas salk introduced an effective vaccine against the virus that had killed and crippled thousands of children and adults among them franklin roosevelt.
it was provided free to the public by the federal government beginning in 1955.
after 1960 an oral vaccine developed by albert sabin usually administered in a sugar cube made widespread vaccination even easier.
by the early 1960s these vaccines had virtually eliminated polio from american life and much of the rest of the world.
as a result of these and many other medical advances both infant mortality and the death rate among young chil dren declined significantly in the first twenty five years after the war although not by as much as in western europe.
average life expectancy in that same period rose by five years to seventy one.
pesticides at the same time that medical researchers were finding cures and vaccines against infectious diseases other scientists were developing new kinds of chemical pesticides which they hoped would protect crops from destruction by insects and protect humans from such insect carried diseases as typhus and malaria.
the most famous of the new pesticides was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane generally known as ddt a compound discovered in 1939 by a swiss chemist named paul ddt muller.
he had found that although ddt seemed harmless to human beings and other mammals it was extremely toxic to insects.
american scientists learned of mullers discovery in 1942 just as the army was grappling with the insect borne tropical diseases especially malaria and typhus that threatened american sol diers overseas during world war ii.
under these circumstances ddt seemed a godsend.
it was first used on a large scale in italy in 1943 1944 during a typhus outbreak which it quickly helped end.
soon it was being sprayed in mosquito infested areas of pacific islands where american troops were fighting the japanese.
no soldiers suffered any apparent ill effects from the sprayings and the incidence of malaria dropped precipitously.
ddt quickly gained a reputation as a miraculous tool for controlling insects and it undoubtedly saved thousands of lives.
only later did scientists recognize that ddt had long term toxic effects on animals and humans.
postwar electronic research the 1940s and 1950s saw dramatic new developments in electronic technology.
researchers in the 1940s produced the first commercially viable televisions and created a technology that invention of made ir possible t0 broadcast programming television over lar8e areas.
later in the late 1950s scientists at rcas david sarnoff laboratories in new jersey developed the technology for color television which first became widely available in the early 1960s.
in 1948 bell labs the research arm of at t produced the first transistor a small solid state device capable of amplifying electrical signals which was much smaller and more efficient than the cumbersome vacuum tubes that had powered most electronic equipment in the past.
transistors made possible the miniaturization of many devices radios televisions audio equipment hearing aids and were also important in aviation weaponry and satellites.
they contributed as well to another major breakthrough in electronics the development of integrated circuitry in the late 1950s.
integrated circuits combined a number of once separate electronic elements transistors resistors diodes and others and embedded them into a single microscopically small device.
they made it possible to create increasingly complex electronic devices requiring complicated circuitry that would have been impractical to produce through other means.
most of all integrated circuits helped advance the development of the computer.
chapter 28 the salk vaccine dr jonas salk a medical researcher at the university of pittsburgh developed in the mid 1950s the first vaccine that proved effective in preventing polio.
in its aftermath scenes similar to this one a mass inoculation of families in a municipal stadium in evansville indiana repeated themselves all over the country.
a few years later dr albert sabin of the university of cincinnati created a vaccine that could be administered more easily through sugar cubes.
ap images postwar computer technology prior to the 1950s computers had been constructed mainly to perform complicated mathematical tasks such as those required to break military codes.
in the 1950s they began to perform commercial functions for the first time as data processing devices used by businesses and other organizations.
the dawn of the computer age this massive computer powered by tubes was part of the first generation of mainframes developed after world war ii.
they served mostly government agencies and large corporations.
by the 1990s a small desktop computer could perform all the functions of this huge computer at much greater speed.
time life pictures getty images the first significant computer of the 1950s was the universal automatic computer or t za 4 univac which was devel univac j u r i tt.
oped initially for the u s bureau of the census by the remington rand company.
it was the first computer able to handle both alphabetical and numerical information easily.
it used tape storage and could perform calculations and other functions much faster than its predecessor the eniac developed in 1946 by the same researchers at the university of pennsylvania who were responsible for the univac.
searching for a larger market than the census for their very expensive new device remington rand arranged to use a univac to predict the results of the 1952 election for cbs television news.
it would they believed produce valuable publicity for the machine.
analyzing early voting results the univac accurately predicted an enormous landslide victory for eisenhower over stevenson.
few americans had ever heard of a computer before that night and the univacs television debut became therefore a critical breakthrough in public awareness of computer technology.
remington rand had limited success in marketing the univac but in the mid 1950s the international business machines company ibm introduced its first major data processing computers and began to find a wide market for them among businesses in the united states and abroad.
these early successes combined with the enormous amount of money ibm invested in research and development made the company the worldwide leader in computers for many years.
bombs rockets and missiles in 1952 the united states successfully detonated the first hydrogen bomb.
the soviet union tested its first h bomb a year later.
unlike the plutonium and uranium bombs developed during world war ii the hydrogen bomb derives its power not from fission the splitting of atoms but from fusion the joining of lighter atomic elements with heavier ones.
it is capable of producing explosions of vastly greater power than the earlier fission bombs.
the development of the hydrogen bomb gave considerable impetus to a stalled scientific project in both the united states and the soviet union the effort to develop unmanned rockets and missiles capable of carrying the the hydrogen bomb the affluent society 761 new weapons which were not suitable for delivery by airplanes to their targets.
both nations began to put tremendous resources into their development.
the united states in particular benefited from the emigration to america of some of the german scientists who had helped develop rocketry for germany during world war ii.
in the united states early missile research was conducted almost entirely by the air force.
there were significant early successes in developing rockets capable of traveling several hundred miles.
but american and soviet leaders were both struggling to build longer range missiles that could cross oceans and continents intercontinental ballistic missiles or icbms capable of traveling through space to distant targets.
american scientists experimented in the 1950s with first the atlas and then the titan icbm.
there were some early successes but there were also many setbacks particularly because of the difficulty of massing sufficient stable fuel to provide the tremendous power needed to launch missiles beyond launching a satellite 1961 four years after the successful russian launching of the satellite sputnik in 1957 threw americans into something close to a panic a thor able star rocket takes off from cape canaveral florida carrying an american satellite.
the satellite contained a nuclear generator capable of providing it with extended continuous power for its radio transmitters.
national archives and records administration the atmosphere.
by 1958 scientists had created a solid fuel to replace the volatile liquid fuels of the early missiles and they had also produced miniaturized guidance systems capable of ensuring that missiles could travel to reasonably precise destinations.
within a few years a new generation of missile known as the minuteman with a range of several thousand miles became the basis of the american atomic weapons arsenal.
american scientists also developed a nuclear missile capable of being carried and fired by submarines the polaris which could launch from below the surface of the ocean by compressed air.
a polaris was first successfully fired from underwater in 1960.
the space program the origins of the american space program can be traced most directly to a dramatic event in 1957 when the soviet union the shock announced that it had launched an of sputnik earth orbiting satellite spurufk into outer space.
the united states had yet to perform any similar feats and the american government and much of american society reacted to the announcement with alarm as if the soviet achievement was also a massive american failure.
federal policy began encouraging and funding strenuous efforts to improve scientific education in the schools to create more research laboratories and above all to speed the development of america s own exploration of outer space.
the united states launched its first satellite explorer i in january 1958.
the centerpiece of space exploration however soon became the manned space program established in 1958 through the creation of a new agency the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and through the selection of the first american space pilots or astronauts they quickly became among the nations most revered heroes.
nasas initial effort the mercury project was designed to launch manned vehicles into space to orbit the earth.
on may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american launched into space.
but his short suborbital flight came several months after a soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin had made a flight in which he had orbited the earth.
on february 2 1962 john glenn later a u s senator became the first american to orbit the globe.
nasa later introduced the gemini program whose spacecraft could carry two astronauts at once.
mercury and gemini were followed by the apollo program whose purpose was to land men on the moon.
it had some catastrophic setbacks most notably a fire in january 1967 that killed three astronauts.
but on july 20 1969 neil armstrong edwin aldrin and michael collins successfully traveled in a space capsule into orbit around the moon.
armstrong and aldrin then detached a smaller craft from the capsule landed the apollo program 762 chapter 28 apollo 11 edwin buzz aldrin is photographed by his fellow astronaut neil armstrong in august 1969 when they became the first humans to set foot on the surface of the moon.
they traveled into orbit around the moon in the spaceship apollo 11 and then traveled from the spaceship to the moon in a lunar module which they then used to return to the ship for the journey home.
nasa on the surface of the moon and became the first humans to walk on a body other than earth.
six more lunar missions followed the last in 1972.
not long after that however the government began to cut the funding for missions and popular enthusiasm for the program began to wane.
the future of the manned space program did not lie primarily in efforts to reach distant planets as originally envisioned.
instead the program became a more modest effort to make travel in near space easier and more practical through the development of the space shuttle an airplane like device launched by a missile but capable of both navigating in space and landing on earth much like a conventional aircraft.
the first space shuttle was successfully launched in 1982.
the explosion of one shuttle challenger in january 1986 shortly after takeoff killing all seven astronauts stalled the program for two years.
missions resumed in the late 1980s driven in part by commercial purposes.
the space shuttle launched and repaired communications satellites and inserted the hubble space telescope into orbit in 1990 and later repaired its flawed lens.
but problems continued to plague the program into the early twenty first century.
the space program like the military development of missiles gave a tremendous boost to the american aeronautics industry and was responsible for the development of many technologies that proved valuable in other areas.
people of plenty among the most striking social developments of the postwar era was the rapid expansion of a middle class lifestyle and outlook.
the new prosperity of social groups that had previously lived on the margins the growing availability of consumer products at affordable prices and the rising public fascination with such products and the massive population movement from the cities to the suburbs all helped make the american middle class a larger more powerful more homogeneous and more dominant force than ever before.
the consumer culture at the center of middle class culture in the 1950s as it had been for many decades before was a growing absorption with consumer goods.
that was a result of increased prosperity of the increasing variety and availability of products and of advertisers adeptness in creating a demand for those products.
it was also a result of the growth of consumer credit which increased by 800 percent between 1945 and 1957 through the development of credit cards revolving charge accounts and easy payment plans.
prosperity fueled the automobile industry and detroit responded to the boom with ever flashier styling and accessories.
consumers also responded eagerly to the development of such new products as dishwashers garbage disposals televisions hi fis and stereos.
to a large degree the prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s was consumer driven as opposed to investment driven.
because consumer goods were so often marketed and advertised nationally the 1950s were notable for the rapid spread of great national consumer crazes.
for example children adolescents and even some adults became entranced in the late 1950s with the hula hoop a large plastic ring kept spinning around the waist.
the popularity of the walt disney pto duced childrens television show the mickey mouse club created a national demand for related products such as mickey mouse watches and hats.
it also helped produce the stunning success of disneyland an amusement park near los angeles that re created many of the characters and events of disney entertainment programs.
consumer crazes the affluent society 763 the davy crockett craze in the 1950s walt disney introduced a television show about american folk hero davy crockett.
this boy wears to school his hero s famous coon skin that is raccoon skin cap and davy crockett t shirt as he reads about crockett.
in addition to merchandising products associated with crockett disney believed that it was time for americans to get acquainted or renew acquaintance with the robust cheerful energetic and representative folk heroes from the american past.
bettmann corbis the landscape and the automobile the success of disneyland depended largely on the ease of highway access from the dense urban areas around it as well as the vast parking lots that surrounded the park.
it was in short a symbol of the overwhelming influence of automobiles on american life and on the american landscape in the postwar era.
between 1950 and 1980 the nations population increased by 50 percent but the numbers of automobiles owned by americans increased by 400 percent.
the federal highway act of 1956 which appropriated 25 billion for highway construction was one of the most important alterations of the national landscape in modern history.
interstate great ribbons of concrete 40 000 miles of highways them spread across the nation spanning rivers and valleys traversing every state and providing links to every major city and between cities and their suburbs.
these highways dramatically reduced the time necessary to travel from one place to another.
they also made trucking a more economical way than railroads to transport goods to markets.
they made travel by automobile truck and bus as fast as or faster than travel by trains resulting in the long steady decline of railroads.
highways also encouraged the movement of economic activities manufacturing in particular out of cities and into surburban and rural areas where land was cheaper.
the decline of many traditional downtowns soon followed as many workers moved outside the urban core.
there was rapid growth of what eventually became known as edge cities and other new centers of industry and commerce outside traditional city centers.
the proliferation of automobiles and the spread of highways also made it easier for families to move into homes that were far away from where they worked.
this enabled many people to live in larger houses with larger lots than they could have afforded previously.
garages began to be built onto houses in great numbers after world war ii and such suburban amenities as swing sets barbecues and private swimming pools became more common as backyards became more the focus of family life.
the shift of travel from train to automobile helped launch a tremendous proliferation of motels 26 000 by 1948 60 000 by 1960 well over 100 000 by 1970.
the first holiday inn starting what would soon become the largest motel chain in america opened along a highway connecting memphis and nashville tennessee in 1952.
drive in theaters a distinctively american phenomenon that had begun to appear in the 1930s spread rapidly after the war.
there were 4 000 drive ins by 1958.
the suburban nation by 1960 a third of the nations population was living in suburbs.
suburbanization was partly a result of important innovations in home building which made singlefamily houses affordable to millions of people.
the most famous levittown tbe postwar suburban developers william levitt used new mass production techniques to construct a large housing development on long island near new york city.
this first levittown there would later be others in new jersey and pennsylvania consisted of several thousand two bedroom cape cod style houses with identical interiors and only slightly varied facades each perched on its own concrete slab to eliminate excavation costs facing curving treeless streets.
levittown houses and other similarly low priced homes sold for under 10 000 and they helped meet an enormous and growing demand for housing.
young couples often newly married and the husband a war veteran eager to start a family assisted by low cost government subsidized mortgages provided by the gi bill see p 74l rushed to purchase the inexpensive homes.
why did so many americans want to move to the suburbs.
one reason was the enormous importance postwar americans placed on family life after five years of disruptive war.
suburbs 764 chapter 28 interstates the interstate highway system changed the physical landscape of the united states.
its great sprawling ribbons of concrete such as this photograph that shows the hollywood freeway harbor freeway and arroyo seco freeway intersecting on multiple levels sliced through cities towns and rural areas.
but its biggest impact was in facilitating the movement of urban populations out of cities and into increasingly distant suburbs.
photo by j r eyerman time life pictures getty images provided families with larger homes than they could find or afford in the cities.
many people were attracted by the idea of living in a community populated largely by people of similar age and background and found it easier to form friendships and social circles there than in the city.
women in particular often valued the presence of other nonworking mothers living nearby to share the tasks of child raising.
another factor motivating white americans to move to the suburbs was race.
there were some african american suburbs but most suburbs were restricted to whites both because relatively few blacks could afford to live in them and because formal and informal barriers kept out even prosperous african americans.
in an era when the black population of most cities was rapidly growing many white families moved to the suburbs to escape the integration of urban neighborhoods and schools.
suburban neighborhoods had many things in common with one another.
but they were not uniform.
levittowns and inexpensive developments like them ultimately became the homes of mainly lower middle class people one step removed from the inner city.
other more affluent suburbs became enclaves of wealthy families.
in virtually every city a clear hierarchy emerged of upper class suburban neighborhoods and more modest ones just as such gradations had emerged years earlier among urban neighborhoods.
the suburban family for professional men many of whom worked in cities at some distance from their homes suburban life generally meant a rigid division between their working and personal worlds.
for many middle class married women it meant increased isolation prevailing from the workplace.
the enormous gender roles cultural emphasis on family life in reinforced t e 1950s strengthened popular prejudices against women entering the professions or occupying any paid job at all.
many middle class husbands considered it demeaning for their wives to be employed.
and many women shied away from the workplace when they could afford to stay at home full time with their children.
one of the most influential books in postwar american life was a famous guide to child rearing dr benjamin spocks baby and child dr benjamin care first published in 1946 and reissued and revised repeatedly for decades thereafter.
dr spocks approach to raising babies was child centered as opposed to parent centered.
the purpose of motherhood he taught was to help children learn and grow and realize their potential.
all other considerations including the mothers own physical and emotional requirements should be subordinated to the needs of the child.
dr spock at first envisioned only a very modest role for fathers in the process of child rearing although he changed his views on this and on many other issues over time.
women who could afford not to work faced pressures to remain in the home and concentrate on raising their children.
but as expectations of material comfort rose many middle class families needed a second income to maintain the standard of living they desired.
as a result the number of married women working outside the home actually increased in the postwar years even as the social pressure for them to stay out of the workplace grew.
by 1960 nearly a third of all married women were part of the paid workforce.
the birth of television television the most powerful medium of mass communication in the second half of the twentieth century was central to the culture of the postwar era.
experiments in broadcasting pictures along with sound had begun as early as the 1920s but commercial television began only shortly after world war ii.
its growth was phenomenally rapid.
in 1946 there were only 17 000 sets in the country by 1957 there were 40 million television sets in use almost as many sets as there were families.
more people had television sets according to one report than had refrigerators.
the television industry emerged directly out of the radio industry and all three major networks the national broadcasting company the columbia broadcasting system and the american broadcasting company had started as radio companies.
like radio the television business was driven by advertising.
the need to attract advertisers determined most programming decisions and in the early days of television sponsors often played a direct powerful and continuing role in determining the content of the programs they chose to the affluent society 765 ozzie and harriet in addition to depicting american life as predominantly white middle class and suburban television in the 1950s and 1960s often portrayed americans as optimistic and upwardly mobile.
here the nelson family characters from the show the adventures of ozzie and harriet enjoys time together in their backyard pool.
abc photofest sponsor.
many early television shows bore the names of the corporations that were paying for them the ge television theater the chrysler playhouse the camel news caravan and others.
some daytime serials were actually written and produced by procter gamble and other companies.
the impact of television on american life was rapid pervasive and profound.
by the late 1950s television news had replaced newspapers magazines and radios as the nations most important vehicle of information.
television advertising social helped create a vast market for new fash consequences ions ancl products televised athletic events of television gradually made professional and college sports one of the most important sources of entertainment and one of the biggest businesses in america.
television entertainment programming almost all of it controlled by the three national networks and their corporate sponsors replaced movies and radio as the principal source of diversion for american families.
much of the programming of the 1950s and early 1960s created a common image of american life an image that was predominantly white middle class and suburban and that was epitomized by such popular situation comedies as ozzie t.
and harriet and leave it to beaver.
homogenizing programmins also reinforced the concept message f gender roles that most men and many women unthinkingly embraced.
most situation comedies in particular showed families in which as the title of one of the most popular put it father knows best and in which most women were mothers and housewives striving to serve their children and please their husbands.
but television also conveyed other images gritty urban working class families in jackie gleasons the honeymooners the childless show business family of the early i love lucy unmarried professional women in our miss brooks and my little margie hapless african americans in amos n andy.
television not only sought to create an idealized image of a homogeneous suburban america.
it also sought to convey experiences at odds with that image but to convey them in warm unthreatening terms.
yet television also inadvertently created conditions that could accentuate social conflict.
even those unable to share in the affluence of the era could through television news and other venues acquire a vivid picture of how the rest of their society lived.
and at the same time that television was reinforcing the homogeneity of the white middle class it was also contributing to the sense of alienation and powerlessness among groups excluded from the world it portrayed.
travel outdoor recreation and environmentalism the idea of a paid vacation for american workers and the association of that idea with travel entered american culture beginning in the 1920s.
but it was not until the postwar years that vacation travel became truly widespread among middle income americans.
the construction of the interstate highway system contributed dramatically to the growth of travel.
so did the increasing affluence of workers which made it possible for them to buy cars.
nowhere was this surge in travel and recreation more visible than in americas national parks which experienced the 766 chapter 28 city annexations original suburban municipal original city 1837 incorporations 1837 1889 1837 1889 1890 1939 1890 1939 1940 1990 1940 1990 chicagos annexations and the suburban noose this map uses chicago as an example of two important processes in the growth of american cities municipal consolidation and suburbanization.
in 1837 chicago consisted of a small area on the shore of lake michigan represented by the small dark orange area on the right center of the map.
over the next fifty years chicago annexed an enormous amount of additional land around its original borders followed by a few smaller annexations in the twentieth century.
at the same time however many of the areas around chicago were separating themselves from the city by incorporating as independent communities suburbs with a particular wave of such incorporations in the first decades of the twentieth century continuing into the 1990s.
a map of new york and of many other cities would reveal a similar pattern.
what were the consequences for the city of its legal and financial separation from so many suburban communities.
beginnings of what became a permanent surge in attendance in the 1950s.
people who traveled to national parks did so for many reasons some to hike and camp some to fish jbcho park r and hunt activities that themselves grew dramatically in the 1950s and helped create a large number of clubs some simply to look in awe at the landscape.
many visitors to national parks came in search less of conventional recreation than of wilderness.
the importance of that search became clear in the early 1950s in the first of many battles over development of wilderness areas the fight to preserve echo park.
echo park is a spectacular valley in the dinosaur national monument on the border between utah and colorado near the southern border of wyoming.
in the early 1950s the federal governments bureau of reclamation created early in the century to encourage irrigation develop electric power and increase water supplies proposed building a dam across the green river which runs through echo valley so as to create a lake for recreation and a source of hydroelectric power.
the american environmental movement had been relatively quiet since its searing defeat early in the century in its effort to stop a similar dam in the hetch hetchy valley at yosemite national park see p 575.
but the echo park proposal helped rouse it from its slumber.
in 1950 bernard devoto a well known writer and a great champion of the american west published an essay in the saturday evening post titled shall we let them ruin our national parks it had a sensational impact arousing opposition to the echo valley dam from many areas of the country.
the sierra club relatively quiet in previous decades moved into action the controversy helped elevate a new and aggressive leader david brower who eventually transformed the club into the nations leading environmental organization.
by the mid 1950s a large coalition of environmentalists naturalists and wilderness vacationers had been mobilized in opposition to the dam and in 1956 congressbowing to the public pressure blocked the project and preserved echo park in its natural state.
the controversy was a major victory for those who wished to preserve the sanctity of the national parks and it was an important impetus to the dawning environmental consciousness that would become so important in later decades.
organized society and its detractors sierra club reborn white collar workers came to outnumber blue collar laborers for the first time in the 1950s and an increasing proportion of them worked in corporate settings with rigid hierarchical structures.
industrial workers also confronted large bureaucracies both in the workplace and in their own unions.
consumers discovered the frustrations of bureaucracy in dealing with the large national companies from whom they bought goods and services.
more and more americans were becoming convinced that the key to a successful future lay in acquiring the specialized training and skills necessary for work in large organizations.
the american educational system responded to the demands of this increasingly organized society by experimenting with changes in curriculum and philosophy.
elementary and secondary schools gave increased attention to the teaching of science mathematics and foreign languages particu growth of after launching of the soviet specialized unions sputnik a l of which educators education considered important for the development of skilled specialized professionals.
universities in the meantime were expanding their curricula the affluent society 767 to provide more opportunities for students to develop specialized skills.
the idea of the multiversity a phrase first coined by the chancellor of the university of california at berkeley to describe his institutions diversity represented a commitment to making higher education a training ground for specialists in a wide variety of fields.
the debilitating impact of bureaucratic life on the individual slowly became a central theme of popular and scholarly debate.
william h whyte jr produced one of the most widely discussed books of the decade the organization man 1956 which attempted to describe the special mentality of the worker in a large bureaucratic setting.
self reliance whyte claimed was losing place to the ability to get along and work as a team as the most valued trait in the modern character.
sociologist david riesman had made similar observations in the lonely crowd.
1950 in which he argued that the traditional inner directed man who judged himself on the basis of his own values and the esteem of his family was giving way to a new other directed man more concerned with winning the approval of the larger organization or community.
novelists too expressed misgivings in their work about the impersonality of modern society.
saul bellow produced a series of novels the adventures of augie march 1953 seize the dag 1956 herzog 1964 and many others that chronicled the difficulties american jewish men had in finding fulfillment in modern urban america.

the beats and the restless culture of youth the most caustic critics of bureaucracy and of middle class society in general were a group the beat of young poetswritersand generations artists generally known as critiques the beats or derisively as beatniks.
they wrote harsh critiques of what they considered the sterility and conformity of american life the meaninglessness of american politics and the banality of popular culture.

jack kerouac produced the bible of much of the beat generation in his novel on the road 1957 an account of a cross country automobile trip that depicted the rootless iconoclastic lifestyle of kerouac and his friends.
the beats were the most visible evidence of a widespread restlessness among young americans in the 1950s.
in part that restlessness was a result of prosperity itself of a growing sense among young people of limitless possibilities and of the declining power of such traditional values as thrift discipline and self restraint.
young middle class americans were growing up in a culture that encouraged them to expect rich and fulfilling lives but they were living in a world in which almost all of them experienced obstacles to that fulfillment.
tremendous public attention was directed at the phenomenon of juvenile delinquency and in both politics and popular culture there were dire warnings about the growing criminality of american youth.
the 1955 film blackboard jungle for example was a frightening depiction of crime and violence in city schools.
scholarly studies presidential commissions and journalistic exposes all contributed to the sense of alarm about the spread of delinquency although in fact youth crime did not dramatically increase in the 1950s.
the culture of alienation that the beats so vividly represented had counterparts even in ordinary middle class behavior teenage rebelliousness toward parents youthful fascination with fast cars and motorcycles and the increasing visibility of teenage sex assisted by the greater availability of birth control devices.
the popularity of james dean in such movies as rebel without a cause 1955 east of eden 1955 and giant 1956 conveyed a powerful image of youth culture in the 1950s.

most ppu ar s ow n history of television began as an effort by a young comedian 1 jltjui to strengthen her troubled marriage.
in 1950 lucille ball was performing in a popular weekly cbs radio comedy my favorite husband in which she portrayed a slightly zany housewife who tangled frequently with her banker husband played by richard denning.
the network proposed to transfer the show from radio to television.
lucy said she would do so only if she could replace denning with her real life husband of ten years desi arnaz a cuban born bandleader whose almost constant traveling was putting a strain on their marriage.
network officials tried in vain to talk her out of the idea.
arnaz had no acting experience they told her.
lucy herself recognized another reason for their reluctance the radicalism of portraying an ethnically mixed marriage on the air.
but she held her ground.
on monday october 15 1951 the first episode of i love lucy was broadcast over cbs.
desi arnaz played ricky ricardo a cuban bandleader and singer who spoke at times with a comically exaggerated latin accent.
lucille ball was lucy ricardo his stage struck and slightly dizzy wife.
performing with them were william frawley and vivian vance who played their neighbors and close friends fred and ethel mertz.
in the premiere episode the girls want to go to a nightclub ricky and fred want to go to a boxing match on the night of fred and ethel s anniversary while the wives are arranging an evening at a nightclub the opening episode contained many of the elements that characterized the show throughout its long run and ensured its extraordinary success the remarkable chemistry among the four principal actors the unexpected comedic talent of desi arnaz and most of all the brilliance of lucille ball.
she was a master of physical comedy and many of her funniest moments involved scenes of absurdly incongruous situations lucy working an assembly line lucy stomping grapes in italy.
her characteristic yowl of frustration became one of the most familiar sounds in american culture.
she was a beautiful woman but she never hesitated to make herself look ridiculous.
she was everywoman her longtime writer jess oppenheim once wrote her little expressions and inflections stimulated the shock of recognition in the audience.
but it was not just the great talents of its cast that made love lucy such a phenomenon.
it was the skill of its writers in evoking some of the most common experiences and desires of television viewers in the 1950s.
lucy in particular mined the frustrations of domestic life for all they were worth constantly engaging in zany and hilarious schemes to break into show business or somehow expand her world.
the husbands wanted calm and conventional domestic lives and time to themselves for conspicuously male activities boxing fishing baseball.
in the first seasons the fictional lucy at home although lucy and desi at first portrayed a childless ethnically mixed couple living in a manhattan apartment many of the comic situations in the early years of the show were purely domestic.
here lucy wearing an apron deals with one of her many household predicaments with the extraordinary physical comedy that was part of her great success.
desi watching skeptically was a talented straight man to lucy s zaniness.
cbs photofest couples lived as neighbors without children in a manhattan apartment building.
later lucy had a child and they all moved to the suburbs.
the show used lucy s real life pregnancy on the air and on january 19 1953 only hours after lucille ball gave birth to her real in a car accident dean became an icon of the unfocused rebelliousness of american youth in his time.
rock n roll one of the most powerful cultural forces for american youth was the enormous popularity of rock n roll and of the greatest early rock star elvis presley.
presley became a symbol of a elvis presley youthful determination to push at the borders of the conventional and acceptable.
his sultry good looks his self conscious effort to dress in the vaguely rebellious style of urban gangs motorcycle jackets and slicked back hair and most of all the open sexuality of his music and his public performances made him wildly popular among young americans in the 1950s.
his first great hit heartbreak hotel established him as a national phenomenon in 1956 and he remained a powerful figure in american popular culture until and indeed beyond his death in 1977.

cbs photofest promoting the show the marriage of lucille ball and desi arnaz which paralleled the television marriage of lucy and ricky ricardo was one of the most effective promotional devices for love lucy.

rock around the clock used in the film blackboard jungle served to announce the arrival of rock n roll to millions of young people who were closely connected to african american musical traditions.
rock drew from other sources too from country western music another strong influence on presley from gospel music even from jazz.
but its most important influence was its roots in rhythm and blues.
the rise of such white rock musicians as presley was a result in part of the limited willingness of white audiences to accept black musicians.
but the 1950s did see a growth in the popularity of african american bands and singers among both black and white audiences.
chuck berry little richard b.
ring chubby checker the temptations and others many of them recorded by the african american producer berry gordy the founder and president of motown records in detroit never rivaled presley in their popularity among white youths.
but they did develop a significant multiracial audience of their own.
the rapid rise and enormous popularity of rock owed a great deal to innovations in radio and television programming.
by the 1950s radio stations no longer felt obliged to present mostly live programming.
instead many radio stations devoted themselves to playing recorded music.
early in the 1950s a new breed of radio announcers known now as disc jockeys began to create programming aimed specifically at young fans of rock music and when those programs became wildly successful other stations followed suit.
american bandstand a televised showcase for rock n roll hits that began in 1957 featured a live audience dancing to mostly recorded music.
the show helped spread the popularity of rock and made its.
769 770 chapter 28 host dick clark one of the best known figures in america among young americans.
radio and television were important to the recording industry of course because they encouraged the sale of records.
also important were jukeboxes which played individual songs on 45s records with one song on each side and payola proliferated in soda fountains diners bars scandals und other places where young people were likely to congregate.
sales of records increased threefold from 182 million to 521 million between 1954 and 1960.
so eager were record promoters to get their songs on the air that some routinely made secret payments to station owners and disc jockeys to encourage them to showcase their artists.
these payments which became known as payola produced a briefly sensational series of scandals when they were exposed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
the other america it was relatively easy for white middle class americans in the 1950s to believe that the world they knew a world of economic growth personal affluence and cultural homogeneity was the world all americans experienced that the values and assumptions they shared were ones that most other americans shared too.
but such assumptions were false.
even within the middle class there was considerable restiveness among women intellectuals young people and others who found the middle class consumer culture somehow unsatisfying even stultifying.
more importantly large groups of americans remained outside the circle of abundance and shared in neither the affluence of the middle class nor its values.
on the margins of the affluent society in 1962 the socialist writer michael harrington created a sensation by publishing a book called the other america in which the other chronicled the continuing existence of america poverty in america.
the conditions he described were not new.
only the atten tion he was bringing to them was.
the great economic expansion of the postwar years reduced poverty significantly but did not eliminate it.
in 1960 at any given moment more than a fifth of all american families over 30 million people continued to live below what the government defined as the poverty line down from a third of all families fifteen years before.
many millions more lived just above the official poverty line but with incomes that gave them little comfort and no security.
most of the poor experienced poverty intermittently and temporarily.
eighty percent of those classified as poor at any particular moment were likely to have moved into poverty recently and might move out of it again as soon as they found a job an indication of how unstable employment persistent poverty and hispanics.
could be at the lower levels of the job market.
but approximately 20 percent of the poor were people for whom poverty was a continuous debilitating reality from which there was no easy escape.
that included approximately half the nations elderly and a large proportion of african americans native americans constituted the single poorest group in the country a result of government policies that undermined the economies of the reservations and drove many indians into cities where some lived in a poverty worse than that they had left.
these were the people harrington had written about in the other america people who suffered from what he called a system designed to be impervious to hope this hard core poverty rebuked the assumptions of those who argued that economic growth would eventually lead everyone into prosperity that as many claimed a rising tide lifts all boats it was a poverty that the growing prosperity of the postwar era seemed to affect hardly at all.
declining agricultural prices rural poverty among those on the margins of the affluent society were many rural americans.
in 1948 farmers had received 8 9 percent of the national income in 1956 they received only 4 1 percent.
in part this decline reflected the steadily shrinking farm population in 1956 alone nearly 10 percent of the rural population moved into or was absorbed by cities.
but it also reflected declining farm prices.
because of enormous surpluses in basic staples prices fell 33 percent in those years even though national income as a whole rose 50 percent at the same time.
even most farmers who managed to survive experienced substantial losses of income at the same time that the prices of many consumer goods rose.
not all farmers were poor.
some substantial landowners weathered and even managed to profit from the changes in american agriculture.
others moved from considerable to only modest affluence.
but the agrarian economy did produce substantial numbers of genuinely impoverished people.
black sharecroppers and tenant farmers continued to live at or below subsistence level throughout the rural south in part because of the mechanization of cotton picking beginning in 1944 in part because of the development of synthetic fibers that reduced demand for cotton.
two thirds of the cotton acreage of the south went out of production between 1930 and 1960.
migrant farmworkers a group concentrated especially in the west and southwest and containing many mexican american and asian american workers lived in similarly dire circumstances.
in rural areas without much commercial agriculture such as the appalachian region in the east where the decline of the coal economy reduced the one significant source of support for the region whole communities lived in desperate poverty increasingly cut off from the market economy.
all these groups were vulnerable to malnutrition and even starvation.
the affluent society 771 the inner cities as white families moved from cities to suburbs in vast numbers many inner city neighborhoods became vast repositories for the poor ghettos from which there was no easy escape.
the growth of these neighborhoods owed much to a vast black urban migration of african americans out of the migration countryside and into industrial cities.
more than 3 million black men and women moved from the south to northern cities between 1940 and 1960.
chicago detroit cleveland new york and other eastern and midwestern industrial cities experienced a great expansion of their black populations both in absolute numbers and even more as a percentage of the whole since so many whites were leaving these cities at the same time.
similar migrations from mexico and puerto rico expanded poor hispanic neighborhoods at the same time.
between 1940 and 1960 nearly a million puerto ricans moved into american cities the largest group to new york.
mexican workers crossed the border in texas and california and swelled the already substantial latino communities of such cities as san antonio houston san diego and los angeles which by 1960 had the largest mexican american population of any city approximately 500 000 people.
why so many inner city communities populated largely by racial and ethnic minorities remained so poor in the midst of growing affluence has been the subject of considerable debate.
some critics have argued that the new migrants were victims in part of their own pasts that the work habits values and family structures they brought with them from their rural homes were poorly adapted to the needs of the modern industrial city.
others have argued that the inner city itself its crippling poverty its crime its violence its apparent hopelessness created a culture of poverty that made it difficult for individuals to advance.
many others argue that a combination of declining blue collar jobs inadequate support for minority dominated public schools and barriers to advancement rooted in racism not the culture and values of the poor themselves was the source of inner city poverty.
it is indisputable that inner cities were filling up with poor minority residents at the same time that the unskilled industrial jobs they were seeking were diminishing.
employers were relocating factories and mills from old industrial cities to new locations in suburbs smaller cities and even abroad places where the cost of labor was lower.
even in the factories that remained automation was reducing the number of unskilled jobs.
the economic opportunities that had helped earlier immigrant groups to rise up from poverty were unavailable to most of the postwar migrants.
nor can there be any doubt that historic patterns of racial discrimination in hiring education and housing doomed many members of these communities to continuing and in some cases increasing poverty.
for many years the principal policy response to the poverty of inner cities was urban renewal the effort to tear down buildings in the poorest and most degraded areas.
in the urban twenty years after world war ii urban renewal renewal projects destroyed over 400 000 buildings among them the homes of nearly 1 5 million people.
in some cases urban renewal provided new public housing for poor city residents.
some of it was considerably better than the housing they left some of it was poorly designed and constructed and deteriorated rapidly into dismal and dangerous slums.

m chapter 28 brown v board of education the rise of the civil rights movement after decades of skirmishes an open battle began in the 1950s against racial segregation and discrimination.
although white americans played an important role in the civil rights movement pressure from african americans themselves was the crucial element in raising the issue of race to prominence.
the brown decision and massive resistance on may 17 1954 the supreme court announced its decision in the case of brown v board of education of topeka.
in considering the legal segregation of a kansas public school system the court rejected its own 1896 plessy v ferguson decision which had ruled that communities could provide blacks with separate facilities as long as the facilities were equal to those of whites.
the brown decision was the culmination of many decades of effort by black opponents of segregation and particularly by a group of talented naacp lawyers many of them trained at howard university in washington d c by the great legal educator charles houston.
thurgood marshall william hastie james nabrit and others spent years filing legal challenges to segregation in one state after another nibbling at the edges of the system and accumulating precedents to support their assault on the separate but equal doctrine itself.
the same lawyers filed the suits against the school boards of topeka kansas and several other cities that became the basis for the brown decision.
the topeka suit involved the case of an african american girl who had to travel several miles to a segregated public school every day even though she lived virtually next door to a white elementary school.
when the case arrived before the supreme court the justices examined it not simply in terms of legal precedent but in terms of history sociology and psychology.
they concluded that school segregation inflicted unacceptable damage on those it affected regardless of the relative quality of the separate schools.
chief justice earl warren explained the unanimous opinion of his colleagues we conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.
separate educational facilities are inherently unequal the following year the court issued another decision known as brown ii to provide rules for implementing the 1954 order.
it ruled that communities must work to desegregate their schools with all deliberate speed but it set no timetable and left specific decisions up to lower courts.
separate but equal doctrine overturned massive resistance in some communities for example washington d c compliance came relatively quickly and quietly.
more often however strong local opposition what came to be known in the south as massive resistance produced long delays and bit ter conflicts.
some school districts ignored the ruling altogether.
others attempted to circumvent it with purely token efforts to integrate.
more than 100 southern members of congress signed a manifesto in 1956 denouncing the brown decision and urging their constituents to defy it.
southern governors mayors local school boards and nongovernmental pressure groups including hundreds of white citizens councils all worked to obstruct desegregation.
many school districts enacted pupil placement laws allowing school officials to place students in schools according to their scholastic abilities and social behavior.
such laws were transparent devices for maintaining segregation but in 1958 the supreme l.

g everett collection superstock the affluent society 773 court in shuttlesivorth v birmingham board of education refused to declare them unconstitutional.
by the fall of 1957 only 684 of 3 000 affected school districts in the south had even begun to desegregate their schools.
many white parents simply withdrew their children from the public schools and enrolled them in all white segregation academies some state and local governments diverted money from newly integrated public schools and used it to fund the new all white academies.
the broum decision far from ending segregation had launched a prolonged battle between federal authority and state and local governments and between those who believed in racial equality and those who did not.
the eisenhower administration was not eager to commit itself to that battle.
the president himself had greeted the little rock broivn decision with skepticism and once said it had set back progress on race relations at least fifteen years.
but in september 1957 he faced a case of direct state defiance of federal authority and felt compelled to act.
federal courts had ordered the desegregation of central high school in little rock arkansas.
an angry white mob tried to prevent implementation of the order by blockading the entrances to the school and governor orval faubus refused to do anything to stop the obstruction.
president eisenhower responded by federalizing the arkansas national guard and sending troops to little rock to restore order and ensure that the court orders would be obeyed.
only then did central high school admit its first black students.
the expanding movement montgomery bus boycott the brown decision helped spark a growing number of popular challenges to segregation in the south.
on december 1 1955 rosa parks an african american woman was arrested in montgomery alabama when she refused to give up her seat on a montgomery bus to a white passenger.
parks an active civil rights leader in the community had apparently decided spontaneously to resist the order to move.
her feet were tired she later explained.
but black leaders in montgomery had been waiting for such an incident which they wanted to use to challenge the segregation of the buses.
the arrest of this admired woman produced outrage in the citys african american community and helped local leaders organize a successful boycott of the bus system to demand an end to segregated seating.
the bus boycott owed much of its success to the prior existence of well organized black citizens groups.
a black womens political caucus had in fact been developing plans for a boycott of the segregated buses for some time.
they seized on rosa parks as a symbol of the movement.
once launched the boycott was almost completely effective.
black workers who needed to commute to their jobs of whom the largest group consisted of female domestic servants formed car pools to ride back and forth to work or simply walked at times over long distances.
the boycott put eco nomic pressure not only on the bus company a private martin luther kings strategy concern but on many montgomery merchants as well.
the bus boycotters found it difficult to get to downtown stores and tended to shop instead in their own neighborhoods.
still the boycott might well have failed had it not been for a supreme court decision late in 1956 inspired in part by the protest that declared segregation in public transportation to be illegal.
the buses in montgomery abandoned their discriminatory seating policies and the boycott came to a close.
an important result of the montgomery boycott was the rise to prominence of a new figure in the movement for civil rights.
the man chosen to head the boycott movement was a local baptist pastor martin luther king jr the son of a prominent atlanta minister a powerful orator and a gifted leader.
at first king was reluctant to lead the movement.
but once he accepted the role he became consumed by it.
kings approach to black protest was based on the doctrine of nonviolence that is of passive resistance even in the face of direct attack.
he drew from the teachings of mahatma gandhi the indian nationalist leader from henry david thoreau and his doctrine of civil disobedience and from christian doctrine.
and he produced an approach to racial struggle that captured the moral high ground for his supporters.
he urged african americans to engage in peaceful demonstrations to allow themselves to be arrested even beaten if necessary and to respond to hate with love.
for the next thirteen years as leader of the southern christian leadership conference an interracial group he founded shortly after the bus boycott he was the most influential and most widely admired black leader in the country.
the popular movement he came to represent soon spread throughout the south and throughout the country.
pressure from the courts from northern liberals and from african americans themselves also speeded the pace of racial change in other areas.
one important color line had been breached as early as 1947 when the brooklyn dodgers signed jackie robinson as the first african american to play major league baseball.
by the mid 1950s blacks had established themselves as a powerful force in almost all professional sports.
within the government president eisenhower completed the integration of the armed forces attempted to desegregate the federal workforce and in 1957 signed a civil rights act passed without active support from the white house by a democratic congress providing federal protection for african americans who wished to register to vote.
it was a weak bill with few mechanisms for enforcement but it was the first civil rights bill of any kind to win passage since the end of reconstruction and it served as a signal that the executive and legislative branches were beginning to join the judiciary in the federal commitment to the second reconstruction causes of the civil rights movement why did a civil rights movement begin to emerge at this particular moment.
the injustices it challenged and the goals it promoted were hardly new in theory african americans 774 chapter 28 could have launched the same movement fifty or a hundred years earlier or decades later.
why did they do so in the 1950s and 1960s.
several factors contributed to the rise of african american protest in these years.
the legacy of world war ii was one of w the most important.
millions of black legacy of.
world war ii men an a women had served m the mili tary or worked in war plants during the war and had derived from the experience a broader view of the world and of their place in it.
another factor was the growth of an urban black middle class which had been developing for decades but which began to flourish after the war.
much of the impetus urban black middle class fr the civil rights movement came from the leaders of urban black communities ministers educators professionals and much of it came as well from students at black colleges and universities which had expanded significantly in the previous decades.
men and women with education and a stake in society were often more aware of the obstacles to their advancement than poorer and more oppressed people to whom the possibility of advancement may have seemed too remote even to consider.
and urban blacks had considerably more freedom to associate with one another and to develop independent institutions than did rural blacks who were often under the very direct supervision of white landowners.
television and other forms of popular culture were another factor in the rising consciousness of racism among blacks.
more than any previous generation postwar african americans had constant vivid reminders of how the white majority lived of the world from which they were effectively excluded.
television also conveyed the activities of demonstrators to a national audience ensuring that activism in one community would inspire similar protests in others.
in addition to the forces that were inspiring african americans to mobilize other forces were at work mobilizing many white americans to support the movement once it began.
one was the cold war which made racial injustice an embarrassment to americans trying to present their nation as a model to the world.
another was the political mobilization of northern blacks who were now a substantial voting bloc within the democratic party politicians from northern industrial states could not ignore their views.
labor unions with substantial black memberships also played an important part in supporting and funding the civil rights movement.
eisenhower republicanism dwight d eisenhower was one of the least experienced politicians to serve in the white house in the twentieth century.
he was also among the most popular and politically successful presidents of the postwar era.
at home he pursued essentially moderate policies avoiding most new initiatives but accepting the work of earlier reformers.
abroad he continued and even intensified american commitments to oppose communism but brought to some of those commitments a measure of restraint that his successors did not always match.
what was good for general motors business leaders new outlook the first republican administration in twenty years staffed itself with men drawn from the same quarter as those who had staffed republican administrations in the 1920s the business community.
but by the 1950s many business leaders had acquired a social and political outlook very different from that of their predecessors.
above all many had reconciled themselves to at least the broad outlines of the keynesian welfare state the new deal had launched.
indeed some corporate leaders had come to see it as something that actually benefited them by helping maintain social order by increasing mass purchasing power and by stabilizing labor relations.
to his cabinet eisenhower appointed wealthy corporate lawyers and business executives who were not apologetic about their backgrounds.
charles wilson president of general motors assured senators considering his nomination for secretary of defense that he foresaw no conflict of interest because he was certain that what was good for our country was good for general motors and vice versa eisenhower s consistent inclination was to limit federal activities and encourage private enterprise.
he supported the private rather than public development of natural resources.
to the chagrin of farmers he lowered federal support for farm prices.
he also removed the last limited wage and price controls maintained by the truman administration.
he opposed the creation of new social service programs such as national health insurance.
he strove constantly to reduce federal expenditures even during the recession of 1958 and balance the budget.
he ended 1960 his last full year in office with a 1 billion budget surplus.
ihe survival of the welfare state the president took few new initiatives in domestic policy but he resisted pressure from the right wing of his party to disman federal r ose welfare policies of the new deal highway act a survived the conservative assaults of 1956 of the war years and after.
he agreed to extend the social security system to an additional 10 million people and unemployment compensation to an additional 4 million and he agreed to increase the legal minimum hourly wage from 75 cents to 1.
perhaps the most significant legislative accomplishment of the eisenhower administration was the federal highway act of 1956 which authorized 25 billion for a ten year project that built over 40 000 miles of interstate highways the largest public works project in american history.
the program was to be funded through a highway trust fund whose revenues would come rom new taxes on the purchase of fuel automobiles trucks and tires.
the affluent society 775 the highway bill president dwight eisenhower signs the federal highway act of 1956 into law from the oval office at the white house.
this initiative authorized 25 billion to build more than 40 000 miles of interstate highway.
in 1956 eisenhower ran for a second term even though he had suffered a serious heart attack the previous year.
with adlai stevenson opposing him once again he won by another even greater landslide receiving nearly 57 percent of the popular vote and 457 electoral votes to stevenson s 73.
democrats retained control of both houses of congress which they had won back in 1954.
and in 1958 during a serious recession they increased that control by substantial margins.
the decline of mccarthyism the eisenhower administration did little in its first years in office to discourage the anticommunist furor that had gripped the nation.
by 1954 however the crusade against subversion was beginning to produce significant popular opposition an indication that the anticommunist passion of several years earlier was beginning to abate.
the clearest signal of that change was the political demise of senator joseph mccarthy.
during the first year of the eisenhower administration mccarthy continued to operate with impunity.
but in january 1954 he overreached when he attacked secretary of the army robert stevens and the armed services in general.
at that point the administration and influential members of congress organized a special investigation of the charges which became known as the army mccarthy hearings.
they were among the first congressional hearings to be nationally televised.
the result was devastating to mccarthy.
watching mccarthy in action bullying witnesses hurling groundless and often cruel accusations evading issues much of the public began to see him as a villain and even a buffoon.
in december 1954 the senate voted 67 to 22 to condemn him army mccarthy hearings for conduct unbecoming a senator three years later with little public support left he died a victim apparently of complications arising from alcoholism.
eisenhower dulles and the cold war the threat of nuclear war with the soviet union created a sense of high anxiety in international relations in the 1950s.
but the nuclear threat had another effect as well.
with the potential devastation of an atomic war so enormous both superpowers began to edge away from direct confrontations.
the attention of both the united states and the soviet union began to turn to the rapidly escalating instability in the poor and developing nations of the third world.
dulles and massive retaliation eisenhowers secretary of state and except for the president himself the dominant figure in the nations foreign policy in the 1950s was john foster dulles an aristocratic corporate lawyer with a stern moral revulsion to communism.
he entered office denouncing the containment policies of the truman years as excessively passive arguing that the united states should pursue an active program of liberation which would lead to a rollback of communist expansion.
once in power however he had to defer to the more moderate views of the president himself.
the most prominent of dulless innovations was the policy of massive retaliation which dulles announced early in 1954.
776 chapter 28 the united states would he explained respond to communist economic threats to its allies not by using conven benefits of massive retaliation tional forces in local conflicts a policy that had led to so much frustration in korea but by relying on the deterrent of massive retaliatory power by which he meant nuclear weapons.
in part the new doctrines reflected dulles s inclination for tense confrontations an approach he once defined as brinksmanship pushing the soviet union to the brink of war in order to exact concessions.
but the real force behind the massive retaliation policy was economics.
with pressure growing both in and out of government for a reduction in american military expenditures an increasing reliance on atomic weapons seemed to promise as some advocates put it more bang for the buck france america and vietnam what had been the most troubling foreign policy concern of the truman years the war in korea plagued the eisenhower administration only briefly.
on july 27 1953 negotiators at panmunjom finally signed an agreement ending the hostilities.
each antagonist was to withdraw its troops a mile and a half from the existing battle line which ran roughly along the 38th parallel the prewar border between north and south korea.
a conference in geneva was to consider means by which to reunite the nation peacefully although in fact the 1954 meeting produced no agreement and left the ceasefire line as the apparently permanent border between the two countries.
almost simultaneously however the united states was being drawn into a long bitter struggle in southeast asia.
vietnam a colony of france was facing strong opposition from nationalists led by ho chi minh a communist.
when french troops became surrounded in a disastrous siege in north vietnam only american intervention it was dien bien dear cou prevent the total collapse of phu the french military effort.
yet despite the urgings of secretary of state dulles vice president nixon and others eisenhower refused to permit direct american military intervention in vietnam claiming that neither congress nor america s other allies would support such action.
cold war crises american foreign policy in the 1950s rested on a reasonably consistent foundation the containment policy as revised by the truman and eisenhower administrations.
but the nations leaders spent much of their time reacting to both real and imagined crises in far flung areas of the world.
among the cold war challenges the eisenhower administration eisenhower and dulles although president eisenhower was a somewhat colorless television personality his was th f h promote its policies and dramatize its actions.

6 bettmann corbis recognizing israel resolved some confronted were a series of crises in the middle east a region in which the united states had been little involved until after world war ii.
on may 14 1948 after years of zionist efforts and a dramatic decision by the new united nations israel proclaimed its independence.
president truman recognized the new jewish homeland the next day.
but the creation of israel while it conflicts created others.
palestinian arabs unwilling to accept being displaced from what they considered their own country joined with israels arab neighbors and fought determinedly against the new state in 1948 the first of several arab israeli wars.
committed as the american government was to israel it was also concerned about the stability and friendliness of the arab regimes in the oil rich middle east in which american petroleum companies had major investments.
thus the united states reacted with alarm as it watched mohammad mossadegh the nationalist prime minister of iran begin to resist the presence of western corporations in his nation in the early 1950s.
in 1953 the american cia joined forces with conservative iranian military leaders to engineer a coup that drove mossadegh from office.
to replace him the cia helped elevate the young shah of iran mohammad reza pahlevi from his position as token constitutional monarch to that of virtually absolute ruler.
the shah remained closely tied to the united states for the next twenty five years.
american policy was less effective in dealing with the nationalist government of egypt under the leadership of general gamal abdel nasser which began to develop a trade relationship with the soviet union in the suez crisis early 1950s in 1956 t0 punish nasser for his friendliness toward the communists dulles withdrew american offers to assist in building the great aswan dam across the nile.
a week later nasser retaliated by seizing control of the suez canal from the british saying that he would use the income from it to build the dam himself.
on october 29 1956 israeli forces attacked egypt.
the next day the british and french landed troops in the suez to drive the egyptians from the canal.
dulles and eisenhower feared that the suez crisis would drive the arab states toward the soviet union and precipitate a new world war.
by refusing to support the invasion and by joining in a united nations denunciation of it the united states helped pressure the french and british to withdraw and helped persuade israel to agree to a truce with egypt.
cold war concerns affected american relations in latin america as well.
in 1954 the eisenhower administration ordered the cia to help topple the new leftist government of jacobo arbenz guzman in guatemala a regime that dulles responding to the entreaties of the united fruit company a major investor in guatemala fearful of arbenz argued was potentially communist.
no nation in the region had been more closely tied to america than cuba.
its leader fulgencio batista had ruled as a military dictator since 1952 when with american assistance he had toppled a more moderate govern fidel castro.
cubas relatively prosperous economy had become a virtual fiefdom of american corporations which controlled almost all the islands natural resources and had cornered over half the vital sugar crop.
american organized crime syndicates controlled much of havanas lucrative hotel and nightlife business.
in 1957 a popular movement of resistance to the batista regime began to gather strength 778 chapter 28 under the leadership of fidel castro.
on january 1 1959 with batista having fled to exile in spain castro marched into havana and established a new government.
castro soon began implementing radical policies of land reform and expropriating foreign owned businesses and resources.
cuban american relations deteriorated rapidly as a result.
when castro began accepting assistance from the soviet union in 1960 the united states cut back the quota by which cuba could export sugar to america at a favored price.
early in 1961 as one of its last acts the eisenhower administration severed diplomatic relations with castro.
isolated by the united states castro soon cemented an alliance with the soviet union.
europe and the soviet union although the problems of the third world were moving slowly toward the center of american foreign policy the direct relationship with the soviet union and the effort to resist communist expansion in europe remained the principal concerns of the eisenhower administration.
in 1955 hungarian revolution of 1956 eisenhower and other nato leaders met with the soviet premier nikolai bulganin at a cordial summit conference in geneva.
but when a subsequent conference of for eign ministers met to try to resolve specific issues they could find no basis for agreement.
relations between the soviet union and the west soured further in 1956 in response to the hungarian revolution.
hungarian dissidents had launched a popular uprising in november to demand democratic reforms.
before the month was out soviet tanks and troops entered budapest to crush the uprising and restore an orthodox pro soviet regime.
the eisenhower administration refused to intervene.
the u 2 crisis in november 1958 nikita khrushchev who had succeeded bulganin as soviet premier and communist party chief earlier that year renewed the demands of his predecessors that the nato powers abandon west berlin.
when the united states and its allies predictably refused khrushchev the cuban revolution fidel castro is shown here in the cuban jungle in 1957 with a small group of his staff and their raoul.

bettmann corbis the affluent society 779 suggested that he and eisenhower discuss the issue personally both in visits to each others countries and at a summit meeting in paris in 1960.
the united states agreed.
khrushchevs 1959 visit to america produced a cool but mostly polite public response.
plans proceeded for the summit conference and for eisenhowers visit to moscow shortly thereafter.
only days before the scheduled beginning of the paris meeting however the soviet union announced that it had shot down an american u 2 a high altitude spy plane over russian territory.
its pilot francis gary powers was in captivity.
khrushchev lashed out angrily at the american incursion into soviet air space breaking up the paris summit almost before it could begin and withdrawing his invitation to eisenhower to visit the soviet union.
looking back the booming economic growth of the 1950s and the anxiety over the cold war that formed a backdrop to it shaped the politics and the culture of the decade.
for most americans the 1950s were years of increasing personal prosperity.
sales of private homes increased dramatically suburbs grew precipitously young families had children at an astounding rate creating what came to be known as the postwar baby boom after the end of the divisive korean war the nations politics entered a period of relative calm symbolized by the genial presence in the white house of dwight d eisenhower who provided moderate and undemanding leadership through most of the decade.
the nations culture too helped create a broad sense of stability and calm.
television which emerged in the 1950s as the most powerful medium of mass culture presented largely uncontroversial programming dominated by middle class im after eight years in office eisenhower had failed to eliminate and in some respects had actually increased the tensions between the united states and the soviet union.
yet eisenhower had brought to the cold war eisenhowers.
r i restraint als own sense the limits of american power.
he had resisted military intervention in vietnam.
and he had placed a measure of restraint on those who urged the creation of an enormous american military establishment.
in his farewell address in january 1961 he warned of the unwarranted influence of a vast military industrial complex his caution in both domestic and international affairs stood in marked contrast to the attitudes of his successors who argued that the united states must act more boldly and aggressively on behalf of its goals at home and abroad.
ages and traditional values.
movies theater popular magazines and newspapers generally contributed to a broad sense of well being.
but the 1950s were not in the end as calm and contented as the politics and popular culture of the time suggested.
a powerful youth culture emerged in these years that displayed a considerable level of restiveness and even disillusionment.
african americans began to escalate their protests against segregation and inequality.
the continuing existence of widespread poverty among large groups of americans attracted increasing attention as the decade progressed.
these pulsing anxieties combined with frustration over the continuing tensions of the cold war produced by the late 1950s a growing sense of impatience with the calm placid public culture of the time.
that was one reason for the growing desire for action and innovation as the 1960s began.

why did the civil rights movement become increasingly assertive and militant over the course of the 1960s.
how did u s involvement in vietnam escalate through the 1960s.
what were the political and social consequences of that escalation in both vietnam and the united states.
setting the stage by the late 1950s a growing restlessness was bubbling beneath the apparently placid surface of american society.
anxiety about americas position in the world growing pressures from african americans and other minorities the increasing visibility of poverty the rising frustrations of women and other long suppressed discontents were beginning to shake the nation s public life.
ultimately that restlessness would make the 1960s one of the most turbulent eras of the twentieth century.
but at first it contributed to a bold and confident effort by political leaders and popular movements to attack social and international problems within the framework of conventional liberal politics.
at the same time challenges to liberalism emerged from both the left and the right.
the civil rights movement grew rapidly in the early 1960s and quickly evolved into a diverse set of movements some of which adopted radical and even revolutionary goals.
student disenchantment also grew dramatically in the 1960s becoming a powerful and increasingly disruptive force on campuses and beyond.
finally u s involvement in the war in vietnam led eventually to a commitment of over half a million american troops and resulted in over 55 000 american deaths.
it also produced an unprecedentedly large opposition movement in the united states.
by the end of the 1960s the united states had entered what was in many ways a fundamentally new period in its history.
the 1960s produced a searing critique of american life which greatly transformed both the politics and culture of the nation.
the moderate center had dominated american life for decades before the 1960s.
in the aftermath of the decade american society became increasingly fragmented and at times polarized.
expanding the liberal state those who yearned for a more active government in the late 1950s and who accused the eisenhower administration of allowing the nation to drift looked above all to the presidency for leadership.
the two men who served in the white house through most of the 1960s john kennedy and lyndon johnson seemed for a time to be the embodiment of these liberal hopes.
john kennedy the presidential campaign of 1960 produced two young candidates who claimed to offer the nation active leadership.
the republican nomination went almost uncontested to vice president richard nixon who promised moderate reform.
the democrats in the meantime emerged from a spirited primary campaign united somewhat uneasily behind john fitzgerald kennedy an attractive and articulate senator from massachusetts who had narrowly missed being the partys vice presidential candidate in 1956.
john kennedy was the son of the wealthy powerful and highly controversial joseph p kennedy former american ambassador to britain.
but while he had grown up in a world of ease election privilege he became a spokesman for personal sacrifice and energetic of 1960 progress.
his appealing public image was at least as important as his political positions in attracting popular support.
he overcame doubts about his youth he turned forty three in 1960 and religion he was catholic to win with a tiny plurality of the popular vote 49 7 percent to nixons 49 6 percent and only a slightly more comfortable electoral majority 303 to 219.
kennedy had campaigned promising a set of domestic reforms more ambitious than any since the new deal a program he described as the new frontier but his thin popular mandate and a congress dominated by a coalition of republicans and conservative democrats frustrated many of his hopes.
kennedy did manage to win approval of tariff reductions his administration had negotiated and he began to build an ambitious legislative agenda that he hoped he might eventually see enacted including a call for a significant tax cut to promote economic growth more than any other president of the century except perhaps the two roosevelts and later ronald reagan kennedy made his own personality an integral part of his presidency and a central civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 783 candidate party electoral vote popular vote john f kennedy democratic 34 227 096 49 7 richard m nixon 71q 34 108 546 republican 49 6 harry f byrd dixiecrat 15 501 643 0 7 other candidates 197 029 prohibition socialist labor constitution socialist workers states rights 64 of electorate voting the election of 1960 the election of 1960 was in the popular vote at least one of the closest in american history.
john kennedys margin over richard nixon was less than one third of 1 percent of the total national vote but greater in the electoral college.
note the distribution of electoral strength of the two candidates.
kennedy was strong in the industrial northeast and the largest industrial states of the midwest and he retained at least a portion of his party s traditional strength in the south and southwest.
but nixon made significant inroads into the upper south carried florida and swept most of the plains and mountain states.
l vhof was the significance of this distribution of strength to the future of the two parties.
kennedy focus of national attention.
nothing illus assassinated trated that more clearly than the popular reaction to the tragedy of november 22 1963.
kennedy had traveled to texas with his wife and vice president lyndon johnson for a series of political appearances.
while the presidential motorcade rode slowly through the streets of dallas shots rang out.
two bullets struck the president one in the throat the other in the head.
he was sped to a nearby hospital where minutes after arriving he was pronounced dead.
lee harvey oswald who appeared to be a confused and embittered marxist was arrested for the crime later that day and then mysteriously murdered by a dallas nightclub owner jack ruby two days later.
most americans at the time accepted the conclusions of a federal commission appointed president johnson and chaired by chief justice earl warren which found that both oswald and ruby had acted alone that there was no conspiracy.
in later years however many americans came to believe that the warren commission report had ignored evidence of a broad conspiracy behind the murders.
even after fifty years some people still believe in the conspiracies associated with the president s assassination.
and fifty years after his death kennedy s popularity remains high.
lyndon johnson the kennedy assassination was a national trauma a defining event for almost everyone old enough to be aware of it.
at the time however much of the nation took comfort in the personality and performance of kennedy s successor in the white house lyndon baines johnson.
johnson was a native of the poor hill country of west texas and had risen to become majority leader of the u s senate by dint of extraordinary even obsessive effort and ambition.
having failed to win the democratic nomination for president in 1960 he surprised many who knew him by agreeing to accept the second position on the ticket with kennedy.
the events in dallas thrust him into the white house.
johnsons rough edged even crude personality could hardly have been more different from kennedys.
but like kennedy pictures getty images i.
688 chapter 25 it sanctioned japanese dominance in east asia.
the united states and britain had to spread their fleets across the globe japan was concerned only with the pacific.
the washington conference also produced two other related treaties the nine power pact pledging a continuation of the open door policy in china and the four power pact by which the united states britain france and japan promised to respect one anothers pacific territories and cooperate to prevent aggression.
the washington conference began the new era effort to protect the peace and the international economic interests of kellogg unitec states without accepting active briand pact international duties.
the kellogg briand pact of 1928 concluded it.
when the french foreign minister aristide briand asked the united states in 1927 to join an alliance against germany secretary of state frank kellogg who had replaced hughes in 1925 instead proposed a multilateral treaty outlawing war as an instrument of national policy.
fourteen nations signed the agreement in paris on august 27 1928 amid great solemnity and wide international acclaim.
forty eight other nations later joined the pact.
it contained no instruments of enforcement but rested as kellogg put it on the tnoral force of world opinion.
debts and diplomacy the first responsibility of diplomacy hughes kellogg and others agreed was to ensure that american overseas trade faced no obstacles to expansion and would remain free of interference.
preventing a dangerous armaments race and reducing the possibility of war were steps to that end.
so were new financial arrangements that emerged at the same time.
the united states was most concerned about europe on whose economic health american prosperity in large part depended.
not only were the major european industrial powers suffering from the devastation world war i had produced they were also staggering under a heavy burden of debt.
the allied forces were struggling to repay 11 billion in loans they had contracted with the united states during and shortly after the war loans that the republican administrations were unwilling to reduce or forgive.
they hired the money didnt they calvin coolidge once replied when asked if he favored offering europe relief from their debts.
at the same time an even more debilitated germany was attempting to pay the reparations levied against it by the allies.
with the financial structure of europe on the brink of collapse the united states stepped in with a solution.
in 1924 charles g dawes an american banker and diplomat negotiated an agreement under which american banks would provide enormous loans to the germans enabling them circular t0 meet their reparations payments in loans return britain and france would agree to reduce the amount of those payments.
dawes won the nobel peace prize for his efforts but in fact the dawes plan did little to solve the problems it addressed.
it led to a troubling circular pattern in international finance.
america would lend money to germany which would use that money u s production methods in the soviet union this photograph from about 1930 shows american turbines used in a soviet power station built by americans as part of the first five year plan of soviet economic growth.
soviet planners were so impressed with american methods of mass production they called the system of large scale factory production fordism after american automobile manufacturer henry ford.
the granger collection new york to pay reparations to france and england which would in turn use those funds as well as large loans they themselves were receiving from american banks to repay war debts to the united states.
the flow was able to continue only by virtue of the enormous debts germany and the other european nations were accumulating to american banks and corporations.
those banks and corporations were doing more than providing loans.
they were becoming a daily presence in the economic life of europe.
american automobile manufacturers were opening european factories capturing a large share of the overseas market.
other american industries in the 1920s were establishing subsidiaries worth more than 10 billion throughout the continent taking advantage of the devastation of european industry and the inability of domestic corporations to recover.
some groups within the u s government warned that the reckless expansion of overseas loans and investments many in enterprises of dubious value threatened disaster that the united states was becoming too dependent on unstable european economies.
the high tariff barriers that the republican congress had erected through the fordney mccumber act of 1922 were creating additional problems such skeptics warned.
european nations unable to export their goods to the united states were finding it difficult to earn the money necessary to repay their loans.
such warnings fell for the most part on deaf ears.
the u s government felt even fewer reservations about assisting american economic expansion in latin america.
economic during the 1920s american military expansion in forces maintained a presence in numer latin america ous countries in the region.
united states investments in latin america more than doubled between 1924 and 1929 american corporations built roads and other facilities in many areas partly they argued to weaken the appeal of revolutionary forces in the region but at least equally to increase their own access to latin americas rich the global crisis 1921 1941 689 natural resources.
united states banks were offering large loans to latin american governments just as they were in europe and just as in europe the latin americans were having great difficulty earning the money to repay them in the face of the formidable u s tariff barrier.
by the end of the 1920s resentment of yankee imperialism was growing rapidly.
the economic troubles after 1929 would only accentuate such problems.
hoover and the world crisis after the relatively placid international climate of the 1920s the diplomatic challenges facing the hoover administration must have seemed ominous and bewildering.
the world financial crisis that began in 1929 and greatly intensified after 1931 was not only creating economic distress it was also producing a dangerous nationalism that threatened the weak international agreements established during the previous decade.
above all the depression was toppling some existing political leaders and replacing them with powerful belligerent governments bent on expansion as a solution to their economic problems.
hoover was confronted therefore with the beginning of a process that would ultimately lead to war.
in latin america hoover worked studiously to repair some of the damage created by earlier american policies.
he made a ten week goodwill tour through the region before his inauguration.
once in office he tried to abstain from intervening in the internal affairs of neighboring nations and moved to withdraw american troops from haiti.
when economic distress led to the collapse of one latin american regime after another hoover announced a new policy the united states would grant diplomatic recognition to any sitting government in the region without questioning the means it had used to obtain power.
he even repudiated the roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine by refusing to permit u s intervention when several latin american countries defaulted on debt obligations to the united states in october 1931.
in europe the administration enjoyed few successes in its efforts to promote economic stability.
when hoovers proposed moratorium on debts in 1931 failed to attract broad support or produce financial stability see pp.
641 643 many economists and political leaders appealed to the president to cancel all war debts to the united states.
like his predecessors hoover refused and several european nations promptly went into default severely damaging an already tense international climate.
the ineffectiveness of diplomacy in europe was particularly troubling in view of some of the new governments coming to power on the continent.
benito mussolinis fascist party had been in control of italy since the early 1920s by the 1930s the regime was growing increasingly nationalistic and militaristic and fascist leaders were loudly threatening an active campaign of imperial expansion.
more ominous was the growing power of the national socialist or nazi party in germany.
by the late 1920s the weimar republic the nations government since the end of world war i had lost virtually all popular support discredited by among other things a ruinous inflation.
adolf hitler the stridently nationalistic leader of the nazis was rapidly growing in popular favor.
although he lost a 1932 election for chancellor hitler would sweep into power less than a year later.
his belief in the racial superiority of the aryan german people his commitment to providing lebensraum living space for his master race his pathological anti semitism and his passionate militarism all posed a great threat to european and world peace.
more immediately alarming to the hoover administration was a major crisis in asia another early step toward world war ii.
hitler and mussolini the german and italian dictators shown here reviewing nazi troops in the mid 1930s acted publicly as if they were equals.
privately hitler treated mussolini with contempt and mussolini complained constantly of being a junior partner in the relationship.

690 chapter 25 the japanese reeling from an economic depression of their own were concerned about the increasing strength of the soviet manchuria union and of premier chiang kai sheks nationalist china.
in particular they were alarmed at chiangs insistence on expanding his governments power in manchuria which remained officially a part of china but over which the japanese had maintained effective economic control since 1905.
when the moderate government of japan failed to take forceful steps to counter chiangs ambitions japans military leaders staged what was in effect a coup in the autumn of 1931 seizing control of foreign policy from the weakened liberals.
weeks later they launched a major invasion of northern manchuria.
see america in the world pp.
the american government had few options.
for a while secretary of state henry stimson who had served as secretary of war under taft continued to hope that japanese moderates would regain control of the tokyo government and halt the invasion.
the militarists however remained in command and by the beginning of 1932 the conquest of manchuria was complete.
stimson issued stern but ineffectual warnings to japan and tried to use moral suasion to end the crisis.
but hoover forbade him to cooperate with the league of nations in imposing economic sanctions against the japanese.
stimsons only real tool in dealing with the manchurian invasion was a refusal to grant diplomatic recognition to the new japanese territories.
japan was unconcerned and early in 1932 expanded its aggression farther into china attacking the city of shanghai and killing thousands of civilians.
by the time hoover left office early in 1933 it was clear that the international system the united states had attempted to create in the 1920s a system based on voluntary cooperation among nations and on an american refusal to commit to the interests of other countries had collapsed.
the united states faced a choice.
it could adopt a more energetic form of internationalism and enter into firmer and more meaningful associations with other nations.
or it could resort to nationalism and rely on its own devices for dealing with its own and the worlds problems.
for the next six years it experimented with elements of both approaches.
isolationism and internationalism the administration of franklin roosevelt faced a dual challenge as it entered office in 1933 it had to deal with the worst economic crisis in the nations history and it had to deal with failure of americas interwar diplomacy the bombing of chungking 1940 chungking now chongqing was the capital of china under the nationalist government of some of the most savage fighting of the sino japanese war.

the two problems were not unrelated.
it was the worldwide depression itself that was producing much of the political chaos throughout the globe.
through most of the 1930s however the united states was unwilling to make more than faint gestures toward restoring stability to the world.
like many other peoples suffering economic hardship most americans were turning inward.
yet the realities of world affairs were not to allow the nation to remain isolated for very long as franklin roosevelt soon realized.
depression diplomacy perhaps roosevelts sharpest break with the policies of his predecessor was on the question of american economic relations with europe.
hoover had argued that only by resolving the question of war debts and reinforcing the gold standard could the american economy hope to recover.
he had therefore agreed that the united states would participate in the world economic conference to be held in london in june 1933 to fdrs try to reslve these issues.
by the time bombshell the conference assembled however roosevelt was president.
he had already decided to allow the gold value of the dollar to fall to enable american goods to compete in world markets.
shortly after the conference convened roosevelt released a famous bombshell message repudiating the orthodox views of most of the delegates and rejecting any agreement on currency stabilization.
the conference quickly dissolved without reaching agreement and not until 1936 did the administration finally agree to new negotiations to stabilize western currencies.
at the same time roosevelt abandoned the commitments of the hoover administration to settle the issue of war debts through international agreement.
in effect he simply let the issue die.
in april 1934 he signed a bill to forbid american banks to make loans to any nation in default on its debts.
the result was to stop the old circular system within months war debt payments from every nation except finland stopped for good.
although the new administration had no interest in international currency stabilization or settlement of war debts it did have an active interest in improving americas position in world trade.
roosevelt approved the reciprocal trade agreement act of 1934 authorizing the administration to negotiate treaties lowering tariffs by as much as 50 percent in return for reciprocal reductions by other nations.
by 1939 secretary of state cordell hull a devoted free trader had nego reciprocal trade agreement act america and the soviet union americas hopes of expanding its foreign trade helped produce efforts by the roosevelt administration to improve relations with the soviet union.
the united states and russia had viewed each other with mistrust and even hostility since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 and the american government still had not officially recognized the soviet regime by 1933.
but powerful voices within the united states were urging a change in policy because the soviet union appeared to be a possible source of trade.
the russians too were eager for a new relationship.
they were hoping in particular for american cooperation in containing the power of japan which soviet leaders feared as a threat to russia from the southeast.
in november 1933 therefore soviet foreign minister maxim litvinov reached an agreement with president roosevelt in washington the soviets would cease their propaganda efforts in the united states and protect american citizens in russia in return the united states would recognize the soviet regime.
despite this promising beginning however relations with the soviet union soon soured once again.
american trade failed to establish much of a foothold in russia and the soviets received no reassurance from the united states that it was interested in stopping japanese expansion in asia.
by the end of 1934 as a result of these disappointed hopes on both sides the soviet union and the united states were once again viewing each other with considerable mistrust.
the good neighbor policy somewhat more successful were american efforts to enhance both diplomatic and economic relations with latin america through what became known as the good neighbor policy latin america was one of the most important targets of the new policy of trade reciprocity.
during the 1930s the united states succeeded in increasing both exports to and imports from the other nations of the western hemisphere by over 100 percent.
closely tied to these new economic relationships was a new u s attitude toward intervention in latin america.
the hoover administration had unofficially abandoned the earlier u s practice of using military force to compel latin american governments to repay debts respect foreign investments or otherwise behave responsibly the roosevelt administration went further.
at the inter american conference december 1933 secretary of state hull signed a formal convention declaring no state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another roosevelt respected that pledge throughout his years in office.
the good neighbor policy did not mean however that the united states had abandoned its influence in latin america.
instead of military force americans now tried to use economic influence.
the new reliance on economic pressures eased tensions between the united states and its neighbors considerably.
it did nothing to stem the growing u s domination of the latin american economies.
in montevideo in inter american conference tiated new treaties with twenty one countries.
the result was an increase in american exports of nearly 40 percent.
but most of the agreements admitted only products not competitive with american ndustry and agriculture so imports into the united states ontinued to lag.
thus other nations were not obtaining the american currency needed to buy american products or pay ff debts to american banks.
the sino japanese war 1931 1941 t w t f before pearl harbor well before war broke out in europe in 1939 the first shots u u lai v3 of what would become world war ii had been fired in the pacific in a conflict between japan and china japan emerged from world war i as a great world power with a proud and powerful military and growing global trade.
but the great depression created severe economic problems for the japanese in part because of stiff new american tariffs on silk imports.
as in other parts of the world entering manchuria 1931 japanese troops pour into mukden now shenyang the capital of the chinese province of manchuria in 1931 following a staged incident that allowed japan to claim that its troops had been attacked.
the so called mukden incident marked the beginning of the long sino japanese war.
hulton archive getty images the crisis strengthened the political influence of highly nationalistic and militaristic leaders.
japanese militarists dreamed of a new empire in the pacific that would give japan access to fuel raw materials and markets for its industries as well as land for its agricultural needs and its rapidly increasing population.
such an empire they argued would free asia from exploitation by europe and america and would create a new world order based on moral principles.
during world war i japan had seized territory and economic concessions in china and had created a particularly strong presence in the northern chinese region of manchuria.
there in september 1931 a group of militant young army officers seized on a railway explosion to justify a military campaign through which they conquered the entire province.
both the united states government and the league of nations demanded that japan evacuate manchuria.
the japanese ignored them and for the next six years consolidated their control over their new territory.
on july 7 1937 japan began a wider war when it attacked chinese troops at the marco polo bridge outside beijing.
over the next few weeks japanese forces overran a large part of southern china including most of the port cities killing many chinese soldiers and civilians in the process.
particularly notorious was the japanese annihilation of many thousands of civilians in the city of nanjing the number has long been in dispute but estimates range from 80 000 to more than 300 000 in an event that became known in china and the west as the nanjing massacre.
the chinese government fled to the mountains.
as in 1931 the united states and the league of nations protested in vain.
the china that the japanese had invaded was a nation in turmoil.
it was engaged in a civil war between the so called kuomintang a nationalist party led by chiang kai shek and the chinese communist party led by mao zedong and this internal struggle weakened mussolini withdrew from the talks.
two years later japan withdrew from the london naval conference which was attempting to draw up an agreement to continue the limitations on naval armaments negotiated at the washington conference of 1921.
faced with a choice between more active efforts to stabilize the world and more energetic attempts to isolate the nation from it most americans unhesitatingly chose the lat sources of ter support fr isolationism emerged isolationism from many quarters.
old wilsonian internationalists had grown disillusioned with the rise of isolationism the first years of the roosevelt administration marked not only the death of hoovers hopes for international economic agreements but the end of any hopes for world peace through treaties and disarmament as well.
the arms control conference in geneva had been meeting without result since 1932 and in may 1933 roosevelt attempted to spur it to action by submitting a new american proposal for arms reductions.
negotiations stalled and then broke down and only a few months later first hitler and then 692 the global crisis 1921 1941 693 china s capacity to resist invasion.
but beginning in 1937 the two chinese rivals agreed to an uneasy truce and began fighting the japanese together with some success bogging the japanese military down in a seemingly endless war and imposing hardships on the japanese people at home.
the japanese government and the military however remained determined to continue the war against china whatever the sacrifices.
one result of the costs of the war for japan was its growing depen dence on the united states for steel and oil to meet civilian and military needs.
in july 1941 in an effort to pressure the japanese to stop their expansion the roosevelt administration made it impossible for the japanese to continue buying american oil japan now faced a choice between ending its war in china and finding other sources of fuel to keep its war effort and its civilian economy going.
it chose to extend the war beyond china in a search for oil.
the best available sources were in the dutch east indies but the only way to secure that european colony the japanese believed would be to neutralize the united states in asia.
visionary military planners in japan began advocating a daring move to immobilize the americans in the pacific before expanding the war elsewhere with an attack on the u s naval base at pearl harbor.
the first blow of world war ii in america therefore was the culmination of more than a decade of japanese efforts to conquer china.

other americans were listening to the argument popular among populist minded politicians in the midwest and west that powerful business interests wall street munitions makers and others had tricked the united states into participating in world war i.
an investigation by a senate committee chaired by senator gerald nye of north dakota revealed exorbitant profiteering and blatant tax evasion by many corporations during the war and it suggested on the basis of little evidence that bankers had pressured m ilson to intervene in the war so as to protect their loans abroad.
roosevelt himself shared some of the suspicions voiced by the isolationists and claimed to be impressed by the findings of the nye investigation.
nevertheless he continued to hope for at least a modest american role in maintaining world peace.
in 1935 he asked the senate to ratify a treaty to make the united states a member of the world court a treaty that would have expanded americas symbolic commitment to internationalism without increasing its actual responsibilities in any important way.
nevertheless isolationist opposition spurred by unrelenting hostility from the hearst newspapers and a passionate broadcast by father charles coughlin on the eve of the senate vote resulted in the defeat of the treaty.
it was a devastating political blow to the president and he did not soon again attempt to challenge the isolationist tide.
that tide seemed to grow stronger in the following months.
through the summer of 1935 it became clear that mussolinis italy was preparing to invade ethiopia in an effort to expand its colonial holdings in africa.
fearing that a general european war would result american legislators began to design legal safeguards to prevent the united states from being dragged into the conflict.
the result was the neutrality act of 1935.
the 1935 act and the neutrality acts of 1936 and 1937 that followed was designed to prevent a recurrence of the events that many americans now believed had pressured the united states into world war i.
the 1935 law established a t mandatory arms embargo against both vic neutrality acts tim and aggressor in any military conflict and empowered the president to warn american citizens that they might travel on the ships of warring nations only at their own risk.
thus isolationists believed the protection of neutral rights could not again become an excuse for american intervention in war.
the 1936 neutrality act renewed these provisions.
and in 1937 with world conditions growing even more precarious congress passed a new neutrality act that established the so called cash and carry policy by which belligerents could purchase only nonmilitary goods from the united states and had to pay cash and carry the goods away on their own vessels.
the american stance of militant neutrality gained support in october 1935 when mussolini finally launched his ethiopia long anticipated attack on ethiopia.
when the league of nations protested italy simply resigned from the organization completed its conquest of ethiopia and formed an alliance the axis with nazi germany.
most americans responded to the news with renewed determination to isolate themselves from european instability.
two thirds of those responding to public opinion polls at the time opposed any american action to deter aggression.
isolationist sentiment showed its strength once again in 1936 1937 in response to the civil war in spain.
the falangists a group much like the italian fascists revolted in july 1936 against the existing republican government.
hitler and mussolini supported general francisco franco who became the leader of the falangists in 1937 694 chapter 25 1 i i the spanish civil war many americans took up arms to help the republican forces fight against franco and his army.

particularly disturbing was the deteriorating situation in asia.
japan s aggressive designs against china had been clear since the invasion of manchuria in 1931.
in the summer of 1937 tokyo launched an even broader assault attacking chinas five northern provinces.
see america in the world pp.
the united states roosevelt believed could not allow the japanese aggression to go unremarked or unpunished.
in a speech in chicago in october 1937 therefore the president warned forcefully of the dangers that japanese aggression posed to world peace.
aggressors he proclaimed should be quarantined by the international community to prevent the contagion of war from spreading.
the president was deliberately vague about what such a quarantine would mean.
nevertheless public response to the speech was disturbingly hostile.
as a result roosevelt drew back.
only months later another episode provided renewed evidence of how formidable the obstacles to roosevelts efforts remained.
on december 12 1937 japanese aviators bombed and sank the u s gunboat panay as it sailed the yangtze river in china.
the attack was almost undoubtedly deliberate.
it occurred in broad daylight with clear visibility.
a large american flag had been painted conspicuously on the panays deck.
even so isolationists seized eagerly on japanese protestations that the bombing had been an accident and pressured the administration to accept japans apologies.
the failure of munich hitlers determination to expand german power became fully visible in 1936 when he moved the revived german army into the rhineland violating the versailles treaty and rearming an area that france had in effect controlled since world war i.
in march 1938 german forces marched into austria and hitler proclaimed a union or anschluss between austria his native land and germany his adopted one thus fulfilling his longtime dream of uniting the german speaking peoples in one great nation.
neither in america nor in most of europe was there much more than a murmur of opposition.
the austrian invasion however soon created another crisis because hitler had by now occupied territory surrounding three sides of western czechoslovakia a region he dreamed of annexing to provide germany with the lebensraum living space he believed it needed.
in september 1938 he demanded that czechoslovakia cede to him part of that region the sudetenland an area on the austro german border in which many ethnic germans lived.
czechoslovakia which possessed substantial military power of its own was prepared to fight rather than submit.
but it realized it could not hope for success without help from other european nations.
it received none.
most western nations were appalled at the prospect of another war and were willing to pay almost any price to settle the crisis peacefully.
anxiety the global crisis 1921 1941 695 munich conference ran almost as high in the united states as it did in europe during and after the crisis and helped produce such strange expressions of fear as the hysterical response to the famous war of the worlds radio broadcast in october.
see patterns of popular culture pp.
on september 29 hitler met with the leaders of france and great britain at munich in an effort to resolve the crisis.
the french and british agreed to accept the german demands for czechoslovakia in return for hitler s promise to expand no farther.
this is the last territorial claim i have to make in europe the fuhrer solemnly declared.
and prime minister neville chamberlain returned to england to a hero s welcome assuring his people that the agreement ensured peace in our time among those who had cabled him with encouragement at munich was franklin roosevelt.
the munich accords were the most prominent element of a policy that came to be known as appeasement and that failure of came t0 identified not altogether fairly appeasement almost exclusively with chamberlain.
whoever was to blame however it became clear almost immediately that the policy was a failure.
in march 1939 hitler occupied the remaining areas of czechoslovakia violating the munich agreement unashamedly.
and in april he began issuing threats against poland.
at that point both britain and france gave assurances to the polish government that they would come to its assistance in case of an invasion they even flirted too late with the stalinist regime in russia attempting to draw it into a mutual defense agreement.
stalin however had already decided that he could expect no protection from the west after all he had not even been invited to attend the munich conference.
accordingly he signed a nonaggression pact with hitler in august 1939 freeing the germans for the moment from the danger of a two front war.
for a few months hitler had been trying to frighten the poles into submitting to german demands.
when that failed he staged an incident on the polish border to allow him to claim that germany had been attacked and on september 1 1939 he launched a full scale invasion of poland.
britain and france true to their pledges declared war on germany two days later.
world war ii in europe had begun.
from neutrality to intervention this nation will remain a neutral nation the president declared shortly after the hostilities began in europe but i cannot ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well it was a statement that stood in stark and deliberate contrast to woodrow wilson s 1914 plea that the nation remain neutral in both deed and thought and it was clear from the start that among those whose opinions were decidedly unneutral in 1939 was the president himself.
neutrality tested there was never any question that both the president and the majority of the american people favored britain france and the other allied nations in the conflict.
the question was how much the united states was prepared to do to assist them.
at the very least roosevelt believed the united states should make armaments available to the allied armies to help them counter the highly productive german munitions industry.
in september 1939 he asked congress for a revision of the neutrality acts.
the original measures had forbidden the sale of american weapons to any nation engaged in war roosevelt wanted the arms embargo lifted.
powerful isolationist opposition forced him to accept a weaker revision than he would have liked as passed by congress the 1939 measure maintained cash and carry as.

popperfoto getty images the dramatic news bulletins were part of a radio play by howard koch loosely adapted from h g wells s 1898 novel the war of the worlds.
announcers reminded the audience repeatedly throughout the broadcast that they were listening to a play but many people either did not hear or did not notice the disclaimers.
by the end of the hour according to some estimates as many as a million americans were flying into panics convinced that the end of the world was imminent thousands of listeners in new york and new jersey fled their homes and tried to drive along clogged highways into the hills or the countryside.

for years sociologists and other scholars studied the episode for clues about mass behavior.
welles and his colleagues claimed to be surprised by the reaction their show created.
the broadcast proved more effective than they had expected because it touched on anxieties that ran deep in american life at the time.

the show also tapped longer standing anxieties about the fragility of life that afflicted many americans during the long depression of the 1930s and it seemed to frighten working class people those most vulnerable to unexpected catastrophes in particular.
most of all however the war of the worlds unintentionally exploited the enormous power that radio had come to exercise in american life and the great trust many people had developed in what they heard over the air.
for many people the broadcasts they received over the radio had become their principal even their only source of information about the outside world.
when the actors from the mercury theatre began to use the familiar phrases and cadences of radio news announcers it was easy for members of their audience to assume that they were hearing the truth.
welles concluded the broadcast by describing the play as the mercury theater s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo.

with france weakening a few weeks later he proclaimed that the united states would extend to the opponents of force the material resources of this nation and on may 15 winston churchill the new british prime minister sent roosevelt the first of many long lists of requests for ships armaments and other assistance without which he insisted england could not long survive.
many americans including the u s ambassador to london joseph p kennedy argued that the british plight was already hopeless that any aid to the english was a wasted effort.
the president however made the politically dangerous decision to make war materials available to churchill.
he even circumvented the cash and carry provisions of the neutrality act by trading fifty american destroyers most of them left over from world war i to england in return for the right to build american bases on british territory in the western hemisphere and he returned to the factories a number of new airplanes purchased by the american government so that the british could buy them instead.
roosevelt was able to take such steps in part because of a major shift in american public opinion.
before the invasion of france most americans had believed that a german victory in the war would not be a threat to the united states.
by july with france defeated and britain threatened more than 66 percent of the american public according to opinion polls believed that germany posed a direct threat to the united states.
congress was aware of the change and was becoming more willing to permit expanded american shifting public opinion assistance to the allies.
it was also becoming more concerned about the need for internal preparations for war and in september it approved the burke wadsworth act inaugurating the first peacetime military draft in american history.
but while the forces of isolation may have weakened they were far from dead.
a spirited and at times vicious debate began in the spring of 1940 between those activists who advocated expanded american involvement in the war who were termed often inaccurately interventionists and those who continued to insist on neutrality.
the celebrated journalist william allen white served as chairman of a new committee to defend america by aiding the allies whose members lobbied actively for increased american assistance to the allies but opposed actual intervention.
other activists went so far as to urge an immediate declaration of war a position that as yet had little public support and in april 1941 created an organization of their own the fight for freedom committee.
opposing them was a powerful new lobby called the america first committee which attracted some of americas most prominent lead ers.
its chairman was general robert e wood until recently the president of sears roebuck and its membership included a charles lindbergh general hugh johnson america first e kt n committee senator gerald nye and senator burton wheeler.
it won the editorial support of the hearst chain and other influential newspapers and it had at least the indirect support of a large proportion of the republican party.
it also inevitably attracted a fringe of nazi sympathizers and anti semites.
the debate between the two sides was loud and bitter.
through the summer and fall of 1940 moreover it was complicated by a presidential campaign.
the third term campaign for many months the politics of 1940 revolved around the question of franklin roosevelts intentions.
would he break with tradition and run for an unprecedented third term.
the president never publicly revealed his own wishes.
but by refusing to withdraw from the contest he made it impossible for any rival democrat to establish a foothold within the party just before the democratic national convention in july he let it be known that he would accept a draft from his party.
the democrats quickly renominated him and even reluctantly swallowed his choice for vice president agriculture secretary henry a wallace a man too liberal for the taste of many party leaders.
with roosevelt effectively straddling the center of the defense debate favoring neither the extreme isolationists nor the extreme interventionists the republicans had few the global crisis 1921 1941 699 wendell obvious alternatives.
succumbing to a willkie remarkable popular movement carefully orchestrated by among others time and life magazines they nominated a dynamic and attractive but politically inexperienced businessman wendell willkie.
willkie took positions little different from roosevelts he would keep the country out of war but would extend generous assistance to the allies.
an appealing figure and a vigorous campaigner he managed to evoke more public enthusiasm than any republican candidate in decades.
in the end however he was no match for franklin roosevelt.
the election was closer than it had been in either 1932 or 1936 but roosevelt nevertheless won decisively.
he received 55 percent of the popular vote to willkies 45 percent and won 449 electoral votes to willkies 82.
neutrality abandoned in the last weeks of 1940 with the election behind him roosevelt began to make subtle but profound changes in the american role in the war.
more than aiding britain he was moving the united states closer to entering the war.
in december 1940 great britain was virtually bankrupt.
no longer could the british meet the cash and carry requirements imposed by the neutrality acts yet englands needs churchill insisted were greater than ever.
the president therefore suggested a method that would eliminate the dol.
lar sign from all arms transactions.
the lend lease new system was labeled lend lease.
it would allow the government not only to sell but also to lend or lease armaments to any nation deemed vital to the defense of the united states in other words america could funnel weapons to england on the basis of no more than britains promise to return or pay for them when the war was over.
isolationists attacked the measure bitterly arguing correctly that it was simply a device to tie the united states more closely to the allies but congress enacted the bill by wide margins.
with lend lease established roosevelt soon faced another serious problem ensuring that the american supplies would actually reach great britain.
shipping lanes in the atlantic had become extremely dangerous german submarines destroyed as much as a half million tons of shipping each month.
the british navy was losing ships more rapidly than it could replace them and was finding it difficult to transport materials across the atlantic from america.
secretary of war henry stimson who had been hoovers secretary of state and who returned to the cabinet at roosevelts request in 1940 argued that the united states should itself convoy vessels to england but roosevelt decided to rely instead on the concept of hemispheric defense by which the united states navy would defend transport ships only in the western atlantic which he argued was a neutral zone and the responsibility of the american nations.
by july 1941 american ships were patrolling the ocean as far east as iceland escorting convoys of merchant ships and radioing information to british vessels about the location of nazi submarines.
at first germany did little to challenge these obviously hostile american actions.
by the fall of 1941 however events germany in europe changed its position.
german invades the forces had invaded the soviet union in ussr june of that year shattering the 1939 nazi soviet pact.
the germans drove quickly and forcefully deep into russian territory.
when the soviets did not surrender as many military observers had predicted they would roosevelt persuaded congress to extend lend lease privileges to them the first step toward creating a new relationship with stalin that would ultimately lead to a formal soviet american alliance.
now american industry was providing crucial assistance to hitlers foes on two fronts and the navy was playing a more active role than ever in protecting the flow of goods to europe.
in september nazi submarines began a concerted campaign against american vessels.
early that month a german u boat fired on the american destroyer greer which was radioing the u boats position to the british at the time.
roosevelt responded by ordering american ships to fire on german submarines on sight in october nazi submarines hit two american destroyers and sank one of them the reuben james killing many american sailors.
enraged members of congress now voted approval of a measure allowing the united states to arm its merchant vessels and to sail all the way into belligerent ports.
the united states had in effect launched a naval war against germany.
at the same time a series of meetings some private and one public were tying the united states and great britain more closely together.
in april 1941 senior military officers of the two nations met in secret and agreed on the joint strategy they would follow if the united states entered the war.
in august roosevelt met with churchill aboard a british vessel anchored off the coast of newfoundland.
the president made no military commitments but he did join the prime minister in releasing a document that became known as the atlantic charter in which the two nations set out certain common principles on which to base a better future for the world it was in only vaguely disguised form a statement of war aims that called openly for among other things the final destruction of the nazi tyranny by the fall of 1941 it seemed only a matter of time before the united states became an official belligerent.
roosevelt remained convinced that public opinion would support a declaration of war only in the event of an actual enemy attack.
but an attack seemed certain to come if not in the atlantic then in the pacific.
atlantic charter the road to pearl harbor japan took advantage of the crisis that had preoccupied the soviet union and the two most powerful colonial powers in debating the past the question of pearl harbor fti tjt tj p rase remeit ber pearl harbor.
became a rallying cry during world war ii reminding i jt1 jd americans of the surprise japanese attack on the american naval base in hawaii and arousing the nation to exact revenge.
but within a few years of the end of hostilities some americans began to challenge the official version of the attack on december 7 1941 and their charges sparked a debate that has never fully subsided.
was the japanese attack on pearl harbor unprovoked and did it come without warning.
or was it part of a deliberate plan by the roosevelt administration to make the japanese attack to force a reluctant united states into the war.
most controversial of all did the administration know of the attack in advance.
did roosevelt deliberately refrain from warning the commanders in hawaii so that the air raid s effect on the american public would be more profound.
among the first to challenge the official version of pearl harbor was the historian charles a.
beard who maintained in president roosevelt and the coming of the war 1948 that the united states had deliberately forced the japanese into a position whereby they had no choice but to attack.
by cutting off japan s access to the raw materials it needed for its military adventure in china by stubbornly refusing to compromise the united states ensured that the japanese would strike out into the southwest pacific to take the needed supplies by force even at the risk of war with the united states.
the administration which had some time before cracked the japanese code must have known weeks in advance of japan s plan to attack although beard did not claim that officials knew the attack would come at pearl harbor.
beard supported his argument by citing secretary of war henry stimson s comment in his diary the question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot.
this view has reappeared more recently in thomas fleming the new dealers war 2001 which also argues that roosevelt deliberately and duplicitously maneuvered the united states into war with japan.
basil rauch in roosevelt from munich to pearl harbor 1950 challenged beard s thesis.
rauch argued that the administration did not know in advance of the planned attack on pearl harbor.
it did however expect an attack somewhere and it made subtle efforts to maneuver japan into firing the first shot in the conflict.
richard n current in secretary stimson a study in statecraft 1954 offered an even stronger challenge to beard.
stimson did indeed anticipate an attack current argued but not an attack on american territory rather he anticipated an assault on british or dutch possessions in the pacific.
the problem confronting the administration was how to find a way to make a japanese attack on british or dutch territory appear to be an attack on america.
only thus stimson believed could congress be persuaded to approve a declaration of war.
roberta wohlstetter in pearl harbor warning and decision 1962 the most thorough scholarly study to appear to that point undertook to answer the question of whether the roosevelt administration knew of the attack in advance.
she concluded that the united states had ample warning of japanese intentions and should have realized that the pearl harbor raid was imminent but government officials failed to interpret the evidence correctly largely because their preconceptions about japanese intentions were at odds with the evidence they confronted.
admiral edwin t layton who had been a staff officer at pearl harbor in 1941 also blamed political and bureaucratic failures for the absence of advance warning of the attack.
in a 1985 memoir and i was there he argued that the japanese attack was a result not only of audacious planning and skillful execution by tripartite asia britain and france to extend its pact empire in the pacific.
in september 1940 japan signed the tripartite pact a loose defensive alliance with germany and italy that seemed to extend the axis into asia.
in reality the european axis powers never developed a strong relationship with japan and the wars in europe and the pacific were largely separate conflicts.
roosevelt had already displayed his animosity toward japanese policies by harshly denouncing their assault on china and by terminating a long standing american commercial treaty with the tokyo government.
still the japanese drive continued.
in july 1941 imperial troops moved into indochina and seized the capital of vietnam a colony of france.
the united states having broken the japanese codes knew that japans next target would be the dutch east indies and when tokyo failed to respond to roosevelts stern warnings the president froze all japanese assets in the united states and established a complete trade embargo severely limiting japans ability to purchase essential supplies including oil.
american public opinion shaped by strong anti japanese prejudices developed over several decades generally supported these hostile actions.
tokyo now faced a choice.
either it would have to repair relations with the united states to restore the flow of supplies or it would have to find those supplies elsewhere most notably by seizing british and dutch possessions in the pacific.
at first the japanese prime minister prince konoye seemed willing to compromise.
in october however militants in tokyo forced konoye out of office and replaced him with the leader of the war party general hideki tojo.
with japans need for new sources of fuel becoming desperate there now seemed little alternative to war.
for several weeks the tojo government kept up a pretense of wanting to continue negotiations.
on november 20 1941 700 pearl harbor december 7 1941 at least seven 18 inch aerial torpedoes and two bombs struck the battleship uss west virginia on that fateful morning.
repair workers discovered 66 bodies of west virginia crewmembers.
after it was restored to fighting condition the ship reentered the war and participated in the battles of iwo jima and okinawa.
gl archive alamy beard and his successors that the president had deliberately maneuvered the nation into the war by permitting the japanese to attack.
instead he emphasized the enormous daring and great skill with which the japanese orchestrated an ambitious operation that few americans believed possible.
the revisionist claims have not been laid to rest.
john toland revived the charges of a roosevelt betrayal in 1982 in infamy pearl harbor and its aftermath claiming to have discovered new evidence the testimony of an unidentified seaman that proves the navy knew at least five days in advance that japanese aircraft carriers were heading toward hawaii.
from that toland concluded that roosevelt must have known that an attack was forthcoming and that he allowed it to occur in the belief that a surprise attack would arouse popular support for entering the war.
but like the many other writers who have made the same argument toland was unable to produce any direct evidence of roosevelt s knowledge of the planned attack.
understand analyze and evaluate the japanese but also of a dramatic breakdown in our intelligence process.
related directly to feuding among high level naval officers in washington.
the most thorough study of pearl harbor to date is gordon w pranges at down we slept 1981.
like wohlstetter prange concluded that the roosevelt administration was guilty of a series of disastrous blunders in interpreting japanese strategy the american government had possession of enough information to predict the attack but failed to do so.
but prange dismissed the arguments of the revisionists 1.
some historians have argued that the united states provoked japan into attacking pearl harbor.
what is the basis for this argument.
why has this argument regarding the attack on pearl harbor persisted.
layton argued that the attack on pearl harbor resulted partially from a breakdown in the intelligence process.
other attacks on the united states have been attributed to a breakdown in intelligence.
what evidence has been cited to support those claims.
what arguments have been used to refute them.
tokyo proposed a modus vivendi highly favorable to itself and sent its diplomats in washington to the state department to discuss it.
but tokyo had already decided that it would not tokyo yield on the question of china and decision for washington had made clear that it would war accept nothing less than a reversal of that policy.
secretary of state cordell hull rejected the japanese overtures out of hand on november 27 he told secretary of war henry stimson i have washed my hands of the japanese situation and it is now in the hands of you and secretary of the navy frank knox the army and navy he was not merely speculating.
american intelligence had already decoded japanese messages which made clear that war was imminent that after november 29 an attack would be nty a matter of days.
but washington did not know where the attack would take place.
most officials were convinced that the japanese would move first not against american territory but against british or dutch possessions to the south.
american intelligence took note of a japanese naval task force that began sailing east from the kuril islands in the general direction of hawaii on november 25 and radioed a routine warning to the u s naval facility at pearl harbor near honolulu.
but officials were paying more attention to a large japanese convoy moving southward through the china sea.
a combination of confusion and miscalculation led the government to overlook indications that japan intended a direct attack on american forces partly because hawaii was so far from japan that few officials believed such an attack possible.
at 7 55 a m on sunday december 7 1941 a wave of japanese bombers taking off from aircraft carriers hundreds of miles away attacked the united states pearl harbor base at peari harbor.
a second wave came an hour later.
military commanders in hawaii had taken 702 chapter 25 hideki tojo tojo was a general of the imperial japanese army and for most of world war ii the prime minister of japan.
he was directly responsible for the attack on pearl harbor although planning for it had begun before he took office.
after the war tojo was arrested convicted of war crimes and hanged.
lapi roger viollet the image works no precautions against such an attack and had allowed ships to remain bunched up defenselessly in the harbor and airplanes to remain parked in rows on airstrips.
the consequences of the raid were disastrous for america.
within two hours the united states lost 8 battleships 3 cruisers 4 other vessels 188 airplanes and several vital shore installations.
more than 2 000 soldiers and sailors died and another 1 000 were injured.
the japanese suffered only light losses.
american forces were now greatly diminished in the pacific although by a fortunate accident none of the american aircraft carriers the heart of the pacific fleet had been at pearl harbor on december 7.
nevertheless the raid on pearl harbor did virtually overnight what more than two years of effort by roosevelt and others had been unable to do it unified the american people in a fervent commitment to war.
on december 8 the president traveled to capitol hill where he grimly addressed a joint session of congress yesterday december 7 1941 a date which will live in infamy the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the naval and air forces of the empire of japan within four hours the senate unanimously and the house 388 to 1 the lone dissenter being jeannette rankin of montana who had voted against war in 1917 as well approved a declaration of war against japan.
three days later germany and italy japans european allies declared war on the united states and on the same day december 11 congress reciprocated without a dissenting vote.
for the second time in twenty five years the united states was engaged in a world war.
looking back american foreign policy in the years after world war i attempted something that ultimately proved impossible.
the united states was determined to be a major power in the world to extend its trade broadly around the globe and to influence other nations in ways americans believed would be beneficial to their own and the worlds interests.
but the united states was also determined to do nothing that would limit its own freedom of action.
it would not join the league of nations.
it could not join the world court.
it would not form alliances with other nations.
it would operate powerfully and alone.
but ominous forces were at work in the world that would gradually push the united states into greater engagement with other nations.
the economic disarray that the great depression created all around the world the rise of totalitarian regimes in europe and asia the expansionist ambitions of powerful new leaders all worked to destroy the uneasy stability of the post world war i international system.
americas own interests economic and otherwise were now imperiled.
and americas go it alone foreign policy seemed powerless to change the course of events.
franklin roosevelt tried throughout the later years of the 1930s to push the american people slowly into a greater involvement in international affairs.
in particular he tried to nudge the united states toward taking a more forceful stand against dictatorship and aggression.
a powerful isolationist movement stymied him for a time even after war broke out in europe.
gradually however public opinion shifted toward support of the allies britain france and eventually russia and against the axis germany italy and japan.
the nation began to mobilize for war to supply ships and munitions to britain even to engage m naval combat with german forces in the atlantic.
finally on december 7 1941 a surprise japanese attack on the american base at pearl harbor in hawaii ended the last elements of uncertainty and drove the united states now united behind the war e ort mto the greatest conflict in human history.

what was the impact of the war on the u s economy.
how was the military experience of the united states in world war ii different for europe and the pacific.
how did the war affect life on the home front especially for women organized labor and minorities.
setting the stage the attack on pearl harbor thrust the united states into the g s and most terrible war in the history of humanity a war that transformed americas relationship to the the world and changed the world as profoundly as any event of the twentieth century perhaps of any century.
the war also changed america at home in profound if not always readily visible ways.
as the poet archibald macleish said in 1943.
the great majority of the american people understand very well that this war is not a war only but an end and a beginning an end to things known and a beginning of things unknown.
we have smelled the wind in the streets that changes weather.
we know that whatever the world will be when the war ends the world will be different the story of american involvement in the war is not just the story of how the military forces and the industrial might of the united states helped defeat germany italy and japan.
it is also the story of the creation of a new world both abroad and at home.
war on two fronts america united whatever political disagreements and social tensions may have existed among the american people during world war ii there was striking unity of opinion about the conflict itself a unity as one member of congress proclaimed shortly after pearl harbor never before witnessed in this country americas unity and confidence were severely tested in the first troubled months of 1942.
despite the impressive display of patriotism and the dramatic flurry of activity the war was going very badly.
britain appeared ready to collapse.
the soviet union was staggering.
one after another allied strongholds in the pacific were falling to the forces of japan.
the first task facing the united states therefore was less to achieve victory than to stave off defeat.
containing the japanese ten hours after the strike at pearl harbor japanese airplanes attacked the american airfields at manila in the philippines destroying much of americas remaining air power in the pacific.
three days later guam an american possession fell to japan then wake island and the british colony hong kong.
the great british fortress of singapore surrendered in february 1942 the dutch east indies in march burma in april.
in the philippines exhausted filipino and american troops gave up their defense of the islands on may 6.
american strategists planned two broad offensives to turn the tide against the japanese.
one under the command of general douglas macarthur would move north from australia through new guinea and eventually back to the philippines.
the other under admiral chester nimitz would move west from hawaii toward major japanese island outposts in the central pacific.
ultimately the two offensives would come together to invade japan itself.
the allies achieved their first important victory in the battle of coral sea just northwest of australia on may 7 8 1942 when american forces turned back the previously unstoppable midway japanese fleet.
a month later there was an even more important turning point northwest of hawaii.
an enormous battle raged for four days june 3 6 1942 near the small american outpost at midway island at the end of which the united states despite great losses was clearly victorious.
the american navy destroyed four japanese aircraft carriers while losing only one and regained control of the central pacific for the united states.
the americans took the offensive for the first time several months later in the southern solomon islands to the east of new guinea.
in august 1942 american forces assaulted three of the islands gavutu tulagi and guadalcanal.
a ferocious struggle with before uadalcanal qver terribje savagery developed at guadalcanal and continued for six months inflicting heavy losses on both sides.
in the end however the japanese were forced to abandon the island and with it their last chance of launching an effective offensive to the south.
666 chapter 24 saluting the blue eagle several thousand san francisco schoolchildren assembled on a baseball field in 1933 to form the symbol of the national recovery administration an eagle clutching a cogwheel to symbolize industry and a thunderbolt to symbolize energy.
this display is evidence of the widespread if brief popular enthusiasm the nra produced.
nra administrators drew from their memories of world war i liberty loan drives and tried to establish the blue eagle as a symbol of patriotic commitment to recovery.
bettmann corbis nra was the national industrial recovery act which congress passed in june 1933.
at first the new industrial recovery program appeared to work well.
at its center was a new federal agency the national recovery administration nra under the direction of the flamboyant and energetic hugh s johnson.
johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a temporary blanket code a minimum wage of between 30 and 40 cents an hour a maximum workweek of thirty five to forty hours and the abolition of child labor.
adherence to the code he claimed would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment.
at the same time johnson negotiated another more specific set of codes with leaders of the nation s major industries.
these industrial codes set floors below which no company would lower prices or wages in its search for a competitive advantage.
he quickly won agreements from almost every major industry in the country.
from the beginning however the nra encountered serious difficulties.
the codes themselves were hastily and often poorly written.
administering them was beyond the capacities of federal officials with no prior experience in running so vast a program.
large producers consistently dominated the code writing process and ensured that the new regulations would work to their advantage and to the disadvantage of smaller firms.
and the codes at times did more than simply set floors under prices they actively and artificially raised them sometimes to levels higher than the market could sustain.
other nra goals did not progress as quickly as the efforts to raise prices.
section 7 a of the national industrial recovery section 7 a act promised workers the right to form mm hi unions and engage in collective bargaining and encouraged many workers to join unions for the first time.
but section 7 a contained no enforcement mechanisms.
hence recognition of unions by employers and thus the significant wage increases the unions were committed to winning did not follow.
the public works administration pwa established in 1933 to administer the national industrial recovery acts spending programs only gradually allowed the 3 3 billion in public works funds to trickle out.
not until 1938 was the pwa budget pumping an appreciable amount of money into the economy.
perhaps the clearest evidence of the nras failure was that industrial production actually declined in the months after the agencys establishment from an index of 101 in july 1933 to 71 in november despite the rise in prices that the codes had helped to create.
by the spring of 1934 the nra was besieged by criticism and businessmen were ignoring many of its provisions.
that fall roosevelt pressured johnson to resign and established a new board of directors to oversee the nra.
then the supreme court intervened.
in 1935 a case came before the court involving alleged nra code violations by the schechter brothers who operated a wholesale poultry business confined to brooklyn new york.
the court ruled unanimously that the schechters were not engaged in interstate commerce and thus not subject to federal regulation and further that congress had unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the president to draft the nra codes.
the justices struck down the legislation establishing the agency.
roosevelt denounced the justices for their whorse and buggy interpretation of the interstate commerce clause.
he was rightly concerned for the reasoning in the schechter case threatened many other new deal programs as well.
but the courts destruction of the nra itself gave the new deal a convenient excuse for ending a failed experiment.

icarcxjna tennessee river watershed power plant tva dam project chemical plant the tennessee valley authority the tennessee valley authority was one of the largest experiments in government funded public works and regional planning in american history to that point.
the federal government had helped fund many projects in its history canals turnpikes railroads bridges dams and others.
but never before had it undertaken a project of such great scope and never before had it maintained such close control and ownership over the public works it helped create.
this map illustrates the broad reach of the tva within the tennessee valley region which spanned seven states.
tva dams throughout the region helped control floods and also provided a source for hydroelectric power which the government sold to consumers.
note the dam near muscle shoals alabama in the bottom left of the map.
it was begun during world war i and efforts to revive it in the 1920s helped create the momentum that produced the tva.
iv jy were progressives so eager to see the government enter the business of hydroelectric power in the 1920s.
regional planning the aaa and the nra largely reflected the beliefs of new dealers who favored economic planning but wanted private interests farmers or business leaders to dominate the planning process.
other reformers believed that the government itself should be the chief planning agent in the economy.
their most conspicuous success and one of the most celebrated accomplishments of the new deal was an unprecedented experiment in regional planning the tennessee valley authority tva.
the tva had its roots in a political controversy of the 1920s.
progressive reformers had agitated for years for public pya development of the nation s water resources as a source of cheap electric power.
in particular they had urged completion of a great dam at muscle shoals on the tennessee river in alabama a dam begun during world war i and left unfinished when the war ended.
but pposition from the utility companies had been too powerful to overcome.
in 1932 however one of the great utility empires that of the electricity magnate samuel insull collapsed spectacu rly amid widely publicized exposes of corruption.
hostility to the utilities soon grew so intense that the companies were no longer able to block the public power movement.
the result in may 1933 was the tennessee valley authority.
the tva was authorized to complete the dam at muscle shoals and build others in the region and to generate and sell electricity from them to the public at reasonable rates.
it was also intended to be an agent for a comprehensive redevelopment of the entire region for stopping the disastrous flooding that had plagued the tennessee valley for centuries for encouraging the development of local industries for supervising a substantial program of reforestation and for helping farmers improve productivity.
the tva revitalized the region in numerous ways.
it improved water transportation virtually eliminated flooding in the region and provided electricity to thousands who had never before had it.
throughout much of the country largely because of the yardstick provided by the tvas cheap production of electricity private power rates declined.
even so the tennessee valley remained a generally impoverished region despite the tvas efforts.
and like many other new deal programs the tva made no serious effort to challenge local customs and racial prejudices.
668 chapter 24 currency banks and the stock market roosevelt soon came to consider the gold standard a major obstacle to the restoration of adequate prices.
on april 18 1933 he made the shift off the gold standard official with an executive order.
by itself the repudiation of the gold standard meant relatively little.
but both before and after the april decision the administration experimented in various ways with manipulating the value of the dollar by making substantial purchases of gold and silver and later by establishing a new fixed standard for the dollar reducing its gold content substantially from the 1932 amount.
the resort to government managed currency that is to a dollar whose value could be raised or lowered by government policy according to economic circumstances created an important precedent for future federal policies and permanently altered the relationship between the public and private sectors.
it did not however have any immediate impact on the depressed american economy.
public works among the most visible products of the new deal was a vast network of public works in almost all areas of the country but concentrated particularly in the south and the west.
the great dams that the government built in the tennessee valley and elsewhere were particularly effective at capturing the public imagination.
this dramatic photograph by margaret bourke white appeared on the cover of the first issue of life in 1936 which very quickly became the most popular and successful magazine in america.
it shows the fort peck dam on the missouri river.
margaret bourke white time life pictures getty images through other legislation the early new deal increased federal authority over previously unregulated or weakly regulated areas of the economy.
the glass steagall steauall act act of june 1933 gave the government authority to curb irresponsible speculation by banks.
it also established a wall between commercial banking and investment banking.
equally important it established the federal deposit insurance corporation which guaranteed all bank deposits up to 2 500.
finally in 1935 congress passed a major banking act that transferred much of the authority once wielded by the regional federal reserve banks to the federal reserve board in washington.
to protect investors in the stock market congress passed the so called truth in securities act of 1933 requiring corporations issuing new securities to provide full and accurate information about them to the public.
another act of june 1934 sec established the securities and exchange commission sec to police the stock market.
among other things the establishment of the sec was an indication of how far the financial establishment had fallen in public estimation.
the criminal trials of a number of once respected wall street figures for grand larceny and fraud eroded the public stature of the financial community still further.
the growth of federal relief among roosevelt s first acts in office was the establishment of the federal emergency relief administration fera which provided cash grants to states to prop up bankrupt relief agencies.
to administer the program he chose the director of the new york state relief agency harry hopkins who disbursed the fera grants widely and rapidly.
but both hopkins and roosevelt had misgivings about establishing a government dole they felt more comfortable with another form of government assistance work relief.
thus when it became clear that the fera grants were not enough the administration established a second program the civil works administration cwa cwa.
between november 1933 and april 1934 it put more than 4 million people to work on temporary projects.
some of the projects were of lasting value such as the construction of roads schools and parks others were little more than make work.
to hopkins however the important thing was pumping money into an economy badly in need of it and providing assistance to people with nowhere else to turn.
roosevelts favorite relief project was the civilian conservation corps ccc.
established in the first weeks of the new administration the ccc was designed to provide employ ccc ment to the millions of young men who could find no jobs in the cities.
the ccc created camps in national parks and forests and in other rural and wilderness settings.
there young men women were argely excluded from the program worked in a semimilitary environment on such projects as planting trees building reservoirs developing parks and improving agricultural irrigation.
ccc camps were segregated by race.
the vast majority of the new deal 669 them were restricted to white men but a few were available to african americans mexicans and indians.
mortgage relief was a pressing need for millions of farm owners and homeowners.
the farm credit administration which within two years refinanced one fifth of all farm mortgages in the united states was one response to that problem.
the frazier lemke farm bankruptcy act of 1933 was another.
it enabled some farmers to regain their land even after foreclosure on their mortgages.
despite such efforts however 25 percent of all american farm owners had lost their land by 1934.
homeowners were similarly troubled and in june 1933 the administration established the home owners loan corporation which by 1936 had refinanced the mortgages of more than 1 million householders.
a year later congress established the federal housing administration to insure mortgages for new construction and home repairs.
the new deal in transition seldom has an american president enjoyed such remarkable popularity as franklin roosevelt did during his first two years in office.
but with no end to the depression yet in sight the new deal gradually found itself the target of fierce public criticism.
in the spring of 1935 partly in response to these growing attacks roosevelt launched an ambitious new program of legislation that has often been called the second new deal critics of the new deal ome of the most strident attacks on the new deal ame from critics on the right.
roosevelt had tried for i time to conciliate conservatives and business leaders.
by the end of 1934 however it was clear that the american right in general and american liberty league much of the corporate world in particular had become irreconcilably hostile to the new deal.
in august 1934 a group of the most fervent and wealthiest roosevelt opponents led by members of the du pont family reshaped the american liberty league formed initially to oppose prohibition of liquor to arouse pub hc opposition to the new deals dictatorial policies and its supposed attacks on free enterprise.
but the new organization was never able to expand its constituency much beyond the northern industrialists who had founded it.
roosevelts critics on the far left also managed to produce alarm among some supporters of the administration but like the conservatives they proved to have only limited strength.
the communist party the socialist party and other radical and semiradical organizations were at times harshly critical of the new deal.
but they too failed to attract genuine mass support.
more menacing to the new deal than either the far right or the far left was a group of dissident political movements that defied easy ideological classification.
some gained substantial public support within particular states and regions.
and three men succeeded in mobilizing genuinely national followings.
dr francis e townsend an elderly california physician rose from obscurity to lead a movement of more than 5 million members with his plan for federal pensions for the elderly.
according to the townsend plan all americans over the age of sixty would receive monthly government pensions of 200 provided they retired thus freeing jobs for younger unemployed americans and spent the money in full each month townsend which would pump needed funds into the plan economy.
by 1935 the townsend plan had attracted the support of many older men and women.
and while the plan itself was defeated in congress in 1935 the public sentiment behind it helped build support for the social security system which congress did approve in 1935.
father charles e coughlin a catholic priest in the detroit suburb of royal oak michigan achieved even greater renown through his weekly sermons launched in 1926 and broadcast nationally over the radio.
in later years coughlin became notorious for his sympathy for fascism and his outspoken anti semitism.
but until at least 1937 he was known primarily as an advocate for changing the banking and currency systems.
he proposed a series of monetary reforms remonetization of silver issuing of greenbacks and nationalization of the banking system that he insisted would restore prosperity and ensure economic justice.
at first a warm supporter of franklin roosevelt by late 1934 coughlin had become disheartened by the new deal of the many resources at roosevelt s disposal was the impression of his sunny personality during dark times.
it conveyed to many a sense of hope and optimism.
in this political cartoon from about 1934 roosevelt is seen steering the ship of state towards economic recovery.
his detractors are shown grumbl ng under the cloud of depression.
the granger collection new york 670 chapter 24 huey long what he claimed was the presidents failure to deal harshly enough with the money powers in the spring of 1935 he established his own political organization the national union for social justice.
he was widely believed to have one of the largest regular radio audiences of anyone in america.
more alarming to the administration was the growing national popularity of senator huey p long of louisiana.
long had risen to power in his home state through his strident attacks on the banks oil companies and utilities and on the conservative political oligarchy allied with them.
elected governor in 1928 he launched an assault on his opponents so thorough and forceful that they were soon left with virtually no political power.
many critics in louisiana claimed that long had in effect become a dictator.
but he also maintained the overwhelming support of the louisiana electorate in part because of his flamboyant personality and in part because of his solid record of conventional progressive accomplishments building roads schools and hospitals revising the tax codes distributing free textbooks lowering utility rates.
barred by law from succeeding himself as governor he ran in 1930 for a seat in the u s senate and won easily.
long like coughlin supported franklin roosevelt in 1932.
but within six months of roosevelts inauguration he had broken with the president.
as an alternative to the new deal he advocated a drastic program of wealth redistribution a program he ultimately named the share our wealth plan.
the government he claimed could end the depression easily by using the tax system to confiscate the surplus riches of the wealthiest men and women in america and distribute these surpluses to the rest of the population.
that would he claimed allow the government to guarantee every family a minimum homestead of 5 000 and an annual wage of 2 500.
in 1934 long established his own national organization the share our wealth society which soon attracted a large following through much of the nation.
a poll by the democratic national committee in the spring of 1935 disclosed that long might attract more than 10 per cent of the vote if he ran as a third party candidate possibly enough to tip a close election to the republicans.
share our wealth society the second new deal roosevelt launched the so called second new deal in the spring of 1935 in response both to the growing political pressures and to the continuing economic crisis.
the new proposals represented if not a new direction at least a shift in the emphasis of new deal policy.
perhaps the most conspicuous change was in the administrations attitude toward big business.
symbolically at least the president was now willing to attack corporate interests openly.
in march for example he proposed to congress an act designed to break up the great utility holding companies and he spoke harshly of monopolistic control of their industry.
the holding company act of 1935 was the result although furious lobbying by the utilities led to amendments that sharply limited its effects.
huey long few public speakers could arouse a crowd more effectively than huey long of louisiana known to many as the kingfish a nickname borrowed from the popular radio show amos n andy.
it was longs effective use of radio however that contributed most directly to his spreading national popularity in the early 1930s.
archive photos getty images equally alarming to affluent americans was a series of tax reforms proposed by the president in 1935 a program conservatives quickly labeled a soak the rich scheme.
apparently designed to undercut the appeal of huey longs share our wealth plan the roosevelt proposals called for establishing the highest and most progressive peacetime tax rates in history although the actual impact of these rates was limited.
me supreme court decision in 1935 to strike national labor relations board national industrial recovery act also invalidated section 7 a of the act which had guaranteed workers the right to organize and bargain collectively.
a group of progressives in congress led by senator robert f wagner of new york introduced what became the national labor relations act of 1935.
the new law popularly known as the wagner act provided workers with a crucial enforcement mechanism missing from the 1933 law the national labor relations board nlrb which would have power to compel employers to recognize and bargain with legitimate unions.
the president was not entirely happy with the bill but he signed it anyway.
that was in large part because american workers themselves had by 1935 become so important and vigorous a force that roosevelt realized his own political future would depend in part on responding to their demands.
the new deal 671 labor militancy the emergence of a powerful trade union movement in the 1930s was one of the most important social and political developments of the decade.
it occurred partly in response to government efforts to enhance the power of unions but it was also a result of the increased pressure from american workers and their leaders.
the growing labor militancy first became obvious in 1934 when recently organized workers many of them inspired by the collective bargaining provisions of the national industrial recovery act demonstrated a new assertiveness.
it was soon clear however that without stronger legal protection most organizing drives would end in frustration.
once the wagner act became law the search for more effective forms of organization rapidly gained strength in labor ranks.
the american federation of labor afl remained committed to the idea of the craft union organizing workers on the basis of their skills.
but that concept had little to offer unskilled laborers who now constituted the bulk of the industrial work industrial frce during the 1930s therefore a newer unionism concept of labor organization challenged the craft union ideal industrial unionism.
advocates of this approach argued that all workers in a particular industry should be organized in a single union regardless of what functions the workers performed all autoworkers should be in a single automobile union all steelworkers should be in a single steel union.
united in this way workers would greatly increase their power.
leaders of the afl craft unions for the most part opposed the new concept.
but industrial unionism found a number of important advocates most prominent among them john l lewis the talented flamboyant and eloquent leader of the united mine workers.
at first lewis and his allies attempted to work within the afl but friction between the new industrial organizations lewis was promoting and the older craft unions grew rapidly.
at the 1935 afl convention lewis became embroiled in a series of angry confrontations and one celebrated fistfight with craft union leaders before finally walking out.
a few weeks later he created the committee on industrial organization.
when the afl expelled the new committee and all the industrial unions it represented lewis renamed the committee the congress of industrial organizations cio established it in 1936 as an organization directly rivaling the afl and became its first president.
the cio expanded the constituency of the labor movement.
it was more receptive to women and to blacks than the afl had been in part because women and blacks were more likely to be relegated to unskilled jobs and in part because cio organizing drives targeted previously unorganized industries textiles laundries tobacco factories and others where women and minorities constituted much of the workforce.
the cio was also a more militant organization than the afl.
by the time of the 1936 schism it was already engaged in major organizing battles in the automobile and steel industries.
cio organizing battles out of several competing auto unions the united auto workers uaw was gradually emerging preeminent in the early and mid 1930s.
but although it was gaining recruits it was making little sit down progress in winning recognition from the strike automobile corporations.
in december 1936 however autoworkers employed a controversial and effective new technique for challenging corporate opposition the sit down strike.
employees in several general motors plants in detroit simply sat down inside the plants refusing either to work or to leave thus preventing the company from using strikebreakers.
the tactic spread to other locations and by february 1937 strikers had occupied seventeen gm plants.
while male workers remained in the factories female supporters relatives friends and coworkers of the strikers demonstrated on behalf of the strikers lobbied on their behalf with state and local officials and provided food clothing and other necessities to the men inside.
the strikers ignored court orders and local police efforts to force them to vacate the buildings.
when michigans governor frank murphy a liberal democrat refused to call up the national guard to clear out the strikers and when the federal government also refused to intervene on behalf of employers general motors relented.
in february 1937 gm became the first major manufacturer to recognize the uaw other automobile companies soon did the same.
the sit down strike proved effective for rubber workers and others as well but it survived only briefly as a labor technique.
its apparent illegality aroused so much public opposition that labor leaders soon abandoned it.
in the steel industry the battle for unionization was less easily won.
in 1936 the steel workers organizing committee swoc later the united steelworkers of america began a major organizing drive involving thousands of workers and frequent at times bitter strikes.
in march 1937 u s steel the giant of the industry recognized the union rather than risk a costly strike at a time when it sensed itself on the verge of recovery from the depression.
but the smaller companies known collectively as little steel were less accommodating.
on memorial day 1937 a group of striking workers from republic steel gathered with their families for a picnic and demonstration in south chicago.
when they attempted to march peacefully and legally toward the steel plant police opened fire on them.
ten demonstrators were killed another ninety were wounded.
despite a public outcry against the memorial day massacre the harsh tactics of little steel companies succeeded.
the 1937 strike failed.
but the victory of little steel was one of the last gasps of the kind of brutal strikebreaking that had proved so effective in the past.
in 1937 alone there were 4 720 strikes over 80 percent of them settled in favor of the unions.
by the end of the year more than 8 million workers were members of laboixrapid unions recognized as official bargaining growth units by employers compared with 3 million in 1932.
by 1941 that number had expanded to 10 million and included the workers of little steel whose employers had finally recognized the swoc.
672 chapter 24 the memorial day massacre the bitterness of the labor struggles of the 1930s was nowhere more evident than in chicago in 1937 when striking workers attempting to march on a republic steel plant were brutally attacked by chicago police who used clubs tear gas and guns to turn the marchers away.
ten strikers were killed and many others were injured.
carl linde ap images social security in 1935 roosevelt gave public support to what became the social security act which congress passed the same year.
it established several distinct programs.
for the elderly there were two types of assistance.
those who were presently destitute could receive up to 15 a month in federal assistance.
more important for the future many americans presently working were incorporated into a pension system to which they and their employers would contribute by paying a payroll tax it would provide them with an income on retirement.
pension payments would not begin until 1942 and even then would provide only 10 to 85 a month to recipients.
and broad categories of workers including domestic servants and agricultural laborers occupations with disproportionate numbers of blacks and women were excluded from the program.
but the act was a crucial first step in building the nation s most important social program for the elderly.
in addition the social security act created a system of unemployment insurance which employers alone would finance unemployment and which made ic possible for workers insurance laid off from their jobs to receive temporary government assistance.
it also established a limited system later expanded of federal aid to people with disabilities and a program of aid to dependent children.
the framers of the social security act wanted to create a system of insurance not welfare and the largest programs old age pensions and unemployment insurance were in many ways similar to private insurance programs with contributions from participants and benefits available to all.
but the act also provided considerable direct assistance based on need to the elderly poor to those with disabilities to dependent children and their mothers.
these groups were widely the new deal 673 perceived to be small and genuinely unable to support themselves.
but in later generations the programs for these groups would expand considerably.
new directions in relief social security was designed primarily to fulfill long range goals.
but millions of unemployed americans had immediate needs.
to help them the roosevelt administration established the wpa works progress administration wpa in 1935.
like the civil works administration and earlier efforts the wpa established a system of work relief for the unemployed.
but it was much bigger than the earlier agencies both in the size of its budget 5 billion in its first two years and in the energy and imagination of its operations.
under the direction of harry hopkins the wpa was responsible for building or renovating 110 000 public buildings schools post offices government office buildings and for who is eligible everybody working for salary or wages with only a few exceptions.
such as agriculture do t c service and government work applications for social security a untjp eyearv able ihrough employers if you do not get one from your employer.

in the process the wpa kept an average of 2 1 million workers employed and pumped needed money into the economy.
the wpa displayed flexibility and imagination in offering assistance to those whose occupations did not fit into any traditional category of relief.
the federal writers project of the wpa for example gave unemployed writers a chance to do their work and receive a government salary.
the federal arts project similarly helped painters sculptors and others to continue their careers.
the federal music project and the federal theater project oversaw the production of concerts and plays creating work for unemployed musicians actors and directors.
other relief agencies emerged alongside the wpa.
the national youth administration nya provided work and scholarship assistance to high school and college age men and women.
the emergency housing division of the public works administration began federal sponsorship of public housing.
men and women alike were in distress in the 1930s as in all difficult times.
but the new welfare system dealt with members of the two sexes in very different ways.
for men the government concentrated mainly on work relief on such programs as the ccc the cwa and the wpa all of which were overwhelmingly male and through the social security act pensions and unemployment insurance both structured initially to assist mostly men.
the principal government aid to women was not work relief but cash assistance most notably through the aid to dependent children program of social security which was designed largely to assist single mothers.
this disparity in treatment reflected a widespread assumption that men constituted the bulk of the paid workforce and that women needed to be treated within the context of the family.
in fact millions of women were already employed by the 1930s.
the 1936 referendum for a time in 1935 there had seemed reason to question the presidents prospects for reelection.
but by the middle of 1936 with the economy visibly reviving there could be alf landon doubt that he would win a second term.
the republican party nominated the moderate governor of kansas alf m landon who waged a weak campaign.
roosevelts dissident challengers now appeared powerless.
one reason was the violent death of their most effective leader huey long who was assassinated in louisiana in september 1935.
another reason was the ill fated alliance among father coughlin dr townsend and gerald l k smith an intemperate henchman of huey long who joined forces that summer to establish a new political movement the union party which nominated an undistinguished north dakota congressman william lemke for president.
the result was the greatest landslide in american history to that point.
roosevelt polled just under 61 percent of the security poster 1935 within months of the passage of the social irity act of 1935 the new social security board began publicizing the benefits the new im offered to working americans the most dramatic of which was a monthly pension to ed americans who had paid into the system.
the library of congress 674 chapter 24 significant events declining unemployment 1 000 000 unemployed totals for entire labor force unemployment 1920 1945 this chart shows the shifting patterns of unemployment from 1920 to the end of world war ii.
as it reveals nonfarm unemployment was very high in the early 1920s in the last year of the postwar recession but remained relatively low from 1923 to 1929.
the beginning of the great depression sent unemployment soaring to a peak of nearly 13 million people in early 1933 an unemployment rate of 25 percent.
the new deal helped create a partial recovery from the depression over the next four years but unemployment remained very high throughout the 1930s and spiked sharply higher again during the recession of 1937 1938 before falling rapidly after war began in europe.
why was the war so much more successful than the new deal in ending unemployment.
wpa workers on the job the works progress administration funded an enormous variety of work projects to provide jobs for the unemployed.
but most wpa employees worked on construction sites of one kind or another.
jospeh schwartz corbis the new deal 675 wpa mural art the federal arts project of the works progress administration commissioned an impressive series of public murals from the artists it employed.
many of these murals adorned post offices libraries and other public buildings constructed by the wpa.
shown here is a portion of a mural of shipbuilders at the rincon center san francisco.
this mural is unusual in showing an african american worker.
most wpa iconography portrayed workers as white men only.
architec tour alamy vote to landons 36 percent and carried every state except maine and vermont.
the democrats increased their already large majorities in both houses of congress.
the union party received fewer than 900 000 votes.
the election results demonstrated the party realignment electoral rhat ew eal had produced.
the realignment democrats now controlled a broad coalition of western and southern farmers the urban working classes the poor and unemployed and the black communities of northern cities as well as traditional progressives and committed new liberals a coalition that constituted a substantial majority of the electorate.
it would be decades before the republican party could again create a last ing majority coalition of its own.
the new deal in disarray roosevelt emerged from the 1936 election at the zenith of his popularity.
within months however the new deal was mired in serious new difficulties a result of continuing opposition the presidents own political errors and major economic setbacks.
the court fight the 1936 mandate franklin roosevelt believed made it possible for him to do something about the problem of the supreme court.
no program of reform he had become convinced could long survive the conservative justices who had already struck hown the nra and the aaa and threatened to invalidate even more legislation.
in february 1937 roosevelt sent a surprise message to capitol hill proposing a general overhaul of the federal curt system included among the many provisions was one to add up to six new justices to the supreme court with a new justice added for every sitting justice over the age of court seventy.
the courts were overworked packing he claimed and needed additional manpower and fresh ideas to enable them to cope with their increasing burdens.
but roosevelts real purpose was to give himself the opportunity to appoint new liberal justices and change the ideological balance of the court.
conservatives were outraged at the court packing plan and even many roosevelt supporters were disturbed by what they considered evidence of the presidents hunger for power.
still roosevelt might well have persuaded congress to approve at least a compromise measure had not the supreme court itself intervened.
of the nine justices three reliably supported the new deal and four reliably opposed it.
of the remaining two chief justice charles evans hughes often sided with the progressives and associate justice owen j roberts usually voted with the conservatives.
on march 29 1937 roberts hughes and the three progressive justices voted together to uphold a state minimum wage law in the case of west coast hotel u parrishthus appearing to reverse a 5 to 4 decision of the previous year invalidating a similar law.
two weeks later again by a 5 to 4 margin the court upheld the wagner act and in may it validated the social security act.
whether or not for that reason the courts newly moderate position made the courtpacking bill seem unnecessary.
congress ultimately defeated it.
on one level the affair was a significant victory for franklin roosevelt.
the court was no longer an obstacle to new deal reforms particularly after the older justices began to retire to be replaced by roosevelt appointees.
but the court packing episode did lasting political damage to the administration.
from 1937 on southern democrats and other conservatives voted against roosevelts measures much more often than they had in the past.
1 the golden age of comic books superman the most popular action figure in the history of comic books was superman whose superhuman powers were particularly appealing fantasies to americans suffering through the depression and later world war ii.
hulton archive getty images the troubled years of the great depression and world war ii many americans sought release from their anxieties in fantasy.
movies plays books radio shows and other diversions drew people out of their own lives and into a safer or more glamorous or more exciting world.
beginning in 1938 one of the most popular forms of escape for many young americans became the comic book.
in february 1935 malcolm wheeler nicholson founded the first comics magazine what we now know as the comic book titled new fun.
new fun was not successful but wheeler founded a new company detective comics and began in 1937 to design a new magazine called action comics.
wheeler ran out of money before he could publish anything but the company continued without him.
in 1938 the first issue of action comics appeared with a startling and controversial cover a powerful man in a skintight suit lifting a car over his head.
his name was superman and he became the most popular cartoon character of all time.
within a year superman had a comic book named after him which was selling over 1 2 million copies each issue.
by 1940 there was a popular superman radio show introduced by a breathless announcer crying its a bird.
it s a plane.
soon other publishers began developing new superheroes a term invented by the creators of superman to capitalize on this growing new popular appetite.
in 1939 a second great comic book publisher appeared marvel comics.
by the early 1940s superman had been joined by other superheroes the human torch the sub mariner batman the flash and wonder woman a character created in part to signal the importance of women to the war effort.
it is not hard to imagine why superheroes would be so appealing to americans particularly to the teenage boys who were the largest single purchasers of comic books in the 1930s and 1940s.
superman and other superheroes were idealized versions of the ideal boy smart good the perfect boy scout as one fan put it.
but they were also all powerful capable of righting wrong and preventing catastrophe.
at a time when catastrophe was an ever present possibility in the world superheroes were a comforting escape from fear.
many of the early comic book writers were young jewish men conscious of their outsider status in an american culture not yet wholly open to them.
almost all the characters they created had alter egos identities they used while living within the normal world.
superman was clark kent a mild mannered reporter.
batman was bruce wayne a wealthy heir the superhero characters were outsiders themselves but outsiders endowed with special powers and abilities unavailable to ordinary people.
even before america entered world war ii the comic superheroes were battling the axis powers marvel s the human torch and the sub mariner joined forces against the german navy.
superman fought spies and saboteurs at home.
captain america a new character created in march 1941 was a frail young man rejected by the army who after being given a secret serum by a military doctor became extraordinarily powerful.
the cover of the first issue of captain america showed the title character punching hitler in his headquarters in germany.
the end of the war was also the end of this first golden age of american comic books.
many superhero magazines ceased publication as peacetime reduced the popular appetite for fantasy.
in their place emerged new comic books which emphasized romance and even mild sexuality.
in the late 1940s and early 1950s comic books began to come under attack from educators psychiatrists journalists and even the federal government.
congress took no legal action against comic book publishers or writers but the comic book industry itself created a trade association which produced a comics code to prevent indecency in the industry.
comic books experienced an unexpected revival in the late 1950s and 1960s.
old superheroes captain america the human torch and others reappeared new ones spiderman iron man the silver surfer joined them.
superman who had never disappeared enjoyed newfound popularity and became the hero for a time of a popular television show.
but these new or showed similar advances.
roosevelt seized on these improvements as an excuse to try to balance the federal budget convinced by treasury secretary henry morgenthau and many economists that the real danger now was no longer depression but inflation.
between january and august 1937 retrenchment and recession by the summer of 1937 the gross national product which had dropped from 82 billion in 1929 to 40 billion in 1932 had risen back to nearly 72 billion.
other economic indices 676 superman today superman continues to appeal to the fantasies of americans as shown by this poster of the movie superman returns from 2006.
another film man of steel was released in 2013.
and yet another is in the works for 2015 or 2016.
warner bros photofest revised heroes were not entirely like those of the 1930s and 1940s.
they reflected the realities f an increasingly complex and complicated world which their characters like their mostly young readers were struggling to understand.
understand.
and evadj vr what could comic books offer readers suffering through the crisis of the great depression.
how and why have comic book superheroes changed over time.
what might account for the upsurge in comic books popularity in the late 1950s and 1960s.
conditions were soon almost as bad as they had been in the bleak days of 1932 1933.
the recession of 1937 known to the presidents critics as the roosevelt recession was a result of many factors.
but to many observers at the time including apparently the he cut the wpa in half laying off 1 5 million relief workers.
a few weeks later the fragile boom collapsed.
other cuts in spending followed.
the index of industrial production dropped from 117 in august 1937 to 76 in may 1938.
fur million additional workers lost their jobs.
economic 677 1 678 chapter 24 federal budget and surplus deficit 1920 1940 gross national product 1920 1940 100 90 j j 80 u 2 70 5 60 f g 30 i j g 20 x m 10 0 l 8li ibi i 1 1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 budget and surplus deficit as percentage of gnp 1920 1940 president himself it seemed to be a direct result of the t administrations unwise decision to reduce recession spending.
and so m april 1938 the president asked congress for an emergency appropriation of 5 billion for public works and relief programs and government funds soon began pouring into the economy once again.
within a few months another tentative recovery seemed to be under way and the advocates of spending pointed to it as proof of the validity of their approach.
at about the same time at the urging of a group of younger antimonopolist liberals in the administration roosevelt sent a stinging message to congress vehemently denouncing what he called an unjustifiable concentration of economic power and asking for the creation of a commission to consider major reforms in the antitrust laws.
in response congress established the temporary national economic committee tnec whose members included representatives of both houses of congress and officials from several executive agencies.
also that spring roosevelt appointed a new head of the antitrust division of the justice department thurman arnold a yale law school professor who soon proved to be the most vigorous director ever to serve in that office.
later in 1938 the administration successfully supported one of its most ambitious pieces of labor legislation the fair labor standards act which for the first time established a national minimum wage and a forty hour workweek and which also placed strict limits on child labor.
like social security the act at first excluded from its provisions the great majority of women and minority workers.
despite these achievements however by the end of 1938 the new deal had essentially come to an end.
congressional opposition now made it difficult for the president to enact any major new programs.
but more important perhaps the threat end of the wor crisis hung heavy in the political new deal atmosphere and roosevelt was gradually growing more concerned with persuading a reluctant nation to prepare for war than with pursuing new avenues of reform.
1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 federal budget surplus deficit and gnp 1920 1940 among its many other effects the great depression produced dramatic changes in the fiscal condition of the federal government.
in the first of these three charts note the sharp decline in federal spending in the early 1920s as the nation demobilized from world war i and the appearance of significant budget surpluses.
note too the dramatic increase in government spending and the appearance of significant deficits once the depression began and particularly once franklin roosevelt became president.
the second chart illustrates the varying fortunes of the nation s economy by showing the rise and fall of gross national product the total of goods and services produced by the economy.
the gnp fell sharply in the first years of the depression but by the end of the 1930s was nearing its 1929 levels again.
the final chart gives some perspective on these figures by illustrating the relationship between federal spending and federal surpluses and deficits and the total size of the economy.
at its peak in these years federal spending was never more than about 9 percent of the gnp and the deficit never more than about 5 percent.
in recent decades the federal budget has often exceeded 20 percent of the gnp.
deficits much higher in absolute numbers than those of the 1930s were rarely higher as a percentage of the gnp than those of the 1930s until the first decade of the twenty first century.
why did government deficits increase so sharply during the great depression.
limits and legacies of the new deal in the 1930s roosevelt s principal critics were conservatives who accused him of abandoning the constitution and establishing a menacing even tyrannical state.
in later years the new deals most visible critics attacked it from the left pointing to the major problems it left unsolved and the important groups it failed to represent.
and beginning in the early twenty first century conservative attacks on the new deal would emerge again.
a full understanding of the new deal requires coming to terms with the sources of both critiques by examining both its achievements and its limits.
the new deal 679 i the idea of the broker state in 1933 many new dealers dreamed of using their new popularity and authority to remake american capitalism to produce new forms of cooperation and control that would create a genuinely harmonious ordered economic world.
by 1939 it was clear that what they had created was in fact something quite different.
but rather than bemoan the gap between their original intentions and their ultimate achievements new deal liberals both in 1939 and in later years chose to accept what they had produced and to celebrate it to use it as a model for future reform efforts.
what they had created was something that in later years would become known as the broker state instead of forging all elements of society into a single fqtari khmfwt of the broker harmonious unit as some reformers had state once hoped to do the real achievement of the new deal was to elevate and strengthen new interest groups so as to allow them to compete more effectively in the national marketplace.
the new deal made the federal government a mediator in that continuous competition a force that could intervene when necessary to help some groups and limit the power of others.
in 1933 there had been only one great interest group albeit a varied and divided one with genuine power in the national economy the corporate world.
by the end of the 1930s american business found itself competing for influence with an increasingly powerful labor movement an organized agricultural economy and aroused consumers.
in later years the broker state idea would expand to embrace other groups as well racial ethnic and religious minorities women and many others.
thus one of the enduring legacies of the new deal was to make the federal government a protector of interest groups and a supervisor of the competition among them rather than an instrument attempting to create a universal harmony of interests.
what determines which interest groups receive government assistance in a broker state.
the experience of the new deal suggests that such assistance goes largely to those groups able to exercise enough political or economic power to demand it.
thus in the 1930s farmers after decades of organization and agitation and workers as the result of militant action and mass mobilization won from the government new and important protections.
other groups less well organized perhaps but politically important because so numerous and visible won limited assistance as well imperiled homeowners the unemployed the elderly.
by the same token the interest group democracy that the new deal came to represent offered much less to those groups either too weak to demand assistance or not visible enough to arouse widespread public support.
and yet those same groups were often the ones most in need of help from their government.
one of the important limits of the new deal therefore was its very modest record on behalf of several important social groups.
african americans and the new deal one group the new deal did relatively little to assist was african americans.
the administration was not hostile to black aspirations.
on the contrary the new deal was probably more sympathetic to them than any previous government of the eleanor roosevelt first lady eleanor roosevelt was among the first women to play an important role in politics and government.
she oversaw franklin roosevelts political campaigns before he became president as well as developed an important career of her own working on social programs in new york.
when she moved to the white house she served her husband by traveling widely something that franklin roosevelt whose legs were paralyzed by polio could not often do and she took on issues that her husband chose not to embrace.
an example is this photograph of eleanor roosevelt riding in a car to a washington d c jail to inspect the facility which had a reputation for being overcrowded and obsolete.
underwood underwood corbis debating the past the new deal t7 ni t3 many years debate among historians over the nature of the new deal mirrored the u h debate among americans in the 1930s over the achievements of the roosevelt administration.
historians struggled just as contemporaries had done to decide whether the new deal was a good thing or a bad thing.
by far the dominant view of the new deal among scholars has been an approving liberal interpretation and the first important voice of that view was arthur m schlesinger jr who argued in the three volumes of the age of roosevelt 1957 1960 that the new deal marked a continuation of the long struggle between public power and private interests.
roosevelt had moved that struggle to a new level challenging the unrestrained power of the business community and offering far more protection for workers farmers consumers and others than they had enjoyed in the past.
the first systematic revisionist interpretation of the new deal came in 1963 in william leuchtenburg s franklin d roosevelt and the new deal.
leuchtenburg was a sympathetic critic arguing that most of the limitations of the new deal were a result of the restrictions imposed on roosevelt by the political and ideological realities of his time that the new deal probably could not have done much more than it did.
nevertheless leuchtenburg could not agree with others who called the new deal a revolution in social policy.
he was able to muster only enough enthusiasm to call it a halfway revolution one that enhanced the positions of some previously disadvantaged groups notably farmers and factory workers but did little or nothing for many others including blacks sharecroppers and the urban poor.
ellis hawley augmented these moderate criticisms of the roosevelt record in the new deal and the problem of monopoly 1966.
in examining 1930s economic policies hawley argued that new deal efforts were in many cases designed to enhance the position of private entrepreneurs even at times at the expense of some of the liberal reform goals that administration officials espoused.
much harsher criticisms of the new deal emerged in the 1960s and later.
barton bernstein in a 1968 essay concluded that the roosevelt administration may have saved capitalism but it failed to help and in many ways actually harmed groups most in need of assistance.
ronald radosh thomas ferguson and more recently colin gordon took such arguments further.
they cited the close ties between the new deal and internationalist financiers and industrialists the liberalism of the 1930s was a product of their shared interest in protecting capitalists and stabilizing capitalism.
most scholars in the 1980s and 1990s however seemed largely to have accepted the revised liberal view that the new deal was a significant and most agreed valuable chapter in the history of reform but one that worked within rigid occasionally crippling limits.
much of the recent work on the new deal has focused on the constraints within which it was operating.
the sociologist theda skocpol along with other scholars has emphasized the issue of state capacity as an important new deal constraint ambitious reform ideas often foundered she argued because no government bureaucracy had sufficient strength and expertise to shape or administer them.
james t patterson barry karl mark leff and others have emphasized the political constraints the new deal encountered.
both in congress and among the public conservative inhibitions about government remained strong.
frank freidel ellis hawley herbert stein and many others point as well to the ideological constraints affecting franklin roosevelt and his supporters.
alan brinkley in the end of reform 1995 described an ideological shift in new deal liberalism that shifted from the initial regulatory view of government to one that envisioned relatively little direct governmental interference in the corporate world and centered instead on keynesian welfare state programs.
david kennedy in freedom from fear 1999 argued by contrast that the aggressive anticapitalism of early new deal liberalism actually hampered the search for recovery.
only when roosevelt twentieth century.
eleanor roosevelt spoke throughout the 1930s on behalf of racial justice and put continuing pressure on her husband and others in the federal government to ease discrimination against blacks.
she was also partially responsible for what was symbolically at least one of the most important events of the decade for african americans.
when the renowned african american concert singer marian anderson was refused permission in the spring of 1939 to give a concert in the auditorium of the daughters of the american revolution washingtons only major concert hall eleanor roosevelt resigned from the organization and then along with interior secretary harold ickes another champion of racial equality helped secure government permission for her to sing on the steps of the lincoln memorial.
andersons easter sunday concert attracted 75 000 people and became in effect one of the first modern civil rights demonstrations.
the president himself appointed a number of black officials to significant second level positions in his administration.
roosevelt appointees such as robert weaver william hastie and mary mcleod bethune created an informal network of black officeholders who consulted frequently cabinet with one another and who became known us the ublack cabinet eleanor roosevelt harold ickes and harry hopkins all made efforts to ensure that new deal relief programs did not exclude blacks and by 1935 perhaps a quarter of all african americans were receiving some form of government assistance.
one result was a historic change in black electoral behavior.
as late as 1932 most african americans were voting republican as they had since the civil war.
by 1936 more than 90 percent of them were voting democratic the beginnings of a political alliance that would endure for decades.
680 fdr in albany before he became president franklin roosevelt served as governor of new york where he developed a reputation of being an activist working to confront the great depression.

the phrase new deal liberalism has come in the postwar era to seem synonymous with modern ideas of aggressive federal management of the economy elaborate welfare systems a powerful bureaucracy and large scale government spending.
many historians of the new deal however would argue that the modern idea of new deal liberalism bears only a limited relationship to the ideas that new dealers themselves embraced.
the liberal accomplishments of the 1930s can be understood only in the context of their own time later liberal efforts drew from that legacy but also altered it to fit the needs and assumptions of very different eras.
understand analyze and evaluate 1.
what is the conservative view of the new deal.
how did the political atmosphere of the 1930s limit the new deal.
did the new deal save capitalism.
if so how and why.
african americans supported franklin roosevelt because they knew he was not their enemy.
but they had few illusions that the new deal represented a major turning point in american race relations.
for example the president was never willing to risk losing the backing of southern democrats by supporting legislation to make lynching a federal crime.
nor would he endorse efforts in congress to ban the poll tax one of the most potent tools by which white southerners kept blacks from voting.
new deal relief agencies did not challenge and indeed reinforced existing patterns of discrimination.
the civilian conservation corps established separate black camps.
the nra codes tolerated paying blacks less than whites doing the same jobs.
african americans were largely excluded from employment in the tva.
the federal housing administration refused to provide mortgages to african existing discrimination reinforced americans moving into white neighborhoods and the first public housing projects financed by the federal government were racially segregated.
the wpa routinely relegated black hispanic and asian workers to the least skilled and lowest paying jobs or excluded them altogether when funding ebbed nonwhites like women were among the first to be dismissed.
the new deal was not hostile to african americans and it did much to help them advance.
but it refused to make the issue of race a significant part of its agenda.
the new deal and the indian problem in many respects government policies toward the indian tribes in the 1930s were simply a continuation of the long established effort to encourage native americans to assimilate indian reorganization act 682 chapter 24 but the principal elements of federal policy in the new deal years worked to advance a very different john collier oa1 larelv because of the efforts of the extraordinary commissioner of indian affairs in those years john collier.
collier was a former social worker who had become committed to the cause of the indians after exposure to tribal cultures in new mexico in the 1920s.
more important he was greatly influenced by the work of twentieth century anthropologists who promoted the idea of cultural relativism which challenged the three centuries old assumption among white americans that indians were savages and that white society was inherently superior and more civilized.
collier promoted legislation that would he hoped reverse the pressures on native americans to assimilate and would allow them the right to live in traditional indian ways.
not all tribal leaders agreed with collier indeed his belief in the importance of preserving indian culture would not find its broadest support among the tribes until the 1960s.
nevertheless collier effectively promoted legislation which became the indian reorganization act of 1934 that restored to the tribes the right to own land collectively.
it reversed the allotment policy adopted in 1887 which encouraged the breaking up of tribal lands into individually owned plots a policy that had led to the loss of over 90 million acres of tribal land to white speculators and others.
in the thirteen years after passage of the 1934 bill tribal land increased by nearly 4 million acres and indian agricultural income increased from under 2 million in 1934 to over 49 million in 1947.
even with the redistribution of lands under the 1934 act however indians continued to possess for the most part only territory whites did not want much of it arid some of it desert.
and as a group they continued to constitute the poorest segment of the population.
the efforts of the 1930s did not solve what some white people called the indian problem they did however provide indians with some tools for rebuilding the viability of the tribes.
women ano the new deal as with african americans the new deal was not hostile to feminist aspirations but neither did it do a great deal to advance them.
that was largely because such aspirations did not have sufficiently widespread support even among women to make it politically advantageous for the administration to back them.
there were to be sure important symbolic gestures on behalf of women.
roosevelt appointed the first female cabinet member in the nations history secretary of labor frances perkins.
he also named more than 100 other women to positions at lower levels of the federal bureaucracy.
they created an active female network within the government and cooperated harlem the negro capital of america photographer jack manning took this picture street portrait 5 young bogs as part of aaron siskinds project called the harlem document which portrayed life in what look magazine called the negro capital of america.
this photo was taken in 1938 or 1939.
jack manning the new york times redux with one another in advancing causes of interest to women.
symbolic such appointments were in part a response gains for to pressure from eleanor roosevelt who women was a committed advocate of womens rights and a champion of humanitarian causes.
molly dewson head of the womens division of the democratic national committee was also influential in securing federal appointments for women as well as in increasing their role within the democratic party.
several women received appointments to the federal judiciary.
and one hattie caraway of arkansas became in 1934 the first woman elected to a full term in the u s senate.
she was running to succeed her husband who had died in office.
but new deal support for women operated within limits partly because new deal women themselves had limited views of what their aims should be.
frances perkins and many others in the administration emerged out of the feminist tradition of the progressive era which emphasized not so much gender equality as special protections for women.
perkins and other women reformers were instrumental in creating support for and shaping the character of the social security act of 1935.
but they built into that bill their own notion of women s special place in a male dominated economy.
the principal provision of the bill specifically designed for women the aid to dependent children program was modeled on the state level mothers pensions that generations of progressive women had worked to pass earlier in the century.
the new deal 683 the new deal generally supported the prevailing belief that in hard times women should withdraw from the work prevailing place to open up more jobs for men.
new gender norms deal relief agencies offered relatively buttressed little employment for women.
the nra sanctioned wage practices that discriminated against women.
the social security program at first excluded domestic servants waitresses and other predomi nantly female occupations.
the new deal in the west and the south two regions of the united states that did receive special attention from the new deal were the west and the south both of which benefited disproportionately from new deal relief and public works programs.
the west received more federal funds per capita through new deal relief programs than any other region and parts of the south were not far behind.
most westerners were eager for the assistance new deal agencies provided but their political leaders were not always as supportive.
in colorado for example the state legislature refused to provide the required matching funds for fera relief in 1933.
when in response harry hopkins cut colorado off from the program unemployed people rioted in denver and looted food stores.
only then did the legislature reverse course and provide funding.
in the south locally administered new deal relief programs did not challenge prevailing racial norms.
in the west too new deal programs accepted existing racial and ethnic prejudices.
in several states relief agencies paid different groups at different rates white anglos received the most generous aid blacks indians and mexican americans received lower levels failure to of support in the ccc camps in new challenge mexico hispanics and anglos sometimes jim crow worked in the same camps but there were frequent tensions and occasional conflicts between them.
but the main reason for the new deals impact on the west was that conditions in the region made the governments programs especially important.
federal agricultural programs had an enormous impact on the west because farming remained so much more central to the economy of the region than it did in much of the east.
the largest new deal public works programs the great dams and power stations were mainly in the west both because the best locations for such facilities were there and because the west had the most need for new sources of water and power.
the grand coulee dam on the columbia river was the largest public works project in american history to that point.
it provided cheap electric power for much of the northwest and along with the construction of smaller dams and water projects nearby cre ated a basis for economic development in the region.
without this enormous public investment by the federal government much of the economic development that trans formed the west after world war ii would have been much more difficult if not impossible to achieve.
but the region paid new deals legacy in the west a price for the governments beneficence for generations after the great depression the federal government maintained a much greater and more visible bureaucratic presence in the west than in any other region.
the new deal located fewer great infrastructure projects in the south than it did in the west although the largest of them the tva was an entirely southern venture.
but many of the economic development efforts the roosevelt administration undertook were of disproportionate benefit to the south largely because the south was the least economically developed region of the nation in the 1930s.
one example was rural electrification which had a large impact on many agrarian areas of the nation but a particular impact on the south where vast parts of the countryside remained without access to power lines until the rural electrification administration provided them.
the new deal also directed national attention toward the economic condition of the south in a way that no previous administration had done.
many americans outside the south had long believed the south to be backward but they tended to attribute that backwardness to racism segregation and prejudice.
in a 1938 economic report sponsored by the federal government a group of social scientists and others called the south the nations number one economic problem although the report made some reference to the souths racial customs it spoke mostly about its lack of sufficiently developed economic institutions and facilities.
failure to achieve recovery the new deal and the national economy the most frequent criticisms of the new deal involve its failure genuinely to revive or reform the american economy.
new dealers never fully embraced government spending as a vehicle for recovery and their efforts along other lines never succeeded in ending the depression.
the economic boom sparked by world war ii not the new deal finally ended the crisis.
nor did the new deal substantially alter the distribution of power within american capitalism and it had only a small impact on the distribution of wealth among the american people.
nevertheless the new deal did have important and lasting effects on both the behavior and the structure of the american economy.
it helped elevate new groups workers farmers and others to positions from which they could at times effectively challenge the power of the corporations.
it contributed to the economic development of the west and to a lesser degree the south.
it increased the regulatory functions of the federal government in ways that helped stabilize previously troubled areas of the economy the stock market the banking system and others.
many of these regulations were weakened or repealed beginning in the 1970s and beyond.
and the administration helped establish the basis for new forms of federal fiscal policy which in the postwar years would give the government tools for promoting and regulating economic growth.

the conservative inhibitions new dealers brought to this task ensured that the welfare system would be limited in its impact at least in comparison with those of other industrial nations would reinforce some traditional patterns of gender and racial discrimination and would be expensive and cumbersome to administer.
but for all its limits the new system marked a historic break with the federal governments traditional reluctance to offer public assistance to its neediest citizens.
the new deal and american politics perhaps the most dramatic effect of the new deal was on the structure and behavior of american government and on the character of american politics.
franklin roosevelt helped enhance the power of the federal government.
by the end of the 1930s state and local governments were clearly of secondary importance to the government in washington.
roosevelt also established the presidency as the preeminent center of authority within the federal government.
finally the new deal had a profound impact on how the american people defined themselves politically.
it took a new weak divided democratic party which expectations of ad been a minority force in american government politics for many decades and turned it into a mighty coalition that would dominate national party competition for more than thirty years.
it turned the attention of many voters away from some of the cultural issues that had preoccupied them in the 1920s and awakened in them an interest in economic matters of direct importance to their lives.
and it created among the american people greatly increased expectations of government expectations that the new deal did not always fulfill but that survived to become the basis of new liberal crusades in the postwar era.
looking back the new deal was the most dramatic and important moment in the modern history of american government.
from the time of franklin roosevelts inauguration in 1933 to the beginning of world war ii eight years later the federal government engaged in a broad and diverse series of experiments designed to relieve the distress of unemployment and poverty to reform the economy to prevent future crises and to bring the great depression to an end.
it had only partial success in all those efforts.
unemployment and poverty remained high throughout the new deal although many federal programs provided assistance to millions of people who would otherwise have had none.
the structure of the american economy remained essentially the same as it had been in earlier years although there were by the end of the new deal some important new regulatory agencies in washington and an important new role for organized labor enforced by a new federal law.
nothing the new deal did ended the great depression but some of its policies kept it from getting worse and some of them pointed the way toward more effective economic policies in the future.
perhaps the most important legacy of the new deal was the creation of a sense of possibilities among many americans to persuade them that the fortunes of individuals need not be left entirely to chance or to the workings of the market.
many americans emerged from the 1930s convinced that individu als deserved some protections from the unpredictability and instability of the modern economy and that the new deal for all its limitations had demonstrated the value of enlisting gov ernment in the effort to provide those protections.

what are some of the views that americans expressed as the world crises of the 1930s expanded.
how did the economic crisis of the worldwide great depression help create new political orders in many nations.
what was the sequence of events between 1939 and 1941 that brought the united states into military involvement in world war ii.
setting the stage republican senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts chairman of the senate foreign relations committee led the fight against ratification of the treaty of versailles in 1918 and 1919.
in part because of his efforts the senate defeated the treaty the united states failed to join the league of nations and american foreign policy embarked on an independent course that for the next two decades would attempt but ultimately fail to expand american influence and maintain international stability without committing the united states to any lasting relationships with other nations.
lodge was not an isolationist.
he believed the united states should exert its influence internationally.
but he believed too that the united states should remain unfettered by obligations to anyone else.
he said in 1919 we are a great moral asset of christian civilization.
how did we get there.
by our own efforts.
nobody led us nobody guided us nobody controlled us.
i would keep america as she has been not isolated not prevent her from joining other nations for.
great purposes but i wish her to be master of her own fate.
lodge was not alone in voicing such sentiments.
throughout the 1920s those controlling american foreign policy attempted to increase americas role in the world while keeping the nation free of commitments that might limit its own freedom of action.
in the end the cautious limited american internationalism of the interwar years proved insufficient to protect the interests of the united states to create global stability or to keep the nation from becoming involved in the greatest war in human history.
the diplomacy of the new era critics of american foreign policy in the 1920s often used a single word to describe the cause of their disenchantment isolationism.
having rejected the wilsonian vision of a new world order myth of they c aime the nation had turned its back on the rest of the globe and repu isolationism diated its international responsibilities.
in fact the united states played a more active role in world affairs in the 1920s than it had at almost any previous time in its history even if not the role the wilsonians had prescribed.
replacing the league it was clear when the harding administration took office in 1921 that american membership in the league of nations was no longer a realistic possibility.
as if finally to bury the issue secretary of state charles evans hughes secured legislation from congress in 1921 declaring the war with germany at an end and then proceeded to negotiate separate peace treaties with the former central powers.
through these treaties american policymakers believed the united states would receive all the advantages of the versailles treaty with none of the burdensome responsibilities.
but hughes was also committed to finding something to replace the league as a guarantor of world peace and stability.
he embarked therefore on a series of efforts to build safeguards against future wars but safeguards that would not hamper american freedom of action in the world.
the most important such effort was the washington conference of 1921 an attempt to prevent what was threatening to become a costly and destabilizing naval armaments race between the united states britain and japan.
in his opening speech hughes startled the delegates by proposing a plan for dramatic reductions in the fleets of all three nations and a ten year moratorium on the construction of large warships.
he called for the scrapping of nearly 2 million tons of existing shipping.
far more surprising than the proposal was the fact that the conference ultimately agreed to accept most of its terms something that hughes apparently had not anticipated.
the five power pact of february 1922 established both limits for total naval tonnage and a ratio of armaments among the signatories for every 5 tons of american and british warships japan would maintain 3 and france and italy 1 75 each.
although the treaty seemed to confirm the military inferiority of japan in fact washington conference of 1921 687.
706 chapter 26 thus in both the southern and central pacific the initiative had shifted to the united states by mid 1943.
the japanese advance had come to a stop.
with aid from australians and new zealanders the americans now began the slow arduous process of moving toward the philippines and toward japan itself.
holding off the germans in the european war the united states had less control over military operations.
it was fighting in cooperation with britain and with the exiled tree french forces in the west and it was trying also to conciliate its new ally the soviet union which was fighting hitler in the east.
the army chief of staff general george c marshall supported a plan for a major allied invasion of france across the english channel in the spring of 1943.
but the american plan faced challenges from the allies.
the soviet union which was absorbing as it would throughout the war the brunt of the german effort wanted the allied invasion to proceed at the earliest possible moment.

america in a world at war 707 northern africa and southern europe before undertaking the major invasion of france.
roosevelt realized that to support the british plan would antagonize the soviets and might delay the important crosschannel invasion.
but he also knew that the invasion of europe would take a long time to prepare and he was reluctant to wait so long before getting american forces into combat.
and so over the objections of some of his most important advisers he decided to support the british plan.
at the end of october 1942 the british opened a counteroffensive against nazi forces in north africa under general erwin rommel who was threatening the suez canal at el alamein and forced the germans to retreat from egypt.
on november 8 anglo american forces landed at oran and algiers in algeria and at casablanca in morocco areas under the nazi controlled french government at vichy and began moving east toward rommel.
the germans threw the full weight of their forces in africa against the inexperienced americans and inflicted a serious defeat on them at the kasserine pass in tunisia.
general george s patton however regrouped the american troops and began an effective counteroffensive.
with the help of allied air and naval power and of british forces attacking from the east under general bernard montgomery the hero of el alamein the american offensive finally drove the last germans from africa in may 1943.
the north africa campaign had tied up a large proportion of the allied resources and contributed to the postponement of the planned may 1943 cross channel invasion of france.
that produced angry complaints from the soviet union.
by now however the threat of a soviet collapse seemed much diminished for during the winter of 1942 1943 stalingrad the red armv had success fully held off a major german assault at stalingrad in southern russia.
hitler had committed such enormous forces to the battle and had suffered such appalling losses that he could not continue his eastern offensive.
the soviet victory had come at a horrible cost.
the german siege of stalingrad had decimated the civilian population of the city and devastated the surrounding countryside.
indeed throughout the war the soviet union absorbed losses far greater than any other warring nation up to 20 million casualties a fact that continued to haunt the russian memory and affect soviet policy generations later.
but the soviet success in beating back the german offensive persuaded roosevelt to agree in a january 1943 meeting with churchill in casablanca to an allied invasion of sicily.
general marshall opposed the plan arguing that it would further delay the vital invasion of france but churchill prevailed with the argument that the operation in sicily might knock italy out of the war and tie up german divisions that might otherwise be stationed in france.
on the night of july 9 1943 american and british armies landed in southeast sicily thirty eight days later they had conquered the island and were moving onto the italian mainland.
in the face of these setbacks mussolinis government collapsed and the deposed dictator fled north to germany.
mussolinis successor pietro badoglio quickly committed italy to the allies but germany moved eight divisions into the country and established a powerful defensive line south of rome.
the allied offensive on the italian peninsula which began on september 3 1943 soon bogged down especially after a serious setback at monte cassino that winter.
not until may 1944 did the allies resume their northward advance.
on june 4 1944 they captured rome.

keystone getty images 708.
chapter 26 the invasion of italy contributed to the allied war effort in several important ways.
but it postponed the invasion of france by as much as a year deeply embittering the soviet rfc union many of whose leaders believed that dispute over the second united states and britain were deliber front ately delaying the cross channel invasion in order to allow the russians to absorb the brunt of the fighting.
the postponement also gave the soviets time to begin moving toward the countries of eastern europe.
america and the holocaust in dealing with the global crisis the leaders of the american government were confronted with one of historys great horrors the nazi campaign to exterminate the jews of europe the holocaust.
as early as 1942 high officials in washington had incontrovertible evidence that hitlers forces were rounding up jews and others including non jewish poles gypsies homosexuals and communists from all over europe transporting them to concentration camps in eastern germany and poland and systematically murdering them often in factory like gas chambers.
the death toll would ultimately reach 6 million jews and approximately 4 million others.
news of the atrocities was reaching the public as well and public pressure began to build for an allied effort to end the killing or at least to rescue some of the surviving jews.
the american government consistently resisted almost all such entreaties.
although allied bombers were flying missions within a few miles of the most notorious death camp at auschwitz in poland pleas that the planes try to destroy the crematoria at the camp were rejected as militarily unfeasible.
so were similar requests that the allies try to destroy railroad lines leading to the camps.
the united states also resisted entreaties that it admit large numbers of the jewish refugees attempting to escape europe a pattern established well before pearl harbor.
one ship the german passenger liner st louis had arrived off miami in 1939 after having already been turned away from havana cuba carrying nearly 1 000 escaped german jews only to be refused entry and forced to return to europe.

america in a world at war 709 the war the state department did not even use up the number official v sas permitted by law almost 90 per anti semitism cent of the quota remained untouched.
this disgraceful record was not a result of inadvertence.
there was a deliberate effort by officials in the state department spearheaded by assistant secretary breckinridge long a genteel anti semite to prevent jews from entering the united states in large numbers.
one opportunity after another to assist imperiled jews was either ignored or rejected.
after 1941 there was probably little american leaders could have done other than defeat germany to save most of hitlers victims.
but more forceful action by the united states and britain which was even less amenable than america to jewish requests for assistance might well have saved some lives.
policymakers at the time justified their inaction by arguing that most of the proposed actions bombing the railroads and the death camps for example would have had little effect.
they insisted that the most effective thing they could do for the victims of the holocaust was to concentrate their attention solely on the larger goal of winning the war.
the american people in wartime war is no longer simply a battle between armed forces in the field an american government report of 1939 concluded.
it is a struggle in which each side strives to bring to bear against the enemy the coordinated power of every individual and of every material resource at its command.
the conflict extends war induced economic recovery from the soldier in the front line to the citizen in the remotest hamlet in the rear the united states had experienced wars before.
but not since the civil war had the nation undergone so consuming a military experience as world war ii.
american armed forces engaged in combat around the globe for nearly four years.
american society in the meantime underwent changes that reached into virtually every corner of the nation.
prosperity world war ii had its most profound impact on american domestic life by at last ending the great depression.
by the middle of 1941 the economic problems of the 1930s unemployment deflation industrial sluggishness had virtually vanished before the great wave of wartime industrial expansion.
the most important agent of the new prosperity was federal spending which after 1939 was pumping more money into the economy each year than all the new deal relief agencies combined had done.
in 1939 the federal budget had been 9 billion the highest level it had ever reached in peacetime by 1945 it had risen to 100 billion.
largely as a result the gross national product soared from 91 billion in 1939 to 166 billion in 1945.
personal incomes in some areas grew by as much as 100 percent or more.
the demands of wartime production created a shortage of consumer goods so many wage earners diverted much of their new affluence into savings which would help keep the economic boom alive in the postwar years.
the st louis the fate of the german liner st louis has become a powerful symbol of the indifference of the united states and other nations to the fate of european jews during the holocaust even though its forlorn journey preceded both the beginning of world war ii and the beginning of systematic extermination of jews by the nazi regime.
the st louis carried a group of over 900 jews fleeing from germany in 1939 carrying exit visas of dubious legality cynically sold to them by members of hitlers gestapo.
it became a ship without a port as it sailed from country to country mexico paraguay argentina costa rica and cuba where its passengers were refused entry time and again.
most of the passengers were hoping for a haven in the united states but the u s state department refused to allow the ship even to dock as it sailed up the american eastern seaboard.
eventually the st louis returned to europe and distributed its passengers among britain france holland and belgium where this photograph was taken showing refugees smiling and waving as they prepare to disembark in antwerp in june 1939.
less than a year later all those nations except britain fell under nazi control.

712 chapter 26 the war and the west the impact of government spending was perhaps most dramatic in the west which had long relied on federal largesse more than other regions.
the west coast naturally became the launching point for most of the naval war against japan and the government created large manufacturing facilities in california and elsewhere to serve the needs of its military.
altogether the government made almost 40 billion worth of capital investments factories military and transportation facilities highways power plants in the west during the war more than in any other region.
ten percent of all the money the federal government spent between 1940 and 1945 went to california.
other western states also shared disproportionately in war contracts and government funded capital investments.
by the end of the war the economy of the pacific coast and to a lesser extent other areas of the west had been transformed.
the pacific coast had become the center of the growing american aircraft industry.
new yards in southern california washington state and elsewhere made the west a center of the shipbuilding industry.
los angeles formerly a medium sized city notable chiefly for its film industry now became a major industrial center as well.
once a lightly industrialized region parts of the west were now among the most important manufacturing areas in the country.
once a region without adequate facilities to support substantial economic growth the west now stood poised to become the fastest growing region in the nation after the war.
labor and the war instead of the prolonged and debilitating unemployment that had been the most troubling feature of the depression economy the war created a serious labor shortage.
the armed forces took more than 15 million men and women out of the civilian workforce at the same time that the demand for labor was rising rapidly.
nevertheless the civilian workforce increased by almost 20 percent during the war.
the 7 million people who had previously been unemployed accounted for some of the increase the employment of many people previously considered inappropriate for the workforce the very young the elderly and most important several million women accounted for the rest.
the war gave an enormous boost to union membership which rose from about 10 5 million members in 1941 to more union gains r an 13 mi ion in 1945 but a so created important new restrictions on the ability of unions to fight for their members demands.
the government was principally interested in preventing inflation and in keeping production moving without disruption.
it managed to win important concessions from union leaders on both scores.
one was the so called little steel formula which set a 15 percent limit on wartime wage increases.
another was the no strike pledge by which unions agreed not to stop production in wartime.
in return the government provided labor with a maintenance of membership agreement which insisted that the thousands of new workers pouring into unionized defense plants would be automatically enrolled in the unions.
the agreement ensured the continued health of the union organizations but in return workers had to give up the right to demand major economic gains during the war.
many rank and file union members and some local union leaders resented the restrictions imposed on them by the government and the labor movement hierarchy.
despite the no strike pledge there were nearly 15 000 work stoppages during the war mostly wildcat strikes strikes unauthorized by the union leadership.
when the united mine workers defied the government by striking in may 1943 congress reacted by passing over roosevelts veto the smith connally act or the war labor disputes act which required unions to wait thirty days before striking and empowered the president to seize a struck war plant.
in the meantime public animosity toward labor rose rapidly and many states passed laws to limit union power.
stabilizing the boom the fear of deflation the central concern of the 1930s gave way during the war to a fear of inflation particularly after prices rose 25 percent in the two years office of rice j administration before the attack on pearl harbor.
in october 1942 congress grudgingly responded to the presidents request and passed the anti inflation act which gave the administration authority to freeze agricultural prices wages salaries and rents throughout the country.
enforcement of these provisions was the task of the office of price administration opa led first by leon henderson and then by chester bowles.
in part because of its success inflation was a much less serious problem during world war ii than it had been during world war i.
even so the opa was never popular.
there was widespread resentment of its controls over wages and prices.
and there was only grudging acquiescence in its complicated system of rationing scarce consumer goods coffee sugar meat butter canned goods shoes tires gasoline and fuel oil.
blackmarketing and overcharging grew to proportions far beyond opa policing capacity.
from 1941 to 1945 the federal government spent a total of 321 billion twice as much as it had spent in the entire 150 years of its existence to that point and ten times as much as the cost of world war i.
the national debt rose from 49 billion in 1941 to 259 billion in 1945.
the government borrowed about half the revenues it needed by selling 100 billion worth of bonds some sold to ordinary citizens but most to financial institutions.
much of the rest it raised by radically increasing income taxes through the revenue act of 1942 which established a 94 percent rate for the highest brackets and for the first time imposed taxes on the lowest income families as well.
to simplify collection congress enacted a withholding system of payroll deductions in 1943.
america in a world at war 713 mobilizing production the search for an effective mechanism to mobilize the economy for war began as early as 1939 and continued for nearly four years.
one failed agency after another attempted to bring war rder to the mobilization effort.
finally in production january 1942 the president responded to board widespread criticism by creating the war production board wpb under the direction of former sears roebuck executive donald nelson.
in theory the wpb was to be a superagency with broad powers over the economy.
in fact it never had as much authority as its world war i equivalent the war industries board.
and the genial donald nelson never displayed the administrative or political strength of his 1918 counterpart bernard baruch.
the wpb was never able to win control over military purchases the army and navy often circumvented the board entirely in negotiating contracts with producers.
it was never able to satisfy the complaints of small business which charged correctly that most contracts were going to large corporations.
gradually the president transferred much of the wpbs authority to a new office located within the white house the office of war mobilization directed by former supreme court justice and south carolina senator james f byrnes.
but the owm was only slightly more successful than the wpb.
despite the administrative problems the war economy managed to meet almost all the nation s critical war needs.
enormous new factory complexes sprang up in the space of a few months many of them funded by the federal governments defense plants corporation.
an entire new industry producing synthetic rubber emerged to make up for the loss of access to natural rubber in the pacific.
by the beginning of 1944 american factories were in fact producing more of most goods than the government needed.
their output was twice that of all the axis countries combined.
there were even complaints late in the war from some officials that military production was becoming excessive that a limited resumption of civilian production should begin before the fighting ended.
the military staunchly and successfully opposed almost all such demands.
defense research committee wartime science and technology more than any previous american war world war ii was a watershed for technological and scientific innovation.
that was partly because the american national government poured substantial funds into research and development beginning in 1940.
in that year the government created the national defense research committee ided by the mit scientist vannevar bush who had been a neer in the early development of the computer.
by the end the war the new agency had spent more than 100 million research more than four times the amount spent by the ernment on military research and development in the pre us forty years.
in the first years of the war all the technological advantages seemed to lie with the germans and japanese.
germany had made great advances in tanks and other mechanized armor in the 1930s particularly during the spanish civil war when it had helped arm francos fascist forces.
it used its armor effectively during its blitzkrieg in europe in 1940 and again in north africa in 1942.
german submarine technology was significantly advanced compared to british and american capabilities in 1940 and german u boats were for a time devastatingly effective in disrupting allied shipping.
japan had developed extraordinary capacity in its naval air technology.
its highly sophisticated fighter planes launched from distant aircraft carriers conducted the successful raid on pearl harbor in december 1941.
but britain and america had advantages of their own which quickly helped redress these imbalances.
american techniques of mass production the great automotive assembly lines in particular were converted efficiently to military production in 1941 and 1942 and soon began producing airplanes ships tanks and other armaments in much greater numbers than the germans and japanese could produce.
allied scientists and engineers moved quickly as well to improve anglo american aviation and naval technology particularly to improve the performance of submarines and tanks.
by late 1942 allied weaponry was at least as advanced as that of the enemy.
in addition each technological innovation by the enemy produced a corresponding innovation to limit the damage of the new techniques.
american and british physicists made rapid advances in improving radar and sonar technologytaking advantage of advances in radio technology in the 1920s radar and anb beyond which helped allied naval sonar forces decimate german u boats in 1943 and effectively end their effectiveness in the naval war.
particularly important was the creation in 1940 of centimetric radar which used narrow beams of short wavelength that made radar more efficient and effective than ever before as the british navy discovered in april 1941 when the instruments on one of its ships detected a surfaced submarine ten miles away at night and on another occasion spotted a periscope at three quarters of a mile range.
with earlier technologies the sub and periscope would have been undetectable.
this new radar could also be effectively miniaturized which was critical to its use on airplanes and submarines in particular.
it required only a small rotating aerial and it used newly advanced cavity magnetron valves of great power.
these innovations put the allies far in advance of germany and japan in radar and sonar technology.
the allies also learned early how to detect and disable german naval mines and when the germans tried to counter this progress by introducing an acoustic mine which detonated when a ship came near it not necessarily just on contact the allies developed acoustical countermeasures of their own which transmitted sounds through the water to detonate mines before ships came near them.
anglo american antiaircraft technology both on land and on sea also improved although never to the point where it 714 chapter 26 radar scope 1944 navy technicians are shown here demonstrating the new radar scopes that revolutionized the tracking of ships and planes during world war ii.
national archives and records administration could stop bombing raids.
germany made substantial advances in the development of rocket technology in the early years of the war and it managed to launch some rocket propelled bombs the vis and v2s across the english channel aimed at london.
the psychological effects of the rockets on the british people were considerable.
but the germans were never able to create a production technology capable of building enough such rockets to make a real difference in the balance of military power.
beginning in 1942 british and american forces seized the advantage in the air war by producing new and powerful four engine bombers in great numbers among them the british lancaster bi and the american boeing b17f capable of flying a bomb load of 6 000 pounds for 1 300 miles and capable of reaching 37 500 feet.
because they were able to fly higher and longer than the german equivalents they were able to conduct extensive bombing missions over germany and later japan with much less danger of being shot down.
but the success of the bombers rested heavily as well on new electronic devices capable of guiding their bombs to their targets.
the gee navigation system which was also valuable to the navy used electronic pulses to help pilots plot their exact location something that in the past only a highly skilled navigator could do and then only in good weather.
in march 1942 eighty allied bombers fitted with gee systems staged a devastatingly effective bombing raid on german industrial and military installations in the ruhr valley.
studies showed that the gee system doubled the accuracy rate of night bombing raids.
also effective was the oboe system a radio device that sent a sonic message to airplanes to tell them when they were within twenty yards of their targets first introduced in december 1942.
the area in which the allies had perhaps the greatest advantages in technology and knowledge was the gather ultra intelligence much of it through britains top secret ultra project.
some of america in a world at war 715 the advantages the allies enjoyed came from successful efforts to capture or steal german and japanese intelligence devices.
more important however were the efforts of cryptologists to puzzle out the enemy s systems and advances in computer technology that helped the allies decipher coded messages sent by the japanese and the germans.
much of germany s coded communication made use of the so called enigma machine which was effective because it constantly changed the coding systems it used.
in the first months of the war polish intelligence had developed an electro mechanical computer which it called the bombe that could decipher some enigma messages.
after the fall of poland british scientists led by the brilliant computer pioneer alan turing took the bombe which was too slow to keep up with the increasingly frequent changes of coding the germans were using and greatly improved it.
on april 15 1940 the new improved high speed bombe broke the coding of a series of german messages within hours not days as had previously been the case.
a few weeks later it began decrypting german messages at the rate of 1 000 a day providing the british and later the americans with a constant flow of information about enemy operations that continued unknown to the germans until the end of the war.
later in the war british scientists working for the intelligence services built the first real programmable digital computer the colossus ii which became operational less than a week before the beginning of the normandy invasion.
it was able to decipher an enormous number of intercepted german messages almost instantly.
the united states also had some important intelligence breakthroughs including in 1941 a dramatic success by the magic american magic operation the counterpart to the british ultra in breaking a japanese coding system not unlike the german enigma a mechanical device known to the allies as purple.
the result was that americans had access to intercepted information that if properly interpreted could have alerted them to the japanese raid on pearl harbor in december 1941.
but because such a raid had seemed entirely inconceivable to most american officials prior to its occurrence those who received the information failed to understand or disseminate it in time.
african americans and the war during world war i many african americans had eagerly seized the chance to serve in the armed forces believing that their patriotic efforts would win them an enhanced position in postwar society.
they had been cruelly disappointed.
as world war ii approached blacks were again determined to use the conflict to improve their position in society this time however not by currying favor but by making demands.
in the summer of 1941 a philip randolph president of the predominantly black brotherhood of sleeping car porters began to insist that the government require companies receiving defense contracts to integrate their workforces.
to mobilize support for the demand randolph planned a massive march on washington which would he promised bring more than 100 000 demonstrators to the capital.
roosevelt was afraid of both the possibility of violence and the certainty of political embarrassment.
he finally persuaded randolph to cancel the march in return for a promise to fepc establish a fair employment practices commission fepc to investigate discrimination in war industries.
the fepc s enforcement powers and thus its effectiveness were limited but its creation was a rare symbolic victory for african americans making demands of the government.
the demand for labor in war plants greatly increased the migration of blacks from the rural areas of the south into industrial cities a migration that continued for more than a decade after the war and brought many more african americans into northern cities than the great migration of 1914 1919 had done.
the migration bettered the economic condition of many african americans but it also created urban tensions.
on a hot june day in detroit in 1943 a series of altercations between blacks and whites at a city park led to two days of racial violence in which thirty four people died twenty five of them african americans.
despite such tensions the leading black organizations redoubled their efforts during the war to challenge the system core segreation the congress of racial equality core organized in 1942 mobilized mass popular resistance to discrimination in a way that the older more conservative organizations had never done.
randolph bayard rustin james farmer and other younger black leaders helped organize sit ins and demonstrations in segregated theaters and restaurants.
in 1944 core won a much publicized victory by forcing a washington d c restaurant to agree to serve african americans.
core s defiant spirit would survive into the 1950s and help produce the civil rights movement.
pressure for change was also growing within the military.
at first the armed forces maintained their traditional practice of limiting blacks to the most menial assignments keeping them in segregated training camps and units and barring them entirely from the marine corps and the army air forces.
gradually however military leaders were forced to make adjustments in part because of public and political pressures but also because they recognized that these forms of segregation were wasting manpower.
by the end of the war the number of black servicemen had increased sevenfold to 700 000 some training camps were being at least partially integrated african americans were beginning to serve on ships with white sailors and more black units were being sent into combat than at the beginning of the war.
but tensions remained.
in some of the partially integrated army bases fort dix new jersey for example riots occasionally broke out when african americans protested having to serve in segregated divisions.
substantial discrimination survived in all the services until well after the war.
but within the military as within the society at large the traditional pattern of race relations was slowly eroding.
716 chapter 26 native americans and the war approximately 25 000 native americans performed military service during world war ii.
many of them served in combat among them ira hayes one of the men who memorably raised code the american flag at iwo jima.
others talkers worked as code talkers working in military communications and speaking their own languages which enemy forces would be unlikely to understand over the radio and the telephones.
the war had important effects too on those native americans who remained civilians.
little war work reached the tribes and government subsidies dwindled.
many talented young people left the reservations some to serve in the military others more than 70 000 to work in war plants.
this brought many indians into close contact with white society for the first time and awakened in some of them a taste for the material benefits of life in capitalist america that they would retain after the war.
some never returned to the reservations but chose to remain in the non indian world and assimilate to its ways.
others found that after the war employment opportunities that had been available to them during the fighting became unavailable once again drawing them back to the reservations.
the wartime emphasis on national unity undermined support for the revitalization of tribal autonomy that the indian reorganization act of 1934 had launched.
new pressures emerged to eliminate the reservation system and require the tribes to assimilate into white society pressures so severe that john collier the director of the bureau of indian affairs who had done so much to promote the reinvigoration of the reservations resigned in 1945.
mexican american war workers large numbers of mexican workers entered the united states during the war in response to labor shortages on the pacific coast in the southwest and eventually in almost all areas of the nation.
the american and mexican governments agreed in 1942 to a program by which braceros contract laborers would be admitted to the united states for a limited time to work at specific jobs and american employers in some parts of the southwest began actively recruiting mexican american workers.
during the depression many mexican american farmworkers had been deported to make room for unemployed white workers.
the wartime labor shortage caused farm owners to begin hiring mexican americans again.
more important however mexican americans were able for the first time to find significant numbers of factory jobs.
they formed the second largest group of migrants after african americans to american cities in the 1940s.
over 300 000 of them served in the united states military.
the sudden expansion of mexican american neighborhoods created tensions and occasionally conflict in some employment gains for mexican americans victory gardens during both world war i and ii private and public lands were cultivated by non combattant civilians often children to reduce the pressure on the public food supply.
in addition to help solving practical needs of food production these gardens served to boost the morale of citizens across the country as they supported the war effort.
here gardeners work a plot of of land in saint gabriels park in new york city with the chrysler building looming in the background.
bettmann corbis american cities.
some white residents of los angeles became alarmed at the activities of mexican american teenagers many of whom were joining street gangs pachucos.
the pachucos were particularly distinctive because of their members style of dress which whites considered outrageous.
they wore zoot suits long loose jackets with padded shoulders baggy pants tied at the ankles long watch chains broad brimmed hats and greased ducktail hairstyles.
it was a style borrowed in part from fashions in harlem.
in june 1943 animosity toward the zoot suiters produced a four day riot in los angeles during which white sailors stationed at a base in long beach invaded mexican american zoot suit communities and attacked zoot suiters riots in response to alleged attacks.
the city police did little to restrain the sailors who grabbed mexican american teenagers tore off and burned their clothes cut off their ducktails and beat them.
but when mexican americans tried to fight back the police moved in and arrested them.
in the aftermath of the zoot suit riots los angeles passed a law prohibiting the wearing of zoot suits.
women and children at war the war drew increasing numbers of women into roles from which by either custom or law they had been largely barred.
the number of women in the workforce dramatic increased by nearly 60 percent and women nfemalein accunted for a third of paid workers in employment 1945 as pposed to a quarter in 1940.
these wage earning women were more america in a world at war 717 likely to be married and older than most women who had entered the workforce in the past.
many women entered the industrial workforce to replace male workers serving in the military.
but while economic and military necessity eroded some of the popular objections to women in the workplace obstacles remained.
many factory owners continued to categorize jobs by gender.
female work like male work was also categorized by race.
black women were usually assigned more menial tasks and paid at a lower rate than their white counterparts.
employers also made substantial investments in automated assembly lines to reduce the need for heavy labor.
special recruiting materials for women made domestic analogies.
cutting airplane wings was compared to making a dress pattern mixing chemicals to making a cake.
still women did make important inroads in industrial employment during the war.
women had been working in industry for over a century but some began now to take on heavy industrial jobs that had long been considered mens work the famous wartime image of rosie the riveter limited child care rosie the riveter symbolized the new importance of the female industrial workforce.
women workers joined unions in substantial numbers and they helped erode at least some of the prejudice including the prejudice against working mothers that had previously kept many of them from paid employment.
most women workers during the war were employed not in factories but in service sector jobs.
above all they worked for the government whose bureaucratic needs expanded dramatically alongside its military and industrial needs.
washington d c in particular was flooded with young female clerks secretaries and typists known as government girls most of whom lived in cramped quarters in boardinghouses private homes and government dormitories and worked long hours in the war agencies.
public and private clerical employment for women expanded in other urban areas as well creating high concentrations of young women in places largely depleted of young men.
even within the military which enlisted substantial numbers of women as wacs army and waves navy most female work was clerical.
the new opportunities produced new problems.
many mothers whose husbands were in the military had to combine working with caring for their children.
the scarcity of child care facilities or other community services meant that some women had no choice but to leave young children often known as latchkey children or eight hour orphans at home alone or sometimes locked in cars in factory parking lots while they worked.
perhaps in part because of the family dislocations the war produced juvenile crime rose markedly in the war years.
young boys were arrested at rapidly increasing rates for car theft and burglary vandalism and vagrancy.
the arrest rate for prostitutes many of whom were teenage girls rose too as did the incidence of sexually transmitted disease.
for many children however the distinctive experience of the war years was not crime but work.
more than a third of all teenagers between the ages of fourteen and eighteen were employed late in the war causing some reduction in high school enrollments.
the return of prosperity during the war helped increase the rate and lower the age of marriage after the depression decline but many of these young marriages were unable to survive the pressures of wartime separation.
the divorce rate rose rapidly.
the rise in the birth rate that accompanied the increase in marriages was the first sign of what would become the great postwar baby boom beginning of the baby boom soldiers women at war many american women enlisted in the army and navy women s corps during world war ii but an equally important contribution of women to the war effort was their work in factories and offices often in jobs that would have been considered inappropriate for them in peacetime but that they were now encouraged to assume because of the absence of so many men.
the library of congress i life the great magazine birth of a great era of photographs in the twentieth century created many new magazines.
one of the finest was life first published in 1936 by henry luce.
it soon became the most popular magazine in america.
luce himself wrote a minor classic of journalism for his new magazine to see life to see the world to eyewitness great events to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud to see strange things machines armies multitudes shadows in the jungle and on the moon to see man s work.
thus to see and to be shown is now the will and new expectancy of half of mankind.
henry luce time life pictures getty images luce and his partner briton hadden began a remarkable empire when they started time magazine in 1923.
but hadden died suddenly in 1929 and luce took charge.
he began a successful business magazine fortune.
but it was life that made luce famous and wealthy.
the cowles family of iowa followed luce with look which was also successful.
but for most americans life was the most important magazine.
life which began just three years before world war ii presented many stories on the coming conflict.
building for the war was growing fast by 1942.
detroit and other cities turned their automobile production into the manufacture of planes armored vehicles jeeps and other war materiel.
life reporters warned that the morale situation is perhaps worst in the u s for detroit can either blow up hitler or it can blow up the u s life sent a large pool of photographers and graphic artists across the atlantic to cover the war.
the magazine turned the conflict into a great visual story and became renowned for its striking imagery.
life s remarkable popularity continued throughout the war its first issue after the japanese attack on pearl harbor featured the word war set in large black type on its first page.
photographers were not allowed to use many of the pictures they took of the tremendous damage until 1943 because editors feared that people at home would be shocked if they saw wartime life and culture the war created considerable anxiety in american life.
families worried about loved ones at the front and struggled to adjust to the absence of husbands fathers brothers sons and to the new mobility of women which also drew family members away from home.
businesses and communities struggled to compensate for shortages of goods and the absence of men.
but the abundance of the war years also created a striking buoyancy in american life that the conflict itself only partially subdued.
suddenly people had money to spend again 718 economic and despite the many shortages of con ood times sumer goods at least some things to spend it on.
audiences equal to about half the population attended movies each week often to watch heroic war films.
magazines particularly pictorial ones such as life reached the peak of their popularity satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger of readers for pictures of and stories about the war.

but eventually americans saw what the war really was through images that included flag draped coffins.
at the end of the war on vj day the great photographer alfred eisenstadt captured a moment of peace and joy when he took the famous picture of a sailor embracing a young woman in times square.
after the war although there were still serious essays on politics and foreign affairs life began another effort to show america as a prosperous and happy nation.
the magazine began to show modern living along with football games automobile trips family trips and all the pleasant trivia of the american way of life.
life was eager to show the great bounty of american life.
how can one feel thankful for too much one reporter wrote through most of the 1950s life remained an enormously prosperous venture.
but toward the end of that decade life started to decline as many magazines began to lose their impact with the growing popularity of television.
advertisers who would have bought ad space in magazines began buying television advertisements magazines including life lost a vital source of their revenue.
in december 1972 life published its last issue.
but the great life photographs remain a remarkable archive of events around the world during a large part of the twentieth century.
home on leave or awaiting shipment overseas were especially attracted to the dances and the big band.
advertisers and at times even the government exhorted americans to support the war effort to ensure a future of material comfort and consumer choice for themselves and their children.
your people are giving their lives in useless sacrifice the saturday evening post wrote in a mock letter to the leaders of wartime japan.
ours are fighting for a glorious future of mass employment mass production and mass distribution and ownership even troops at the front seemed at rimes to justify their efforts with reference to the comforts of home more than to the character of the enemy or the ideals fighting for future prosperity america claimed to be defending.
they are fighting for home the writer john hersey once wrote from guadalcanal with at least a trace of dismay because home is where the good things are the generosity the good pay the comforts the democracy the pie for men at the front the image of home was a powerful antidote to the rigors of wartime.
they dreamed of music food movies material comforts.
many also dreamed of women wives and girlfriends but also movie stars and others who became the source of one of the most popular icons of the front the pinup.
720 chapter 26 for the servicemen who remained in america during the war and for soldiers and sailors in cities far from home in particular the company of friendly wholesome women was the uso military believed critical to maintaining morale.
usos recruited thousands of young women to serve as hostesses in their clubs women who were expected to dress nicely dance well and chat happily with lonely men.
other women joined dance brigades and traveled by bus to military bases for social evenings with servicemen.
they too were expected to be pretty to dress attractively and conservatively and to interact comfortably with men they had never met before and would likely never see again.
the uso forbade women to have dates with soldiers after parties in the clubs and the members of the dance brigades were expected to have no contact with servicemen except during the dances.
clearly such regulations were sometimes violated.
but while the military took elaborate measures to root out homosexual men and women from their ranks unceremoniously dismissing many of them with undesirable dis charges it quietly tolerated healthy heterosexuality the internment of japanese americans world war i had produced widespread hatred vindictiveness and hysteria in america as well as widespread and flagrant violations of civil liberties.
world war ii did not produce a comparable era of repression.
the government barred from the mails a few papers it considered seditious among them father coughlins anti semitic and pro fascist social justice but there was no general censorship of dissident publications.
the most ambitious effort to punish domestic fascists a sedition trial of twenty eight people ended in a mistrial and the defendants went free.
unlike during world war i the government generally left socialists and communists most of whom strongly supported the war effort alone although the roosevelt administration summarily and secretly executed a number of german spies who had entered the country.
nor was there much of the ethnic or cultural animosity that had shaped the social climate of the united states during world war i.
the zoot suit riots in los angeles and occasional racial conflicts in american cities and on military bases made clear that traditional racial and ethnic hostilities had not ethnic disappeared.
so did wartime restrictions distinctions imposed on some italians including provi blurred sions forbidding many of them to travel and imprisoning several hundred.
the great opera singer ezio pinza was classified as an enemy alien but on the whole the war worked more to blur ethnic distinctions than to heighten them.
americans continued to eat sauerkraut without calling it by the world war i name liberty cabbage they displayed relatively little hostility toward german or italian americans.
instead they seemed to share the view of their governments propaganda that the enemy was less the german and italian people than the vicious political systems to which they had succumbed.
in popular culture and in everyday interactions ethnicity seemed less a source of menacing difference as it often had in the past and more evidence of healthy diversity.
the participation and frequent heroism of american soldiers of many ethnic backgrounds encouraged this change.
but there was a glaring exception to the general rule of tolerance the treatment of the small politically powerless group of japanese americans.
from the beginning americans adopted a different attitude toward their asian enemy than they did toward their european foes.
the japanese both government and private propaganda encouraged americans to believe were a devious malign and cruel people.
the infamous attack on pearl harbor seemed to many americans to confirm that assessment.
this racial animosity soon extended to americans of japanese descent.
there were not many japanese americans in the continental united states only about 127 000 most of them concentrated in a few areas in california.
about a third of them were unnaturalized first generation immigrants issei two thirds were naturalized or native born citizens of the united states nisei.
the japanese in america like the chinese had long been the target of ethnic and racial animosity and unlike members of european ethnic groups who had encountered similar resentment asians seemed unable to dispel prejudice against them no matter how assimilated they became.
many white americans anti japanese continued to consider asians even native prejudice born citizens so foreign that they could never become real americans.
partly as a result much of the japanese american population in the west continued to live in close knit to some degree even insular communities which reinforced the belief that they were alien and potentially menacing.
the attack on pearl harbor inflamed these long standing suspicions and turned them into active animosity.
wild stories circulated about how the japanese in hawaii had helped sabotage pearl harbor and how japanese americans in california were conspiring to aid an enemy landing on the pacific coast.
there was no evidence to support any of these charges but according to earl warren then attorney general of california the apparent passivity of the japanese americans was itself evidence of the danger they posed.
because they did nothing to allow officials to gauge their intentions warren claimed it was all the more important to take precautions against conspiracies.
although there was some public pressure in california to remove the japanese threat popular sentiment was generally more tolerant of the nisei and issei and more willing to make distinctions between them and the japanese in japan than was official sentiment.
the real impetus for taking action came from the government.
secretary of the navy frank knox for example said shortly after pearl harbor that the most effective fifth column a term for internal sabotage work of the entire war was done in hawaii that statement clearly referring to the large japanese population there later proved to be entirely false.
general john l dewitt the senior military commander on the west coast claimed to have no confidence in japanese american loyalty whatsoever when asked about the distinction between unnaturalized japanese immigrants america in a world at war 721 and american citizens he said a jap is a jap.
it makes no dif ference whether he is an american citizen or not in february 1942 in response to such pressure and over the objections of the attorney general and j edgar hoover the director of the fbi president roosevelt authorized the army to intern the japanese americans.
he created the war relocation authority wra to oversee the project.
more than 100 000 people issei and nisei alike were rounded up told to dispose of their property however they could which often meant simply abandoning it and taken to what the govern relocation ment euphemistically termed relocation centers centers in the interior in fact they were facilities little different from prisons many of them located in the western mountains and the desert.
conditions in the internment camps were not brutal but they were harsh and uncomfortable.
government officials talked of them as places where the japanese could be socialized and americanized but the internment camps were more a target of white economic aspirations than of missionary work.
the governor of utah where many of the internees were located wanted the federal government to turn over thousands of japanese americans to serve as forced laborers.
washington did not comply but the wra did hire out many inmates as agricultural laborers.
the internment never produced significant popular opposition.
for the most part once the japanese were in the camps other americans including their former neighbors on the west coast largely forgot about them except to make strenuous efforts to acquire the property they had abandoned.
even so beginning in 1943 conditions slowly improved.
some young japanese americans left the camps to attend colleges and universities mostly in the east the wra continued to be wary of letting japanese return to the pacific coast.
others were permitted to move to cities to take factory and service jobs although again not on the west coast.
some young manzanar relocation center during world war ii more than 100 000 japanese americans were interned by the government in relocation centers such as the one shown here.
many o these u s citizens were forced to give up their property and to work for little or no money.
here sequestered citizens wait for lunch.
the library of congress lc a35 6 m 22 men joined and others were drafted into the american military a nisei army unit fought with distinction in europe.
in 1944 the supreme court ruled in korematsu v u s that the relocation was constitutionally permissible.
in another case the same year it barred the intern y g ment of loyal citizens but left the inter pretation of loyal to the discretion of the government.
nevertheless by the end of 1944 most of the internees had been released and in early 1945 they were finally permitted to return to the west coast where they faced continuing harassment and persecution and where many found their property and businesses irretrievably lost.
in 1988 they won some compensation for their losses when after years of agitation by survivors of the camps and their descendants congress voted to award them reparations.
but by then many of the former internees had died.
chinese americans and the war just as americas conflict with japan undermined the position of japanese americans the american alliance with china during world war ii significantly enhanced both the legal and social status of chinese americans.
in 1943 partly to improve relations with the government of china congress finally repealed the chinese exclusion act which had barred almost all chinese immigration since 1882.
the new quota for chinese immigrants was minuscule 105 a year but a substantial number of chinese women managed to gain entry into the country chinese through other provisions covering war exclusion brides and fiancees.
over 4 000 chinese acts repealed women entered the united states in the first three years after the war.
permanent residents of the united states who were of chinese descent were finally permitted to become citizens.
racial animosity toward the chinese did not disappear but it did decline in part because government propaganda and popular culture began presenting positive images of the chinese partly to contrast them with the japanese in part because chinese americans like african americans and other previously marginal groups began taking jobs in war plants and other booming areas suffering from labor shortages and hence moving out of the isolated world of the chinatowns.
a higher proportion of chinese americans 22 percent of all adult males were drafted than of any other national group and the entire chinese community in most cities worked hard and conspicuously for the war effort.
the retreat from reform late in 1943 franklin roosevelt publicly suggested that dr new deal as he called it had served its purpose and should now give way to dr win the war the statement reflected the presidents own genuine shift in concern that victory was now more important 722 chapter 26 than reform.
but it also reflected the political reality that had emerged during the first two years of war.
liberals in government were finding themselves unable to enact new programs.
they were even finding it difficult to protect existing ones from conservative assault.
within the administration itself many liberals found themselves displaced by the new managers of the wartime agencies who came overwhelmingly from large corporations and conservative wall street law firms.
but the greatest assault on dismantling new deal reforms came from conserva the new deal tives in congress who seized on the war as an excuse to do what many of them had wanted to do in peacetime dismantle many of the achievements of the new deal.
they were assisted by the end of mass unemployment which decreased the need for such relief programs as the civilian conservation corps and the works progress administration both of which were abolished by congress.
they were assisted too by their own increasing numbers.
in the congressional elections of 1942 republicans gained 47 seats in the house and 10 in the senate.
roosevelt continued to talk at times about his commitment to social progress and liberal reform in part to bolster the flagging spirits of his traditional supporters.
but increasingly the president quietly accepted the defeat or erosion of new deal measures in order to win support for his war policies and peace plans.
he also accepted the changes because he realized that his chances for reelection in 1944 depended on his ability to identify himself less with domestic issues than with world peace.
republicans approached the 1944 election determined to exploit what they believed was resentment of wartime regimentation and privation and unhappiness with democratic reform.
they nominated as their candidate the young and vigorous governor of new york thomas e dewey.
roosevelt was unopposed within his party but democratic leaders pressured him to abandon the controversial vice president henry wallace an outspoken liberal and hero of the cio.
roosevelt tired and frail seemed to take little interest in the matter and passively acquiesced in the selection of senator harry s truman of missouri a man he barely knew.
truman was not a prominent figure in the party but he had won acclaim as chairman of the senate war investigating committee known as the truman committee which had compiled an impressive record of uncovering waste and corruption in wartime production.
the conduct of the war was not an issue in the campaign.
instead the election revolved around domestic economic 1944 election issues anct indirectly the president s health.
the president was in fact gravely ill suffering from among other things arteriosclerosis.
but the campaign seemed momentarily to revive him.
he made several strenuous public appearances late in october which dispelled popular doubts about his health and ensured his reelection.
roosevelt captured 53 5 percent of the popular vote to deweys 46 percent and won 432 electoral votes to deweys 99.
democrats lost 1 seat in the senate gained 20 in the house and maintained control of both.
the defeat of the axis strategic bombing by the middle of 1943 america and its allies had succeeded in stopping the axis advance in both europe and the pacific.
in the next two years the allies themselves seized the offensive and launched a series of powerful drives that rapidly led the way to victory.
the liberation of france by early 1944 american and british bombers were attacking german industrial installations and other targets almost around the clock drastically cutting production and impeding transportation.
especially devastating was the massive bombing of such german cities as leipzig dresden and berlin attacks that often made few distinctions between industrial sites and resi dential ones.
a february 1945 incendiary raid on dresden created a great firestorm that destroyed three fourths of the previously undamaged city and killed approximately 135 000 people almost all civilians.
military leaders claimed that the bombing destroyed industrial facilities demoralized the population and cleared the way for the great allied invasion of france planned for the late spring.
the air battles over germany considerably weakened the luftwaffe the german air force and made it a less formidable obstacle to the allied invasion.
preparations for the invasion were also assisted by the breaking of the enigma code.
an enormous invasion force had been gathering in england for two years almost 3 million troops and perhaps the greatest array of naval vessels and armaments ever assembled in one d day place.
on the morning of june 6 1944 d day general dwight d eisenhower the supreme commander of the allied forces sent this vast armada into action.
the landing came not at the narrowest part of the english channel where the germans had expected and prepared for it but along sixty miles of the cotentin peninsula on the coast of normandy.
while airplanes and battleships offshore bombarded the nazi defenses 4 000 vessels landed troops and supplies on the beaches.
three divisions of paratroopers had been dropped behind the german lines the night before amid scenes of great confusion to seize critical roads and bridges for the push inland.
fighting was intense along the beach but the superior manpower and equipment of the allied forces gradually prevailed.
within a week the german forces had been dislodged from virtually the entire normandy coast.
for the next month further progress remained slow.
but in late july in the battle of saint lo general omar bradleys first army smashed through the german lines.
general george s patton s third army spearheaded by heavy tank attacks then moved through the hole bradley had created and began a drive into the heart of france.
on august 25 free french forces arrived in paris and liberated the city from four years of german occupation.
and by mid september the allied armies had driven the germans almost entirely out of france and belgium.

world war ii in europe the allied counteroffensive 1943 1945 this map illustrates the climactic movements in the war in europe the two great offensives against germany that began in 1943 and culminated in 1945.
from the east the armies of the soviet union having halted the germans at stalingrad and moscow swept across eastern europe toward germany.
from the west and the south american british and other allied forces moved toward germany through italy and after the normandy invasion in june 1944 through france.
the two offensives met in berlin in may 1945.
what problems did the position of the allied forces at the end of the war help to produce.
the great allied drive came to a halt however at the rhine river in the face of a firm line of german defenses and a period f cold weather rain and floods.
in mid december german forces struck in desperation along fifty miles of front in the battle of the ardennes forest.
in the battle of the bulge bulge named for a large bulge that appeared in the american lines as the germans pressed forward they drove fifty five miles toward antwerp before they were finally stopped at bastogne.
the battle ended seri ous german resistance in the west.
while the allies were fighting their way through france soviet forces were sweeping westward into central europe and the balkans.
in late january 1945 the russians launched a great offensive toward the oder river inside germany.
in early spring they were ready to launch a final assault against berlin.
by then omar bradleys first army was pushing into germany from the west.
early in march his forces captured the city of cologne on the west bank of the rhine.
the next day in a remarkable stroke of good fortune he discovered and seized an undamaged bridge over the river at remagen 724 chapter 26 the normandy invasion this photograph taken from a landing craft shows american troops wading ashore and onto the normandy beaches where one of the decisive battles of world war ii was taking shape.
the invasion was launched despite threatening weather and rough seas.
popperfoto getty images allied troops were soon pouring across the rhine.
in the following weeks the british field marshal bernard montgomery commander of allied ground operations on d day and after pushed into northern germany with a million troops while bradleys army sweeping through central germany completed the encirclement of 300 000 german soldiers in the ruhr.
the german resistance was now broken on both fronts.
american forces were moving eastward faster than they had anticipated and could have beaten the russians to berlin and prague.
instead the american and british high commands decided to halt the advance along the elbe river in central germany to await the russians.
that decision enabled the soviets to occupy eastern germany and czechoslovakia.
on april 30 with soviet forces on the outskirts of berlin adolf hitler killed himself in his bunker in the capital.
and germany on may 8 1945 the remainin german defeated forces surrendered unconditionally.
v e victory in europe day prompted great celebrations in western europe and in the united states tempered by the knowledge of the continuing war against japan.
the pacific offensive in february 1944 american naval forces under admiral chester nimitz won a series of victories in the marshall islands and cracked the outer perimeter of the japanese empire.
within a month the navy had destroyed other vital japanese bastions.
american submarines in the meantime were decimating japanese shipping and crippling the nations domestic economy.
by the summer of 1944 the already skimpy food rations for the japanese people had been reduced by nearly a quarter there was also a critical gasoline shortage.
americas principal ally in asia was china and the united states hoped that the chinese forces would help defeat the japanese.
to assist them the army sent general joseph w stilwell to help provide critical supplies to china by a land route through india and across the himalayas.
it was a brutal task.
the japanese blocked them at several points and stilwell had to rely for a time on airlifts of supplies over the mountains.
but finally in the fall of 1944 stilwells forces succeeded in constructing a road and pipelines across the mountains into china a route that came to be known by several names the burma road the ledo road and at times the stilwell road.
america in a world at war 725 coming home euphoric american soldiers arrive in new york harbor back aboard the queen elizabeth after the end of the war in europe in 1945.
ap images japanese forces consistently threatened the burma road.
more dangerously the japanese were also threatening the wartime capital of china in chungking.
chiang kai shek the chinese premier was reluctant to use his troops against the japanese and seemed more concerned with attacking chinese communists who were also fighting the japanese.
this helped create a famous feud between stilwell and chiang.
stilwell began to call chiang not entirely privately the peanut the dispute continued for many months until stilwell finally left china.
stilwell s successors had little more success in prodding chiang to confront the japanese.
the decisive battles of the pacific war occurred not in china but at sea.
in mid june 1944 an enormous american armada struck the heavily fortified mariana islands and after some of the bloodiest operations of the war captured tinian guam and saipan 1 350 miles from tokyo.
in september american forces landed on the western carolines.
and on october 20 general macarthur s troops landed on leyte island in the philippines.
as the american forces pushed closer to japan itself the japanese used their entire fleet against the allied invaders in three major encounters which together constituted the decisive battle of leyte gulf the largest naval battle of leyte gulf engagement in history.
american forces held off the japanese onslaught and sank four japanese carriers all but destroying japan s capacity to continue a serious naval war.
nevertheless the japanese forces seemed only to increase their resistance.
in february 1945 american marines seized the tiny volcanic island of iwo jima only 750 miles from tokyo but only after the costliest single battle in the history of the marine corps.
the marines suffered over 25 000 casualties and the japanese forces suffered even greater losses.
the battle for okinawa an island only 370 miles south of japan was further evidence of the strength of the japanese okinawa resistance in those last desperate months.
week after week the japanese sent kamikaze suicide planes against american and british ships sacrificing 3 500 of them while inflicting great damage.
japanese troops on shore launched desperate nighttime attacks on the american lines.
the united states and its allies suffered nearly 50 000 casualties before finally capturing okinawa in late june 1945.
more than 100 000 japanese died in the siege.
the same kind of bitter fighting seemed to await the americans in japan itself.
but there were also signs early in 726 chapter 26 okinawa the invasion of okinawa an island near japan was one of the last major battles of world war ii.
in this photograph taken june 18 1945 a bullet scarred monument provides shelter to members of the 7th infantry of the u s tenth army as they look ahead at japanese action.
over 11 000 americans and more than 80 000 japanese died in the rugged battle for the island which consumed nearly three months.
it ended three days after this photograph was taken.
two months later after the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki japan surrendered.
bettmann corbis japanese had almost no ships or planes left with which to fight.
in july 1945 for example american warships stood off the shore of japan and shelled industrial targets many already in ruins from aerial bombings with impunity.
a brutal firebombing of tokyo in march in which american bombers dropped napalm on the city created a massive firestorm in which at least 83 000 and perhaps as many as 100 000 mostly civilians died.
it further weakened the japanese will to resist.
moderate japanese leaders who had long since decided that the war was lost were struggling for power within the government and were looking for ways to bring the war to an end.
after the invasion of okinawa emperor hirohito appointed a new premier and gave him instructions to sue for peace but the new leader could not persuade military leaders to give up the fight.
the premier did try along with the emperor to obtain mediation through the soviet union.
the russians however showed little interest in playing the role of arbitrator.
whether the moderates could ultimately have prevailed is a question about which historians and others continue to disagree.
in any case the question eventually became moot.
in mid july american scientists conducted a successful test of a new atomic bomb which led to a major event in world history significant only in part because it ended world war ii.
the manhattan project reports had reached the united states in 1939 that nazi scien tists had taken the first step toward the creation of an atomic bomb.
the united states and britain immediately began a race to develop the weapon before the germans did.
the search for the new weapon emerged from theories developed by atomic physicists beginning early in the century and particularly from some of the founding ideas of modern science developed by albert einstein.
einsteins famous theory of relativity had revealed the relationships between mass and energy.
more precisely he had argued that in theory at least matter could be converted into a tremendous force of energy.
it was einstein by then living in the united states who warned franklin roosevelt that the germans were developing atomic weapons and that the united states must begin trying to do the same.
the effort to build atomic weapons centered on the use of uranium whose atomic structure made possible the creation of a nuclear chain reaction.
a nuclear chain reaction occurs when the atomic nuclei in radioactive matter are split a process known as nuclear fission by neutrons.
each fission creates new neutrons that produce fissions in additional atoms at an ever increasing and self sustaining pace.
the construction of atomic weapons had become feasible by the 1940s because of the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium in the 1930s by enrico fermi in italy.
in 1939 the enrico fermi 8reat danish physicist niels bohr sent news of german experiments in radioactivity to the united states.
in 1940 scientists at columbia university began chain reaction experiments with uranium and produced persuasive evidence of the feasibility of using uranium as fuel for a weapon.
the columbia experiments stalled in 1941 and america in a world at war 727 the explosion a blinding flash of light probably brighter than any ever seen on earth followed by a huge billowing mushroom cloud created a vast crater in the barren desert.
the work moved to uc berkeley and the university of chicago where enrico fermi who had emigrated to the united states in 1938 achieved the first controlled fission chain reaction in december 1942.
by then the army had taken control of the research and appointed general leslie groves to reorganize the project which soon became known as the manhattan project because it was devised in the manhattan engineer district office of the army corps of engineers.
over the next three years the u s government secretly poured nearly 2 billion into the manhattan project a massive scientific and technological effort conducted at hidden laboratories in oak ridge tennessee los alamos new mexico hanford washington and other sites.
scientists in oak ridge who were charged with finding a way to create a nuclear chain reaction that could be feasibly replicated within the confined space of a bomb began experimenting with plutonium a derivative of uranium first discovered by scientists at uc berkeley.
plutonium proved capable of providing a practical fuel for the weapon.
scientists in los alamos under the direction of j robert oppenheimer were charged with the construction of the actual atomic bomb.
despite many unforeseen problems the scientists pushed ahead much faster than anyone had predicted.
even so the war in europe ended before they were ready to test the first weapon.
just before dawn on july 16 1945 in the desert near alamogordo new mexico the scientists gathered to witness the first atomic explosion in history the detonation of a plutonium fueled bomb that its creators had named trinity.
the trinity bomb atomic warfare news of the explosion reached president harry s truman who had taken office in april on the death of roosevelt in potsdam germany where he was attending a conference of allied leaders.
he issued an ultimatum to the japanese signed jointly by the british demanding that they surrender by august 3 or face complete devastation.
the japanese premier wanted to accept the allied demand but he still could not persuade the military leaders to agree.
there was a hint from tokyo that the government might agree to surrender in return for a promise that the japanese could retain their emperor.
the american government firmly committed to the idea of unconditional surrender dismissed those proposals.
they were convinced perhaps correctly that the moderates who were making the peace overtures did not have the power to deliver them.
when the deadline passed with no surrender truman ordered the air force to use the new atomic weapons against japan.
controversy has raged for decades over whether trumans decision to use the bomb was justified and what his motives were.
see debating the past pp.
some people have argued that the atomic attack was unnecessary that had the united states agreed to the retention of the emperor which it ultimately did agree to in any case or waited only a few more weeks the japanese would have surrendered.
others debating the bombs use the emperor surveys the ruins in the aftermath of the american firebombing of tokyo which caused as much damage and death as the atomic bomb attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki and just before the formal japanese surrender in september 1945 emperor hirohito previously visible to most japanese only in formal portraits walked through the ruins of the city and allowed himself to be photographed.
this photograph is widely considered the first picture of the emperor to reveal any expression on his face.
it was taken by carl mydans a photographer for life magazine.
photo by carl mydans time life pictures getty images debating the past the decision to drop the atomic bomb t wt the f 1994 the air and space museum of the smithsonian institution in washington 1im d c installed in its main hall the fuselage of the enola gay the airplane that dropped the first atomic bomb ever used in warfare.
it was used in 1945 on the japanese city of hiroshima.
originally the airplane was to have been accompanied by an exhibit that would include discussions of the many popular and academic controversies over whether the united states should have used the bomb.
but a powerful group of critics demanded that the exhibit should reflect only the official explanation of the decision.
in the end the museum decided to mount no exhibit at all.
the enola gay hangs in the smithsonian today without any explanation for the millions of tourists who see it each year.
the furor that surrounded the enola gay exhibit reflects the passions that the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki continue to arouse among people around the world.
it also reflects the continuing debate since 1945 among historians about how to explain and evaluate president truman s decision to use the atomic bomb in the war against japan.
truman himself both at the time and in his 1955 memoir insisted that the decision was a simple and straightforward one.
the alternative to using atomic weapons he claimed was an invasion of mainland japan that might have cost as many as a million american lives.
given that choice he said the decision was easy.
i regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubt that it should be used.
truman s explanation of his decision has been supported by the accounts of many of his contemporaries secretary of war henry stimson winston churchill and several of truman s senior military advisers.
it has also received considerable support from historians.
herbert feis argued in the atomic bomb and the end of world war ii 1966 that truman had made his decision on purely military grounds to ensure a speedy american victory.
david mccullough author of the popular biography truman published in 1992 also accepted truman s own account of his actions largely uncritically as did alonzo l hamby in man of the people 1995 an important scholarly study of truman.
one consideration weighed most heavily on truman hamby concluded.
the longer the war lasted the more americans killed.
robert j donovan author of an extensive history of the truman presidency conflict and crisis 1977 reached the same conclusion the simple reason truman made the decision to drop the bomb was to end the war quickly and save lives.
other scholars have strongly disagreed.
as early as 1948 a british physicist p m s blackett wrote in fear war and the bomb that the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki was not so much the last military act of the second world war as the first major operation of the cold diplomatic war with russia.
an important critic of truman s decision is the historian gar alperovitz the author of two influential books on the subject atomic diplomacy hiroshima and potsdam 1965 and the decision to use the atomic bomb and the architecture of an american myth 1995.
alperovitz dismissed the argument that the bomb was used to shorten the war and save lives.
japan was likely to have surrendered soon even if the bomb had not been used he claimed.
instead he argued the united states used the bomb less to influence japan than to intimidate the soviet union.
truman made his decision to bomb hiroshima following a discouraging meeting with stalin at potsdam.
he was heavily influenced therefore by his belief that america needed a new way to force stalin to change his behavior to make russia more manageable in europe.
martin j sherwin in a world destroyed 1975 argued similarly that the danger stalin posed to the peace made american policymakers aware that the effective use of atomic weapons could help strengthen the american hand in the nation s critical relationship with the soviet union.
john w dower s war without mercy 1986 contributed by implication at least to another controversial explanation of the american decision racism.
throughout world war ii many americans looked upon the japanese as members of an almost bestial race almost a subhuman species.
and while dower himself stops short of saying so other historians have suggested that this racialized image of the japanese contributed to american willingness to drop atomic bombs on japanese cities.
even many of truman s harshest critics however note that it is as alperovitz argue that nothing less than the atomic bombs could have persuaded the hard line military leaders of japan to surrender without a costly american invasion.
some critics of the decision including some of the scientists involved in the manhattan project have argued that whatever the japanese intentions the united states as a matter of morality should not have used the terrible new weapon.
one horrified physicist wrote the president shortly before the attack this thing must not be permitted to exist on this earth.
we must not be the most hated and feared people in the world the nations military and political leaders however showed little concern about such matters.
truman who had not even known of the existence of the manhattan project 728.
until he became president was apparently making what he believed to be a simple military decision.
a weapon was available that would end the war quickly he could see no reason not to use it.
still more controversy has existed over whether there were other motives at work behind trumans decision.
with the soviet union poised to enter the war in the pacific did the united states want to end the conflict quickly to forestall an expanded communist presence in asia.
did truman use the bomb to intimidate stalin with whom he was engaged in difficult negotiations so that the soviet leader would accept american demands.
little direct evidence is available to support or definitively refute either of these accusations.

bettmann corbis has written all but impossible to find specific evidence that racism was an important factor in the decision to attack hiroshima and nagasaki.
the debate over the decision to drop the atomic bomb is an unusually emotional one and it has inspired bitter professional and personal attacks on advocates of almost every position.
it illustrates clearly how history has often been and remains a powerful force in the way societies define their politics their values and their character.

many more survived to suffer the crippling effects of radioactive fallout or to pass those effects on to their children in the form of birth defects.
the japanese government stunned by the attack was at first unable to agree on a response.

the most catastrophic war in the history of mankind had come to an end and the united states had emerged not only victorious but in a position of unprecedented power influence and prestige as well.
it was a victory however that few could greet with unambiguous joy.
fourteen 729 730 chapter 26 million combatants had died in the struggle.
as many as 40 million civilians may have died mostly from bombings from disease and starvation from genocidal campaigns of extermination.
the united states had suffered only light casualties in comparison with many other nations but the cost had still been high 322 000 dead another 800 000 injured.
and despite the sacrifices the world continued to face an uncertain future menaced by the threat of nuclear warfare and by the emerging antagonism between the worlds two strongest nations the united states and the soviet union that would darken the peace for many decades to come.
looking back the united states played a critical indeed decisive role in the war against germany and italy and it defeated japan in the pacific largely alone.
but americas sacrifices in the war paled next to those of the nations most important allies.
britain france and above all the soviet union paid a staggering price in lives infrastructure and social unity that had no counterpart in the united states most of whose citizens experienced a booming prosperity and only modest privations during the four years of american involvement in the conflict.
there were of course jarring social changes during the war that even prosperity could not entirely offset shortages restrictions regulations family dislocations and perhaps most of all the absence of millions of men and considerable numbers of women who went overseas to work and fight.
american fighting men and women of course had very different experiences than those americans who remained at home.
they endured tremendous hardships substantial casualties and great loneliness.
they fought effectively and bravely.
they helped liberate north africa and italy from german occupation.
and in june 1944 finally they joined british french and other forces in a great and successful invasion of france which led less than a year later to the destruction of the nazi regime and the end of the european war.
in the pacific they turned back the japanese offensive through a series of difficult naval and land battles.
but in the end it was not the american army and navy that brought the war against japan to a close.
it was the unleashing of the most destructive weapon mankind had ever created the atomic bomb on the people of japan that finally persuaded the leaders of that nation to surrender.

0 republic pictures photofestl setting the stage even before the end of world war ii there were signs of tension between the united states and the soviet union.
once the war was over those tensions quickly grew to create what became known as the cold war a tense and dangerous rivalry that like world war ii reshaped the world order in important ways.
the intense rivalry between the united states and the soviet union and between democratic capitalism and communism divided much of the world into two not quite warring camps.
out of this rivalry came a series of new military alliances on both sides of the conflict.
a new conception of american foreign policy known as containment also emerged based on the belief that the principal international goal of the united states should be to prevent communism from spreading beyond its present boundaries.
containment helped keep the tensions between the rival blocs low enough to avoid a catastrophic nuclear war.
but the cold war world was far from stable as two major wars in korea and vietnam and countless smaller conflicts all over the world made clear.
the cold war also cast its shadow over domestic life in the united states.
it transformed american politics weakening the grip of the democratic party on the electorate making the issue of communism a central part of postwar political life and helping to produce a great anticommunist frenzy in the late 1940s and early 1950s that had corrosive effects on american life.
known to many as mccarthyism after the wisconsin senator who became the most famous and notorious voice of anticommunism for a time the post world war ii red scare was a widespread phenomenon that affected almost every area of american life.
origins of the cold war few issues in twentieth century american history have aroused more debate than the question of the origins of the cold war.
some historians have claimed that soviet duplicity and expansionism created the international tensions while others have proposed that american provocations and imperial ambitions were at least equally to blame.
most historians agree however that wherever the preponderance of blame may lie both the united states and the soviet union contributed to the atmosphere of hostility and suspicion that quickly clouded the peace.
see debating the past pp.
americas postwar vision sources of soviet american tension at the heart of the rivalry between the united states and the soviet union in the 1940s was a fundamental difference in the ways the great powers envisioned the postwar world.
one vision first openly outlined in the atlantic charter in 1941 was of a world in which nations abandoned their traditional beliefs in military alliances and spheres of influence and governed their relations with one another through democratic processes with an international organization serving as the arbiter of disputes and the protector of every nations right of self determination.
that vision inspired in part by woodrow wilson appealed to many americans including franklin roosevelt.
the other vision was that of the soviet union and to some extent it gradually became clear of great britain.
both stalin and churchill had signed the atlantic charter.
but britain had always been uneasy about the implications of the self determination ideal for its own spheres of enormous empire.
and the soviet union was determined to create a secure influence sphere for itsejf in central and eastern europe as protection against possible future aggression from the west.
both churchill and stalin therefore tended to envision a postwar structure in which the great powers would control areas of strategic interest to them in which something vaguely similar to the traditional european balance of power would reemerge.
gradually the differences between these two positions would turn the peacemaking process into a form of warfare.
734 chapter 27 wartime diplomacy serious strains had already begun to develop in the alliance with the soviet union in january 1943 when roosevelt and churchill met in casablanca morocco to discuss allied strategy.
stalin had declined roosevelts invitation to attend.
the two leaders could not accept stalins most important demand the immediate opening of a second front in western europe.
but they tried to reassure stalin by announcing that they would accept nothing less than the unconditional surrender of the axis powers thus indicating that they would not negotiate a separate peace with hitler and leave the soviets to fight on alone.
in november 1943 roosevelt and churchill traveled to teheran iran for their first meeting with stalin.
by now however roosevelts most effective bargaining tool stalins need for american assistance in his struggle against germany had been largely removed.
the german advance against russia had been halted soviet forces were now launching their own westward offensive.
nevertheless the teheran conference seemed in most respects a success.
roosevelt and stalin established a cordial personal relationship.
stalin agreed to an american request that the soviet union enter the war in the pacific soon after the end of hostilities in europe.
roosevelt in turn promised that an anglo american second front would be established within six months.
on other matters however the origins of future disagreements were already visible.
most important was the question of the future of poland.
roosevelt and churchill were willing to agree to a movement of the soviet border westward allowing stalin to annex some historically polish territory.
but on the nature of the postwar government in the rest of poland there were sharp differences.
roosevelt and d1spolap4dzer churchill supported the claims of the polish government in exile that had been functioning in london since 1940 stalin wished to install another pro communist exiled government that had spent the war in lublin in the soviet union.
the three leaders avoided a bitter conclusion to the teheran conference only by leaving the issue i i v r lx z n yalta more than a year later in february 1945 roosevelt joined churchill and stalin for a peace conference in the soviet city of yalta a resort on the black sea that was once a summer palace for the tsars.
on a number of issues the big three as roosevelt churchill and stalin were known reached agreements.
in return for stalins renewed promise to enter the pacific war roosevelt agreed that the soviet union should receive some of the territory in the pacific that russia had lost in the 1904 russo japanese war.
the negotiators also agreed to a plan for a new international organization a plan that had been hammered out the previous t t summer at a conference in washington d c nations at t ie dumbarton oaks estate.
the new united nations would contain a general assembly in which every member would be represented and a security council with permanent representatives of the five yalta churchill roosevelt and stalin known during the war as the big three meet at yalta in the crimea in february 1945 to come.
instead they settled on a series of vague compromises that ultimately left all parties feeling betrayed.
bettmann corbis try to agree on the outlines of the peace that they knew was soon to the cold war 735 major powers the united states britain france the soviet union and china each of which would have veto power.
the security council would also have temporary delegates from several other nations.
these agreements became the basis of the united nations charter drafted at a conference of fifty nations beginning april 25 1945 in san francisco.
the u s senate ratified the charter in july by a vote of 80 to 2 in striking contrast to the slow and painful defeat it had administered to the charter of the league of nations twenty five years before.
on other issues however the yalta conference produced no real accord.
basic disagreement remained about the postwar polish government.
stalin whose armies now occupied poland had already installed a government composed of the pro communist lublin poles.
roosevelt and churchill insisted that the pro western london poles must be allowed a place in the warsaw regime.
roosevelt envisioned a government based on free democratic elections which both he and stalin recognized the pro western forces would win.
stalin agreed only to a vague compromise by which an unspecified number of pro western poles would be granted a place in the government.
he reluctantly consented to hold free and unfettered elections in poland on an unspecified future date.
they did not take place for almost fifty years.
nor was there agreement about the future of germany.
roosevelt seemed to want a reconstructed and reunited germany.
stalin wanted to impose heavy reparations on germany and to ensure a permanent dismemberment of the nation.
the final agreement was like the polish accord vague and unstable.
the decision on reparations disagreements c r.
over germany would be referred to a future commission.
the united states great britain france and the soviet union would each control its own zone of occupation in germany the zones to be determined by the position of troops at the end of the war.
berlin the german capital was already well inside the soviet zone but because of its symbolic importance it would be divided into four sectors one for each nation to occupy.
at an unspecified date germany would be reunited but there was no agreement on how the reunification would occur.
as for the rest of europe the conference produced a murky accord on the establishment of governments broadly representative of all democratic elements and responsible to the will of the people the yalta accords in other words were less a settlement of postwar issues than a set of loose principles that sidestepped the most difficult questions.
roosevelt churchill and stalin returned home from the conference each apparently convinced that he had signed an important agreement.
but the soviet interpretation of the accords differed so sharply from the anglo american interpretation that the illusion endured only briefly.
in the weeks following the yalta conference roosevelt watched with growing alarm as the soviet union moved systematically to establish pro communist governments in one central or eastern european nation after another and as stalin refused to make the changes in poland that the president believed he had promised.
but roosevelt did not abandon hope.
still believing the dif ferences could be settled he left washington early in the spring for a vacation at his retreat in warm springs georgia.
there on april 12 1945 he suffered a sudden massive stroke and died.
the collapse of the peace harry s truman who succeeded roosevelt in the presidency had little familiarity with international issues.
and he did not share roosevelts apparent faith in the flexibility of the soviet union.
roosevelt had hoped that stalin was a reasonable man with whom an ultimate accord might be reached.
truman in contrast sided with those in the government and there were many who considered the soviet union fundamentally untrustworthy and who viewed stalin with suspicion and even loathing.
the failure of potsdam truman had been in office only a few days before he decided to as he put it get tough with the soviet union.
truman met on april 23 with soviet foreign minister molotov and sharply trumans chastised him for violations of the yalta get tough accords.
in fact truman had only limited policy leverage by which to compel the soviet union to carry out its agreements.
truman insisted that the united states should be able to get 85 percent of what it wanted but he was ultimately forced to settle for much less.
truman conceded first on poland.
when stalin made a few minor concessions to the pro western exiles truman recognized the warsaw government hoping that noncommunist forces might gradually expand their influence there.
until the 1980s they did not.
other questions remained above all the question of germany.
to settle them truman met in july at potsdam in russian occupied germany with churchill who after elections in britain in the midst of the talks was replaced as prime minister by clement attlee and stalin.
truman reluctantly accepted the adjustments of the polish german border that stalin had long demanded he refused however to permit the russians to claim any reparations from the american french and british zones of germany.
this stance effectively confirmed that germany would remain divided with the western zones united into one nation friendly to the united states and the russian zone surviving as another nation with a soviet dominated communist government.
ihe china problem zentral to american hopes for an open peaceful world policed y the great powers was a strong independent china.
but even efore the war ended the american government was aware that those hopes faced a major perhaps insurmountable obstacle the chinese government of chiang kai shek.
chiang was merally friendly to the united states but his government was rrupt and incompetent with feeble popular support and chiang kai shek debating the past origins of the cold war m fj tj cold war may be over but the debate over its origins is not.
x il ju for more than a decade after the end of world war ii few historians in the united states challenged the official american interpretation of the beginnings of the cold war.
most students of the conflict agreed that relations with the soviet union broke down because stalin violated the yalta accords and because he was spreading communism throughout the world.
not long after the war as communism was spreading in europe george f kennan wrote an important telegraph arguing that the soviet union needed to be contained that while the united states should not invade communist nations it should work to stop their growing influence.
over time he suggested containment would weaken the soviet union.
in debates from the 1950s on scholars began to offer different more critical views about the cold war.
william appleman williams writing in the tragedy of american diplomacy 1959 disagreed with the containment theory.
the cold war he said was simply the most recent version of a consistent american effort in the twentieth century to maintain an open door for american trade in world markets.
according to williams the confrontation with the soviet union was less a response to russian aggressive designs than an expression of the american belief in the necessity of capitalist expansion.
later revisionists modified williams s claims but most accepted his basic outlook.
the united states had been primarily to blame for the cold war many scholars asserted.
claims were made that the soviet union was too weak and exhausted at the end of world war ii to pose a serious threat to america that the united states used its nuclear monopoly to threaten and intimidate stalin that harry truman recklessly abandoned the conciliatory tone taken by franklin roosevelt who died in 1945 taking instead a provocative hard line against the russians the soviet response these scholars national archives and records administration chiang was unable or unwilling to face the problems that were threatening to engulf him.
since 1927 the nationalist government he headed had been engaged in a prolonged and bitter rivalry with the communist armies of mao zedong.
so successful had the communist challenge grown that mao was in control of one fourth of the population by 1945.
some americans urged the government to find a third force to support as an alternative to either chiang or mao.
a few argued that the united states should try to reach some accommodation with mao.
truman however decided reluctantly that he had no choice but to continue supporting chiang.
for the next several years as the long struggle between the nationalists and the communists erupted into a full scale civil war the united states continued to send money and weapons to chiang.
eventually truman sent general george marshall former army chief of staff and future secretary of state to study the chinese problem and recommend a policy for the united states.
many american friends in china known generally as the china lobby pressured marshall to expand the american military presence as a way to combat the continuing expansion of communist control.
marshall came to believe that nothing short of an all out war with china would be necessary to defeat the communists and he was unwilling to recommend that the president should accept such a war.
that decision was the source of many embittered attacks on marshall truman and many others for decades to come.
instead the american government was beginning to consider an alternative to china as the strong pro western force in asia restoring a revived japan.
abandoning the strict japan occupation policies of the first years after the war when general douglas macarthur had governed the nation the united states lifted restrictions on industrial development and encouraged rapid economic growth in japan.
the vision of an open united world was giving way in asia as it was in europe to an acceptance of a divided world with a strong pro american sphere of influence.
the containment doctrine by the end of 1945 any realistic hope of a postwar world constructed according to the atlantic charter ideals that roosevelt and churchill had agreed upon was in shambles.
instead a new american policy known as containment was slowly emerging.
rather than attempting to create a unified open world the united states and its allies would work to contain the threat of further soviet expansion.
736 asserted reflected a legitimate fear of capitalist encirclement.
walter lafeber in america russia and the cold war 1945 1966 1967 and later editions maintained that america s supposedly idealistic internationalism at the close of the war was in reality an effort to ensure a world shaped in the american image that would guarantee its influence especially regarding trade.
ultimately the revisionist interpretation began to produce a reaction of its own a postrevisionist view of the conflict.
some manifestations of this reaction consisted of little more than a reaffirmation of the traditional view of the cold war but the dominant works of postrevisionist scholarship attempted to strike a balance between the two camps to identify areas of blame and misperception on both sides of the conflict.
thomas g paterson in soviet american confrontation 1973 viewed russian hostility and american efforts to dominate the postwar world as equally responsible for the cold war.
john lewis gaddis in the united states and the origins of the cold war 1941 1947 1972 and other works similarly maintained that neither side can bear sole responsibility for the onset of the cold war.
american policymakers he argued had only limited options because of the pressures of domestic politics.
and stalin was immobilized by his obsessive concern with maintaining his own power and ensuring absolute security for the soviet union.
but if neither side was entirely to blame gaddis concluded the soviets must be held more accountable for the problems for stalin was in a much better position to compromise given his broader power within his own government than the politically hamstrung truman.
melvyn leffler s preponderance of power 1991 argued similarly that american policymakers genuinely believed in the existence of a soviet threat and were determined to remain consistently stronger than the soviets in response.
a more complex view of the cold war has emerged out of the postrevisionist literature.
the cold war historians now suggest was not so much the fault of one side or the other as it was the natural perhaps inevitable result of tensions between the world s two most powerful nations nations that had been suspicious of if not hostile toward one another for nearly a century.
the united states and the soviet union were doomed to be antagonists ernest may wrote in 1984.
there probably was never any real possibility that the post 1945 relationship could be anything but hostility verging on conflict.
since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 scholars have had access to russian archives that have enriched though not fundamentally changed the way historians view the cold war.
john lewis gaddis in we now know rethinking cold war history 1998 and the cold war a history 2005 argues that the strong anticommunist positions of margaret thatcher ronald reagan and pope john paul ii had a larger impact on the weakening of the soviet union than was previously understood.
in the global cold war 2005 arne westad also making use of the released archives roots the origins of the dangerous instability in the so called third world in the frequent interventions of both the soviet union and the united states in the cold war era.
and john lewis gaddis in the cold war a history looks back on the cold war that he chronicled for several decades in the midst of the cold war.
he argues that despite all the anxieties it raised and all the violence it helped to create the containment policy that shaped american foreign policy beginning in the mid 1940s was ultimately a significant success.
understand analyze and evaluate 1 what are the traditional and revisionist arguments concerning the origins of the cold war.
how does the postrevisionist view differ from the traditional and revisionist interpretations.
was the cold war inevitable.
truman doctrine the new doctrine emerged in part as a response to events in europe in 1946.
in turkey stalin was trying to win control over the vital sea lanes to the mediterranean.
in greece communist forces were threatening the pro western government.
the british had announced they could no longer provide assistance.
faced with these challenges truman decided to enunciate a firm new policy.
in doing so he drew from the ideas of the influential american diplomat george f kennan who had warned not long after the war that the only appropriate diplomatic approach to dealing with the soviet union was a longterm patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies on march 12 1947 truman appeared before congress and used kennan s warnings as the basis of what became known as the truman doctrine.
i believe he argued that it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures in the same speech he requested 400 million part of it to bolster the armed forces of greece and turkey another part to provide economic assistance to greece.
congress quickly approved the measure.
the american commitment ultimately helped ease soviet pressure on turkey and helped the greek government defeat the communist insurgents.
more important it established a basis for american foreign policy that would survive for more than forty years.
the marshall plan an integral part of the containment policy was a proposal to aid in the economic reconstruction of western europe.
there were many motives humanitarian concern for the european people a fear that europe would remain an jrope46 economic drain on the united states if it could not quickly rebuild and begin to feed itself a desire for a strong european market for american goods.
but above all american policymakers believed that unless something could be done to strengthen the shaky pro american governments in western europe those governments might fall under the control of rapidly growing domestic communist parties.
in june 1947 therefore secretary of state george c marshall announced a plan to provide economic assistance to all european nations including the soviet union that would join in drafting a program for recovery.
although russia and its eastern satellites quickly and predictably rejected the plan 73 738 chapter 27 peace mongerim saluting the marshall plan in another age a chimney spouting smoke would evoke environmental damage.
but in the aftermath of world war ii the rebuilding of europe s industrial capacity was a great achievement helped by and celebrated by the united states and the marshall plan.
the granger collection new york mobilization at home that the united states had accepted a continuing commitment to the containment policy became clear in 1947 and 1948 through a series of measures designed to maintain american military power at near wartime levels.
in 1948 at president trumans request congress approved a new military draft and revived the selective service system.
in the meantime the united states having failed to reach agreement with the soviet union on international control of nuclear weapons redoubled its own efforts in atomic research elevating nuclear weaponry to a central place in its military arsenal.
the atomic energy commission established in 1946 became the supervisory body charged with overseeing all nuclear research both civilian and military.
and in 1950 the truman administration approved the development of the new hydrogen bomb a nuclear weapon far more powerful than the bombs the united states had used in 1945.
the national security act of 1947 reshaped the nations major military and diplomatic institutions.
it created a new department of defense to oversee all branches of the armed services combining functions previously performed separately by the war and navy departments.
a national security council nsc operating out of the white house would oversee foreign and military policy.
a central intelligence agency cia would replace the wartime office of national security act of 1947 sixteen western european nations eagerly participated.
whatever domestic opposition to the plan there was in the united states largely vanished after a sudden coup in czechoslovakia in february 1948 that established a soviet dominated communist government there.
in april congress approved the creation of the economic cooperation administration the agency that would administer the marshall plan as it became known.
over the next three years the marshall plan channeled over 12 billion of american aid into europe helping to spark a substantial economic revival.
by the end of 1950 european industrial production had risen 64 percent communist strength in the member nations had declined and opportunities for american trade had revived.
surviving nuclear war preoccupation with the possibility of a nuclear war reached a fever pitch in the first years of the atomic era.
the federal civil defense agency which in 1950 issued these simple rules for civilians to follow in dealing with an atomic attack was one of many organizations attempting to convince the american public that a nuclear war was survivable.

the national security act in other words gave the president expanded powers with which to pursue the nations international goals.
the road to nato at about the same time the united states was moving to strengthen the military capabilities of western europe.
convinced that a reconstructed germany was essential to the hopes of the west truman reached an agreement with england and france to merge the three western zones of occupation into a new west german republic which would include the former american british and french sectors of berlin even though that city lay well within the east german zone.
stalin responded quickly.
on june 24 1948 he imposed a tight blockade around the western sectors of berlin.
if germany was to be officially divided he was implying then the country s western government would have to abandon its outpost in the heart of the soviet controlled eastern zone.
truman refused to do so.

eventually the american british and french sectors were combined to create west be a city rned by west germany but entirely surrounded by communist east germany.
ow did the west prevent east germany from absorbing west berlin.
740 chapter 27 unwilling to risk war through a military challenge to the blockade he ordered a massive airlift to supply the city with food fuel and other needed goods.
the airlift continued for more than ten months transporting nearly 2 5 million tons of material keeping a city of 2 million people alive and transforming west berlin into a symbol of the wests resolve to resist communist expansion.
in the spring of 1949 stalin lifted the now ineffective blockade.
and in october the division of germany into two nations the federal republic in the west and the democratic republic in the east became official.
the crisis in berlin accelerated the consolidation of what was already in effect an alliance among the united states and nato the countries f western europe.
on april 4 1949 twelve nations signed an agreement establishing the north atlantic treaty organization nato and declaring that an armed attack against one member would be considered an attack against all.
the nato countries would moreover maintain a standing military force in europe to defend against what many policymakers believed was the threat of a soviet invasion.
the formation of nato eventually spurred the soviet union to create an alliance of its own with the communist governments in eastern europe an alliance formalized in 1955 by the warsaw pact.
reevaluating cold war policy a series of events in 1949 propelled the cold war in new directions.
an announcement in september that the soviet union had successfully exploded its first atomic weapon years earlier than predicted shocked and frightened many americans.
so did the collapse of chiang kai sheks nationalist government in china which occurred with startling speed in the last months of 1949.
chiang fled with his political allies and the remnants of his army to the offshore island of formosa taiwan and the entire chinese mainland came under the control of a communist government that many americans believed to be an extension of the soviet union.
the united states refused to recognize the new communist regime and instead devoted increased attention to the revitalization of japan as a buffer against asian communism ending the american occupation in 1952.
in this atmosphere of escalating crisis truman called for a thorough review of american foreign policy.
the result was a nsc 68 national security council report issued in 1950 and commonly known as nsc 68 which outlined a shift in the american position.
the first statements of the containment doctrine the writings of george kennan the truman doctrine speech had made at least some distinctions between areas of vital interest to the united states and areas of less importance to the nations foreign policy and called on america to share the burden of containment with its allies.
but the april 1950 document argued that the united states could no longer rely on other nations to take the initiative in resisting communism.
it must itself establish firm and active leadership of the noncommunist world.
and it must move to stop communist expansion virtually anywhere it occurred proclaiming the victory of the revolution chairman mao zedong standing on the rostrum of the tiananmen square gate in beijing speaks by radio to the chinese people on october 1 1949 to proclaim the founding of the people s republic of china.
this was shortly after the communist victory in the nation s civil war and the departure of chiang kai shek and his followers to the island of taiwan.
ap images regardless of the intrinsic strategic or economic value of the lands in question.
among other things the report called for a major expansion of american military power with a defense budget almost four times the previously projected figure.
the conservative opposition to containment the containment doctrine for dealing with the cold war attracted broad bipartisan support.
but not everyone believed that containment was the right approach to take.
some americans on the left believed that containment was unnecessarily belligerent and that the united states could have made peace with the russians.
but greater opposition to containment came from conservative americans who believed that it was too weak a response to communism and saw containment as a kind of appeasement.
among the conservatives who disdained containment was an anticommunist organization known as the john birch the cold war 741 society.
its leader was robert welch a man so fearful of communism that he believed some of the most important leaders of american government were trying to undermine the united states by collaborating with the soviets.
welch presented his opposition in the blue book of the john birch society in which he argued that much of the american government was riddled with treason.
for years he wrote we have been taken steadily down the road to communism by steps supposedly designed as ways of fighting communism but instead he argued it was communist americans themselves who were undermining the nation.
both the u s and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians welch wrote.
if left unexposed the traitors inside the u s government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a one world government among the sources of treason welch claimed were the united nations and other international institutions.
many americans considered the john birch society an extremist organization but the belief that communism was the greatest danger facing the united states was widely supported by many people.
the opposition to containment reached some of the highest levels of the government.
john foster dulles who would become secretary of state in the eisenhower administration wrote the foreign policy plank of the republican platform in 1952.
we charge that the leaders of the administration in power lost the peace so dearly earned by world war ii dulles stated.
they abandoned friendly nations such as latvia lithuania estonia poland and czechoslovakia containment opponents such as dulles argued was a policy of weakness that had allowed the communists to take over much of the world.
many of those who argued against containment called for what was known as rollback instead of containing communism the united states should be pushing back the borders of communism despite the possibility of another war.
president eisenhower however did not share dulless belief in rollback and the government abided by the containment strategy throughout the 1950s and beyond.
american society and politics after the war the crises overseas were not the only frustrations the american people encountered after the war.
the nation also faced serious economic difficulties in adapting to peacetime.
the resulting instability contributed to an increasingly heated political climate.
the problems of reconversion the bombs that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki ended the war months earlier than almost anyone had predicted and pro pelled the nation precipitously into a process of reconversion.
there had been many predictions that peace would bring a return of depression unemployment as war production ceased and returning soldiers flooded the labor market.
but there was no general economic collapse in 1946 for several reasons.
government spending dropped sharply and abruptly to be sure 35 billion of war contracts were canceled within weeks of the japanese surrender.
but increased consumer demand gi bill soon compensatect consumer goods had been generally unavailable during the war so many workers had saved a substantial portion of their wages and were now ready to spend.
a 6 billion tax cut pumped additional money into general circulation.
the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 better known as the gi bill of rights provided economic and educational assistance to veter ans increasing spending even further.
this flood of consumer demand ensured that there would be no new depression but it contributed to more than two years of serious inflation during which prices rose at rates of 14 to 15 percent annually.
in the summer of 1946 president truman vetoed an extension of the authority of the wartime office of price administration thus eliminating price controls.
he was opposed not to the controls but to congressional amendments that had weakened the opa.
inflation soared to 25 percent before he relented a month later and signed a bill little different from the one he had rejected.
compounding the economic difficulties was a sharp rise in labor unrest driven in part by the impact of inflation.
by the end of 1945 there had already been major strikes in the auto postwar mobile electrical and steel industries.
in labor unrest april 1946 john l lewis led the united mine workers on strike shutting down the coal fields for forty days.
fears grew rapidly that without vital coal supplies the entire economy might grind to a halt.
truman finally forced the miners to return to work by ordering the gi bill the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 better known as the gi bill provided a wide range of benefits to all honorably discharged service personnel who served during the war.
benefits included low cost mortgages low interest loans to start a business cash payments of tuition and living expenses to attend university high school or vocational education as well as one year of unemployment compensation.
by 1956 roughly 2 2 million veterans had used the g l.
bill education benefits to attend colleges or universities.
an additional 5 6 million veterans used these benefits for some kind of training program.
bettmann corbis 742 chapter 27 the cold war 743 government seizure of the mines.
but in the process he pressured mine owners to grant the union most of its demands which he had earlier denounced as inflationary.
almost simultaneously the nations railroads suffered a total shutdown the first in the nations history as two major unions walked out on strike.
by threatening to use the army to run the trains truman pressured the workers back to work after only a few days.
reconversion was particularly difficult for the millions of women and minorities who had entered the workforce during the war.
with veterans returning home and looking for jobs in the industrial economy employers tended to push women blacks hispanics chinese and others out of the plants to make room for white males.
some of the war workers particularly women left the workforce voluntarily out of a desire to return to their former domestic lives.
but as many as 80 percent of women workers and virtually all black hispanic and asian males wanted to continue working.
the postwar inflation the pressure to meet the rising expectations of a high consumption society the growing divorce rate which left many women responsible for their own economic well being all combined to create among women a high demand for paid employment.
as they found themselves excluded from industrial jobs therefore women workers moved increasingly into other areas of the economy above all the service sector.
the fair deal rejected days after the japanese surrender truman submitted to congress a twenty one point domestic program outlining what truman s ater terme fair deal it called for fair deal expansion of social security benefits the raising of the legal minimum wage from 40 to 65 cents an hour a program to ensure full employment through aggressive use of federal spending and investment a permanent fair employment practices act public housing and slum clearance long range environmental and public works planning and government promotion of scientific research.
weeks later he added other proposals federal aid to funding for the st lawrence seaway nationalization of atomic energy and perhaps most important national health insurance a dream of welfare state liberals for decades but one deferred in 1935 when the social security act was written.
the president was declaring an end to the wartime moratorium on liberal reform.
he was also symbolizing as he later wrote my assumption of the office of president in my own right but many of the fair deal programs fell victim to the same public and congressional conservatism that had crippled the last years of the new deal.
indeed that conservatism seemed to be intensifying as the november 1946 congressional elections suggested.
using the simple but devastating slogan had enough the republican party won control of both houses of congress.
the new republican congress quickly moved to reduce government spending and chip away at new deal reforms.
the president bowed to what he claimed was the popular mandate to lift most remaining wage and price controls and congress taft hartley act moved further to deregulate the economy.
inflation rapidly increased.
when a public outcry arose over the soaring prices for meat senator robert taft perhaps the most influential republican conservative in congress advised consumers to eat less and added we have got to break with the corrupting idea that we can legislate prosperity legislate equality legislate opportunity true to the spirit of tafts words the republican congress refused to appropriate funds to aid education increase social security or support reclamation and power projects in the west.
it defeated a proposal to raise the minimum wage.
it passed tax measures that cut rates dramatically for high income families and moderately for those with lower incomes.
only vetoes by the president finally forced a more progressive bill.
the most notable action of the new congress was its assault on the wagner act of 1935.
conservatives had always resented the new powers the legislation had granted unions and in light of the labor difficulties during and after the war such resentments intensified sharply.
the result was the labor management relations act of 1947 better known as the taft hartley act.
it made illegal the so called closed shop a workplace in which no one can be hired without first being a member of a union.
and although it continued to permit the creation of so called union shops in which workers must join a union after being hired it permitted states to pass right to work laws prohibiting even that.
repealing this provision the controversial section 14 b would remain a goal of the labor movement for decades.
outraged workers and union leaders denounced the measure as a slave labor bill truman vetoed it but both the house and the senate easily overruled him the same day.
the taft hartley act did not destroy the labor movement as many union leaders had predicted.
but it did damage weaker unions in relatively lightly organized industries such as chemicals and textiles and it made more difficult the organizing of workers who had never been union members especially women minorities and most workers in the south.
the election of 1948 truman and his advisers believed the american public was not ready to abandon the achievements of the new deal despite the 1946 election results.
as they planned strategy for the 1948 campaign therefore they placed their hopes in an appeal to enduring democratic loyalties.
throughout 1948 truman proposed one reform measure after another.
although congress ignored or defeated them all the president was building campaign issues for the fall.
there remained however the problems of trumans personal unpopularity the belief among much of the electorate democratic t iat an his administration were weak defections and inept and the deep divisions within the democratic party.
at the democratic national convention that summer two factions abandoned the party southern conservatives reacted angrily to trumans proposed civil rights bill the first major one of the century and to the approval at the convention of a civil rights plank in the platform engineered by hubert humphrey the mayor of minneapolis.
these two factions formed the states rights or dixiecrat party with governor strom thurmond of south carolina as its presidential nominee.
at the same time the democratic partys left wing formed a new progressive party with henry a wallace as its candidate.
wallace supporters objected to what they considered the slow and ineffective domestic policies of the truman administration but they resented even more the presidents confrontational stance toward the soviet union.
in addition many democratic liberals unwilling to leave the party attempted to dump the president in 1948.
the americans for democratic action ada a coalition of liberals tried to entice dwight d eisenhower the popular war hero to contest the nomination.
only after eisenhower had refused did liberals bow to the inevitable and concede the nomination to truman.
the republicans in the meantime had once again nominated governor thomas e dewey of new york whose substantial reelection victory in 1946 had made him one of the nations leading political figures.
austere dignified and competent he seemed to offer an unbeatable alternative to the president.
polls showed dewey with an apparently insurmountable lead in september so much so that some opinion analysts stopped taking surveys.
dewey conducted a subdued statesmanlike campaign and tried to avoid antagonizing anyone.
but truman seemingly done believed he could win.
as the campaign gathered momentum truman became more and more aggressive turning the fire away from himself and toward dewey and the do nothing good for nothing republican congress election night 1948 throughout the 1948 campaign harry truman was considered a very unlikely victor for a new term as president.
but the combination of an energetic campaign by truman a lack of enthusiasm for his opponent thomas dewey and the lingering loyalty to the new deal led to a surprise victory.
the chicago daily tribune a strongly republican paper was so certain of dewey s victory that it published this headline which hit the newsstands just after it became clear that truman won.
this picture is one of the most famous political photographs of the twentieth century.
rue des archives the granger collection new york which was he told the voters responsible for fueling inflation and abandoning workers and the middle class.
to dramatize his point he called congress into a special session in july to give it a chance he said to enact the liberal measures the republicans had recently written into their platform.
congress met for two weeks and predictably did almost nothing.
the president traveled nearly 32 000 miles and made 356 speeches delivering blunt extemporaneous attacks.
he had told senator alben barkley of kentucky his running mate im going to fight hard.
im going to give them hell he called for repeal of the taft hartley act increased price supports for farmers and strong civil rights protection for blacks.
he was the first president to campaign in harlem.
he sought in short to re create much of franklin roosevelts new deal coalition.
to the surprise of virtually everyone he succeeded.
on election night truman won a narrow but decisive victory 49 5 percent of the popular vote to deweys 45 1 percent with the two splinter parties dividing the small remainder between them and an electoral vote margin of 303 to 189.
democrats in the meantime regained both houses of congress by substantial margins.
trumans surprising victory the fair deal revived despite the democratic victories the eighty first congress was little more hospitable to trumans fair deal reform than its republican predecessor.
truman did win some important victories.
congress raised the legal minimum wage from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour.
it approved an important expansion 744.
chapter 27 electoral vote 303 189 39 segregation within the armed forces.
and he allowed the justice department to become actively involved in court battles against discriminatory statutes.
in the meantime the supreme court signaled its own growing awareness of the issue by ruling in shelley v kraemer 1948 that the courts could not be used to enforce private covenants meant to bar african americans from residential neighborhoods.

this map shows the broad geographic reach of truman s victory.
dewey swept most of the northeast but truman dominated almost everywhere else.
strom thurmond the states rights candidate carried four states in the south.
what had prompted thurmond to desert the democratic party and run for president on his own.
of the social security system increasing benefits by 75 percent and extending them to 10 million additional people.
and it passed the national housing act of 1949 which provided for the construction of 810 000 units of low income housing accompanied by long term rent subsidies.
inadequate funding plagued the program for years and it reached its initial goal only in 1972.
but on other issues among them national health insurance and aid to education truman made no progress.
nor was he able to persuade congress to accept the truman stymied c1v1 rihts legislation he proposed in 1949 which would have made lynching a federal crime provided federal protection of black voting rights abolished the poll tax and established a new fair employment practices commission to curb discrimination in hiring to replace the wartime commission roosevelt had established in 1941.
southern democrats filibustered to kill the bill.
truman did proceed on his own to battle several forms of racial discrimination.
he ordered an end to discrimination in the hiring of government employees.
he began to dismantle looming over the political economic and diplomatic struggles of the postwar years was the image of the great and terrible mushroom clouds that had risen over alamogordo hiroshima and nagasaki.
americans greeted these terrible new instruments of destruction with fear and awe but also with expectation.
postwar culture therefore was torn in many ways.
there was the dark image of the nuclear war that many americans feared would be a result of the rivalry with the soviet union.
but there was also the bright image of a dazzling technological future that atomic power might help to produce.
the fear of nuclear weapons was not hard to find in popular culture even if it was often disguised in other ways.
the late 1940s and early 1950s were the heyday of the film noir a kind of filmmaking that had originated in france and had been named for the dark lighting characteristic of the genre.
american film noir movies portrayed the loneliness of individuals in an impersonal world a staple of american culture for many decades but also suggested the menacing character of the age the looming possibility of vast destruction.
sometimes films and television programs addressed nuclear fear explicitly for example the celebrated television show of the 1950s and early 1960s the twilight zone which frequently featured dramatic portrayals of the aftermath of nuclear war or postwar comic books which depicted powerful superheroes saving the world from destruction.
such images resonated with the public because awareness of nuclear weapons was increasingly built into their daily lives.
schools and office buildings had regular air raid drills to prepare people for the possibility of nuclear attack.
radio stations regularly tested the emergency broadcast systems.
fallout shelters sprang up in public buildings and private homes stocked with water and canned goods.
america was a nation filled with anxiety.
and yet at the same time the united states was also an exuberant nation dazzled by its own prosperity and excited by the technological innovations that were transforming the promise of world.
among those innovations was nuclear power which offered the possibility that the same scientific knowledge that could destroy the world might also lead it into a dazzling future.
a gallup poll late in 1948 revealed that approximately two thirds of those who had an opinion on the subject believed that in the long run atomic energy would do more good than harm nuclear power cheap nuclear power the cold war 745 plants began to spring up in many areas of the country welcomed as the source of cheap and unlimited electricity their potential dangers scarcely even discussed by those who celebrated the creation of atomic power.
the korean war on june 24 1950 the armies of communist north korea swept across their southern border and invaded the pro western half of the korean peninsula to the south.
within days they had occupied much of south korea including seoul its capital.
almost immediately the united states committed itself to defeating the north korean offensive.
it was the nations first military engagement of the cold war.
the divided peninsula before the end of world war ii both the united states and the soviet union had sent troops into korea in an effort to weaken japanese occupation.
once the war was over and the japanese expelled the united states and the soviet union each supported different governments the soviets supporting a communist regime in the north and the united states supporting a pro c western government in the south.
instead they rhee had divided the nation supposedly temporarily along the 38th parallel.
the russians departed in 1949 leaving behind a communist government in the north with a strong soviet equipped army.
the americans left a few months later handing control to the pro western government of syngman rhee who was anticommunist but only nominally democratic.
he had a relatively small military which he used primarily to suppress internal opposition.
the relative weakness of the south offered a strong incentive to nationalists in the north korean government who wanted to reunite the country.
the temptation to invade grew stronger when the american government implied that it did not consider south korea within its own defense perimeter the role of the soviet union in north koreas calculations prior to the 1950 invasion remains unclear there is reason to believe that the north koreans acted without stalins prior approval.
but the soviets supported the offensive once it began.
the truman administration responded quickly to the invasion.
on june 27 1950 the president appealed to the united nations to intervene.
the soviet union was boycotting the security council at the time to protest the councils refusal to recognize the new communist government of china and thus was unable to exercise its veto power.
as a result american delegates were able to win un agreement to a resolution calling for international assistance to the rhee government.
on june 30 the united states ordered its own ground forces into korea and truman appointed general douglas macarthur to command the overwhelmingly american un operations there.
the intervention in korea was the first expression of the newly expansive american foreign policy outlined in nsc 68.
but the administration quickly went beyond nsc 68 and decided that the war would be an effort not simply at containment but also at liberation after a surprise american invasion at inchon in september had routed the north korean liberation forces from the south and sent them fleeing back across the 38th parallel truman gave macarthur permission to pursue the communists into their own territory.
his aim as an american sponsored un resolution proclaimed in october was to create a unified independent and democratic korea from invasion to stalemate for several weeks macarthurs invasion of north korea proceeded smoothly.
on october 19 the capital pyongyang fell to the un forces.
victory seemed near until the new communist government of china alarmed by the movement of american forces toward its border intervened.
by november 4 eight divisions of the chinese army had entered the war.
the un offensive stalled and then collapsed.
through december 1950 outnumbered american forces fought a bitter losing battle against the chinese divisions retreating at almost every juncture.
within weeks communist forces had pushed the americans back below the 38th parallel once again and had captured the south korean capital of seoul a second time.
by mid january 1951 the rout had ceased and by march the un armies had managed to regain much of the territory they had recently lost taking back seoul and pushing the communists north of the 38th parallel once more.
but with that the war degenerated into a protracted stalemate.
from the start truman was determined to avoid a direct conflict with china which he feared might lead to a new world war.
once china entered the war he began seeking a negotiated solution to the struggle and for the next two years he insisted that there be no wider war.
but he faced a formidable opponent in general macarthur who resisted any limits on his military discretion.
the united states was fighting the chinese he argued.
it should therefore attack china itself if not through an actual invasion then at least by bombing communist forces massing north of the chinese border.
in march 1951 macarthur indicated his unhappiness in a public letter to house republican leader joseph w martin that concluded there is no substitute for victory his position had wide popular support.
the martin letter came after nine months during which macarthur had opposed trumans decisions.
more than once the president had warned the general to keep his objections to himself.
the release of the martin letter therefore struck the president as intolerable insubordination.
on april 11 1951 he relieved macarthur of his command.
there was a storm of public outrage.
sixty nine percent of the american people supported macarthur a gallup poll reported.
when the general returned to the united states truman macarthur controversy 746 chapter 27 disarray in korea this disturbing picture by the noted life magazine photographer carl mydans conveys something of the air of catastrophe that surrounded the rout of americans from north korea by the chinese in 1951.
having approached the chinese border the americans confronted a massive invasion of korea by chinese troops who soon pushed them back below the border between the north and the south and well beyond.
shown here are u s marines following a vehicle carrying corpses after a battle with chinese and north korean troops.
they had been trapped by the enemy in north korea and had fought their way forty miles south before being rescued.
photo by carl mydans time life pictures getty images later in 1951 he was greeted with wild enthusiasm.
his televised farewell appearance before a joint session of congress which he concluded by saying old soldiers never die they just fade away attracted an audience of millions.
public criticism of truman abated somewhat when a number of prominent military figures including general omar bradley publicly supported the presidents decision.
but substantial hostility toward truman remained.
in the meantime the korean stalemate continued.
negotiations between the opposing forces began at panmunjom in july 1951 but the talks and the war dragged on until 1953.
limited mobilization just as the war in korea produced only a limited american military commitment abroad so it created only a limited economic mobilization at home.
still the government did try to control the wartime economy in several important ways.
first truman set up the office of defense mobilization to fight inflation by holding down prices and discouraging high union wage uemanas.
vvnen tnese cautious regulatory failed the president took more drastic action.
when railroad workers walked off the job in 1951 truman ordered the government to seize control of the railroads.
that helped keep the wartime trains running but it had no effect on union economic demands.
workers ultimately got most of regulation what they had demanded.
in 1952 during a nationwide steel strike truman seized the steel mills citing his powers as commander in chief.
but in a 6 to 3 decision the supreme court ruled that the president had exceeded his authority and truman was forced to relent.
the korean war gave a significant boost to economic growth by pumping new government funds into the economy at a point when many people believed a recession was about to begin.
but as the long stalemate continued leaving 140 000 americans dead or wounded frustration turned to anger.
many began to believe that something must be deeply wrong not only in korea but within the united states as well.
such fears contributed to the rise of the second major campaign of the century against domestic communism.
the cold war 747 north korean forces june 25 1950 sept 10 1950 un counterattack sept 15 1950 nov 24 1950 same pusan the korean war 1950 1953 these two maps illustrate the changing fortunes of un forces which were mostly american during the 1950 1953 korean war.
the map at the left shows the extent of the north korean invasion of the south in 1950 communist forces for a time controlled all of korea except a small area around pusan in the southeast.
on september 15 1950 un troops under douglas macarthur landed in force at inchon and soon drove the north koreans back across the border.
macarthur then pursued the north koreans well into their own territory.
the map at right shows the very different circumstances once the chinese entered the war in november 1950.
chinese forces drove the un army back below the 38th parallel and briefly deep into south korea below seoul.
the un troops fought back to the prewar border between north and south korea late in 1951 but the war then bogged down into a stalemate that continued for a year and a half.
ye lion sea what impact did the korean war have on american politics in the early 1950s.
the crusade against subversion why did the american people develop a growing fear of internal communist subversion that by the early 1950s had reached the point of near hysteria.
there are many possible answers but no single definitive explanation.
one factor was obvious.
communism was not an imagined enemy in the 1950s.
it had tangible shape in joseph stalin and the soviet union.
in addition america had sources of encountered setbacks in its battle against the red scare communjsm the korean stalemate the loss of china the soviet development of an atomic bomb.
searching for someone to blame many people were attracted to the idea of a communist conspiracy within american borders.
but there were other factors as well rooted in american domestic politics.
1uac and alger hiss auch of the anticommunist furor emerged out of the republican partys search for an issue with which to attack he democrats and out of the democrats efforts to stifle hat issue.
beginning in 1947 with republicans temporar ly in control of congress the house un american activities 748 chapter 27 dalton trumbo screenwriter dalton trumbo was a member of the hollywood ten he refused to testify before the house un american activities committee in its investigation of communist influences in hollywood.
as a result trumbo was blacklisted and could not find work.
while blacklisted trumbo won two academy awards one was given to a front writer who pretended to be the author of the script and the other was awarded to robert rich trumbo s pseudonym.
bettmann corbis committee huac held widely publicized investigations to prove that under democratic rule the government had tolerated if not actually encouraged communist subversion.
the committee turned first to the movie industry arguing that communists had infiltrated hollywood.
writers and producers some of them former communists were called to testify and when several of them the hollywood ten refused to answer questions about their own political beliefs and those of their colleagues they were jailed for contempt.
some writers were barred from employment in the movie industry when hollywood attempting to protect its public image adopted a blacklist of those of suspicious loyalty more alarming to much of the public was huacs investigation into charges of disloyalty leveled against a former high ranking member of the state department alger hiss.
in 1948 whittaker chambers a self avowed former communist agent who had turned vehemently against the party and become an editor at time magazine told the committee that alger hiss hiss passe classified state department documents through him to the soviet union in 1937 and 1938.
when hiss sued him for slander chambers produced microfilms of the documents called the pumpkin papers because chambers had kept them hidden in a pumpkin in his garden.
hiss could not be tried for espionage because of the statute of limitations a law that protects individuals from prosecution for most crimes after seven years have passed.
but largely because of the relentless efforts of richard m nixon a freshman republican congressman from california and a member of huac hiss was convicted of perjury and served several years in prison.
the hiss case not only discredited a prominent young diplomat it also cast suspicion on a generation of liberal democrats and made it possible for many americans to believe that communists had actually infiltrated the government.
the federal loyalty program and the rosenberg case rartiy to protect itseir against republican encourage support for the presidents foreign policy initiatives the truman administration in 1947 initiated a widely publicized program to review the loyalty of federal employees.
in august 1950 the president authorized sensitive agencies to fire people deemed bad security risks by 1951 more than 2 000 government employees had resigned under pressure and 212 had been dismissed.
the employee loyalty program established a widely cited list of supposedly subversive organizations.
the director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi j edgar hoover investigated and harassed alleged radicals.
in 1950 congress passed the mccarran internal security act requiring all communist organizations to register with the government.
truman vetoed the bill.
congress easily overrode his veto.
the successful soviet detonation of a nuclear weapon in 1949 convinced many people that there had been a conspiracy to pass american atomic secrets to the russians.
in 1950 klaus fuchs a young british scientist seemed to confirm those fears when he testified that he had delivered to the russians details of the manufacture of the bomb.
the case ultimately settled on an obscure new york couple julius and ethel rosenberg members of the communist party whom the federal government claimed had been the masterminds of the mccarran internal security act the cold war 749 the conspiracy.
the case against them rested in large part on testimony by ethels brother david greenglass a machinist who had worked on the manhattan project.
greenglass admitted to channeling secret information to the soviet union through other agents including fuchs.
his sister and brother in law had he claimed planned and orchestrated the espionage.
the rosenbergs were convicted and on april 5 1951 sentenced to death.
after two years of appeals and protests by sympathizers they died in the electric chair on june 19 1953.
au these factors the huac investigations the hiss trial the loyalty investigations the mccarran act the rosenberg case helped to intensify public fear of communist subversion.
by the early 1950s the fear seemed to have gripped much of the country.
state and local governments the judiciary schools and universities labor unions all sought to purge themselves anticommunist of real or imained subversives.
a perva hysteria sive ear settled on the country not only the fear of communist infiltration but also the fear of being suspected of communist subversion.
it was a climate that made possible the rise of an extraordinary public figure whose behavior at any other time might have been dismissed as preposterous.
mccarthyism mccarthyisms appeal joseph mccarthy was a relatively undistinguished first term republican senator from wisconsin when in february 1950 he suddenly burst into national prominence.
in the midst of a speech in wheeling west virginia he raised a sheet of paper and claimed to hold in my hand a list of 205 known communists currently working in the u s state department.
no person of comparable stature had ever made so bold a charge against the federal government and in the weeks to come as mccarthy repeated and expanded his accusations he emerged as the nations most prominent leader of the crusade against domestic subversion.
within weeks of his charges against the state department mccarthy was leveling accusations at other agencies.
after 1952 with the republicans in control of the senate and mccarthy the chairman of a special subcommittee he conducted highly publicized investigations of subversion in many areas of the government.
his ambitious assistants roy cohn and david schine sauntered arrogantly through federal offices and american embassies overseas looking for evidence of communist influence.
one hapless government official after another appeared before mccarthys subcommittee where the senator belligerently and often cruelly badgered witnesses and destroyed public careers.
mccarthy never produced solid evidence of actual communist subversion.
but a growing constituency adored him nevertheless for his coarse fearless assaults on a government establishment that many americans considered arrogant elitist even traitorous.
republicans in particular rallied to his claims that the democrats had been responsible for twenty years of treason that only a change of parties could rid the country of subversion.
mccarthy in short provided his followers with an issue into which they could channel a wide range of resentments fear of communism animosity toward the countrys eastern establishment and frustrated partisan ambitions.
for a time mccarthy intimidated all but a few people from opposing him.
even the highly popular dwight d eisenhower running for president in 1952 did not speak out against him although he disliked mccarthys tactics and was outraged at mccarthys attacks on general george marshall.
the republican revival public frustration over the stalemate in korea and popular fears of internal subversion combined to make 1952 a bad year for the democratic party.
truman whose popularity had greatly diminished wisely decided not to run again.
the party united instead behind governor adlai e stevenson of illinois whose dignity wit and eloquence made him a beloved figure to many liberals and intellectuals.
but republicans charged that stevenson lacked the strength or the will to combat communism sufficiently.
mccarthy described him as soft and took delight in deliberately confusing him with alger hiss.
stevensons greatest problem however was the republican candidate opposing him.
rejecting the efforts of conservatives to nominate robert taft or douglas macarthur the republicans turned to a man who had no previous identifi dwight cation with the party general dwight eisenhower d eisenhower military hero commander of nato president of columbia university in new york.
eisenhower won nomination on the first ballot.
he chose as his running mate the young california senator who had gained national prominence through his crusade against alger hiss richard m nixon.
eisenhower and nixon were a powerful combination in the autumn campaign.
while eisenhower attracted support through his geniality and his statesmanlike pledges to settle the korean conflict at one point dramatically promising to go to korea himself nixon effectively exploited the issue of communist subversion.
after surviving early accusations of financial improprieties which he effectively neutralized in a famous television address the checkers speech nixon went on to launch harsh attacks on democratic cowardice appeasement and treason eisenhower won by both a popular and electoral landslide 55 percent of the popular vote to stevensons 44 percent 442 electoral votes to stevensons 89.
republicans gained control of both houses of congress for only the second time in two decades.
the election of 1952 ended twenty years of democratic government.
and while it might not have seemed so at the time it also signaled the end of some of the worst turbulence of the postwar era.
mccarthyism tit y y irj bt the american civil liberties union warned in the early 1950s at the peak of vv il jut in the anticommunist fervor that is now known as mccarthyism that the threat to civil liberties today is the most serious in the history of our country it was expressing a view with which many americans wholeheartedly agreed.
but while many americans accept that there were unusually powerful challenges to freedom of speech and association in the late 1940s and early 1950s there is wide disagreement about the causes and meaning of those challenges.
the simplest argument and one that continues to attract scholarly support is that the postwar red scare expressed real and legitimate concerns about communist subversion in the united states.
william o neill in a better world 1982 and richard gid powers in not without honor 1995 have both argued that anticommunism was a serious intelligent and patriotic movement despite its excesses.
the american communist party according to this view was an agent of stalin and the soviet union within the united states actively engaged in espionage and subversion.
the effort to root communists out of public life was both understandable and justifiable and the hysteria it sometimes produced was an unhappy but predictable by product of an essentially rational and justifiable effort.
anticommunism powers wrote expressed the essential american determination to stand against attacks on human freedom and foster the growth of democracy throughout the world to superimpose on this rich history the cartoon features of joe mccarthy is to reject history for the easy comforts of moralism.
most interpretations however have been much less charitable.
in the 1950s in the midst of the red scare an influential group of historians and social scientists began to portray the anticommunist fervor of their time as an expression of social maladjustment an argument perhaps rare book and special collections division the library of congress looking back even during world war ii when the united states and the soviet union were allies it was evident to leaders in both nations that america and russia had quite different visions of what the postwar world should look like.
very quickly after the war ended those differences became visible to almost everyone and the once fruitful relationship between the worlds two greatest powers quickly soured.
americans came to believe that the soviet union was an expansionist tyranny little different from hitlers germany that josef stalin the soviet leader was bent on world conquest.
soviets came to believe that the united states was trying to protect its own dominance in the world by encircling the soviet union and trying to limit its ability to operate as a great power.
the result of these tensions was what became known by the end of the 1940s as the cold war.
actual conflicts in the early years of the cold war were relatively few.
instead the united states engaged in a series of policies designed to prevent both war and soviet aggression.
it helped rebuild the shattered nations of western europe with substantial economic aid through the marshall plan to stabilize those nations and prevent them from becoming communist.
america announced a new foreign policy known as containment that committed it to an effort to keep the soviet union from expanding its influence further into the world.
the united states and western europe formed a strong and enduring alliance nato to defend europe against possible soviet advances.
in 1950 however the armed forces of communist north korea launched an invasion of the noncommunist south and to most americans including most importantly president truman the conflict quickly came to be seen as a test of american resolve in the cold war.
the korean war was long costly and unpopular with many military setbacks and frustrations.
in the end however the united states working through the united nations managed to drive the north koreans out of the south and stabilize the original division of the peninsula.
750 most closely associated with richard hofstadter s essay the paranoid style in american politics.
there was they argued no logical connection between the modest power of actual communists in the united states and the anticommunist hysteria.
the fear of communism they maintained was rooted in social and cultural anxieties that had only an indirect connection with the political world.
extreme anticommunism they claimed was something close to a pathology it expressed fear of and alienation from the modern world.
a person afflicted with the paranoid style hofstadter wrote believes himself to be living in a world in which he is spied upon plotted against betrayed and very likely destined for total ruin.
he feels that his liberties have been arbitrarily and outrageously invaded.
he is opposed to almost everything that has happened in american politics in the past twenty years.
other scholars writing not long after the decline of mccarthyism rejected the sociocultural argument but shared the belief that the crusade against subversion was a distortion of normal public life they saw the anticommunist crusade as an example of party politics run amok.
richard freeland in the truman doctrine and the origins of mccarthyism 1971 argued that the democrats began the effort to purge the government of radicals to protect themselves from attacks by the republicans.
nelson polsby robert griffith and others have noted how republicans seized on the issue of communism in government in the late 1940s to reverse their nearly twenty year exclusion from power.
with each party trying to outdo the other in its effort to demonstrate its anticommunist credentials it was hardly surprising that the crusade reached extraordinarily intense proportions.
still other historians have emphasized the role of powerful government officials and agencies with a strong commitment to anticommunism most notably j edgar hoover and the fbi.
athan theoharis and kenneth o reilly introduced the idea of an anticommunist bureaucracy in work published in the 1970s and 1980s.
ellen schrecker in many are the crimes 1998 argues that the red scare was at its heart directed largely against the left and that it was orchestrated by an interlocking cluster of official agencies with a deep commitment to the project.
several scholars finally have presented an argument that does not so much challenge other interpretations as complement them.
anticommunist zealots were not alone to blame for the excesses of mccarthyism they argue.
it was also the fault of liberals in politics in academia and perhaps above all in the media who were so intimidated by the political climate or so imprisoned within the conventions of their professions that they found themselves unable to respond effectively to the distortions and excesses they recognized around them.

it greatly strengthened an already powerful crusade against communists and those believed to be communists within the united states a crusade often known as mccarthyism because of the notoriety of senator joseph mccarthy of wisconsin the most celebrated leader of the effort.
america after world war ii was indisputably the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world.

setting the stage if america was experiencing a golden age in the 1950s and early 1960s as many americans believed at the time and many continue to believe today it was largely a result of two developments.
one was a booming national prosperity which profoundly altered the social economic and even physical landscape of the united states.
the other was the continuing struggle against communism a struggle that created great anxiety but that also encouraged some americans to look even more approvingly at their own society.
the politics of the 1950s seemed in many ways to reflect the combination of self satisfaction and anxiety that affluence and the cold war had created.
there were to be sure many critics of american life in these years but their influence was mostly limited to the margins of the nation s culture.
in retrospect many of these marginalized critics appear to have understood the state of american life far better than those who so confidently celebrated the nation s successes for there were serious social problems that most americans largely ignored.
more than 30 million americans 20 percent of the population continued to live in poverty in the 1950s according to some measurements.
significant minorities continued to suffer social political and economic discrimination.
many american women were beginning to chafe at the obstacles to their personal and professional growth.
the very things that made america seem so successful in the 1950s also contributed to bringing the nation s social problems more sharply into focus.
but even in the 1950s the first signs of the changes to come could be seen.
the smooth surface of american public life could not obscure a growing restlessness economic miracle among the most striking features of american society in the 1950s and early 1960s was a booming economic growth that made even the heady 1920s seem pale by comparison.
it was a better balanced and more widely distributed prosperity than that of thirty years earlier but it was not as universal as some americans liked to believe.
sources of economic growth between 1945 and 1960 the gross national product grew by 250 percent from 200 billion tc over 500 billion.
unemployment which during the depression had averaged between 15 anc 25 percent remained throughout the 1950s and early 1960s at about 5 percent or lower.
inflation in the meantime hovered around 3 percent a year or less.
the causes of this growth and stability were varied.
government spending which had endec the depression in the 1940s continued to stimulate growth through public funding of schools government housin veterans benefits welfare the 100 billion interstate highway pro spending gram which began in 1956 and above all military spending.
economic growth was at its peak averaging 4 7 percent a year during the first half o the 1950s when military spending was highest because of the korean war.
in the late 1950s with spending on armaments in decline the annual rate of growth declined by more than half tc 2 25 percent.
the national birth rate reversed a long pattern of decline with the so called baby boom which had begun during the war and peaked in 1957.
the nations population rose almost 20 percent ir the decade from 150 million in 1950 to 179 million in i960.
the baby boom contributed tc increased consumer demand and expanding economic growth.

at the peak of the baby boom during the 1950s the nation s population grew by 20 percent.
archive photos getty images what impact did the baby boom have on the nation s economy.
because of this unprecedented growth the economy grew nearly ten times as fast as the population in the thirty years after the war.
and while that growth was far from equally distributed it affected most of society.
the average american in i960 had over 20 percent more purchasing power than in 1945 and more than twice as much as during the prosperous 1920s.
by 1960 per capita income was over 1 800 500 more than it had been in 1945.
the american people had achieved the highest standard of living of any society in the history of the world.
the rise of the modern west no region of the country profited more from economic growth than the american west.
its population expanded dramatically its cities boomed its industrial economy flourished.
before world war ii most of the west had been economically at least an appendage of the great industrial economy of the east.
the west provided the east with raw materials and agricultural goods.
by the 1960s however some parts of the west had become among the most important and populous industrial and cultural centers of the nation in their own right.
as during world war ii much of the growth of the west was a result of federal spending and investment on the dams power stations highways and other infrastructure projects that made economic development possible and on the military contracts that continued to flow disproportionately to factories in california and texas many of them built with government funds during the war.
but other factors played a role as well.
the enormous increase in automobile use after world war ii a result among other things of suburbanization and improved highway systems gave a large stimulus to the petroleum industry and contributed to the rapid growth of oil fields in texas and colorado and also to the metropolitan centers serving them houston dallas and denver.
state governments in the west invested heavily in their universities.
the university of texas and university of california systems in particular became among the nations largest and best as centers of research they helped attract technology intensive industries to the region.
climate also contributed to economic growth.
california nevada and arizona in particular attracted many migrants from the east because of their warm dry climates.
the growth favorable f los angeles after world war ii was climate a particularly remarkable phenomenon.
more than 10 percent of all new businesses in the united states between 1945 and 1950 began in los angeles.
its population rose by over 50 percent between 1940 and 1960.
the new economics the discovery of the power of the american economic system was a major cause of the confident tone of much american political life in the 1950s.
during the depression politicians intellectuals and others had often questioned the viability of capitalism.
in the 1950s such doubt vanished.
two features in particular made the postwar economy a source of national confidence.
first was the belief that keynesian economics made it possible for government to regulate and stabilize the economy keynesian without intruding directly into the private economics sector.
the british economist john maynard keynes had argued as early as the 1920s that by varying the flow of government spending and taxation fiscal policy and managing the supply of currency monetary policy the government could stimulate the economy to cure recession and dampen growth to prevent inflation.
the experience of the last years of the depression and the first years of the war had seemed to confirm this argument.
by the mid 1950s keynesian theory was rapidly becoming a fundamental article of faith not only among professional economists but also among much of the public.
the new economics as its supporters came to call it finally won official acceptance in 1963 when john kennedy proposed a tax cut to stimulate economic growth.
although it took kennedys death and the political skills of lyndon johnson to win passage of the measure in 1964 the result seemed to confirm all that the keynesians had predicted an increase in private demand which stimulated economic growth and reduced unemployment.
as the economy continued to expand far beyond what anyone had predicted only a few years before many americans assumed that such growth was now without bounds.

capital and labor over 4 000 corporate mergers took place in the 1950s and more than ever before a relatively small number of large scale organizations controlled an enormous proportion of the nations economic activity.
this was particularly true in industries benefiting corporate from government defense spending.
as consolidation during world war ii the federal government tended to award military contracts to a few large corporations.
in 1959 for example half of all defense contracts went to only twenty firms.
by the end of the decade half the net corporate income in the nation was going to only slightly more than 500 firms or one tenth of 1 percent of the total number of corporations.
a similar consolidation was occurring in the agricultural economy.
as increasing mechanization reduced the need for farm labor the agricultural workforce declined by more than half in the two decades after the war.
mechanization also endangered one of the most cherished american institutions the family farm.

corporations enjoying booming growth were reluctant to allow strikes to interfere with their operations.
as a result business leaders made important concessions to unions.
as early as 1948 walter reuther president of the united automobile workers obtained a contract from general motors that included a built in escalator clause an automatic cost of living increase pegged to the consumer price index.
in 1955 reuther received a guarantee from ford motor company of continuing wages to auto workers even during layoffs.

two million african americans were on some form of relief by 1932.
traditional patterns of segregation and disenfranchisement in the south survived the depression largely unchal scottsboro lensed but a few particularly notorious case examples of racism did attract national attention.
the most celebrated was the scottsboro case.
in march 1931 nine black teenagers were taken off a freight train in alabama in a small town near scottsboro and arrested for vagrancy and disorder.
later two white women who had also been riding the train accused them of rape.
in fact there was overwhelming evidence medical and otherwise that the women had not been raped that they may have made their accusations out of fear of being arrested themselves.
nevertheless an all white jury in alabama quickly convicted all nine of the scottsboro boys as they were known to both friends and foes and sentenced eight of them to death.
the supreme court overturned the convictions in 1932 and a series of new trials began that attracted increasing national attention.
the international labor defense an organization associated with the communist party came to the aid of the accused youths and began to publicize the case.
later the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp provided assistance as well.
the trials continued throughout the 1930s.
although the white southern juries who sat on the case never acquitted any of the defendants all of them eventually gained their freedom four because the charges were dropped four because of early paroles and one because he escaped.
but the last of the scottsboro defendants did not leave prison until 1950.
the depression was a time of important changes in the role and behavior of leading black organizations.
the naacp for example began to work diligently to win a position for blacks within naacps tbe emer in labr movement changing supporting the formation of the role congress of industrial organ izations and helping to break down racial barriers within labor unions.
walter white secretary of the naacp once made a personal appearance at an auto plant to implore african americans not to work as strikebreakers.
partly as a result of such efforts more than half a million blacks were able to join the labor movement.
in the steelworkers union for example african americans constituted about 20 percent of the membership.

mexican americans filled many of the same menial jobs in the west and elsewhere that african americans filled in other regions.

some became agricultural migrants traveling from region to region harvesting fruit lettuce and other crops.

as in the south unemployed white anglos in the southwest discrimination demanded jobs held by hispanics.
thus against mexican unemployment rose quickly to hispanics levels far higher than those for anglos.
some mexicans were in effect forced to leave the country by officials who arbitrarily removed them from relief rolls or simply rounded them up and transported them across the border.

occasionally there were signs of organized resistance by mexican americans themselves most notably in california where some formed a union of migrant farmworkers.
but harsh repression by local growers and the public authorities allied with them prevented such organizations from having much impact.
like african american farmworkers many mexicans began as a result to migrate to cities such as los angeles where they lived in a poverty comparable to that of urban blacks in the south and northeast.

chinese americans had the dual challenge in the 1930s of dealing both with large scale unemployment and with continuing news of catastrophe from china where most still had many family members.
hulton archive getty images all japanese americans in los angeles worked at such stands at the end of the 1930s.
for those who found jobs usually poorly paid in the industrial or service economy employment was precarious like blacks and hispanics they often lost jobs to white americans desperate for work that a few years earlier they would not have considered.
japanese farmworkers like chicano farmworkers suffered from the increasing competition for even these low paying jobs from white migrants from the great plains.
in california younger men and women organized japanese american democratic clubs in several cities which worked for among other things laws protecting racial and ethnic minorities from discrimination.
at the same time some japanese american businessmen and professionals tried to overcome obstacles by encouraging other japanese to become more assimilated more american they formed the japanese american citizens league in 1930 to promote their goals.
by 1940 it had nearly 6 000 members.
chinese americans fared no better.
the overwhelming majority continued to work in chinese owned laundries and restaurants.
those who moved outside the asian community could rarely find jobs above the entry level.

most men and many women believed that what work there was should go tc men.
many people believed that no woman whose husband was employed should acc ept a job.
but the widespread assumption that married women at least should not work outside the home did not stop them from doing so.
both single and married women worked in the 1930s despite public condemnation of the practice because they or their families needed the money.
in fact the largest new group of female workers consisted ol wives and mothers.
by the end of the depression 20 percent popular disapproval of womens employment increased female employment more women were working than had been doing so at the beginning.
the increase occurred despite considerable obstacles.
professional opportunities for women declined because unemployed men began moving into professions such as teaching and social work that had previously been considered womens fields.
female industrial workers were more likely to be laid off or to experience wage reductions than their male counterparts.
but white women also had certain advantages in the workplace.
the nonprofessional jobs that women traditionally held as salesclerks and stenographers and in other service positions were less likely to disappear than the predominantly male jobs in heavy industry.
nor were many men even unemployed men likely to ask for such jobs.

note however the general leveling off of the participation of single women who traditionally accounted for the vast majority of women workers after 1920 at the same time that the total number of women in the paid workforce was rising.
many more married women began entering the paid workforce in these years particularly in the 1930s.
iv iy did so many married women begin doing paid work during the great depression.
black women suffered massive unemployment because of a great reduction of domestic service jobs.
as many as half of all black working women lost their jobs in the 1930s.
even so at the end of the 1930s 38 percent of black women were employed as compared to 24 percent of white women.
that was because black women both married and unmarried had always been more likely to work than white women less out of preference than out of economic necessity.
for american feminists the depression years were on the whole a time of frustration.
although economic pressures pushed more women into the workforce those same pressures helped to erode the frail support that feminists had won in the 1920s for the idea of women becoming economically and professionally independent.
depression families the economic hardships of the depression years placed great strains on american families many of whom had become accustomed in the 1920s to a steadily rising standard of living but now found themselves plunged suddenly into uncertainty.
such circumstances forced many families to retreat from the consumer patterns they had developed in the 1920s.
women often returned to sewing clothes for themselves and retreat from l eir tumilies and to preserving their own consumerism fd rather than buying such products in stores.
others engaged in home businesses taking in laundry selling baked goods accepting boarders.
many households expanded to include distant relatives.
parents often moved in with their children and grandparents with their grandchildren or vice versa.
but the depression also eroded the strength of many family units.
there was a decline in the divorce rate but largely because divorce was now too expensive for some.
more common was the informal breakup of families particularly the desertion of families by unemployed men bent on escaping the humiliation of being unable to earn a living.
the marriage and birth rates declined simultaneously for the first time since the early nineteenth century.
the depression and american culture the great depression was a traumatic experience for millions of americans and it shook the confidence of many people in themselves or in their nation or both.
out of the crisis emerged some of the most probing criticisms of american society and the american economic system of the industrial age.
at the same time the depression produced powerful confirmations of traditional values and reinforced many traditional goals.
there was not one depression culture but many.
depression values american social values seemed to change relatively little in response to the depression.
instead many people responded to hard times by redoubling their commitment to familiar ideas and goals.
the sociologists robert lynd and helen merrell lynd who had published a celebrated study of muncie indiana middletown in 1929 returned there in the mid 1930s to see how the city had changed.
they concluded in their 1937 book middletown in transition that in most respects the texture of middletowns culture has not changed.
middletown is overwhelmingly living by the values by which it lived in 1925 above all the men and women of middle to wn and by implication many other americans remained committed to the traditional american emphasis on the individual.
in some respects the economic crisis worked to undermine the traditional success ethic in america.
many people began to look to government for assistance many blamed corporate moguls international bankers economic royalists and others for their distress.
yet the depression did not in the end seriously erode the success ethic.
persistence of the success ethic 650 chapter 23 some victims of the depression expressed anger and struck out at the economic system.
many however seemed to blame themselves.
nothing so surprised foreign observers of america self blame in as the apparent passivity of the unemployed many of whom were so ashamed of their joblessness that they refused to leave their homes.
at the same time millions of people responded eagerly to reassurances that they could through their own efforts restore themselves to prosperity and success.
the writer and lecturer dale carnegies self help manual how to win friends and influence people 1936 was one of the best selling books of the decade.
carnegies message was not only that personal initiative was the route to success it was also that the best way for people to get ahead was to fit in and make other people feel important.

of rural americans were shocked during the 1930s poverty at their discovery of debilitating rural poverty.
among those who were most effective in conveying the dimensions of this poverty was a group of documentary photographers many of them employed by the federal farm security administration in the late 1930s who traveled through the south recording the nature of agricultural life.

many writers similarly turned away from the personal concerns of the 1920s and devoted themselves to exposes of social injustice.

but the cultural products of the 1930s that attracted the widest popular audiences were those that diverted attention away from the depression.
and they came to americans primarily through the two most powerful instruments of popular culture in the 193 os radio and the movies.
radio almost every american family had a radio in the 1930s.
in cities and towns radio consoles were now as familiar a part of the furnishing of parlors and kitchens as tables and chairs.
even in remote rural areas without access to electricity many families purchased radios and hooked them up to car batteries when they wished to listen.
unlike in later times radio in the 1930s was often a community experience.
young people would place radios on their front porches and invite friends over to sit talk or dance.
in poor urban neighborhoods many people who could not afford a radio play among the most popular entertainments of the 1930s were live readings of plays over the radio many of them mysteries or romances written specifically for the new medium.

everett collection other kinds of social activities would gather on a street or in a backyard to listen to sporting events or concerts.
within families the radio often drew parents and children together in the evening to listen to favorite programs.
what did americans hear on the radio.
although radio stations occasionally carried socially and politically provocative escapist programs the staple of broadcasting was programming escapism comedies such as amos n andy with its humorous if demeaning picture of urban blacks adventures such as superman dick tracy and the lone ranger and other entertainment programs.
radio brought a new kind of comedy previously limited to vaudeville or to ethnic theatersto a wide audience.
jack benny george burns and gracie allen and other masters of elaborately timed jokes and repartee began to develop broad followings that they would later take with them to television.
soap operas also later to become staples of television programming were enormously popular on radio in the 1930s especially with women who were alone in the house during the day.
that was one reason they became known as soap operas soap companies whose advertising was targeted at women generally sponsored them.
almost invariably radio programs were broadcast live and as a result radio spawned an enormous number of public performances.
radio comedies and dramas were often performed before audiences in theaters or studios.
band concerts were broadcast from dance halls helping jazz and swing bands to achieve broad popularity.
classical music too was broadcast bve from studios.
radio provided americans with their first direct access to important public events and radio news and sports divisions grew rapidly to meet the demand.
some of the most dramatic moments of the 1930s were a result of radio coverage of celebrated events the world series major college football games the academy awards political radios conventions presidential inaugu impact rations.
when the german dirigi ble the hindenburg crashed in flames in lakehurst new jersey in 1937 after a transatlantic voyage it produced an enormous national reaction largely because of the live radio account by a broadcaster overcome with emotion who cried out as he watched the terrible crash oh the humanity.

see patterns of popular culture pp.
radio was important for the way it drew the nation together by creating the possibility of shared experiences and common access to culture and information.
it was also significant for the way it helped reshape the social life of the nation for the way it encouraged many families and individuals to center their lives more around the home than they had in the past.
continuing popularity of movies movies in the new era moviegoing would seem particularly vulnerable to hard times.
families struggling to pay the rent or buy food could easily decide to forgo an evening at the movies.
in the first years of the depression movie attendance did drop significantly.
by the mid 1930s however most americans had resumed their moviegoing habits in part because movies were a less expensive entertainment option than many other possibilities and in part because the movies themselves all of them now with sound and by the end of the decade many of them in color were becoming more appealing.
in many ways movies were as safely conventional in the 1930s as they had been in the late 1920s.
hollywood continued to exercise tight control over its products in the 1930s through its resilient censor will hays who ensured that most movies carried no sensational or controversial messages.
the studio system through which a few large movie companies exercised iron control over actors writers and directors and through which a few great moguls such as louis b mayer or jack warner could single handedly decide the fate of most projects also worked to ensure that hollywood films avoided controversy.
but neither the censor nor the studio system could or wished to prevent films from exploring social questions altogether.
a few films such as king vidors our daily bread 1932 and john fords adaptation of john steinbecks novel the grapes of wrath 1940 did explore political themes.
the director frank capra provided a muted social message in several of his comedies mr.

by the time it s a wonderful life appeared frank capra had been the most famous and successful director in hollywood for more than a decade.
his films during those years had almost all been great commercial and critical successes.
capra s popularity was a result in part of his tremendous talent as a director but it was also a result of his ideas.
most of his films expressed a vision of society and of politics that resonated clearly with the concerns of millions of americans as they struggled through the years of the great depression.
capra was born in 1897 in a small village in sicily and moved with his family to america six years later after working his way through college he found a job in the still young movie industry in california and eventually became a director of feature films.

gangster movies such as little caesar 1930 and the public enemy 1931 portrayed a dark gritty violent world with which few americans were familiar but their desperate stories were popular nevertheless with those engaged in their own difficult struggles.

capra was entirely conscious of the romantic populism that he brought to his films.
he was intensely patriotic and he believed fervently that america stood for individual opportunity and was defined by the decency of ordinary people.
he did not like the term masses and found it insulting degrading.
he saw the people rather as a collection of free individuals each an island of human dignity.
when america entered world war ii capra collaborated with the government and the walt disney studios to make a series of films designed to explain to new soldiers what the war was about a series known as why we fight.

popular literature and journalism the social and political strains of the great depression found voice much more successfully in print than they did on the airwaves or the screen.
much literature and journalism in the 1930s dealt directly or indirectly with the tremendous disillusionment and the increasing radicalism of the era.
not all literature of course was challenging or controversial.
the most popular books and magazines of the time were as escapist and romantic as the most popular radio shows and movies.
two of the best selling novels of the decade were romantic sagas set in ear life magazine lier eras margaret mitchells gone with the wind 1936 and hervey allens anthony adverse 1933.
leading magazines 653 654 chapter 23 focused more on fashions stunts scenery and the arts than on the social conditions of the nation.
the enormously popular new photographic journal life which began publication in 1936 and quickly became one of the most successful magazines in american history had one of the largest readerships of any publication in the united states.
it devoted some attention to politics and to the economic conditions of the depression more in fact than did many of its competitors.
but it was best known for stunning photographs of sporting and theater events natural landscapes and impressive public projects.
its first cover was a striking photograph by margaret bourke white of a new deal hydroelectric project.
one of its most popular features was life goes to a party which took the chatty social columns of daily newspapers and turned them into glossy photographic glimpses of americans having fun.
other depression writing however was frankly and openly challenging to the dominant values of american popular culture.
in the first years of the depression some of the most significant literature offered corrosive portraits of the harshness and emptiness of american life nathanael wests miss lonely hearts 1933 the story of an advice columnist overwhelmed by the sadness he encounters in the lives of those who consult him jack conroys the disinherited 1933 a harsh portrait of the lives of coal miners and james t farrells studs lonigan 1932 a portrait of a lost hardened working class youth.
the popular front and the left in the later 1930s much of the political literature was a result of the rise of the popular front a broad coalition of antifascist groups on the left of which the most important was the american communist party.
the party had long been a harsh and unrelenting critic of american capitalism and the government it claimed was controlled by it.
but in 1935 under instructions from the soviet union the party softened its attitude toward franklin roosevelt whom stalin considered a potential ally in the coming battle against hitler and formed loose alliances with many other progressive groups.
the party began to praise the new deal.
it even supported john l lewis a powerful and strongly anticommunist labor leader.
the party adopted the slogan communism is twentieth century americanism in its heyday the popular front did much to enhance the reputation and influence of the communist party whose formal membership grew to perhaps 100 000 in the mid 1930s the highest it had ever been or would be again.
but it also helped mobilize writers artists and intellectuals many of them unconnected with and many of them uninterested in the communist party behind a pattern of social criticism.
for some intellectuals the popular front offered an escape from the lonely and difficult stance of detachment and alienation they had embraced in the 1920s.
the spanish civil war spanish civil was important t0 many american intellec war tuals especially those on the left.
it helped give meaning and purpose to individual lives.
the war in spain pitted the fascists of francisco franco southern tenant farmers union who was receiving support from hitler and mussolini against the existing republican government.
it attracted a substantial group of young americans more than 3 000 who formed the abraham lincoln brigade directed and in part created by the american communist party and traveled to spain to join the fight against the fascists.
about a third of its members died in combat.
ernest hemingway who spent time as a correspondent in spain during the conflict wrote in his novel for whom the bell tolls 1940 of how the war provided those americans who fought in it with a part in something which you could believe in wholly and completely and in which you felt an absolute brotherhood with others who were engaged in it the communist party was active as well in organizing the unemployed in the early 1930s and staged a hunger march in washington d c in 1931.
party members were among the most effective union organizers in some industries.
and the party was among the few political organizations that took a firm stand in favor of racial justice its active defense of the scottsboro defendants was but one example of its efforts to ally itself with the aspirations of african americans.
the american communist party was not however the open patriotic organization it tried to appear.
it was always under the close and rigid supervision of the soviet union.
its leaders took their orders from the comintern in moscow.
most members obediently followed the party line although there were many areas in which communists were active for which there was no party line areas in which members acted independently.
the subordination of the party leadership to the soviet union was most clearly demonstrated in 1939 when stalin signed a nonaggression pact with nazi germany.
moscow then sent orders to the american communist party to abandon the popular front and return to its old stance of harsh criticism of american liberals and communist party leaders in the united states immediately obeyed although thousands of disillusioned members left the party as a result.
the socialist party of america under the leadership of norman thomas also cited the economic crisis as evidence of the failure of capitalism and sought vigorously to win public support for its own political program.
among other things it attempted to mobilize support among the rural poor.
the southern tenant farmers union stfu supported by the party and organized by a young socialist h l mitchell attempted to create a biracial coalition of sharecroppers tenant farmers and others to demand economic reform.
neither the stfu nor the party itself however made any real progress toward establishing socialism as a major force in american politics.
by 1936 membership in the socialist party had fallen below 20 000.
antiradicahsm was a powerful force in the 1930s just as it had been during and after world war i and would be again in the 1940s and 1950s.

the granger collection new york could find it or imagine it.
state and local governments harried and sometimes imprisoned communist organizers.
white southerners tried to drive communist organizers out of the countryside just as growers in california and elsewhere tried unsuccessfully to keep communists from organizing mexican american and other workers.
even so only a few times before in american history and in few since did being part of the left seem so respectable and even conventional among workers intellectuals and others.
thus the the left 1930s witnessed a significant if temporary newfound widening of the ideological range of main respectability stream art and politics.
the new deal sponsored artistic work through the works projects administration that was frankly challenging to the capitalist norms of the 1920s.
the filmmaker pare lorentz with funding from new deal agencies made a series of powerful and polemical documentaries the plou that broke the plains 1936 the river 1937 that combined a celebration of new deal programs with a harsh critique of the exploitation of people and the environment that industrial capitalism had produced.
perhaps the most successful chronicler of social conditions in the 1930s was the novelist john steinbeck particularly in his celebrated novel the grapes of wrath published in 1939.
in telling the story of the joad family migrants from the dust the grapes bow t0 cabfrnia who encounter an unend of wrath ing string of calamities and failures he offered not only a harsh portrait of the exploitive features of agrarian life in the west but also a tribute to the endurance of his main characters and to the spirit of community they represent.
the unhappy presidency of herbert hoover herbert hoover began his presidency in march 1929 believing like most americans that the nation faced a bright and prosperous future.
for the first six months of his republican administration he attempted to expand the policies he had advocated during his eight years as secretary of commerce policies that would he believed complete a stable system of cooperative individualism and sustain a successful economy.
the economic crisis that began before the year was out forced 656 chapter 23 the president to deal with a new set of problems but for most of the rest of his term he continued to rely on the principles that had always governed his public life.
the hoover program hoovers first response to the depression was to attempt to restore public confidence in the economy.
the fundamental business of this country that is production and distribution of commodities hoover said in 1930 is on a sound and prosper ous basis he then summoned leaders of failure of voluntarism business labor and agriculture to the white house and urged them to adopt a program of voluntary cooperation for recovery.
he implored businessmen not to cut production or lay off workers he talked labor leaders into forgoing demands for higher wages or better hours.
but by mid 1931 economic conditions had deteriorated so much that the modest structure of voluntary cooperation he had erected collapsed.
hoover also attempted to use government spending as a tool for fighting the depression.
the president proposed to congress an increase of 423 million a significant sum by the standards of the time in federal public works programs and he exhorted state and local governments to fund public construction.
but the spending was not nearly enough in the face of such devastating problems.
and when economic conditions worsened he became less willing to increase spending worrying instead about creating large government deficits.
in 1932 at the depth of the depression he proposed a tax increase to help the government avoid a deficit.
even before the stock market crash hoover had begun to construct a program to assist the already troubled agricultural economy.
in april 1929 he proposed the agricultural marketing act which established the first major government program to.
help farmers maintain prices.
a federally arrlcuttlirat r r j marketing sponsored farm board would make loans to act national marketing cooperatives or establish corporations to buy surpluses and thus raise prices.
at the same time hoover attempted to protect american farmers from international competition by raising agricultural tariffs.
the tariff act of 1930 also known as the smoot hawley tariff and the hawley smoot tariff increased protection on seventy five farm products.
but neither the agricultural marketing act nor the hawley smoot tariff ultimately helped american farmers significantly.
the tariff on the contrary harmed the agricultural economy by stifling exports of food.
by the spring of 1931 herbert hoovers political position had deteriorated considerably.
in the 1930 congressional elections democrats won control of the house and made substantial inroads in the senate by promising increased government assistance to the economy.
many americans held the president personally to blame for the crisis and began calling the shantytowns that unemployed people established on the outskirts of cities hoovervilles democrats urged the hoovers declining popularity hoover the patrician although herbert hoover grew up in a family of modest means in a small town in iowa his critics in the 1930s delighted in portraying him as an aloof aristocrat fond of fancy dinners and elegant surroundings.
as this formal portrait shows hoover gave his critics many opportunities to strengthen that image.
corbis president to support more vigorous programs of relief and public spending.
hoover continued to believe his policies were working.
the international financial panic of the spring of 1931 destroyed the illusion that the economic crisis was coming to an end.
throughout the 1920s european nations had depended on loans from american banks to allow them to make payments on their debts.
after 1929 when they could no longer get such loans the financial fabric of several european nations began to unravel.
in may 1931 one of the largest banks in austria collapsed.
over the next several months panic gripped the financial institutions of neighboring countries.
the american economy rapidly declined to new lows.
by the time congress convened in december 1931 conditions had grown so desperate that hoover supported a series of measures designed to keep endangered banks afloat and protect homeowners from foreclosure on their mortgages.
more important was a bill passed in january 1932 establishing the reconstruction finance corporation rfc reconstruction a government agency whose purpose was corpor on t0 provic e federal loans to troubled banks railroads and other businesses.

world history archive alamy made funds available to local governments to support public works projects and assist relief efforts.
unlike some earlier hoover programs it operated on a large scale.
in 1932 the rfc had a budget of 1 5 billion for public works alone.
nevertheless the new agency failed to deal directly or forcefully enough with the real problems of the economy to produce any significant recovery.
the rfc lent funds only to financial institutions with sufficient collateral much of its money went to large banks and corporations.
at hoovers insistence it helped finance only those public works projects that promised ultimately to pay for themselves toll bridges public housing and others.
above all the rfc did not have enough money to make any real impact on the depression and it did not even spend all the money it had.

of the 1 5 billion public works budget it released only about 20 percent.
popular protest for the first several years of the depression most americans were either too stunned or too confused to raise any effective protest.
by the middle of 1932 however dissident voices holiday association a more celebrated protest movement emerged from american veterans.
in 1924 congress had approved the payment of a 1 000 bonus to all those who had served in world war i the money to be paid beginning in 1945.
by 1932 however many veterans were demanding that the bonus be paid immediately.
hoover concerned about balancing the budget rejected their appeal.
in june more than 20 000 veterans members of the self proclaimed bonus expeditionary force or bonus army marched into washington built crude camps around the city and promised to stay until congress approved legislation to pay the bonus.
some of the veterans departed in july after congress voted down their proposal.
many however remained where they were.
their continued presence in washington disturbed president hoover.
finally in mid july he ordered police to clear the marchers out of several abandoned federal buildings in which they had been staying.
a few marchers threw rocks at the police and someone opened fire two veterans fell dead.
hoover considered the incident evidence of growing violence and radicalism and he ordered the u s army to assist the police in clearing out the buildings.
general douglas macarthur the army chief of staff carried out the mission himself with the assistance of his aide dwight d eisenhower and greatly exceeded the presidents orders.
he led the third cavalry under the com bonus army mand of georse s patton two infantry regiments a machine gun detachment and six tanks down pennsylvania avenue in pursuit of the bonus army.
the veterans fled in terror.
macarthur followed them across the anacostia river where he ordered the soldiers to burn their tent city to the ground.
more than 100 marchers were injured.

in the summer of 1932 a group of unhappy farm owners thered in des moines iowa to establish a new organization p the farmers holiday association which rmers endorsed the withholding of farm products from the market in effect a farmers strike.
the strike began in august in western iowa ead briefly to a few neighboring areas and succeeded in ckading several markets but in the end it dissolved in failure.
658 chapter 23 clearing out the bonus marchers in july 1932 president hoover ordered the washington d c police to evict the bonus marchers from some of the public buildings and land they had been occupying.
the result was a series of pitched battles one of them visible here in which both veterans and police sustained injuries.
such skirmishes persuaded hoover to call out the u s army to finish the eviction.
bettmann corbis the incident served as perhaps the final blow to hoovers already battered political standing.
hoovers own reserved personality reinforced the public image of him as aloof and unsympathetic to distressed people.
the great engineer the personification of the optimistic days of the 1920s had become a symbol of the nations failure to deal effectively with its startling reversal of fortune.
roosevelt had been a well known figure in the party for many years already.
a hudson valley aristocrat a distant cousin of theodore roosevelt a connection strengthened by his marriage in 1904 to the presidents niece eleanor and a handsome charming young man he progressed rapidly from a seat in the new york state legislature to a position as assistant secretary of the navy during world war i to his partys vice presidential nomination in 1920 on the ill fated ticket with james m cox.
less than a year later he was stricken with polio.
although he never regained use of his legs and eventually could appear to walk only by using crutches and braces he built up sufficient physical strength to return to politics in 1928.
when al smith received the democratic nomination for president that year roosevelt was elected to succeed him as governor of new york.
in 1930 he easily won reelection.
roosevelt worked no miracles in new york but he did initiate enough positive programs of government assistance to be able to present himself as a more energetic and imaginative leader than hoover.
in national politics he avoided such divisive cultural issues as religion and prohibition and emphasized the economic grievances that most democrats shared.
he was able as a result to assemble a broad coalition within the party and win his partys nomination.
in a dramatic break with tradition he flew to chicago to address the convention in person and accept the nomination.
in the course of his acceptance speech roosevelt aroused the delegates with his ringing promise i pledge you i pledge myself to a new deal for the american people giving his future program a name that would long endure.
neither then nor in the subsequent campaign did roosevelt give much indication of what that program would be.
but herbert hoovers unpopularity virtually ensured roosevelts election.
in november to the surprise of no one roosevelt won by a landslide.
he received 57 4 percent of the popular vote to 1932 election hoovers 39 7.
in the electoral college the result was even more overwhelming.
hoover carried delaware pennsylvania connecticut vermont new hampshire and maine.
roosevelt won everything else.
democrats won majorities in both houses of congress.
it was a broad and convincing mandate.
the interregnum the period between the election and the inauguration which in the early 1930s lasted more than four months was a season of growing economic crisis.
presidents elect traditionally do involve themselves directly in government.
but in a series o rittle exchanges with roosevelt in the months following the election hoover tried to exact from the president elect a p edge to maintain policies of economic orthodoxy.
roosevelt genially refused.
the election of 1932 as the 1932 presidential election approached few people doubted the outcome.
the republican party dutifully renominated herbert hoover for a second term of office but the fdr gloomy atmosphere of the convention made nominated c ear r at few delegates believed he could win.
the democrats in the meantime gath ered jubilantly in chicago to nominate the governor of new york franklin delano roosevelt.

the ride appeared uncomfortable for the outgoing president.
hoover seems glum and uncommunicative whereas roosevelt seems ready to take on his new responsibilities.
i bettmann corbis election of 1932 like the election of 1928 the election of 1932 was exceptionally one sided.
but this time the landslide favored the democratic candidate franklin roosevelt who overwhelmed herbert hoover in all regions of the country except new england.
roosevelt obviously benefited primarily from popular disillusionment with hoovers response to the great depression.
but what characteristics of roosevelt himself contributed to his victory.
in february only a month before the inauguration a new crisis developed when the collapse of the american banking system suddenly and rapidly accelerated.
public confidence in banking rhe banks was ebbing depositors were crisis withdrawing their money in panic and one bank after another was closing its doors and declaring bankruptcy.
hoover again asked roosevelt to give prompt public assurances that there would be no tinkering with the currency no heavy borrowing no unbalancing of the budget.
roosevelt again refused.
march 4 1933 was therefore a day of both economic crisis and considerable personal bitterness.
on that morning herbert hoover convinced that the united states was headed for disaster rode glumly down pennsylvania avenue with a beaming buoyant franklin roosevelt who would shortly be sworn in as the thirty second president of the united states.
looking back the great depression which began so unexpectedly and spread so quickly and widely changed many things in american hfe.
it created unemployment on a scale never before experienced in the nations history.
it put enormous pressures on families on communities on state and local governments and ultimately on washington which during the innovative but ultimately failed presidency of herbert hoover was unable to produce policies capable of dealing effectively with the crisis.
in the nations politics and culture the depression provoked strong currents of radicalism and protest and many middle class americans came to fear and many less affluent people to hope that a revolution might be approaching.
in reality while the great depression shook much of american society and culture it actually toppled very little.
the capitalist system survived damaged for a time but never truly threatened.
the widely shared values of materialism and personal responsibility were shaken but never overturned.
the american people in the 1930s were more receptive than 660 chapter 23 they had been in the 1920s to evocations of community generosity and the dignity of common people.
they were more open to experiments in government and business and even private lives than they had been in earlier years.
but for most americans belief in the american way of life a phrase that became widely resonant in the 1930s for the first time remained strong throughout the long years of economic despair.

what emergency measures did fdr take in his first hundred days as president.
2 who were the major critics of fdr s new deal and how did their criticisms influence fdr s second new deal.
what were the principal achievements of the second new deal in 1945.
setting the stage the administration of franklin roosevelt was in many ways the most politically successful presidency in american history roosevelt won four successive terms in office and his administration constructed a series of programs that permanently altered the shape of the federal government and its relationship to society by the end of the 1930s the new deal as the roosevelt program was called had created many of the broad outlines of the political world we know today.
it had created a powerful coalition within the democratic party that would dominate american politics for most of the next thirty years and it had produced the beginnings of a new liberal ideology that would govern reform efforts for decades.
one thing the new deal had not done however was end the great depression.
at the end of 1940 near the end of roosevelt s second term many of the basic problems of the depression remained unsolved.
the persistence of the depression created many challenges to the new deal.
dissident groups on both the right and the left some of them of considerable size and strength mobilized outside the conventional party system to promote alternative paths to recovery.
factions within the democratic party most notably southern conservatives turned against roosevelt s policies joined with republicans and helped create a conservative coalition in congress that frustrated many of his goals.
only the advent of world war ii in 1940 and 1941 succeeded in ending the great depression.
it also brought to a close most of the domestic initiatives of the new deal.
launching the new deal roosevelts first task upon taking office was to alleviate the panic that was threatening the financial system.
he did so in part by force of personality and in part by constructing very rapidly an ambitious and diverse program of legislation.
restoring confidence much of roosevelts success was a result of his ebullient personality.
in his inaugural address he assured the american people that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and promised to roosevelts take drastic even warlike action against the emergency.
he projected an infec personality tious optimism that helped alleviate the growing despair.
he was the first president to make regular use of the radio and his friendly fireside chats during which he explained his programs and plans to the people helped build public confidence in the administration.
roosevelt held frequent informal press conferences and won the respect and friendship of most reporters.
their regard for him was such that by unwritten agreement no journalist ever photographed the president getting into or out of his car or sitting in his wheelchair.
much of the american public remained unaware throughout the roosevelt years that the presidents legs were completely paralyzed.
but roosevelt could not rely on image alone.
on march 6 1933 two days after taking office he issued a proclamation closing all american banks for four days until congress could meet in special session to consider banking reform legislation.
so great was the panic about bank failures that the bank holiday as the president euphemistically described it created a general sense of relief.
three bank days later roosevelt sent to congress the emergency banking act a generally holiday conservative bill much of it drafted by hoover administration holdovers designed primarily to protect the larger banks from being dragged down by the weakness of smaller ones.
the bill provided for treasury department inspection of all banks before they would be allowed to reopen for federal assistance to some troubled institutions and for a thorough reorganization of those in the greatest difficulty.
a confused and frightened congress passed the bill within four hours of its introduction.
i can assure you roosevelt told the public on march i2 in his first fireside chat that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.
whatever else the new law accomplished it helped dispel the panic three quarters of the banks in the federal reserve system reopened within the next three days and billion in 662 the new deal 663 the radio president franklin d roosevelt was the first american president to master the use of radio.
beginning in his first days in office he regularly bypassed the newspapers and communicated directly with the people through his famous fireside chats.
he is shown here speaking in 1938 urging communities to continue to provide work relief for the unemployed.
l bettmann corbis hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month.
the immediate banking crisis was over.
on the morning after passage of the emergency banking act roosevelt sent to congress another measure the economy act designed to convince fiscally conservative americans especially the business community that the federal government was in safe responsible hands.
the act proposed to balance the federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and reducing pensions to veterans by as much as 15 percent.
otherwise the president warned the nation faced a 1 billion budget deficit.
like the banking bill this one passed congress almost instantly despite heated protests from some congressional progressives.
roosevelt also moved in his first days in office to put to rest one of the divisive issues of the 1920s.
he supported and then signed a bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer with r a 3 2 percent alcohol content an interim repealed measure pending the repeal of prohibition for which a constitutional amendment the twenty first was already in process.
the amendment was ratified later in 1933.
agricultural adjustment these initial actions were largely stopgaps to buy time for comprehensive programs.
the first of them was the agricultural adjustment act which congress passed in may 1933.
its most important feature was its provision for reducing crop production to end agricultural surpluses and halt the downward spiral of farm prices.
under the provisions of the act producers of seven basic commodities wheat cotton corn hogs rice tobacco and dairy products would decide on production limits for their crops.
aaa the government through the agricultural adjustment administration aaa would then tell individual farmers how much they should produce and would pay them subsidies for leaving some of their land idle.
a tax on food processing for example the milling of wheat would provide the funds for the new payments.
farm prices would be subsidized up to the point of parity.
the aaa helped bring about a rise in prices for farm commodities in the years after 1933.
gross farm income increased by half in the first three years of the new deal and the agricultural economy emerged from the 1930s much more stable and prosperous than it had been in many years.
the aaa did however favor larger farmers over smaller ones particularly since local administration of its programs often fell into the hands of the most powerful producers in a community.
by distributing payments to landowners not those who worked the land the government did little to discourage planters who were reducing their acreage from evicting tenants and sharecroppers and firing field hands.
in january 1936 the supreme court struck down the crucial provisions of the agricultural adjustment act arguing that the government had no constitutional authority to require farmers to limit production.
but within a few weeks the administration had secured passage of new legislation the soil conservation and domestic allotment act which permitted the government to pay farmers to reduce production so as to conserve soil prevent erosion and accomplish other secondary goals.
the court did not interfere with the new laws.
the administration launched several efforts to assist poor farmers as well.
the resettlement administration established in 1935 and its successor the farm security administration created in 1937 provided loans to help farmers cultivating submarginal soil to relocate to better lands.
but the programs never moved more than a few thousand farmers.
more effective was the rural electrification administration created in 1935 which worked to make electric power available for the first time to thousands of farmers through utility cooperatives.
industrial recovery ever since 1931 leaders of the u s chamber of commerce and many others had been urging the government to adopt an antideflation scheme that would permit trade associations to cooperate in stabilizing prices within their industries.
existing antitrust laws clearly forbade such practices and herbert hoover had refused to endorse suspension of the laws.
the roosevelt administration was more receptive.
in exchange for relaxing antitrust provisions however new dealers insisted on other provisions.
business leaders would have to make important concessions to labor recognize the workers right to bargain collectively through unions to ensure that the incomes of workers would rise along with prices.
and to help create jobs and increase consumer buying power the administration added a major program of public works spending.
the result of these and many other impulses rural electrification banking crises when franklin delano roosevelt took office as president in 1933 the u s banking system was close to collapse.
as depositors panicked by the worsening depression withdrew their savings from the banks bank after bank was forced to close.
to prevent a complete collapse of the banking system fdr first declared a bank holiday calling for the closing of all banks and then called congress into special session to pass banking reform legislation the emergency banking act.
in his first fireside chat on march 12 1933 excerpted in the first source document below the president sought to explain to the public the actions he and congress had undertaken and to reassure his listeners that their money would be safe in banks.
some seventy five years after the great depression of the 1930s the nation once again experienced a serious financial crisis in the great recession of 2007 2010.
once again congress passed banking reform legislation calling for closer regulation of banks and providing greater protections for consumers.
in his address of july 21 2010 president barack obama outlined the provisions of the new legislation and sought to reassure the public.
excerpts from this address comprise the second source in this feature.
the great depression 1933 franklin delano roosevelt the banking crisis first fireside chat first of all let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit vault.
it invests your money in many different forms of credit in bonds in commercial paper in mortgages and in many other kinds of loans.
in other words the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning around.
what then happened during the last few days of february and the first few days of march.
because of undermined confidence on the part of the public there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold a rush so great that the soundest banks couldn t get enough currency to meet the demand.
by the afternoon of march third a week ago last friday scarcely a bank in the country was open to do business.
proclamations closing them in whole or in part had been issued by the governors in almost all the states.
it was then that i issued the proclamation providing for the national bank holiday and this was the first step in the governments reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric.
the second step last thursday was the legislation promptly and patriotically passed by the congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers so that it became possible in view of the requirement of time to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually in the days to come.
this law also gave authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of our banking facilities.
the new law allows the twelve federal reserve banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call.
it is necessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period of several days in order to permit the banks to make applications for the necessary loans to obtain currency needed to meet their requirements and to enable the government to make common sense checkups we have had a bad banking situation.
some of our bankers had shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the peoples funds.
they had used the money entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans this was of course not true in the vast majority of our banks but it was true in enough of them to shock the people of the united states for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put them into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate but seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted them all and i t j.
u oecame the governments iob to straighten out this situation and do it as quickly as possible.
and that job is being performed 664 ere is n ement m t e rea justment of our financial system more important than currency more important than g an 1 3 js 1 6 c ence people themselves.
confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our p an.

barack obama signing of dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act over the past two years we have faced the worst recession since the great depression.
eight million people lost their jobs.
tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet.
countless businesses have been unable to get the loans they need and many have been forced to shut their doors.
and although the economy is growing again too many people are still feeling the pain of the downturn.
now while a number of factors led to such a severe recession the primary cause was a breakdown in our financial system.
it was a crisis born of a failure of responsibility from certain corners of wall street to the halls of power in washington.
for years our financial sector was governed by antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the system and take risks that endangered the entire economy.
unscrupulous lenders locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs.
firms like aig placed massive risky bets with borrowed money.
and while the rules left abuse and excess unchecked they also left taxpayers on the hook if a big bank or financial institution ever failed.
now lets put this in perspective.
the fact is the financial industry is central to our nations ability to grow to prosper to compete and to innovate.
there are a lot of banks that understand and fulfill this vital role and there are a whole lot of bankers who want to do right and do right by their customers.
this reform will help foster innovation not hamper it.
it is designed to make sure that everybody follows the same set of rules so that firms compete on price and quality not on tricks and not on traps rjeform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system.
it will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis.
shareholders will also have a greater say on the pay of ceos and other executives so they can reward success instead of failure.
and finally because of this law the american people will never again be asked to foot the bill for wall streets mistakes.
there will be no more tax funded bailouts period.
if a large financial institution should ever fail this reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy.
and there will be new rules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is too big to fail.
the fact is every american from main street to wall street has a stake in our financial system.
wall street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it possible for start ups to sell new products.
they provide loans to businesses to expand and to hire.
they back mortgages for families purchasing a new home.
thats why well all stand to gain from these reforms.
we all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets.
we all win when shareholders have more power and more information.
we all win when consumers are protected against abuse.
and we all win when folks are rewarded based on how well they perform not how well they evade accountability.

they were powered by vacuum tubes that were much more reliable than earlier models.

commercial aviation developed slowly in the 1920s beginning with the use of planes to deliver mail.
on the whole airplanes remained curiosities and sources of entertainment.
but technological advances the development of the radial engine and the creation of pressurized cabins were laying the groundwork for the great increase in commercial travel in the 1930s and beyond.
trains became faster and more efficient as well with the development of the diesel electric engine.
electronics home appliances plastics and synthetic fibers such as nylon both pioneered by researchers at du pont aluminum magnesium oil electric power and other industries fueled by technological advances all grew and spurred the economic boom.
telephones continued to proliferate.
by the late 1930s there were approximately 25 million telephones in the united states approximately one for every six people.
the seeds of future technologies were also visible in the 1920s and 1930s.
in both england and america scientists and engineers were working to transform primitive calculating early machines into devices capable of perform computers ing more complicated tasks.
by the early 1930s researchers at mit led by vannevar bush had created an instrument capable of performing a variety of complicated tasks the first analog computer which became the starting point for dramatic progress over the next several decades.
a few years later howard aiken with financial assistance from harvard and mit built a much more complex computer with memory capable of multiplying eleven digit numbers in three seconds.
genetic research had begun in austria in the mid nineteenth century through the work of gregor mendel a catholic monk who performed experiments on the hybridization of vegetables in the garden of his monastery.
his findings attracted little attention during his lifetime but in the early twentieth century they were discovered by several investigators and helped shape modern genetic research.
among the american pioneers was thomas hunt morgan of columbia university and later cal tech whose experiments with fruit flies revealed how several genes could be transmitted together as opposed to mendels belief that they could only be transferred separately.
morgan also revealed the way in which genes were arranged along the chromosome.
his work helped open the path to understanding how genes could recombine a critical discovery that led to advanced experiments in hybridization and genetics.
economic organization large sectors of american business were accelerating their drive toward national organization and consolidation.
certain industries notably those such as steel dependent on large scale mass production seemed naturally to move toward concentrating production in a few large firms u s steel the nations largest corporation was so dominant that almost everyone used the term little steel to refer to all of its competitors combined.
other industries such as textiles that were less dependent on technology and less susceptible to great economies of scale proved more resistant to consolidation despite the efforts of many businessmen to promote it.
in those areas where industry did consolidate new forms of corporate organization emerged to advance the trend.
general modern motors by 1920 not only the largest auto administrative mobile manufacturer but also the systems fifth largest american corporation was a classic example.
gms founder william durant had expanded the company dramatically but had never replaced the informal personal management style with which he began.
when gm foundered in the recession of the early 1920s leadership of the company fell to alfred p sloan who created a modern administrative system with an efficient the new era 617 divisional organization.
the new system not only made it easier for gm to control its many subsidiaries it also made it simpler for it and for the many other corporations that adopted similar administrative systems to expand further.
some industries less susceptible to domination by a few great corporations attempted to stabilize themselves not trade through consolidation but through cooper associations ation.
an important vehicle was the trade association a national organization created by various members of an industry to encourage coordination in production and marketing techniques.
trade associations worked reasonably well in the mass production industries that had already succeeded in limiting competition through consolidation.
but in more decentralized industries such as cotton textiles their effectiveness was limited.
the strenuous efforts by industrialists throughout the economy to find ways to curb competition through consolidation or cooperation reflected a strong fear of overproduction.
even in the booming mid 1920s industrialists remembered how too rapid expansion had helped produce recessions in 1893 1907 and 1920.
the great unrealized dream of the new era was to find a way to stabilize the economy so that such collapses would never occur again.
labor in the new era the remarkable economic growth was accompanied by a continuing and in some areas even increasing maldistribution of wealth and purchasing power.
more than two thirds of the american people in 1929 lived at no better than what one major study described as the minimum comfort level half of those languished at or below the level of subsistence and poverty american industrial workers experienced both the successes and the failures of the 1920s as much as any other group.
on the one hand most workers saw their standard of living rise during the decade many enjoyed greatly improved working conditions and other benefits.
some employers in the 1920s eager to avoid disruptive labor unrest and the growth of independent trade unions adopted paternalistic techniques that came to be known as welfare capitalism henry ford for welfare example shortened the workweek raised capitalism wages and instituted paid vacations.
u s steel made conspicuous efforts to improve safety and sanitation in its factories.
for the first time some workers became eligible for pensions on retirement nearly 3 million by 1926.
women workers in such companies tended to receive other kinds of benefits less often pensions more often longer rest periods and vacations.
when labor grievances surfaced despite these efforts workers could voice them through the so called company unions that were emerging in many industries.
these were workers councils and shop committees organized by the corporations themselves and thus without the independence later unions demanded.
welfare capitalism brought many workers important eco nomic benefits but it did not help them gain any real control over their own fates.
company unions were feeble vehicles forbidden in most industries to raise the issues most important to workers.
and welfare capitalism survived only as long as industry prospered.
after 1929 with the economy in crisis the system quickly collapsed.
welfare capitalism affected only a relatively small number of workers in any case.
most employers were interested primarily in keeping their labor costs to a minimum.
workers as a whole therefore received wage increases at a rate far below increases in production and profits.
unskilled workers in particular saw their wages increase by only a little over 2 percent between 1920 and 1926.
in the end american workers in the 1920s remained a relatively impoverished and powerless group.
their wages rose but the average annual income of a worker remained below 1 500 a year when 1 800 was considered necessary to maintain a minimally decent standard of living.
only by relying on the earnings of several family members could many working class families make ends meet.
and almost all such families had to live with the very real possibility of one or more members losing their jobs.
unemployment was lower in the 1920s than it had been in the previous two decades and much lower than it would be in the 1930s.
but a large proportion of the workforce estimated at 5 7 percent at any given time was out of work for at least some period during the decade in part because the rapid growth of industrial technology made many jobs obsolete.
many laborers continued to regard an effective independent union movement as their best hope.
but the new era was a bleak time for labor organization in part because the unions themselves were generally conservative and failed to adapt to the realities of the modern economy.
the american federation t r of labor afl remained committed to the for organized concept of the craft union in which labor workers were organized on the basis of par ticular skills.
it continued to make no provision for the fastest growing area of the workforce unskilled industrial workers who had few organizations of their own.
william green who became president of the afl in 1924 was committed to peaceful cooperation with employers and to strident opposition to communism and socialism.
he frowned on strikes.
women ano minorities in the workforce a growing proportion of the workforce consisted of women who were concentrated in what have since become known as pink collar pink collar jobs low paying service occu jobs pations with many of the same problems as manufacturing employment.
large numbers of women worked as secretaries salesclerks telephone operators and in other similarly underpaid jobs.
because technically such positions were not industrial jobs the afl and other labor organizations were generally uninterested in orga nizing these workers.
similarly the half million african americans who had migrated from the rural south to the cities during the great scottish born inventor and scientist alexander communications technology craham bell received a patent for his invention of the telephone on march 7 1876.

by the turn of the century there were more than 5 million phones in the united states.
as the map below shows in 1914 telephone exchanges linked more than 70 000 places and 8 million subscribers in the united states.
the telephone served as the basic communication link in the united states for over 100 years.
every dot on the map marks a town where there is a telephone exchange the same sized dot being used for a large city as for a small village.
some of these exchanges are owned by the associated bell companies and some by independent companies where joined together in one system they meet the needs of each community and with their suburban lines reach 70 000 places and over 8 000 000 subscribers.
the pyramids show that only a minority of the exchanges are bell owned and that the greater majority of the exchanges are owned by independent companies and connected with the bell system.
at comparatively few points are there two telephone companies and there are comparatively few exchanges chiefly rural which do not have outside connections.
the recent agreement between the attorney general of the united states and the bell system will facilitate connections between all telephone subscribers regardless of who owns the exchanges.
over 8 000 different telephone companies have already connected their exchanges to provide universal service for the whole country.

the text accompanying the map explains that the same sized dots are used for large cities as for small villages.
would the use of different sized dots to indicate larger cities or smaller towns make the map more representative of u s telephone usage in 1914.

the a philip randolph migration after 1914 had few opportunities for union repre skilled crafts represented in the afl often worked actively to exclude blacks from their trades and organizations.
most blacks worked in jobs in which the afl took no interest as janitors dishwashers garbage collectors commercial laundry attendants and domestics and in other types of service jobs.
this general reluctance to organize service sector workers was in part because afl leaders did not want women and minorities to become union members.
the brotherhood of sleeping car porters founded in 1925 and led for years by a philip randolph was a notable exception a vigorous union led by an african american and representing a virtually allblack workforce.
over time randolph won some significant gains for his members increased wages shorter working hours and other benefits.
he also enlisted the union in battles for civil rights for african americans.
in the west and the southwest the ranks of unskilled workers included considerable numbers of asians and hispanics few of them organized most of them actively excluded from white dominated unions.
in the wake of the chinese exclusion acts of the late nineteenth century japanese immigrants increasingly took the place of the chinese in menial jobs in california despite the continuing hostility of the white population.
they worked on railroads construction sites and farms and in many other low paying workplaces.
some japanese managed to escape the ranks of the unskilled by forming their own small businesses or setting themselves up as truck farmers farmers who grow small food crops for local sale.
many of the issei japanese immigrants and nisei their american born children enjoyed significant economic success so much so that california passed laws in 1913 and 1920 to make it more difficult for them to buy land.
other asians most notably filipinos also swelled the unskilled workforce and generated considerable hostility.
anti filipino riots in california beginning in 1929 helped produce legislation in 1934 virtually eliminating immigration from the philippines.
mexican immigrants formed a major part of the unskilled workforce throughout the southwest and california.
nearly half a million mexicans entered the united states in the 1920s more than any other national group increasing the total mexican population to over a million.

large m cxica n bjrrios usually raw urban communities often without even such basic services as plumbing and sewage grew up in los angeles el paso san antonio denver and many other cities and towns.
some of the residents found work locally in factories and shops others traveled to mines or did migratory labor on farms but returned to the cities between jobs.
mexican workers too faced hostility and discrimination from the anglo population of the region but there were few efforts actually to exclude them.
employers in the relatively underpopulated west needed this ready pool of low paid unskilled and unorganized workers.
the american plan whatever the weaknesses of the unions and of unorganized unskilled workers the strength of the corporations was the principal reason for the absence of effective protecting a r n the open labor organization.
after the turmoil of shop 1919 corporate leaders worked hard to spread the doctrine that unionism was somehow subversive that a crucial element of democratic capitalism was the protection of the open shop a shop in which no worker could be required to join a union.
the crusade for the open shop euphemistically titled the american plan received the endorsement of the national association of manufacturers in 1920 and became a pretext for a harsh campaign of union busting across the country.
when such tactics proved insufficient to counter union power government assistance often made the difference.
in 1921 the supreme court upheld a lower court ruling that declared picketing illegal and supported the right of courts to issue injunctions against strikers.
in 1922 the justice department intervened to quell a strike by 400 000 railroad workers.
in 1924 the courts refused protection to members of the united mine workers union when mine owners launched a violent campaign in western pennsylvania to drive the union from the coal fields.
as a result of these developments union membership fell from more than 5 million in 1920 to under 3 million in 1929.

622 chapter 22 mechanized of tractors on american farms for example farming quadrupled during the 1920s especially after they began to be powered by internal combustion engines like automobiles rather than by the cumbersome steam engines of the past.
they helped to open 35 million new acres to cultivation.
increasingly sophisticated combines and harvesters were proliferating helping make it possible to produce more crops with fewer workers.
agricultural researchers were already at work on other advances that would later transform food production in america and around the world the invention of hybrid corn made possible by advances in genetic research which became available to farmers in 1921 but was not grown in great quantities until the 1930s and the creation of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which also began to have limited use in the 1920s but proliferated quickly in the 1930s and 1940s.
the new technologies greatly increased agricultural productivity both in the united states and in other parts of the world.
but the demand for agricultural goods was not rising as fast as production.
the results were substantial surpluses a disastrous decline in food prices and a severe drop in farmers income beginning early in the 1920s.
more than 3 million people left agriculture in the course of the decade.
of those who remained many lost ownership of their lands and had to rent instead from banks or other landlords.
in response some farmers began to demand relief in the form of government price supports.
one price raising scheme parity in particu ar came to dominate agrarian demands the idea of parity parity was a complicated formula for setting an adequate price for farm goods and ensuring that farmers would earn back at least their production costs no matter how the national or world agricultural market might fluctuate.
champions of parity urged high tariffs against foreign agricultural goods and a government commitment to buy surplus domestic crops at parity and sell them abroad at whatever the market would bring.
the legislative expression of the demand for parity was the mcnary haugen bill named after its two principal sponsors in mcnary haugen conress and introduced repeatedly bill between 1924 and 1928.
in 1926 and again in 1928 congress where farm interests enjoyed disproportionate influence approved a bill requiring parity for grain cotton tobacco and rice but president coolidge vetoed it both times.
the new culture the increasingly urban and consumer oriented culture of the 1920s helped many americans in all regions live their lives and perceive their world in increasingly similar ways.
that same culture exposed them to a new set of values that reflected the prosperity and complexity of the modern economy.
but the new culture could not of course erase the continuing and indeed increasing diversity of the united states.
consumerism growing mass consumption among the many changes industrialization produced in the united states was the creation of a mass consumer culture.
by the 1920s america was a society in which many men and women could afford not merely the means of subsistence but a considerable measure of additional discretionary goods and services a society in which people could buy items not just because of need but for pleasure as well.
middle class families purchased such new appliances as electric refrigerators washing machines electric irons and vacuum cleaners which revolutionized housework and had a particularly dramatic impact on the lives of women.
men and women wore wristwatches and smoked cigarettes.
women purchased cosmetics and mass produced fashions.
above all americans bought automobiles.
by the end of the decade there were more than 30 million cars on american roads.
the automobile affected american life in countless ways.
it greatly expanded the geographic horizons of millions of people who in the past had seldom ventured far from their homes.
rural men and women in particular found in the automobile a means of escaping the isola tion of farm life now they could visit friends or drive into town quickly and at will rather than spending hours traveling by horse or foot.
city dwellers found in the automobile an escape from the congestion of urban life.
weekend drives through the countryside became a staple of urban leisure.
many families escaped the city in a permanent sense by social impact of the automobile moving to the new suburbs that were rapidly growing up around large cities in response to the ease of access the automobile had created.
the automobile also transformed the idea of vacations.
in the past the idea of traveling for pleasure had been a luxury reserved for the wealthy.
now many middle class and even working class people could aspire to travel considerable distances for vacations which were a new concept for most men and women in this era.
many businesses and industries began to include paid vacations among their employee benefits and many employers encouraged their vacationing workers to travel on the assumption that a change of scene would help restore their energy and vigor at work.
for young people in families affluent enough to afford a car the automobile was often a means of a different kind of escape.
it allowed them to move easily away from parents and family an to develop social lives of their own.
it contributed to one o the distinctive developments of the early twentieth cen turyj t 6 emer ence f a well developed and relatively independent youth culture.

note too the significant network of paved roads in the region by 1930 few of which had existed in 1900.
why did automobile travel do so much more than railroads to expand the travel horizons of small towns.
walter thompson had appeared well before world war i but in the 1920s partly as a result of techniques pioneered by wartime propaganda advertising came of age.
publicists no longer simply conveyed information they sought to identify products with a particular lifestyle to invest them with glamour and prestige and to persuade potential consumers that purchasing a commodity could be a personally fulfilling and enriching experience.
advertisers also encouraged the public to absorb the val ues of promotion and salesmanship and to admire those who were effective boosters and publicists.
one of the most the man successful books of the 1920s was the nobody an nobody knows by advertising execu zcvovvs tive bruce barton.
it portrayed jesus christ as not only a religious prophet but also a super salesman who picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organization that conquered the world the parables barton claimed were the most powerful advertisements of all time bartons message was fully in tune with the new spirit of the consumer culture.
jesus had been a man concerned with living a full and rewarding life in this world twentieth century men and women should do the same.
life is meant to live and enjoy as you go along barton once wrote.
jesus had succeeded because he knew how to make friends to become popular to please others that talent was a prescription for success in the modern era as well.
the advertising industry could never have had the impact it did without the emergence of new vehicles of communication that made it possible to reach large audiences quickly and easily.
newspapers were being absorbed into national chains and wire services were making it possible even for independent newspapers to carry nationally syndicated material.
new or expanded mass circulation magazines also attracted broad national audiences.
the saturday evening post which began publication as a magazine in 1871 appealed to rural and small town families with its homey stories and its conspicuous traditionalism its popularity was in some respects evidence of a yearning for an earlier time.
but other magazines responded directly to the realities of modern urban life.
the readers digest founded in 1921 by dewitt and lila wallace condensed stories and even books originally published in other places in an effort to make the expanding world of knowledge and information available in a brief efficient form for people who would otherwise have no access to it.
time magazine founded in 1923 by henry luce and briton hadden set out to condense the news of the week into a brief accessible lively format for busy people who did not have the time or desire to read newspapers.
mass circulation magazines hollywood the movies and broadcasting at the same time movies were becoming an ever more popular and powerful form of mass communication.
more than 100 million people saw films in 1930 as compared to 40 million in 1922.
the addition of sound to motion pictures beginning in 1927 with the first feature length talkie the jazz singer with al jolson created nationwide excitement.
an embarrassing scandal in 1921 involving the popular comedian fatty arbuckle produced public outrage and political pressure to clean up hollywood.
in response the film industry introduced standards to its films.
studio owners created the motion picture association a new trade association and hired former postmaster general will hays to head it.
more important they gave hays broad 624 chapter 22 powers to review films and to ban anything likely to offend viewers or politicians.
hays exercised his powers broadly and imposed on the film industry a safe sanctimonious conformity for many years.
the most important communications vehicle was the only one truly new to the 1920s radio.
the first commercial radio station in america kdka in pittsburgh began broadcasting in 1920 and the first national radio network the national broadcasting company was formed in 1927.
by 1923 there were more than 500 radio stations covering every area of the country.
the radio industry too feared government regulation and control and thus monitored program content carefully and excluded controversial or provocative material.
but radio was much less centralized than filmmaking.
individual stations had considerable autonomy and even carefully monitored stations and networks could not control the countless hours of programming as effectively as the hays office could control films.
radio programming therefore was more diverse and at times more controversial and even subversive than film.
modernist religion the influence of the consumer culture and its increasing emphasis on immediate personal fulfillment was visible even in religion.
theological modernists taught their followers to abandon some of the traditional tenets of evangelical christianity literal interpretation of the bible belief in the radio news in the early 1920s when radio was still new many people considered it a hobby appropriate to people interested in technology.
by the end of the decade radio was a normal part of the everyday lives of almost everyone.
radio news started off in 1919 as a magazine for amateur radio enthusiasts.
by the time of its last issue in 1971 the magazine had expanded to cover all technical aspects of radio and electronics.
buyenlarge superstock trinity attribution of human traits to the deity and to accept a faith that would help individuals to live more fulfilling lives in the present world.
the most influential spokesman for liberal protestantism in the 1920s was harry emerson fosdick the pastor of riverside church in new york city.
the basis of christian religion he claimed was not unexamined faith but a harry fu developed personality.
in his 1926 bmerson j fosdick book abundant religion he argued that itual dynamic for radiant and triumphant living most americans even most middle class americans stopped well short of this view of religion as a vehicle for advancing mans abundant life and remained faithful to traditional religious messages.
but many other middle class americans were gradually devaluing religion assigning it a secondary role or at times no role in their lives.
when the sociologists robert and helen merrell lynd studied the society of muncie indiana in the mid 1920s they were struck by how many people there claimed that they paid less attention to religion than their parents had.
they no longer devoted much time to teaching their children the tenets of their faith they seldom prayed at home or attended church on any day but sunday.
even the sabbath was becoming not a day of rest and religious reflection but rather a holiday filled with activities and entertainments.
professional women in the 1920s college educated women were no longer pioneers.
there were now two and even three generations of graduates of womens or coeducational colleges and universities many such women were making their presence felt in professional areas that in the past they had rarely penetrated.
still professional opportunities for women remained limited by prevailing assumptions prevalent among many women vvvtt dd limited opportunities for women iiivny ciuuui wild i wcic female occupations.
although there were notable success stories about female business executives journalists doctors and lawyers most professional women remained confined to such traditionally feminine fields as fashion education social work and nursing or to the lower levels of business management.
some middle class women now combined marriage and careers but most still had to choose between work and family.
the majority of the 25 percent of married women who worked outside the home in the 1920s were working class.
the new professional woman was a vivid and widely publicized image in the 1920s.
in reality however most middle class married women did not work outside the home.
changing ideas of motherhood yet the 1920s constituted a new era for middle class women net eless.
in particular the decade saw a redefinition of the idea of motherhood.
shortly after world war 1 an influential group of psychologists the behaviorists led by john b watson began to the new era 625 challenge the long held assumption that women had an instinctive capacity for motherhood.
maternal affection was not they claimed sufficient preparation for child rearing.
instead mothers should rely on the advice and assistance of experts and professionals doctors nurses and trained educators in nursery schools and kindergartens.
for many middle class women these changes helped redefine what had been an all consuming activity.
motherhood was no less important in behaviorist theory than it had been before if anything it was more so.
but for many women it was companionate less emotionally fulfilling less connected marriages t0 r eir instinctive lives more dependent on and tied to people and institutions outside the family.
many attempted to compensate by devoting new attention to their roles as wives and companions to developing what became known as companionate marriage the middle class wife shared increasingly in her husbands social life she devoted more attention to cosmetics and clothing she was less willing to allow children to interfere with their marriage.
most of all many more women considered their sexual relationships with their husbands not simply as a means of procreation as earlier generations had been taught to do but as an important and pleasurable experience in its own right as the culmination of romantic love.
progress in the development of birth control was both a cause and a result of this change.
the pioneer of the american birth control movement was margaret sanger who had become committed to the cause in part because of the influence of emma goldman a russian immigrant and political radical who had agitated for birth control before world war i sanger began birth her career promoting the diaphragm and control other birth control devices out of a concern for working class women believing that large families were among the major causes of poverty and distress in poor communities.
by the 1920s partly because she had limited success in persuading working class women to accept her teachings she was becoming more concerned with persuading middle class women of the benefits of birth control.
women she argued should be free to enjoy the pleasures of sexual activity without any connection to procreation.
birth control devices began to find a large market among middle class women even though some techniques remained illegal in many states and abortion remained illegal nearly everywhere.
the flapper image and reality the new more secular view of womanhood had effects on women beyond the middle class as well.
some women concluded that in the new era it was no longer necessary to maintain a rigid victorian female respectability women could smoke drink dance wear seductive clothes and makeup and attend lively parties.
they could strive for physical and emotional fulfillment for release from repression and inhibition.
the wide popularity of freudian ideas in the 1920s often simplified and distorted for mass consumption contributed to the growth of these attitudes.
flapper by the mid 1920s the flapper the young woman whoj toettmann corby is shown posing in the latest beach costume a fashion a long way 9 rn t t t j t tj is probably no cultural or commercial product more closely identified with the 1 ii u il jej united states than motion pictures or as they are known in much of the world the cinema although the technology of cinema emerged from the work of inventors in england and france as well as the united states the production and distribution of films has been dominated by americans almost from the start.
the united states was the first nation to create a film industry and it did so at a scale vaster than that of any other country the 700 feature films a year that hollywood produced in the 1920s was more than ten times the number created by any other nation and its films were dominating not only the vast american market but much of the world s market as well.
seventy percent of the films seen in france 80 percent of those seen in latin america and 95 percent of the movies viewed in canada and great britain were produced in the united states in the 1920s.
as early as the 1930s the penetration of other nations by american movies was already troubling many governments.
the soviet union responded to the popularity of walt disney s mickey mouse cartoons by inventing a cartoon hero of its own a porcupine designed to entertain in a way consistent with socialist values and not the capitalist ones that the soviets believed hollywood conveyed.
during world war ii american films were banned in occupied france prompting some antifascist dissidents to screen such american films as frank capra s mr smith goes to washington in protest.
american dominance was a result in part of world war i and its aftermath which debilitated european filmmaking just as movies were vigorously growing in the united states.
by the end of world war i half the theaters of the world were in america.
two decades later despite an extraordinary expansion of theaters in other nations the united states continued to have over 40 percent of the world s cinemas.
and while the spread of theaters through other areas of the world helped launch film industries in many other countries it also increased the market and the appetite for american films and strengthened american supremacy in their production.
the sun it now appears the saturday evening post commented in the mid 1920s never sets on the british empire and the american motion picture.
movies were then and perhaps remain still america s most influential cultural export.
even american popular music which has enormous global reach faces more significant local competition than american movies do in most parts of the world.
despite this american dominance however filmmaking has flourished and continues to flourish in many countries around the world.
india s fabled bollywood for example produces an enormous number of movies for its domestic market almost as many as the american industry creates even rudolph ui ii o the son ot the sheik u i i m b k ft.

r valentino the popularity of the film star rudolph valentino among american women was one of the most striking cultural phenomena of the 1920s.
valentino was slight and delicate not at all like the conventional image of manliness but he developed an enormous following among women in part as this poster is obviously intended to suggest by baring his body on screen.
valentino was italian which made him seem somehow strange and foreign to many older stock americans and he was almost always cast in exotic roles never as an american.
his sudden death in 1926 at the age of 31 created enormous outpourings of grief among many american women.
ua photofest such assumptions became the basis of the wflapper the modern woman whose liberated lifestyle found expression in dress hairstyle speech and behavior.
the flapper lifestyle had a particular impact on lower middle class and working class single women who were flocking to new jobs in industry and the service sector.
the young affluent upper class bohemian women most often associated with the flapper image were in fact imitating a style that emerged first among this larger working class group.
at night such women flocked often alone to clubs and dance halls in search of excitement and companionship.
despite the image of liberation the flapper evoked in popular culture most women remained highly dependent on men both in the workplace where they were usually poorly paid and in the home and relatively powerless when men exploited that dependence.
pressing for womens rights the realization that the new woman was as much myth as reality inspired some american feminists to continue their crusade for reform.
the national womans party under the leadership of alice paul pressed on with its campaign to make the equal rights amendment first proposed in 1923 a part of the constitution although it found little equal rights support in congress and met continued amendment resistance from other feminist groups.
nevertheless womens organizations and emale political activities grew in many ways in the 1920s.
responding to the suffrage victory women organized the league of women voters and the womens auxiliaries of both the democratic and republican parties.
female dominated 626 the new era 627 though few of them are widely exported.
the global cinema has had a significant impact on american filmmaking just as american films have influenced filmmakers abroad.
the small british film industry had a strong early influence on american movies partly because of the quality and originality of british films and partly because of the emigration of talented actors directors and screenwriters to the united states.
the great alfred hitchcock for example made his first films in london before moving to hollywood where he spent the rest of his long career.
after world war ii french new wave cinema helped spawn a new generation of highly individualistic directors in the united states.
asian cinema especially the thriving film industry in hong kong with its gritty realism helped lead to some of the powerfully violent american films of the 1980s and beyond as well as the genre of martial arts films that has become popular around the world.
german italian swedish dutch japanese australian and indian filmmakers also had influence on hollywood and over time perhaps even greater influence on the large and growing independent film movement in the united states.
in recent decades as new technologies and new styles have transformed films around the world the american movie industry has continued to dominate global cinema.
but national boundaries no longer adequately describe moviemaking in the twenty first century.
it is becoming a truly globalized enterprise in the same way that so many other commercial ventures are becoming international.
american films today are often produced abroad often have non american directors and actors and are often paid for with international financing.
hollywood still dominates worldwide filmmaking but hollywood itself is now an increasingly global community.

in 1929 congress terminated the program.
education and youth the growing secularism of american culture and its expanding emphasis on training and expertise found reflection in the increasingly important role of education in the lives of american youth.
first more people were going to school in the 1920s than ever before.
high school attendance more than doubled during the decade from 2 2 million to more than 5 million.
enrollment in colleges and universities increased threefold between 1900 and 1930 with much of that increase occurring after world war i.
in 1918 there had been 600 000 college students in 1930 there were 1 2 million nearly 20 percent of the college age population.
attendance was increasing as well at trade and vocational schools and in other institutions providing the specialized training that the modern economy demanded.
schools were beginning to offer instruction not only in the traditional disciplines but also in modern technical skills engineering management economics.
the growing importance of education contributed to the emergence of a separate youth culture.
the idea of adolescence as a distinct period in the life of an individual was for youth the most part new t0 twentieth cen culture tury.
in some measure it was a result of the influence of freudian psychology.
but it was a result too of societys recognition that a more extended period of training and preparation was necessary before a young person was ready to move into the workplace.
schools and colleges provided adolescents with a setting in which they could develop their own social patterns their own hobbies their own interests and activities.
an increasing number of students saw school as a place not just for academic training but also for organized athletics extracurricular activities clubs and fraternities and sororities that is as an institution that allowed them to define themselves less in terms of their families and more in terms of their peer group.
the disenchanted consumer groups grew rapidly and increased the range and energy of their efforts.
women activists won a significant triumph in 1921 when they helped secure passage in congress of a measure in keeping with the traditional feminist goal of securing protective legislation for women the sheppard towner act.

for many young people in the 1920s disenchantment with the war contributed to a growing disenchantment with the united states.
the newly prosperous and consumer driven era they encountered seemed meaningless and vulgar to many artists and intellectuals in particular.
as a result they came to view their own culture with contempt.
rather than trying to influence and reform their society they isolated themselves from it and embarked on a restless search for personal fulfillment.
the american writer gertrude stein once referred to the young americans emerging from world war i as a lost generation for some writers and intellectuals at least it was an apt description.
i dance halls i twfthe booming boisterous consumer oriented world of the 1920s many americans iii especially those living in urban areas challenged the inhibitions of traditional public culture.
they looked instead for freedom excitement and release.
nowhere did they do so more vigorously and visibly than in the great dance halls that were proliferating in cities across the nation in these years.
the dance craze that swept urban america in the 1920s and 1930s was a result of many things.
the great african american migration during world war i had helped bring new forms of jazz out of the south and into the urban north where the phonograph and the radio popularized it.
the growth of a distinctive youth culture and the increasing tendency of men and women to socialize together in public created an audience for uninhibited sexually titillating entertainment.
the relative prosperity of the 1920s enabled many young working class people to afford to spend evenings out.
and prohibition by closing down most saloons and taverns limited their other options.
night after night in big cities and small young people flocked to dance halls to hear the powerful pulsing new music to revel in dazzling lights and ornate surroundings to show off new clothes and hairstyles and of course most of all to dance.
like the new movie palaces that were being built at the same time many of the dance halls provided a sense of grandiosity and glamour.
some of the larger dance halls in the big cities roseland and the savoy in new york the trianon and the aragon in chicago the raymor in boston the greystone in detroit the hollywood paladium and many others were truly cavernous capable of accommodating thousands of couples at once.
over 10 percent of the men and women between the ages of 17 and 40 in new york went dancing at least once a week and the numbers were comparable in other large cities.
what drew so many people to the dance halls.
in large part it was the music which both its defenders and critics recognized as something very new in mainstream american culture.
dancing was moral ruin the ladies home journal primly warned in 1921 prompting carelessness recklessness and laxity of moral responsibility with its direct appeal to the body s sensory centers.
many young dancers might have agreed with the description if not with the moral judgment.
jazz encouraged a kind of uninhibited even frenetic dancing expressive athletic sensual that young couples in particular found extraordinarily exciting a welcome release from the often staid worlds of family school or work.
performances by some of the most famous bands and musicians of the day paul whiteman ben pollack fletcher henderson bix beiderbecke louis armstrong and duke ellington already familiar to everyone through radio performances and recordings drew enormous crowds.
some of the less savory halls also attracted dancers for illicit reasons as sources of bootleg liquor or as places to buy drugs.

dance halls were particularly popular with young men and women from working class immigrant communities.
for them going dancing was part of becoming american a way to escape even if momentarily the insular world of the immigrant neighborhood.
their parents saw it that way too and often tried to stop their children from going because they had been in vain.

going dancing was a chance to mingle with hundreds sometimes thousands of strangers of diverse backgrounds and to participate in a cultural ritual that had no counterpart in ethnic cultures.
but dance halls were not melting pots.
african americans who flocked to ballrooms at least as eagerly as whites usually gathered at clubs in black neighborhoods where there were only occasional white patrons.
white working class people might encounter a large number of different ethnic groups in a great hall at once but the groups did not mix very much.
in chicago s dreamland for example italians congregated near the door poles near the band and jews in the middle of the floor.

besides the music what was the appeal of the dance hall.
although thousands of young people attended dance halls why were the halls unable to break down the ethnic or racial barriers of those who flocked to them.
is there an equivalent today of the dance hall of the 1920s and 1930s.
if so what is its appeal.
who are its customers.
how is it different from the dance halls of the earlier era.
i one result of this alienation was a series of savage critiques of modern society by a wide range of writers some of whom h l mencken were known as the debunkers among them was the baltimore journalist h l protagonist an american officer fighting in europe decides that there is no justification for his participation in the con flict and deserts the army with a nurse with whom he has mien in love.

the harlem renaissance in postwar harlem in new york city a new generation of black artists and intellectuals created a flourishing african american culture widely described as the harlem renaissance there were nightclubs among them the famous cotton club featuring many of the great jazz musicians who would later become staples of national popular culture duke ellington jelly roll morton fletcher henderson and others.
there were theaters featuring ribald musical comedies and vaudeville acts.
many white new yorkers traveled up to harlem for the music and theater but the audiences were largely black.
harlem in the 1920s was above all a center of literature poetry and art that drew heavily from both american and african roots.
black artists were trying in part to demonstrate the richness of their own racial heritage and not incidentally to prove to whites that their race was worthy of respect.

a conflict of cultures the modern secular culture of the 1920s was not unchallenged.
it grew up alongside older more traditional cultures with which it continually and often bitterly competed.
prohibition when the prohibition of the sale and manufacture of alcohol went into effect in january 1920 it had the support of most failure of members of the middle class and most of prohibition those who considered themselves progressives.
within a year however it had become clear that the noble experiment as its defenders called it was not working well.
prohibition did substantially reduce drinking at least in some regions of the country.
but it also produced conspicuous and growing violations that made the law an almost immediate source of disillusionment and controversy.
the federal government hired only 1 500 agents to enforce the prohibition laws and in many places they ai mun received little help from local police.
before organized long k was almost as easyto acquire megal crime alcohol in much of the country as it had once been to acquire legal alcohol.
and since an enormous lucrative industry was now barred to legitimate businessmen organized crime figures took it over.
in chicago al capone built a criminal empire based largely on illegal alcohol.
he guarded it against interlopers with an army as many as 1 000 gunmen whose zealousness contributed to the violent deaths of more than 250 people in the city between 1920 and 1927.
other regions produced gangsters and gang wars of their own.
many middle class progressives who had originally sup ported prohibition soon soured on the experiment.
but an enormous constituency of provincial largely rural protestant americans continued vehemently to defend it.
the new era.

bettmann corbis opponents of prohibition or wets as they came to be known gained steadily in influence.
not until 1933 however when the great depression added weight to their appeals were they finally able effectively to challenge the drys and win repeal of the eighteenth amendment.
nativism and the klan agitation for a curb on foreign emigration to the united states had begun in the nineteenth century and like the prohibition movement it had gathered strength in the years before the war largely because of the support of middle class progressives.
such concerns had not been sufficient in the first years of the century to win passage of curbs on immigration too many employers fought to keep low paid immigrant workers flooding into the country.
but in the troubled and repressive years immediately following the war many old stock americans began to associate immigration with radicalism.
sentiment on behalf of restriction grew rapidly as a result.
in 1921 congress passed an emergency immigration act establishing a quota system by which annual immigration from any country could not exceed 3 percent of the number of persons of that nationality who had been in the united states in 1910.
the new law cut immigration from 800 000 to 300 000 in any single year but nativists remained unsatisfied and pushed for a harsher law.
the national origins act of 1924 strengthened the exclusionist provision of national origins act the 1921 law banned immigration from of 1924 east asia entirely.
that provision deeply angered the japanese who understood that they were the principal target chinese immigration had been illegal since 1882.
the law also reduced the quota for europeans from 3 percent to 2 percent.
the quota would be based moreover not on the 1910 census but on the census of 1890 a year in which there had been many fewer southern ern j 632 chapter 22 prohibition 1921 a new york city police commissioner oversees agents pouring illegal liquor into the street.

what immigration there was in other words would heavily favor northwestern europeans people of nordic or teutonic stock.
five years later a further restriction set a rigid limit of 150 000 immigrants a year.
in the years that followed immigration officials seldom permitted even half that number actually to enter the country.
but the nativism of the 1920s extended well beyond restricting immigration.
among other things this nativism helped instigate the rebirth of the ku klux kian as a major force in american society.
the first kian founded during reconstruction had died in the 1870s.
but in 1915 another group of white southerners the new klan 5 e met on stone mountain near atlanta and established a new version of the society.
nativist passions had swelled in georgia and elsewhere in response to the case of leo frank a jewish factory manager in atlanta convicted in 1914 on very flimsy evidence of murdering a female employee a mob stormed franks jail and lynched him.

immigration restriction legislation passed in 1921 and 1924 was one important reason for the decline.
what other factors depressed immigration in the 1930s and 1940s.

but the most c ange was the huge increase in the proportion of immigrants from latin america a region explictly exempted from the quota system established in 1924 law in these years.
mencons treted differentl9 than europeans in immigration the new era 633 atlanta of d w griffiths film the birth of a nation which glorified the early klan also helped inspire white southerners to form a new one.
at first the new klan like the old was largely concerned with intimidating african americans who according to klan leader william j simmons were becoming insubordinate.
and at first it remained small obscure and almost entirely southern.
after world war i however concern about african americans became secondary to concern about catholics jews and foreigners.
at that point membership in the klan expanded rapidly and dramatically not just in the small towns and rural areas of the south but also in industrial cities in the north and midwest.
indiana had the largest klan membership of any state and there were substantial kians in chicago detroit and other northern industrial cities.
the klan was also strong in the west with particularly large and active chapters in oregon and colorado.
by 1924 there were reportedly 4 million members.
in some communities where klan leaders came from the most respectable segments of society the organization operated much like a fraternal society engaging in nothing more dangerous than occasional political pronouncements.
many klan units or klaverns tried to present themselves as patriots and community leaders.
some established womens and even childrens auxiliaries to demonstrate their commitment to the family.
often however the klan also operated as a brutal even violent opponent of alien groups and as a defender of traditional fundamentalist morality.
some klansmen systematically terrorized blacks jews catholics and foreigners and boycotted their businesses threatened their families and attempted to drive them out of their communities.
occasionally they resorted to violence public whipping tarring and feathering arson and lynching.
what the klan feared it soon became clear was not simply foreign or racially impure groups it was anyone who posed a challenge to traditional values as the defending traditional defined them.
klansmen persecuted values not only immigrants and african americans but also those white protestants they considered guilty of irreligion sexual promiscuity or drunkenness.
the klan worked to enforce prohibition it attempted to institute compulsory bible reading in schools it worked to punish divorce.
it also provided its members many of them people of modest means with little real power in society with a sense of community and seeming authority.
its bizarre costumes its elaborate rituals its secret language its burning crosses all helped produce a sense of excitement and cohesion.
the klan declined quickly after 1925 when a series of internal power struggles and several sordid scandals discredited some of its most important leaders.
the most damaging episode involved david stephenson head of the indiana klan who raped a young secretary kidnapped her and watched her die rather than call a doctor after she swallowed poison.
the klan staggered on in some areas into the 1930s but by world s.
david stephenson 634 chapter 22 war ii it was effectively dead.
the postwar ku klux kian which still survives is modeled on but has no direct connec tion to the kian of the 1920s and 1930s.
religious fundamentalism another bitter cultural controversy of the 1920s challenged the place of religion in contemporary society.
by 1921 american protestantism was divided into two warring camps.
on one side stood the modernists mostly urban middle class people who had attempted to adapt religion to the teachings of science and to the realities of their modern secular society.
on the other side stood the defenders of traditional faith provincial largely rural men and women fighting to maintain the centrality of traditional religion in american life.
they became known as fundamentalists a term derived from an influential set of pamphlets the fundamentals published before world war i.
the fundamentalists were outraged at the abandonment of traditional beliefs in the face of scientific discoveries.
they insisted the bible was to be interpreted literally.
above all they opposed the teachings of charles darwin who had openly challenged the biblical story of the creation.
human beings had not evolved from lower orders of animals the fundamentalists insisted they had been created by god as described in genesis.
fundamentalism was a highly evangelical movement interested in spreading the doctrine to new groups.
fundamentalist evangelists among them the celebrated billy sunday traveled from state to state particularly in the south and parts of the west attracting huge crowds to their revival meetings.
protestant modernists looked on much of this activity with condescension and amusement.
but by the mid 1920s to their great alarm evangelical fundamentalism was gaining political strength in some states with its demands for legislation to forbid the teaching of evolution in the public schools.
in tennessee in march 1925 the legislature adopted a measure making it illegal for any public school teacher to teach any theory that denies the story of the divine creation of man as taught in the bible the tennessee law attracted the attention of the fledgling american civil liberties union which had been founded in 1920 by men and women alarmed by the repressive legal and social climate of world war i and its aftermath.
the aclu offered free counsel to any tennessee educator willing to defy the law and become the defendant in a test case.
a twenty four year old biology teacher in the town of dayton john t scopes agreed to have himself arrested.
and when the aclu decided to send the famous attorney clarence darrow to defend scopes the aging william scopes monkey z r trial jennings bryan now an important funda mentalist spokesman announced that he would travel to dayton to assist the prosecution.
journalists from across the country flocked to tennessee to cover what became known as the monkey trial which opened in an almost circuslike atmosphere.
scopes had of course clearly violated the law and a verdict of guilty was a foregone conclusion especially when the judge refused to permit expert testimony by evolution scholars.
scopes was fined 100 and the case was ultimately dismissed in a higher court because of a technicality.
nevertheless darrow scored an important victory for the modernists by calling bryan to the stand to testify as an expert on the bible in the course of the cross examination which was broadcast by radio to bryan and darrow in dayton clarence darrow left a famous lawyer who defended scopes and william jennings bryan an even more famous politician who supported the prosecution pose for photographers during the 1925 scopes trial.
both men had removed their jackets because of the intense heat and bryan had shocked many of his admirers by revealing that he was not wearing suspenders as most country people did but a belt which in rural tennessee was a symbol of urban culture.
archive photos getty images the new era 635 much of the nation darrow made bryans stubborn defense of biblical truths appear foolish and finally tricked him into admitting the possibility that not all religious dogma was subject to only one interpretation.
the scopes trial was a traumatic experience for many fundamentalists.
it isolated and ultimately excluded them from many mainstream protestant denominations.
it helped put an end to much of their political activism.
but it did not change their religious convictions.
even without connection to traditional denominations fundamentalists continued to congregate in independent churches or new denominations of their own.
the democrats ordeal the anguish of provincial americans attempting to defend an embattled way of life proved particularly troubling to the democratic party which suffered during the 1920s as a result of tensions between its urban and rural factions.
more than the republicans the democrats were a diverse coalition of interest groups linked to the party by local traditions.
among those interest groups were prohibitionists klansmen and fundamentalists on one side and catholics urban workers and immigrants on the other.
in 1924 the tensions between them proved devastating.
at the democratic national convention in new york city that summer bitter conflict broke out over the platform when the partys urban wing attempted to win approval of planks calling for the repeal of prohibition and a denunciation of the kian.
both planks narrowly failed.
more damaging to the party was a deadlock in the balloting for a presidential candidate.
urban democrats supported alfred e smith the irish catholic tammanyite who had risen to become a progressive governor of new york.
rural democrats backed william mcadoo woodrow wilsons treasury secretary and son in law later to become a senator from california he had skillfully positioned himself to win the support of southern and western delegates suspicious of tammany hall and modern urban life.
the convention dragged on for 103 ballots until finally after both smith and mcadoo withdrew the party settled on a compromise the bland corporate lawyer john w davis who had served as solicitor general and ambassador to britain under wilson.
he was easily defeated by president calvin coolidge.
a similar schism plagued the democrats again in 1928 when a1 smith finally secured his partys nomination for president after a much shorter battle.
smith was not how al smith ever a e t0 unite is divided party largely because of widespread anti catholic sentiment especially in the south.
he was the first democrat we the civil war not to carry the entire south.
elsewhere though he did well in the large cities he carried only massachusetts and rhode island.
smiths opponent and the victor in the presidential election was a man who perhaps tnore than any other contemporary politician seemed to personify the modern prosperous middle class society of the blow era herbert hoover.
candidate party electoral vote popular vote herbert hoover republican 444 21 391 381 58 2 alfred e smith democratic 87 15 016 443 40 9 norman thomas socialist 267 835 0 7 other parties socialist workers prohibition 62 890 56 9 of electorate voting election of 1928 the election of 1928 was by almost any measure highly one sided.
herbert hoover won over 58 percent of the vote to alfred smith s 41.
smith carried only massachusetts rhode island and some traditionally democratic states in the south.
why did smith do so poorly even in some of the south.
republican government for twelve years beginning in 1921 both the presidency and the congress were in the hands of the republican party a party in which the power of reformers had greatly dwindled since the heyday of progressivism before the war.
for most of those years the federal government enjoyed a warm and supportive relationship with the american business community.
yet the government of the new era was more than the passive pliant instrument that critics often described.
it also attempted to serve as an active agent of economic change.
harding and coolidge nothing seemed more clearly to illustrate the unadventurous character of 1920s politics than the characters of the two men who served as president during most of the decade warren g harding and calvin coolidge.
harding was elected to the presidency in 1920 having spent many years in public life doing little of note.
an undistinguished senator from ohio he had received the republican presidential nomination as a result of an agreement among leaders of his party who considered him as one noted a good ik a 636 chapter 22 second rater harding appointed capable men to the most important cabinet offices and he attempted to stabilize the nation s troubled foreign policy.
but even as he attempted to rise to his office he seemed baffled by his responsibilities as if he recognized his own unfitness.
i am a man of limited talents from a small town he reportedly told friends on one occasion.
i dont seem to grasp that i am president hardings intellectual limits were compounded by personal weaknesses his penchant for gambling illegal alcohol and attractive women.
harding lacked the strength to abandon the party hacks who had helped create his political success.
one of them harry daugherty the ohio party boss principally responsible teapot dome or is meteoric political ascent he appointed attorney general.
another new mexico senator albert b.
fall he made secretary of the interior.
members of the so called ohio gang filled important offices throughout the administration.
unknown to the public and perhaps also to harding daugherty fall and others were engaged in fraud and corruption.
the most spectacular scandal involved the rich naval oil reserves at teapot dome wyoming and elk hills california.
at the urging of fall harding transferred control of those reserves from the navy department to the interior department.
fall then secretly leased them to two wealthy businessmen and received in return nearly half a million dollars in loans to ease his private financial troubles.
fall was ultimately convicted of bribery and sentenced to a year in prison daugherty barely avoided a similar fate for his part in another scandal.
in the summer of 1923 only months before senate investigations and press revelations brought the scandals to light a tired and depressed harding left washington for a speaking tour in the west.
in seattle late in july he suffered severe pain which his doctors wrongly diagnosed as food poisoning.
a few days later in san francisco he suffered two major heart attacks and died.
in many ways calvin coolidge who succeeded harding in the presidency was utterly different from his predecessor.
where harding was genial garrulous and coolidge debauched coolidge was dour silent even puritanical.
and while harding was if not perhaps personally corrupt then at least tolerant of corruption in others coolidge seemed honest beyond reproach.
in other ways however harding and coolidge were similar figures.
both took an essentially passive approach to their office.
like harding coolidge had risen to the presidency on the basis of few substantive accomplishments.
elected governor of massachusetts in 1919 he had won national attention with his laconic response to the boston police strike that year.
that was enough to make him his partys vice presidential nominee in 1920.
three years later after hardings death he took the oath of office from his father a justice of the peace by the light of a kerosene lamp.
if anything coolidge was even less active as president than harding partly as a result of his conviction that government should interfere as little as possible in the life of the nation.
in 1924 he received his partys presidential nomination virtually unopposed.
running against john w davis he won a comfortable victory 54 percent of the popular vote and 382 of the 531 electoral votes.
robert la follette the candidate of the reincarnated progressive party received 16 percent of the popular vote but carried only his home state of wisconsin.
coolidge probably could have won renomination and reelection in 1928.
instead in characteristically laconic fashion he walked into a press room one day and handed each reporter a slip of paper containing a single sentence i do not choose to run for president in 1928 harding and friends president warren g harding center left holding a rod poses with companions during a fishing trip to miami in 1921.
he enjoyed these social and sporting events with wealthy friends and political cronies.
two of his companions here attorney general harry daugherty to the left of harding and interior secretary albert fall at far right were later principal figures in the scandals that rocked the administration before and after harding s death.

but he was not really an outdoorsman despite his efforts to appear so.
he is shown here fishing in simsbury connecticut carefully attired in suit tie hat and rubber boots.
bettmann corbis government and business the story of harding and coolidge themselves however is only a part and by no means the most important part of the story of their administrations.
however passive the new era presidents may have been much of the federal government was working effectively and efficiently during the 1920s to adapt public pol andrew icy to the widelv accepted oal of the time mellon helping business and industry operate with maximum efficiency and productivity.
the dose relationship between the private sector and the federal government that had been forged during world war i continued.
secretary of the treasury andrew mellon a wealthy steel and aluminum tycoon devoted himself to working for substantial reductions in taxes on corporate profits personal incomes and inheritances.
largely because of his efforts congress cut them all by more than half.
mellon also worked closely with president coolidge after 1924 on a series of measures to trim dramatically the already modest federal budget.
the administration even managed to retire half the nations world war i debt.
the most energetic member of the cabinet was commerce secretary herbert hoover who considered himself and was considered by others a notable progressive.
during his eight years in the commerce department hoover encouraged voluntary cooperation in the private sector as the best avenue to stability.
but the idea of voluntarism he believed did not require that the government remain passive on the contrary public institutions hoover insisted should play an active role in creating the new cooperative order.
above all hoover became the champion of the concept of business associationalism a concept that envisioned the creation of national organizations of businessmen in particular industries.
through these trade associations private entrepreneurs could hoover believed stabilize their industries and promote efficiency in production and marketing.
many progressives derived encouragement from the election of herbert hoover to the presidency in 1928.
hoover easily defeated a1 smith the democratic candidate.
and he entered office promising bold new efforts to solve the nations remaining economic problems.
but hoover had few opportunities to prove himself.
less than a year after his inauguration the nation plunged into the severest and most prolonged economic crisis in its history a crisis that brought many of the optimistic assumptions of the new era crashing down and launched the nation into a period of unprecedented social innovation and reform.
hoovers associationalism looking back the remarkable prosperity of the 1920s a prosperity without parallel in the previous history of the united states shaped niuch of what exuberant contemporaries liked to call the new era in the years after world war i america created a vibrant and extensive national culture.
its middle class moved increasingly to embrace consumerism.
its politics reorganized around the needs of a booming interdependent industrial economy rejecting many of the reform crusades of the previ us generation but also creating new institutions to help promote economic growth and stability.
beneath the glittering surface of the new era however were roiling controversies and timeless injustices clamoring for redress.
although the prosperity of the 1920s was more widely shared than at any other time in the nations industrial history more than half the population failed to achieve any real benefits from the growth.
a new optimistic secular culture was attracting millions of urban middle class people.
but many other americans looked at this culture with alarm and fought against it with great fervor.
few eras in modern american history have seen so much political and cultural conflict.
chapter 22 the 1920s ended in a catastrophic economic crash that has colored the image of those years ever since.
the crises of the 1930s should not obscure the real achievements of the new era economy.
neither however should the prosperity of the 1920s obscure the inequity and instability in those years that helped produce the difficult years to come.

what were some of the causes of the great depression.
what made it so severe and why did it last so long.
what was the impact of the depression on farmers minorities and women.
how did president hoover and his administration try to deal with the depression.
what was the result of those efforts.
setting the stage in august 1928 not long before his election to the presidency herbert hoover proclaimed we in america today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.
the poorhouse is vanishing from among us only fifteen months later those words would return to haunt him as the nation plunged into the severest and most prolonged economic depression in its history a depression that continued in one form or another for more than a decade not only in the united states but throughout much of the rest of the world as well.
the depression reached into every area of both economic and social life.
it destroyed the great bull market of the 1920s and sent stock prices into a long and steep decline from which they did not recover for years.
it halted the great wave of investment in industrial plants and infrastructure that had done so much to fuel economic growth before the crash.
it jeopardized the health of the national banking system.
most of all it created massive unemployment which rose at some points to nearly 25 percent of the workforce.
this massive and persistent unemployment was the most visible and to many most frightening aspect of the depression.
in the midst of this crisis herbert hoover used the tools of the federal government more aggressively and creatively than any president had ever used them before to address economic problems.
but it was not enough to stem the tide of the depression.
and there were many steps that hoover refused to consider because he believed they would violate basic principles of american life most notably the rights and responsibilities of individuals.
these values had been greatly admired through most of american history but the crisis of the depression called them into question undermined hoover s reputation and contributed eventually to a major shift in the character of american politics.
the coming of the great depression the sudden economic decline that began in 1929 came as an especially severe shock because it followed so closely a period in which the new era seemed to be performing another series of economic miracles.
the great crash in february 1928 stock prices began a steady rise that continued with only a few temporary lapses for a year and a half.
between may 1928 and september 1929 the average price of stocks stock market increased over 40 percenl the stocks of the major industrials the stocks that boom are used determine the dow jones industrial average doubled in value in that same period.
trading mushroomed from 2 or 3 million shares a day to over 5 million and at times to as many as 10 or 12 million.
a widespread speculative fever grew steadily more intense particularly once brokerage firms began encouraging the mania by recklessly offering easy credit.
in the autumn of 1929 the great bull market began to fall apart.
on october 21 and again on october 23 there were alarming declines in stock prices in both cases followed by temporary recoveries the second of them engineered by j p morgan and company and other big bankers black wh cnspic usly bought up stocks to restore public confidence.

see debating the past pp.
but most agree on several things.
they agree first that what is remarkable about the crisis is not that it occurred periodic recessions are a normal feature of capitalist economies.
what is remarkable is that it was so severe and that it lasted so long.
the important question therefore is not so much why there was a depression but why it was such a bad one.
most observers agree too that a number of different factors account for the severity of the crisis even if there is considerable disagreement about which was the most important.
one of those factors was a lack of diversification in the american economy in the 1920s.
prosperity had depended excessively on a few lack of.
diversification basic indusmes notably construe tion and automobiles.
in the late 1920s those industries began to decline.
expenditures on construction fell from 11 billion to less than 9 billion between 1926 and 1929.
automobile sales fell by more than a third in the first nine months of 1929.
newer industries were emerging to take up the slack among them petroleum chemicals plastics and others oriented toward the expanding market for consumer goods but had not yet developed enough strength to compensate for the decline in other sectors.
a second factor was the maldistribution of purchasing power and as a result a weakness in consumer demand which was too small to create an adequate market for the goods the economy was producing.
even in 1929 after nearly a decade of economic growth more than half the families in america lived on the edge of or below the minimum subsistence level too poor to buy the goods the industrial economy was producing.

the library of congress debating the past f s uhkssr n dhi u sju ilhi 5bmiihm causes of the great depression t t a rpwere the causes of the great depression.
economists and historians have w jf debated this question since the economic collapse began and still have not reached anything close to agreement on an answer to it.
in the process however they have produced several very different theories about how a modern economy works.
during the depression itself different groups offered interpretations of the crisis that fit comfortably with their own self interests.
some corporate leaders claimed that the depression was the result of a lack of business confidence that businessmen were reluctant to invest because they feared government regulation and high taxes.
the hoover administration unable to solve the crisis with the tools it considered acceptable blamed international economic forces and sought therefore to stabilize world currencies and debt structures.
new dealers determined to find a domestic solution to the crisis and ideologically inclined to place limits on corporate power argued that the depression was a crisis of underconsumption that low wages and high prices had made it too difficult to buy the products of the industrial economy and that a lack of demand had led to the economic collapse.
scholars in the years since the great depression have also created interpretations that fit their views of how the economy works.
one of the first important postwar interpretations came from the economists milton friedman and anna schwartz in their monetary history of the united states 1963.
in a chapter titled the great contraction they argued for what has become known as the monetary interpretation.
the depression they claimed was a result of a drastic contraction of the currency a result largely of mistaken decisions by the federal reserve board which raised interest rates when it should have lowered them.
these deflationary measures friedman and schwartz argue turned an ordinary recession into the great depression.
friedman in particular advocated for many years that sound monetary policy is the best way to solve economic problems as opposed to fiscal policies such as taxation and spending.
a second very different argument known as the spending interpretation is identified with among others the economist peter temin and his book did monetary forces cause the great depression.
temin s answer to his own question is no.
the cause of the crisis was not monetary contraction although the contraction made it worse but a drop in investment and consumer spending which preceded the decline in the money supply and helped to cause it.
here again there are obvious political implications.
if a decline in spending was the cause of the depression then the proper response was an effort to stimulate demand raising government spending increasing purchasing power redistributing wealth.
according to this theory the new deal never ended the depression because it did not spend enough.
world war ii did end it because it pumped so much public money into the economy.
this is a liberal keynesian explanation just as the monetary hypothesis is a conservative explanation.
in the great depression 1987 the economic historian michael bernstein avoids trying to explain why the economic downturn occurred and asks instead why it lasted so long.
the reason the recession of 1929 another major problem was the credit structure of the economy.
farmers were deeply in debt their land mortgaged crop prices too low to allow them to pay off what they owed.
small banks especially those tied to the agricultural economy were in constant trouble in the 1920s as their customers defaulted on loans many of these small banks failed.
large banks were in trouble too.
although most american bankers were very conservative some of the nations biggest banks were investing recklessly in the stock market or making unwise loans.
when the stock market crashed many of these banks suffered losses greater than they could absorb.
a fourth factor contributing to the coming of the depression was americas position in international trade.
late in the 1920s declining european demand for american goods began exports t0 decline that was partty because of high american tariffs partly because european industry and agriculture were becoming more productive and partly because some european nations most notably germany under the weimar republic were having financial difficulties and could not afford to buy goods from overseas.
but it was also because the european economy was being destabilized by a fifth factor contributing to the depression the international debt structure that had emerged in the aftermath of world war i unstable international debt structure when the war ended in 1918 all the european nations that had been allied with the united states owed large sums of money to american banks sums much too large to be repaid out of their shattered economies.
that was one reason the allies had insisted over woodrow wilsons objections on reparation payments from germany and austria.
reparations they believed would provide them with a way to pay off their own debts.
but germany and austria were themselves in economic trouble after the war they were no more able to pay the reparations than the allies were able to pay their debts.
the u s government refused to forgive or reduce the debts.
instead american banks began making large loans to european governments with which they paid off their earlier loans.
thus debts and reparations were being paid only by piling up new and greater debts.
in the late 1920s particularly after the american economy began to weaken in 1929 the european nations found it much more difficult to borrow money from the united states.
at the same time high american protective tariffs were making it difficult for them to sell their goods in american markets.
without any source of foreign exchange with which to repay their loans they began to default.

this is in other words an explanation of the depression that seems to support some of the economic ideas that became popular in the 1970s and 1980s calling for a more direct government role in stimulating the growth of new industries.
other explanations include the rise of protectionism increased by the ill advised smoot hawley tariff of 1931 which stifled international trade the weakness of the banking system the reckless credit policies of the 1920s and many others.
in the end however no single explanation of the great depression has ever seemed adequate to most scholars.
the event the economist robert lucas once argued is simply inexplicable by any rational calculation.
understand analyze and evaluate became the depression of the 1930s he argues was the timing of the collapse.
the recession began as an ordinary cyclical downturn.
had it begun a few years earlier the basic strength of the automobile and construction industries in the 1920s would have led to a reasonably speedy recovery.
had it begun a few years later a group of newer emerging industries would have helped produce a recovery in a reasonably short time.
but the recession began in 1929 too late for the automobile and construction industries to help and too soon for emerging new industries to help since they were still in their infancies.
one of the reasons world war ii was so important to the long term recovery of the u s economy bernstein s argument suggests was not just that it pumped money into the economy but that much of that money contributed to developing new industries that would help sustain prosperity 1.
how do the monetary and spending arguments about the causes of the great depression differ from each other.
what is michael bernstein s theory of the causes of the depression.
why have there been such widespread and long standing differences on the question of the causes of the depression.
credit structure was one of the reasons the depression spread to europe and grew much worse in america after 1931.
see america in the world pp.
progress of the depression the stock market crash of 1929 did not so much cause the depression then as help trigger a chain of events that exposed long standing weaknesses in the american economy.
during the next three years the crisis steadily worsened.
a collapse of much of the banking system followed the stock market crash.
more than 9 000 american banks either went bankrupt or closed their doors to avoid bankruptcy between 1930 and 1933.
depositors lost over 2 5 billion in bankin deposits.
partly as a result of these banking collapse closures the total money supply of the nation fell by more than a third between 930 and 1933.
the declining money supply meant a decline hi purchasing power and thus deflation.
manufacturers and merchants began reducing prices cutting back on production and laying off workers.
some economists argue that a severe depression could have been avoided if the federal reserve sys had acted more responsibly.
but the members of the federal reserve board concerned about protecting its own solvency in a dangerous economic environment raised interest rates in 1931 which contracted the money supply even further.
the american gross national product plummeted from more than 104 billion in 1929 to 76 4 billion in 1932 a 25 percent decline in three years.
in 1929 americans had spent 16 2 billion severe in capita investmenf in 1933 they invested contraction onty a a billion.
the consumer price index declined 25 percent between 1929 and 1933 the wholesale price index 32 percent.
gross farm income dropped from 12 billion to 5 billion in four years.
the american people in hard times someone asked the british economist john maynard keynes in the 1930s whether he was aware of any historical era comparable to the great depression.
yes keynes replied.
it was called the dark ages and it lasted 400 years the depression did not of course last 400 years but it did bring unprecedented despair to the economies of the united states and the global depression rp tt great depression began in the united states but it did not end there.
the collapse of 1 tl d the american economy the largest in the world sent shock waves around the globe.
by 1931 the american depression had become a world depression.
the origins of the worldwide depression lay in the pattern of debts that had emerged during and after world war i when the united states loaned billions of dollars to european nations.
in 1931 large banks in new york began calling in their loans from germany and austria.
that precipitated the failure of one of austrias largest banks which in turn created panic through much of central europe.
the economic collapse in germany and austria meant that those nations could not continue paying reparations to britain and france required by the treaty of versailles of 1919 which meant in turn that britain and france could not continue paying off their loans to the united states.
this spreading financial crisis was accompanied by a dramatic contraction of international trade precipitated in part by the smoot hawley tariff in the united states which established the highest import duties in history and stifled much global commerce.
depressed agricultural prices a result of worldwide overproduction also contributed to the downturn.
by 1932 worldwide industrial production had declined by more than a third and world trade had plummeted by nearly two thirds.
by 1933 thirty million people in industrial nations were unemployed five times the number four years before.
but the depression was not confined to industrial nations.
imperialism and industrialization drew almost all regions of the world into the international industrial economy.
colonies and nations in africa asia and south america critically dependent on exporting raw materials and agricultural goods to industrial countries experienced a decline in demand for their products which led to rising levels of poverty and unemployment.
some nations among them the soviet union and china remained unconnected to the global economy and suffered relatively little from the great depression.
but in most parts of the world the depression caused tremendous social and economic hardship.
it also created political turmoil.
among the countries hardest hit by the depression was germany where industrial production had declined by 50 percent and unemployment reached 35 percent in the early 1930s.
the desperate economic conditions there contributed greatly to the rise of the nazi party and its leader adolf hitler who became chancellor in 1932.
japan suffered greatly as well and as in germany japan s economic troubles produced political turmoil and aided the rise of a new militaristic regime.

in other nations governments sought solutions to the depression through reform of their domestic economies.
among the most common responses to the much of the western world.
and it had far reaching effects on american society and culture.
unemployment and relief in the industrial northeast and midwest cities were becoming paralyzed by unemployment.
cleveland ohio in 1932 had an unemployment rate of roughly 50 percent akron 60 percent toledo 80 percent.
many industrial workers were accustomed to periods of unemployment but no one was prepared for the scale and duration of the joblessness of the 1930s.
most americans had been taught to believe that every individual was responsible for his or her own fate that unemployment and poverty were signs of personal failure.
many adult men in particular felt deeply ashamed of their joblessness the helplessness of unemployment was a challenge to traditional notions of masculinity.
unemployed workers walked through the streets day after day looking for jobs that did not exist.
an increasing number of families were turning to state and local public relief systems just to be able to eat.
but those systems which in the 1920s had served only a small number of indigent persons were unequipped to handle the new demands.
in many places relief simply collapsed.
private charities attempted to supplement the public relief efforts but the problem was far beyond their capabilities as well.
state governments felt pressure to expand their own assistance to the unemployed but tax revenues were declining along with everything else and state leaders balked at placing additional strains on already tight budgets.
moreover many public officials believed that an extensive welfare system would undermine the moral fiber of its clients.

645 depression around the world was substantial government investment in public works the united states britain france germany italy the soviet union and other countries made substantial investments in roads bridges dams public buildings and other large projects.
all the industrial countries of the world also experimented with some form of government funded relief for the unemployed often borrowing ideas from one another in the process.
furthermore because classical models of economic behavior seemed unable to explain or provide solutions to the crisis the depression helped create new approaches to economics.
the great british economist john maynard keynes revolutionized economic thought in much of the world.
his 1936 book the general theory of employment interest and money despite its bland title created a sensation by arguing that the depression was a result not of declining production but rather of inadequate consumer demand.
governments he said could stimulate their economies by increasing the money supply and creating investment through a combination of lowering interest rates and public spending.
keynesianism as keynes s theories became known began to have an impact in the united states in 1938 and in much of the rest of the world in subsequent years.
the great depression was an important turning point not only in american history but in the history of the twentieth century world as well it transformed ideas of public policy and economics in many nations it toppled old regimes and created new ones above all it was a major factor maybe the single most important factor in the coming of world war ii.

farm income declined by 60 percent between 1929 and 1932.
a third of all american farmers lost their land.
in addition a large area of agricultural settlement in the great plains f the south and west was suffering from a catastrophic dust bowl natural disaster one of the worst droughts in the history of the nation.
beginning in 93o a large area of the nation stretching north from texas into the dakotas came to be known as the dust bowl.
it began to experience a steady decline in rainfall and an accom panying increase in heat.
the drought continued for a decade turning what had once been fertile farm regions into deserts in kansas the soil in some places was without moisture as far as three feet below the surface.
in nebraska iowa and other affected states summer temperatures were averaging over 100 degrees.
swarms of grasshoppers were moving from region to region devouring what meager crops farmers were able to raise often even devouring fenceposts or clothes hanging out to dry.
great dust storms called black blizzards swept across the plains blotting out the sun and suffocating livestock as well as people unfortunate or foolish enough to stay outside.
even with these disastrous conditions the farm economy continued through the 1930s to produce far more food than american consumers could afford to buy.
farm prices fell so low that few growers made any profit on their crops.
as a result many farmers like many urban unemployed left their homes in search of work.
in the south in particular many dispossessed farmers black and white wandered from town to town hoping to find jobs or handouts.
hundreds of thou okies sands of families from the dust bowl often known as okies since many came from oklahoma traveled to california and other states where they found conditions little better than those they had left.
many worked as agricultural migrants traveling from farm to farm picking fruit and other crops at starvation wages.
throughout the nation problems resulting from malnutrition and homelessness grew at an alarming rate.
hospitals pointed to a striking increase in deaths from starvation.

in atlanta in 1930 an organization calling itself the black shirts organized a campaign with the slogan no jobs for niggers until every white man has a job in other areas whites used intimidation and violence to drive blacks from jobs.
by 1932 over half the african americans in the south were without employment.
and what limited relief there was went almost invariably to whites first.
unsurprisingly therefore many black southerners perhaps 400 000 left the south in the 1930s and journeyed to the cities of the north.
there they generally found less blatant discrimination.

554 chapter 20 bosses of the senate 1889 by joseph keppler keppler was a popular political cartoonist of the late nineteenth century who shared the growing concern about the power of the trusts portrayed here as bloated almost reptilian figures standing menacingly over the members of the u s senate to whose chamber the people s entrance is closed.
the granger collection new york one of the first was hull house which opened in 1889 in chicago as a result of the efforts of the social worker jane addams.
it became a model for more than 400 similar institutions throughout the nation.
staffed by members of the educated middle class settlement houses sought to help immigrant families adapt to the language and customs of their new country.
settlement houses avoided the condescension and moral disapproval of earlier philanthropic efforts.
but they generally embraced a belief that middle class americans had a responsibility to impart their own values to immigrants and to teach them how to create middle class lifestyles.
young college women mostly unmarried were important participants in the settlement house movement.
working in a settlement house which was a protected site that served mostly women was consistent with the widespread assumption that women needed to be sheltered from difficult environments.
the clean and well tended buildings that settlement houses created were not only a model for immigrant women but an appropriate site for elite women as well.
the settlement houses helped create another important el ement of progressive reform the profession of social work.
workers at hull house for example maintained a close relationship with the university of chicagos pioneering work in the field of sociology.
a growing number of programs for the professional training of social workers began to appear in the nations leading universities partly in response to the activities of the settlements.
the allure of expertise as the emergence of the social work profession suggests pro gressives involved in humanitarian efforts placed a high value on knowledge and expertise.
even nonscientific problems they believed could be analyzed and solved scientifically many reformers came to believe that only enlightened experts and well designed bureaucracies could create the stability and order america needed.
some reformers even spoke of the creation of a new civilization in which the expertise of scientists and engineers could e brought to bear on the problems of the economy and society.
the social scientist thorstein veblen for example proposed a new economic system in which power would reside m the hands of highly trained engineers.
only they he argued ou fully understand the machine process by which mod ern society must be governed.
the professions the late nineteenth century saw a dramatic expansion in the number of americans engaged in administrative and professional tasks.
industries needed managers technicians and accountants as well as workers.
cities required commercial medical legal and educational services.
new technology required scientists and engineers who in turn required institutions and instructors to train them.
by the turn of the century those performing these services had come to constitute a distinct social group what some historians have called a new middle class.
the new middle class placed a high value on education and individual accomplishment.
by the early twentieth century its millions of members were building organizations and establishing standards to secure their position in society.
the idea of professionalism had been a frail one in america even as late as 1880.
when every patent medicine salesman could claim to be a doctor when every frustrated politician could set up shop as a lawyer when anyone who could read and write could pose as a teacher a professional label by itself carried little weight.
there were of course skilled and responsible doctors lawyers teachers and others but they had no way of controlling or distinguishing themselves clearly from the amateurs charlatans and incompetents who presumed to practice their trades.
as the demand for professional services increased so did the pressures for reform.
among the first to respond was the medical profession.
in 1901 doctors who considered themselves trained professionals reorganized the american medical association into a national professional society.
by 1920 nearly two thirds of all american doctors were members.
the ama quickly called for strict scientific standards for admission to the practice of medicine with doctors themselves serving as protectors of the standards.
state governments responded by passing new laws requiring the licensing of all physicians.
by 1900 medical education at a few medical schools notably johns hopkins in baltimore founded in 1893 compared favorably with that in the leading institutions of europe.
doctors such as william h welch at hopkins revolutionized the teaching of medicine by moving students out of the classrooms and into laboratories and clinics.
there was similar movement in other professions.
by 1916 lawyers in all forty eight states had established professional bar associations.
the nations law schools accordingly expanded greatly.
businessmen supported the creation of schools of business administration and created their own national organizations the national association of manufacturers in 1895 and the united states chamber of commerce in 1912.
even farmers long the symbol of the romantic spirit of individualism responded to the new order by forming through the national farm bureau american medical association national association of manufacturers the progressives 555 the infant welfare society chicago the infant welfare society was one of many helping organizations in chicago and other large cities many of them closely tied to the settlement houses that strove to help immigrants adapt to american life and create safe and healthy living conditions.

the library of congress lc dig npcc 33267 federation a network of agricultural organizations designed to spread scientific farming methods.
while removing the untrained and incompetent the admission requirements also protected those already in the professions from excessive competition and lent prestige and status to their trades.
some professionals used their entrance requirements to exclude blacks women immigrants and other undesirables from their ranks.
others used them simply to keep the numbers down to ensure that demand would remain high.
women and the professions both by custom and by active barriers of law and prejudice american women found themselves excluded from most of the emerging professions.
but a substantial number of middle class women particularly those emerging from the new womens colleges and coeducational state universities entered professional careers nevertheless.
a few women managed to establish themselves as physicians lawyers engineers scientists and corporate managers in the early 1900s.
several leading medical schools admitted women and in 1900 about 5 percent of all american physicians were female a proportion that remained unchanged until the 1960s.
most however turned by necessity to those helping professions that society considered vaguely domestic and thus suitable for women settlement houses social work and most important teaching.
indeed in the late nineteenth century more than two thirds of all grammar school teachers were women and perhaps 90 percent of all female dominated professions debating the past progressivism t i wt t i ear 50s most historians generally agreed on the central characteristics u in jl jl jlj of progressivism.
it was just what progressives themselves said it was a movement by the people to curb the power of the special interests.
george mowry challenged this traditional view in the california progressives 1951.
he described the reform movement in california not as a people s protest but rather as an effort by a small and privileged group of business and professional men to limit the power of large new corporations and labor unions.
richard hofstadter expanded on this idea in the age of reform 1955 describing progressives throughout the country as people suffering from status anxiety old formerly influential upper middle class families seeking to restore their fading prestige by challenging the powerful new institutions that had begun to displace them.
the mowry hofstadter thesis provoked new challenges and new interpretations of the meaning of progressivism.
gabriel kolko in the triumph of conservatism 1963 rejected the mowry hofstadter idea that progressivism represented the efforts of a displaced elite.
progressivism he argued was an effort to regulate business undertaken not by the people or displaced elites but by corporate leaders who saw in government supervision a way to protect themselves from competition.
martin sklar s the corporate reconstruction of american capitalism 1988 is a more sophisticated version of a similar argument.
a more moderate challenge to the psychological interpretation of progressivism came from historians embracing a new organizational view of history.
in the search for order 1877 1920 1967 robert wiebe presented progressivism as a response to dislocations in american life brought on by rapid changes in the economy.
economic power had moved to large national organizations while social and political life remained centered primarily in local communities.
the result was widespread disorder and unrest.
progressivism wiebe argued was the effort of a new middle class a class tied to the emerging national economy to stabilize and enhance their position in society by creating national institutions suitable for the new national economy.
some historians continued to argue that progressivism was a movement of the people against the special interests.
j joseph huthmacher argued in 1962 that much of the force behind progressivism came from members of the working class especially immigrants who pressed for such reforms as workmen s compensation and wage and hour laws.
john buenker in urban liberalism and progressive reform 1973 claimed that political machines and urban bosses were important sources of reform energy and helped create twentieth century liberalism.
other historians writing in the 1970s and 1980s attempted to link reform to some of the broad processes of political change that had created the public battles of the era.
richard l mccormick s from realignment to reform 1981 a study of political change in new york state argued that the crucial change in this era was the decline of the political parties and the rise of interest groups working for particular social and economic goals.
many historians see progressivism as rooted in gender and have focused on the role of women and the vast network of voluntary associations they created in shaping and promoting progressive reform historians kathryn sklar linda gordon ruth rosen and elaine tyler may among others argued that some progressive battles were part of an effort by women to protect their interests within the domestic sphere in the face of jarring challenges from the new industrial world.
this protective urge drew women reformers to such issues as temperance divorce prostitution and the regulation of female and child labor.
other women worked to expand their own roles professional women were teachers.
for educated black women in particular the existence of segregated schools in the south created a substantial market for african american teachers.
women also dominated other professional activities.
nursing had become primarily a womens field during and after the civil war.
by the early twentieth century it was adopting professional standards.
and many women entered academia often receiving advanced degrees at such predominantly male institutions as the university of chicago mit or columbia and finding professional opportunities in the new and expanding womens colleges.
women and reform the prominence of women in reform movements is one of the most striking features of progressivism.
in most states in the early twentieth century women could not vote.
they almost key role of women in reform causes never field public office.
they had footholds in only a few am usually primarily female professions and lived in a culture ii which most people male and female be lieved that women were not suited fc the public world.

the new woman the phenomenon of the new woman widely rem upon at the time was a product of social and econ socioeconomic changes that affected the private woi origins of the much as the public one even if new woman changes affected mostly middle class pie.
by the end of the nineteenth cer almost all income producing activity had moved out o home and into the factory or the office.
at the same 556 dm n d i r grand charge on the enemy s works other historians have sought to place progressiv ism in a broader context.
daniel rodgers s atlantic crossings 1998 is a study of how european reforms influenced american progressives.
both michael mcgerr in a fierce discontent 2003 and alan dawley in changing the world 2003 have characterized progressivism as a fundamentally moral undertaking.
mcgerr viewed it as an effort by the middle class to create order and stability whereas dawley saw it as an effort by groups on the left to attack social injustice.
given the range of disagreement over the nature of the progressive movement it is hardly surprising that some historians have despaired of finding any coherent definition for the term.
peter filene for one suggested in 1970 that the concept of progressivism as a movement had outlived its usefulness.
but daniel rodgers in an important 1982 article in search of progressivism disagreed.
the very diversity of progressivism he argued accounted both for its enormous impact on its time and for its capacity to reveal to us today the noise and tumult of an age of rapid social change.

progressivism cannot be understood historians of women contend without understanding the role of women and the importance of issues involving the family and the private world within it.
children were beginning school at earlier ages and spending more time there.
for many wives and mothers who did not work for wages the home was no longer an all consuming place.
technological innovations such as running water electricity and eventually household appliances made housework less onerous even if higher standards of cleanliness counterbalanced many of these gains.
declining family size also changed the lives of many women.
middle class white women in the late nineteenth century had fewer children than their mothers and grandmothers had borne.
they also lived longer.
many women thus now spent fewer years with young children in the home and lived more years after their children were grown.
some educated women shunned marriage believing that only by remaining single could they play the roles they envisioned in the public world.

boston marriages1 2 3 the clubwomen among the most visible signs of the increasing public roles of women in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were the women s clubs which proliferated rapidly beginning in the 1880s and 1890s and became the vanguard of many important reforms.
557 558 chapter 20 the womens clubs began largely as cultural organizations to provide middle and upper class women with an outlet for their intellectual energies.
in 1892 when women formed the gfwc general federation of womens clubs to coordinate the activities of local organizations there were more than 100 000 members in nearly 500 clubs.
by 1917 there were over 1 million.
by the early twentieth century the clubs were becoming less concerned with cultural activities and more concerned with contributing to social betterment.
because many club members were from wealthy families some organizations had substantial funds at their disposal to make their influence felt.
and ironically because women could not vote the clubs had a nonpartisan image that made them difficult for politicians to dismiss.
black women occasionally joined clubs dominated by whites.
but most such clubs excluded blacks and so african americans formed clubs of their own.
some of them affiliated with the general federation but most became part of the independent national association of colored women.
some black clubs also took positions on issues of particular concern to african americans such as lynching and aspects of segregation.
the womens club movement seldom raised overt challenges to prevailing assumptions about the proper role of women in society.
few clubwomen were willing to accept the arguments.
of such committed feminists as charlotte a jt jot t 2 space for perkins gilman who in her 1898 book women women and economics argued that the tra ditional definition of gender roles was exploitive and obsolete.
instead the club movement allowed women to define a space for themselves in the public world without openly challenging the existing male dominated order.
much of what the clubs did was uncontroversial planting trees supporting schools libraries and settlement houses building hospitals and parks.
but clubwomen were also an important force in winning passage of state and ultimately federal laws that regulated the conditions of woman and child labor established government inspection a aaaa ul b the colored womens league of washington d c.
the womens club movement spread widely thro h a african american women gathered to improve social and political conditions.

they were instrumental in pressuring state legislatures in most states to provide mothers pensions to widowed or abandoned mothers with small children a system that ultimately became absorbed into the social security system.
in 1912 they pressured congress into establishing the childrens bureau in the labor department an agency directed to develop policies to protect children.
in many of these efforts the clubwomen formed alliances with other womens groups such as the womens trade union womens league wtul founded in 1903 by fe trade union ma e union members and upper class re league formers.
it was committed to persuading women to join unions.
in addition to working on behalf of protective legislation for women wtul members held public meetings on behalf of female workers raised money to support strikes marched on picket lines and bailed striking women out of jail.
woman suffrage perhaps the largest single reform movement of the progressive era indeed one of the largest in american history was the fight for woman suffrage.
it is sometimes difficult for todays americans to understand why the suffrage issue could have become radical the source of such enormous controversy.
but challenge of the time suffrage seemed to many of its women s suffrage critics a very radical demand in part because of the rationale some of its early supporters used to advance it.
throughout the late nineteenth century many suffrage advocates presented their views in terms of natural rights arguing that women deserved the same rights as men including first and foremost the right to vote.
elizabeth cady stanton for example wrote in 1892 of woman as the arbiter of her own destiny if we are to consider her as a citizen as a member of a great nation she must have the same rights as all other members this was an argument that boldly challenged the views of the many men and women who believed that society required a distinctive female sphere in which women would serve first and foremost as wives and mothers.
and so a powerful antisuffrage movement emerged dominated by men but with the active support of many women.
opponents railed against the threat suffrage posed to the natural order of civilization.
antisuffragists many of them women associated suffrage with divorce not without some reason since many suffrage advocates also supported making it easier for women to obtain a divorce.
they linked suffrage with promiscuity immorality and neglect of children.
in the first years of the twentieth century the suffrage movement began to overcome this opposition and win some substantial victories in part because suffragists were becoming better organized and more politically sophisticated than their opponents.
under the leadership of anna howard shaw a boston social worker and carrie chapman catt a journalist nawsa from iowa membership in the national american woman suffrage association nawsa grew from about 13 000 in 1893 to over 2 million in 1917.
the movement gained strength because many of its most prominent leaders began to justify suffrage in safer less threatening ways.
suffrage some supporters began to argue would not challenge the separate sphere in which women resided.
it was they claimed precisely because women occupied shirtwaist workers on strike the womens trade union league was notable for bringing educated middle class women together with workers in efforts to improve factory and labor conditions.
these picketing women are workers in the ladies tailors garment factory in new york.
the library of congress lc dig ggbain 04507 560 chapter 20 suffrage pageant 1913 on march 3 1913 the day before woodrow wilsons inauguration as president more than 5 000 supporters of woman suffrage staged a parade in washington d c that overshadowed wilsons own arrival there.
crowds estimated at over half a million watched the parade not all of them admirers of the woman suffrage movement and some of the onlookers attacked the marchers.
the police did nothing to stop the attacks.
this photograph depicts a suffragist florence noyes costumed as liberty posing in front of the u s treasury building part of a pageant accompanying the parade.
woman suffrage was one of the most important and impassioned reform movements of the progressive era.
the library of congress a distinct sphere because as mothers and wives and homemakers they had special experiences and special sensitivities to bring to public life that woman suffrage could make such an important contribution to politics.
in particular many suffragists argued that enfranchising women would help the temperance movement by giving its largest group of supporters a political voice.
some suffrage advocates claimed that once women had the vote war would become a thing of the past since women would by their calming maternal influence help curb the belligerence of men.
that was one reason why world war i gave a final decisive push to the movement for suffrage.
suffrage also attracted support for other less optimistic reasons.
many middle class people found persuasive the argument that if blacks immigrants and other base groups had access to the franchise then it was a matter not only of justice but of common sense to allow educated well born women to vote.
the principal triumphs of the suffrage movement began in 1910 when washington became the first state in four nineteenth teen vears t0 extenc suffrage to women.
amendment california followed a year later and four other western states in 1912.
in 1913 illinois became the first state east of the mississippi to embrace woman suffrage.
and in 1917 and 1918 new york and michigan two of the most populous states in the union gave women the vote.
by 1919 thirty nine states had granted women the right to vote in at least some elections fifteen had allowed them full participation.
in 1920 finally suffragists won ratification of the nineteenth amendment which guaranteed political rights to women throughout the nation.
to some feminists however the victory seemed less than complete.
alice paul head of the militant national womans conservative arguments for suffrage party founded in 1916 never accepted the relatively conservative separate sphere justification for suffrage.
she argued that the nineteenth amendment alone would not be sufficient to protect womens rights.
women needed more a constitutional amendment that would provide clear legal protection for their rights and would prohibit all discrimination on the basis of sex.
but alice pauls argument found limited favor even among many of the most important leaders of the recently triumphant suffrage crusade.
the assault on the parties sooner or later most progressive goals required the involvement of government.
only government reformers agreed could effectively counter the many powerful private interests that threatened the nation.
but american government at the dawn of the new century was progressives believed poorly reforming adapted to perform their ambitious tasks.
at government every level political institutions were outmoded inefficient and corrupt.
before progressives could reform society effectively they would have to reform government itself.
many reformers believed the first step must be an assault on the dominant role the political par ties played in the life of the state.
attacks on party dominance had been frequent in the lai nineteenth century.
greenbackism and populism for exampl a been efforts to break the hammerlock with which tf repubhcans and democrats controlled public life.
th n ependent republicans or mugwumps had also attempte to challenge the grip of partisanship.
the progressives 561 these early assaults enjoyed some success.
in the 1880s and 1890s for example most states adopted the secret ballot.
prior to that the political parties themselves had printed ballots or tickets with the names of the partys candidates and no others.
they distributed the tickets to their supporters who then simply went to the polls to deposit them in the ballot box.
the old system had made it possible for bosses to monitor the voting behavior of their constituents it had also made it difficult for voters to split their tickets to vote for candidates of different parties for different offices.
the new secret ballot printed by the government and distributed at the polls to be filled out and deposited in secret helped chip away at the power of the parties over voters.
municipal reform many progressives such as lincoln steffens believed the impact of party rule was most damaging in the cities.
municipal government therefore became one of the first targets of those working for political reform.
the muckrakers struck a responsive chord among a powerful group of urban middle class progressives.
for several decades after the civil war respectable citizens of the nation s large cities had avoided participation in municipal government.
viewing politics as a debased and demeaning activity they shrank from contact with the vulgar ele middle class ments who were coming to dominate progressives public life.
by the end of the century however a new generation of activists some of them members of old aristocratic families others a part of the new middle class were taking a growing interest in government.
these activists faced a formidable array of opponents.
in addition to challenging the powerful city bosses and their entrenched political organizations they were attacking a large group of special interests saloon owners brothel keepers and perhaps most significantly those businessmen who had established lucrative relationships with the urban political machines and who viewed reform as a threat to their profits.
finally there was the great constituency of urban working people many of them recent immigrants to whom the machines were a source of needed jobs and services.
gradually however the reformers gained in political strength.
were replaced by an elected nonpartisan commission.
in 1907 des moines iowa adopted its own version of the commission plan and other cities followed.
another approach to municipal reform was the city manager plan by which elected officials hired an outside expert often a professionally trained business manager or engineer to take city manager charge of the city gvernment the city plan manager would presumably remain un tainted by the corrupting influence of politics.
by the end of the progressive era in the early 1920s almost 400 cities were operating under commissions and another 45 employed city managers.
in most urban areas the enemies of partnership had to settle for less absolute victories.
some cities made the election of mayors nonpartisan so that the parties could not choose the candidates or moved them to years when no presidential or congressional races were in progress to reduce the influence of the large turnouts that party organizations produced.
reformers tried to make city councilors run at large to limit the influence of ward leaders and district bosses.
they tried to strengthen the power of the mayor at the expense of the city council on the assumption that reformers were more likely to succeed in getting a sympathetic mayor elected than they were to win control of the entire council.
some of the most successful reformers emerged from conventional political structures that progressives came to control.
tom johnson as sentiment for municipal reform grew in intensity in the late nineteenth century it became possible for progressive mayors committed to ending boss rule to win election over machine candidates in some of americas largest cities.
one of the most prominent was tom johnson the reform mayor of cleveland.
johnson made a fortune in the steel and streetcar business and then entered politics partly as a result of reading henry georges poverty and progress.
he became mayor in 1901 and in his four terms waged strenuous battles against party bosses and corporate interests.
he won many fights but he lost what he considered his most important one the struggle for municipal ownership of public utilities.

but the age of reform as some scholars have called it was not just an american phenomenon.
it was part of a wave of social experimentation that was occurring through much of the industrial world.
several industrializing nations the united states britain germany and france adopted the term progressivism for their efforts but the term that most broadly defined the new reform energies was social democracy.
social democrats in many countries shared a belief in the betterment of society not through religion or inherited ideology but through the accumulation of knowledge.
they favored improving the social condition of all people through economic reforms and government programs of social protection.
and they believed that these changes could come through peaceful political change rather than through radicalism or revolution.
political parties committed to these goals emerged in several countries the labour party in britain social democratic parties in various european nations and the short lived progressive party in the united states.
intellectuals academics and government officials across the world shared the knowledge they were accumulating and observed social programs.
an important moment in the growth of social democracy were the many paris expositions of 1889 and 1900.
their symbol was the famous eiffel tower and their meaning for many progressives was the possibilities of progress through industrial innovation.
not only tourists but progressive experts as well visited the paris expositions and they held meetings while they were there to share their visions of the future.
at the turn of the century american reformers visited germany france britain belgium and the netherlands observing the reforms in progress there while european reformers visited the united states.
reformers from both the united states and europe were also fascinated by the advanced social experiments in australia and especially new zealand which the american reformer henry demarest lloyd once called the political brain of the modern world.
new zealand s dramatic experiments in factory regulation woman suffrage old age pensions progressive taxation and labor arbitration gradually found counterparts in many other nations.

hazen pingree of detroit samuel golden rule jones of toledo and other mayors effectively challenged local party bosses to bring the spirit of reform into city government.
statehouse progressivism the assault on boss rule in the cities did not however always produce results.
consequently many progressives turned to state government as an agent for reform.
they looked with particular scorn on state legislatures whose ill paid undistinguished members they believed were generally incompetent often corrupt and totally controlled by party bosses.
reformers 562 began looking for ways to circumvent the boss controlled legislatures by increasing the power of the electorate.
two of the most important changes were innovations first proposed by populists in the 1890s the initiative and the initiative and referendum.
the initiative allowed reform referendum ers to circumvent state legislatures by submitting new legislation directly to the voters m general elections.
the referendum provided a method by which actions of the legislature could be returned to the electorate for approval.
by 1918 more than twenty states had enacted one or both of these reforms.
similarly the direct primary and the recall were efforts to limit the power of party and improve the quality of elected direct primary and recall officials.
the primary election was an attempt to take the selection of candidates away from the bosses and give it to the peo.
p e qn the south it was also an effort to n lt voting since primary voting many white southerners e leved would be easier to control than general elections.

french reformers pressed in the 1890s for factory regulation assistance to the elderly and progressive taxation.
britain pioneered the settlement houses in working class areas of london a movement that soon spread to the united states as well and like the united states witnessed growing challenges to the power of monopolies at both the local and national level in many countries social democrats felt pressure from the rising worldwide labor movement and from the rise of socialist parties in many industrial countries.
strikes sometimes violent were common in france germany britain and the united states in the late nineteenth century.
the more militant workers became the more unions grew social democrats did not always welcome the rise of militant labor movements but they took them seriously and tried to use them to support their own reform efforts.
the politics of social democracy represented a great shift in the character of public life all over the industrial world.
instead of battles over the privileges of aristocrats or the power of monarchs reformers now focused on the social problems of ordinary people and attempted to improve their lot.
the politics of the future are social politics the british reformer joseph chamberlain said in the 1880s referring to efforts to deal with the problems of ordinary citizens.
that belief was fueling progressive efforts across the world in the years that americans have come to call the progressive era.

they regulated railroads and utilities.
they passed laws to regulate the workplace and provide compensation for laborers injured on the job.
they instituted graduated taxes on inherited fortunes and they nearly doubled state levies on railroads and other corporate interests.
la follette used his personal magnetism to widen public awareness of progressive goals.
reform was the responsibility not simply of politicians he argued but of newspapers citizens groups educational institutions and business and professional organizations as well.
parties and interest groups the reformers did not of course eliminate parties from american political life.
but they did contribute to a decline in party influence.
evidence of their impact decline of r party came from among other things the decline influence in voter turnout.
in the late nineteenth century up to 81 percent of eligible voters routinely turned out for national elections because of the recall gave voters the right to remove a public official from office at a special election which could be called after a sufficient number of citizens had signed a petition.
by 1915 every state in the nation had instituted primary elections for at least some offices.
the recall encountered more strenuous opposition but a few states such as california adopted it as well.
other reform measures attempted to clean up the legislatures themselves.
between 1903 and 1908 twelve states passed laws restricting lobbying by business interests in state legislatures.
in those same years twenty two states banned campaign contributions by corporations and twenty four states forbade public officials to accept free passes from railroads.
many states also struggled successfully to create systems of workmens compensation for workers injured on the job.
and starting in 191b reformers successfully created pensions for widows with dependent children.
reform efforts proved most effective in states that ele vated vigorous and committed politicians to positions of leadership.
in new york governor charles evans hughes exploited progressive sentiment to create a commission to robert la follette campaigning in wisconsin after three terms as governor of wisconsin la follette began a long career in the u s senate in 1906 during which he worked uncompromisingly for advanced progressive reforms so uncompromisingly in fact that he was often almost completely isolated.
he titled a chapter of his autobiography alone in the senate.
la follette had a greater impact on his own state whose politics he and his sons dominated for nearly forty years and where he was able to win passage of many reforms that the federal government resisted.
the library of congress lc dig ggbain 06406 564 chapter 20 strength of party loyalty.
in the early twentieth century while turnout remained high by today s standards the figure declined markedly as parties grew weaker.
in the presidential election of 1900 73 percent of the electorate voted.
by 1912 that figure had declined to about 59 percent.
never again did voter turnout reach as high as 70 percent.
why did voter turnout decline in these years.
the secret ballot was one reason.
party bosses had less ability to get voters to the polls.
illiterate voters had trouble reading the new ballots.
party bosses lost much of their authority and were unable to mobilize voters as successfully as they had in the past.
but perhaps the most important reason for the decline of party rule and voter turnout was that other power centers were beginning to replace them.
they have become known as interest groups beginning late in the nineteenth century and accelerating rapidly in the twentieth new organizations emerged outside the party system professional organizations trade associations representing businesses and industries labor organizations farm lobbies and many others.
social workers the settlement house movement womens clubs and others learned to operate as interest groups to advance their demands.
sources of progressive reform middle class reformers most of them from the east dominated the public image and much of the substance of progressivism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
but they were not alone in seeking to improve social conditions.
working class americans african americans westerners and even party bosses also played crucial roles in advancing some of the important reforms of the era.
labor the machine and reform although the american federation of labor and its leader samuel gompers remained largely aloof from many of the reform efforts of the time reflecting gomperss firm belief that workers should not rely on government to improve their lot some unions played important roles in reform battles.
between 1911 and 1913 thanks to political pressure from labor groups such as the newly formed union labor party california passed a child labor law a workmens compensation law and a limitation on working hours for women.
union pressures contributed to the passage of similar laws in many other states as well.
one result of the assault on the parties was a change in the party organizations themselves which attempted to adapt to the new realities so as to preserve their influence.
they sometimes allowed their machines to become vehicles of social reform.
one example was new york citys tammany hall the percentage 818 79 4 triangle shirtwaist fire nations oldest and most notorious city machine.
its astute leader charles francis murphy began in the early years of the century to fuse the techniques of boss rule with some of the concerns of social reformers.
tammany began to use its political power on behalf of legislation to improve working conditions protect child laborers and eliminate the worst abuses of the industrial economy.
in 1911 a terrible fire swept through the factory of the triangle shirtwaist company in new york city 146 workers most of them women died.
many of them had been trapped inside the burning building because management had locked the emergency exits to prevent malingering.
for the next three years a state commission studied not only the background of the fire but also the general condition of the industrial workplace.
it was responding to intense public pressure from womens groups and new york city labor unions and to quiet pressure from tammany hall.
by 1914 the commission had issued a series of reports calling for major reforms in the conditions of modern labor.
the report itself was a classic progressive document based on the testimony of experts filled with statistics and technical data.
yet when its recommendations reached the new york legislature its most effective supporters were not middle class progressives but two tammany democrats from working class backgrounds senator robert f wagner and assemblyman alfred e smith.

western progressives the american west produced some of the most notable progressive leaders of the time hiram johnson of california george norris of nebraska william borah of idaho and others almost all of whom spent at least some of their political careers in the u s senate.
for western states the most important target of reform energies was not state or local governments which had relatively little power but the federal government which exercised a kind of authority in the west that it had never possessed in the east.
that was in part because some of the most important issues to the future of the west required action above the state level.
disputes over water for example almost always involved rivers and streams that crossed state lines.
the question of which states had the rights to the waters of the colorado river created a political battle that no state government could resolve the federal government had to arbitrate.
more significant perhaps the federal government exercised enormous power over the lands and resources of the western states and provided substantial subsidies to the region in the form of land grants and support for railroad and water projects.
huge areas of the west remained and still remain public lands controlled by washington a far greater proportion than in any states east of the mississippi.
much of the growth of the west was and continues to be a result of federally funded dams and water projects.

but among african americans themselves the progressive era produced some significant challenges to existing racial norms.

du bois 566 chapter 20 african americans faced greater obstacles than any other group in challenging their own oppressed status and seeking reform.
thus it was not surprising perhaps that so many embraced the message of booker t washington in the late nineteenth century to put down your bucket where you are to work for immediate self improvement rather than long range social change.
not all african americans however were content with this approach.
and by the turn of the century a powerful challenge was emerging a challenge to the philosophy of washington but more important to the entire structure of race relations.
the chief spokesman for this new approach was w e b.
du bois unlike washington had never known slavery.
born in massachusetts educated at fisk university in nashville and at harvard he grew to maturity with a more expansive view than washington of the goals of his race and the responsibilities of white society to eliminate prejudice and injustice.
in the souls of black folk 1903 he launched an open attack on the philosophy of washington accusing him of encouraging white efforts to impose segregation and of limiting the aspirations of his race.
is it possible and probable he asked that nine millions of men can make effective progress in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights made a servile caste and allowed only the most meager chance for developing their exceptional men.
if history and reason give any distinct answer to these questions it is an emphatic no rather than content themselves with education at the trade and agricultural schools du bois advocated talented blacks should accept nothing less than a full university education.
they should aspire to the professions.
they should above all fight for their civil rights not simply wait for them to be granted as a reward for patient striving.
in 1905 du bois and a group of his supporters met at niagara falls on the canadian side of the border because no hotel on the american side of the falls would naacp have them and launched what became founded known as the niagara movement.
four years later after a race riot in springfield illinois they joined with white progressives sympathetic to their cause to form the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp.
whites held most of the offices at first but du bois its director of publicity and research was the guiding spirit.
in the ensuing years the new organization led the drive for equal rights using as its principal weapon lawsuits in the federal courts.
within less than a decade the naacp had begun to win some important victories.
in guinn v united states 1915 the supreme court supported its position that the grandfather clause in an oklahoma law was unconstitutional.
the statute denied the vote to any citizen whose ancestors had not been enfranchised in 1860.
in buchanan v worley 1917 the court struck down a louisville kentucky law requiring residential segregation.
the naacp established itself particularly after booker t washington s death in 1915 as one of the nations leading black organizations a position it would maintain for many years.
among the many issues that engaged the naacp and other african american organizations was the phenomenon of lynch ing in the south.
du bois was an outspoken critic of lynching and an advocate of a federal law making it illegal since state courts the young w e b.
du bois this formal photograph of w e b.
du bois was taken in 1899 when he was thirty one years old and a professor at atlanta university.
he had just published the philadelphia negro a classic sociological study of an urban community which startled many readers with its description of the complex class system among african americans in the city.
hulton archive getty images in the south routinely refused to prosecute lynchers.
but the most determined opponents of lynching were southern women.
they included white women such as jessie daniel ames.
the most effective crusader was a black woman ida wells barnett who worked both on her own at great personal risk and with such organizations as the national association of colored women and the womens convention of the national baptist church to try to discredit lynching and challenge segregation.
crusade for social order and reform formers directed many of their energies at the political process.
but they also crusaded on behalf of what they consid ere moral issues.
there were campaigns to eliminate alcohol the progressives 567 from national life to curb prostitution to limit divorce and to restrict immigration.
proponents of each of those reforms be lieved that success would help regenerate society as a whole.
the temperance crusade many progressives considered the elimination of alcohol from american life a necessary step in restoring order to society.
scarce wages vanished as workers spent hours in the saloons.
drunkenness spawned violence and occasionally murder within urban families.
working class wives and mothers hoped through temperance to reform male behavior and thus improve womens lives.
employers too regarded alcohol as an impediment to industrial efficiency workers often missed time on the job because of drunkenness or came to the factory intoxicated.
critics of economic privilege denounced the liquor industry as one of the nations most sinister trusts.
and political reformers who correctly looked on the saloon as one of the central institutions of the urban machine saw an attack on drinking as part of an attack on the bosses.
out of such sentiments emerged the temperance movement.
temperance had been a major reform movement before the civil war mobilizing large numbers of people in a cru wctu sa e witd stron evangelical overtones.
in 1873 the movement developed new strength.
temperance advocates formed the womens christian temperance union wctu led after 1879 by frances willard.
by 1911 it had 245 000 members and had become the single largest womens organization in american history to that point.
in 1893 the anti saloon league joined the temperance movement and along with the wctu began to press for a specific legislative solution the legal abolition of saloons.
gradually that demand grew to include the complete prohibition of the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages.
despite substantial opposition from immigrant and working class voters pressure for prohibition grew steadily through the first decades of the new century.
by 1916 nine eighteenth teen states had passed prohibition laws.
amendment but since the consumption of alcohol was actually increasing in many unregulated areas temperance advocates were beginning to advocate a national prohibition law.
americas entry into world war i and the moral fervor it unleashed provided the last push to the advocates of prohibition.
in 1917 with the support of rural fundamentalists who opposed alcohol on moral and religious grounds progressive advocates of prohibition steered through congress a constitutional amendment embodying their demands.
two years later after ratification by every state in the nation except connecticut and rhode island bastions of catholic immigrants the eighteenth amendment became law to take effect in january 1920.
total immigration during 4 96 five year periods in millions 1901 1906 1911 1916 1905 1910 1915 1920 total immigration 1900 1920 emigration to the united states reached the highest level in the nation s history to that point in the first fifteen years of the twentieth century.
in the nineteenth century there was no five year period when as many as 3 million immigrants arrived in america.
in the first fifteen years of the twentieth century more than 3 million newcomers arrived in every five year period and in one of them as this chart reveals the number reached almost 5 million.
the library of congress 3a38144u why did the flow of immigrants drop so sharply in the period 1916 1920.
568 chapter 20 i i immigration restriction virtually all reformers agreed that the growing immigrant population had created social problems but there was wide disagreement on how best to respond.
some progressives believed that the proper approach was to help the new residents adapt to american society.
others argued that efforts at assimilation had failed and that the only solution was to limit the flow of new arrivals.
in the first decades of the century pressure grew to close the nations gates.
new scholarly theories appealing to the eugenics and prgressive respect for expertise argued nativism that the introduction of immigrants into american society was polluting the nations racial stock.
among the theories created to support this argument was eugenics the science of altering the reproductive processes of plants and animals to produce new hybrids or breeds.
in the early twentieth century there was an effort funded by the carnegie foundation to turn eugenics into a method of altering human reproduction as well.
but the eugenics movement when applied to humans was not an effort to breed new people an effort for which no scientific tools existed.
it was rather an effort to grade races and ethnic groups according to their genetic qualities.
eugenicists advocated the forced sterilization of the mentally retarded criminals and others.
but they also spread the belief that sources of immigration 1900 1920 at least as striking as the increase in immigration in the early twentieth century was the change in its sources.
in the nineteenth century the vast majority of immigrants to the united states had come from northern and western europe especially britain ireland germany and scandinavia.
now as this chart shows the major sources were southern and eastern europe with over 60 percent coming from italy russia and the eastern european regions of the austro hungarian empire.
what impact did these changing sources have on attitudes toward immigration in the united states.
human inequalities were hereditary and that immigration was contributing to the multiplication of the unfit.
skillful publicists such as madison grant whose the passing of the great race 1916 established him as the nations most effective nativist warned of the dangers of racial mongrelization and of the importance of protecting the purity of anglo saxon and other nordic stock from pollution by eastern europeans latin americans and asians.
a special federal commission of experts chaired by senator william p dillingham of vermont issued a study filled with statistics and scholarly testimony.
it argued that the newer immigrant groups largely southern and eastern europeans had proven themselves less assimilable than earlier immigrants.
immigration the report implied should be restricted by nationality.
many people who rejected these racial arguments nevertheless supported limiting immigration as a way to solve such urban problems as overcrowding unemployment strained social services and social unrest.
the combination of these concerns gradually won for the nativists the support of some of the nations leading progressives among them former president theodore roosevelt.
powerful opponents employers who saw immigration as a source of cheap labor immigrants themselves and their political repre sentatives managed to block the restriction movement for a time.
but by the beginning of world war i which effectively blocked immigration temporarily the nativist tide was gaining strength.
challenging the capitalist order if there was one issue that overshadowed and helped to shape all others in the minds of reformers it was the character of the dramatically growing modern industrial economy.
most of the problems that concerned progressives could be traced back directly or indirectly to the growing power and influence and also reformers believed corruption of corporate america.
so it is not surprising that prominent among progressive concerns was reshaping or reforming the behavior of the capitalist world.
the dream of socialism at no time in the history of the united states to that point and seldom after did radical critiques of the capitalist system attract more support than in the period 1900 1914.
although eugene debs never a force to rival or even seriously threaten the two major parties the socialist party of america grew during these years into a force of considerable strength.
in the election of 1900 it had attracted the support of fewer than 100 000 voters in 1912 its durable leader and perennial presidential candidate eugene v debs received nearly l million ballots.
strongest in urban immigrant the progressives 569 may day 1908 the american socialist party staged this vast rally in new york citys union square to celebrate may day in 1908.
the second socialist international had designated may day as the official holiday for radical labor in 1899.
corbis communities particularly among germans and jews it also attracted the loyalties of a substantial number of protestant farmers in the south and midwest.
socialists won election to over 1 000 state and local offices.
and they had the support at limes of such intellectuals as lincoln steffens the crusader against municipal corruption and walter lippmann the brilliant young journalist and social critic.
florence kelley frances willard and other women reformers were attracted to socialism too in part because of its support for pacifism and labor organizing.
virtually all socialists agreed on the need for basic structural changes in the economy but they differed widely on the extent of those changes and the tactics necessary to achieve ihem.
some socialists endorsed the radical goals of european marxists others envisioned a moderate reform that would allow small scale private enterprise to survive but would wobbl nationalize major industries.
some believed in working for reform through electoral politics others favored militant direct action.
among the militants was the radical labor union the industrial workers of the world iww known to opponents as the wobblies a nickname of unknown origin.
under the leadership of william big bill haywood the iww advocated a single union for all workers and abolition of the wage slave system it rejected political action in favor of strikes especially the general strike.
the wobblies were widely believed to have been responsible for the dynamiting of railroad lines and power stations and other acts of terror in the first years of the twentieth century.
the iww was one of the few labor organizations of the time to champion the cause of unskilled workers and had particular strength in the west where a large group of migratory laborers miners timbermen and others found it very difficult to organize or sustain conventional unions.
in 1917 a strike by iww timber workers in washington and idaho shut down production in the industry.
that brought down upon the union the wrath of the federal government which had just begun mobilizing for war and needed timber for war production.
federal authorities imprisoned the leaders of the i and state governments between 1917 and 1919 passed a of laws that outlawed the iww.
the organization surviv a time but never fully recovered.
570 chapter 20 louis brandeis brandeis graduated from harvard law school in 1877 with the best academic record of any student in the schools previous or subsequent history.
his success in his boston law practice was such that by the early twentieth century he was able to spend much of his time in unpaid work for public causes.
his investigations of monopoly power soon made him a major figure in the emerging progressive movement.
woodrow wilson nominated him for the u s supreme court in january 1916.
he was one of the few nominees in the court s history never to have held prior public office and he was the first jew ever to have been nominated.
the appointment aroused five months of bitter controversy in the senate before brandeis was finally confirmed.
for the next twenty years he was one of the courts most powerful members all the while lobbying behind the scenes on behalf of the many political causes preeminent among them zionism the founding of a jewish state to which he remained committed.
bettmann corbis moderate socialists who advocated peaceful change through political struggle dominated the socialist party.
they empha sized a gradual education of the public to socialism s r.
rr demise neec or change and patient efforts within the system to enact it.
but world war i dramatically weakened the socialists.
they had refused to support the war effort and a growing wave of antiradicalism subjected them to enormous harassment and persecution.
decentralization and regulation most progressives retained a faith in the possibilities of reform within a capitalist system.
rather than nationalize basic industries many reformers hoped to restore the economy to a more human scale.
few envisioned a return to a society of small local enterprises some consolidation they recognized was inevitable.
they did however argue that the federal government should work to break up the largest combinations and enforce a balance between the need for bigness and the need for competition.
this viewpoint came to be identified particularly closely with louis d brandeis a brilliant lawyer and later justice of the supreme court who wrote widely most notably in his 1913 book other peoples money about the curse of big the problem of corporate centralization good trusts and bad trusts ness.
brandeis and his supporters opposed bigness in part because they considered it inefficient.
but their opposition had a moral basis as well.
bigness was a threat not just to efficiency but to freedom as well.
it limited the ability of individuals to control their own destinies.
it encour aged abuses of power.
government must brandeis insisted regulate competition in such a way as to ensure that large combinations did not emerge.
other progressives were less enthusiastic about the virtues of competition.
more important to them was efficiency which they believed economic concentration encouraged.
what government should do they argued was not to fight bigness but to guard against abuses of power by large institutions.
it should distinguish between good trusts and bad trusts encouraging the good while disciplining the bad.
since economic consolidation was destined to remain a permanent feature of american society continuing oversight by a strong modernized government was essential.
one of the most influential spokesmen for this emerging nationalist position was herbert croly whose 1909 book the promise of american life became an influential progressive document.
increasingly the attention of nationalists such as croly focused on some form of coordination of the industrial economy.
society must act walter lippmann wrote in a notable 1914 book drift and mastery to introduce plan where there has been clash and purpose into the jungles of disordered growth to some nationalists that meant businesses themselves learning new ways of cooperation and self regulation.
to others the solution was for government to play a more active role in regulating and planning economic life.
one of those who came to endorse that position although not fully until after 1910 was theodore roosevelt who once said we should enter upon a course of supervision control and regulation of those great corporations roosevelt became for a time the most powerful symbol of the reform impulse at the national level.
theodore roosevelt and the modern presidency presidents in general are not lovable the famous writer and columnist walter lippmann who had known many said near t e end of his life.
theyve had to do too much to get where they are.
but there was one president who was lovable teddy roosevelt and i loved him the progressives 571 lippmann was not alone.
to a generation of progressive reformers theodore roosevelt was more than an admired public figure he was an idol.
no president before and few since had attracted such attention and devotion.
yet for all his popularity among reformers roosevelt was in many respects decidedly conservative.
he earned his extraordinary popularity less because of the extent of the reforms he championed than because he brought to his office a broad conception of its powers and invested the presidency with something of its modern status as the center of national political life.
the accidental president when president william mckinley suddenly died in september 1901 the victim of an assassination roosevelt who had been elected vice president less than a year before was only forty two years old the youngest man ever to assume the presidency.
i told william mckinley that it was a mistake to nominate that wild man at philadelphia party boss mark hanna was reported to have exclaimed.
now look that damned cowboy is president of the united states roosevelts reputation as a wild man was a result less of the substance of his early political career than of its style.
as a roosevelts young member of the new york legisla background ture hnd displayed an energy seldom seen in that lethargic body.
as a rancher in the dakota badlands where he retired briefly after the sudden death of his first wife he had helped capture outlaws.
as new york city police commissioner he had been a flamboyant battler against crime and vice.
as assistant secretary of the navy he had been a bold proponent of american expansion.
as commander of the rough riders he had led a heroic if militarily useless charge in the battle of san juan hill in cuba during the spanish american war.
but roosevelt as president rarely rebelled against the leaders of his party.
he became rather a champion of cautious moderate change.
reform he believed was a vehicle less for remaking american society than for protecting it against radical challenges.
overnment capital and labor roosevelts vision of deral power sevelt allied himself with those progressives who urged jlation but not destruction of the trusts.
at the heart of roosevelts policy was his desire to win for government the power to investigate the activities of corporations and publicize the results.
the new department of imerce and labor established in 1903 later to be divided two separate departments was to assist in this task ugh its investigatory arm the bureau of corporations though roosevelt was not a trustbuster at heart he made m highly publicized efforts to break up combinations.
in 2 he ordered the justice department to invoke the man antitrust act against a great new railroad monopoly m northwest the northern securities company a 400 president theodore roosevelt to a generation of progressive reformers theodore roosevelt was an idol.
no president before and few since had attracted such attention and devotion from the american people.
the library of congress lc dig ppmsca 37602 northern securities company million enterprise pieced together by j p morgan and others.
to morgan accustomed to a warm supportive relationship with republican administrations the action was baffling.
he told the president if we have done any thing wrong send your man to my man and they can fix it up roosevelt proceeded with the case nonetheless and in 1904 the supreme court ruled that the northern securities company must be dissolved.
although he filed more than forty additional antitrust suits during the remainder of his presidency roosevelt had no serious commitment to reverse the prevailing trend toward economic concentration.
a similar commitment to establishing the government as an impartial regulatory mechanism shaped roosevelts policy toward labor.
in the past federal intervention in industrial disputes had almost always meant action on behalf of employers.
roosevelt was willing to consider labors position as well.
when a bitter 1902 strike by the united mine workers endangered coal supplies for the coming winter roosevelt asked both the operators and the miners to accept impartial federal arbitration.
when the mine owners balked roosevelt threatened to send federal troops to seize the mines.
the operators finally relented.
arbitrators awarded the strikers a 10 percent wage increase and a nine hour day although no recognition of their union less than they had wanted but more than they would likely have a leader in americas conservation dedicated to conserving america movement naturalist john muir 1838 1914 was born in scotland and grew up in wisconsin.
he went to california in 1868 and spent several years in the american west exploring the land and studying the trees forests and glaciers of the area before settling permanently in california in 1880.
he campaigned for the establishment of yosemite national park a goal achieved in 1890.
through his friendship with president theodore roosevelt he persuaded the president to greatly increase the amount of protected public land.
as a dedicated conservationist muir wrote articles attempting to rouse the public to the need to protect public lands.
in addition to the public lands he helped protect and preserve muir created another lasting legacy the sierra club an organization that he co founded and that is still thriving today.
the two source documents below are thus both connected to john muir.
the first is an excerpt from his book our national parks.
the second is a reprinting of the sierra club s current stated purposes and goals.
our national parks 1901 from chapter 1 the wild parks and forest reservations of the west by john muir the tendency nowadays to wander in wildernesses is delightful to see.
thousands of tired nerve shaken over civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home that wildness is a necessity and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers but as fountains of life.
awakening from the stupefying effects of the vice of over industry and the deadly apathy of luxury they are trying as best they can to mix and enrich their own little ongoings with those of nature and to get rid of rust and disease.
briskly venturing and roaming some are washing off sins and cobweb cares of the devils spinning in all day storms on mountains sauntering in rosiny pine woods or in gentian meadows brushing through chaparral bending down and parting sweet flowery sprays tracing rivers to their sources getting in touch with the nerves of mother earth jumping from rock to rock feeling the life of them learning the songs of them panting in whole souled exercise and rejoicing in deep long drawn breaths of pure wildness.
this is fine and natural and full of promise.
so also is the growing interest in the care and preservation of forests and wild places in general and in the half wild parks and gardens of towns.
when like a merchant taking a list of his goods we take stock of our wildness we are glad to see how much of even the most destructible kind is still unspoiled.
looking at our continent as scenery when it was all wild lying between beautiful seas the starry sky above it the starry rocks beneath it to compare its sides the east and the west would be like comparing the sides of a rainbow.
but it is no longer equally beautiful.
t he continents outer beauty is fast passing away especially the plant part of it the most destructible and most universally charming of all.
only thirty years ago the great central valley of california five hundred miles long and fifty miles wide was one bed of golden and purple flowers.
now it is ploughed and pastured out of existence gone forever scarce a memory of it left in fence corners and along the bluffs of the streams.
the same fate sooner or later is awaiting them all unless awaken ing public opinion conies forward to stop it.

574 chapter 20 boys in the mines these young boys covered in grime and no more than twelve years old pose for the noted photographer lewis hine outside the coal mine in pennsylvania where they separated coal from slate in coal breakers.
the rugged conditions endured by mine workers were one cause of the great strike of 1902 in which theodore roosevelt intervened.
the library of congress won without roosevelts intervention.
roosevelt viewed himself as no more the champion of labor than as a champion of management.
on several occasions he ordered federal troops to intervene in strikes on behalf of employers.
the square deal during roosevelts first years as president he was principally concerned with winning reelection which required that he not antagonize the conservative republican old guard.
by skillfully dispensing patronage to conservatives and progressives alike and by winning the support of northern businessmen while making adroit gestures to reformers roosevelt had neutralized his opposition within the party by early 1904.
he won its presidential nomination with ease.
and in the general election where he faced a dull conservative democrat alton b parker he captured over 57 percent of the popular vote and lost no states outside the south.
during the 1904 campaign roosevelt boasted that he had worked in the anthracite coal strike to provide everyone with a square deal one of his first targets after the election hepburn act was r e powerful railroad industry.
the interstate commerce act of 1887 establishing the interstate commerce commission icc had been an early effort to regulate the industry but over the years the courts had sharply limited its influence.
roosevelt asked congress for legislation to increase the governments power to oversee railroad rates.
the hepburn railroad regulation act of 1906 sought to restore some regulatory authority to the government although the bill was so cautious that it satisfied few progressives.
roosevelt also pressured congress to enact the pure food and drug act which restricted the sale of dangerous or ineffective medicines.
when upton sinclairs powerful novel the jungle appeared in 1906 featuring appalling descrip and emtuo ct tions of conditions in the meatpacking industry roosevelt pushed for passage of the meat inspection act which helped eliminate many diseases once transmitted in impure meat.
starting in 1907 he proposed but mostly failed to achieve even more stringent reforms an eight hour workday broader compensation for victims of industrial accidents inheritance and income taxes regulation of the stock market and others.
he also started openly to criticize conservatives in congress and the judiciary who were obstructing these programs.
the result was a widening gulf between the president and the conservative wing of his party.
roosevelt and conservation roosevelts aggressive policies on behalf of conservation contributed to that gulf.
using executive powers he restricted private development on millions of acres of undeveloped government land most of it in the west by adding them to the previously modest national forest system.
when conservatives in congress restricted his authority over public lands in 1907 roosevelt and his chief forester gifford pinchot seized all the forests and many of the water power sites still in the public domain before the bill became law.
roosevelt was the first president to take an active interest in the new and struggling american conservation movement.
in the early twentieth century the idea of preserving the natural world for ecological reasons was not well established.
instead many people who considered themselves conservationists such as pinchot the first director of the national forest service which he helped to create promoted policies to protect land for carefully managed development.
the progressives 575 the old guard eagerly supported another important aspect of roosevelts natural resource policy public reclamation and irriga federal aid tion pro ects in 1902 the president backed to the west national reclamation act better known as the newlands act named for its sponsor nevada senator francis newlands.
the newlands act provided federal funds for the construction of dams reservoirs and canals in the west projects that would open new lands for cultivation and years later provide cheap electric power.
roosevelt and preservation despite his sympathy with pine hots vision of conservation roosevelt also shared some of the concerns of the naturalists those within the conservation movement committed to protecting the natural beauty of the land and the health of its wildlife from human intrusion.
early in his presidency roosevelt even spent four days camping in the sierras with john muir the nations leading preservationist and the founder of the sierra club.
roosevelt added significantly to the still young national park system whose purpose was to protect public land from any exploitation or development.
congress had created the first national park yellowstone in wyoming in 1872 and had authorized others in the 1890s yosemite and sequoia in california and mount rainier in washington state.
roosevelt added land to several existing parks and also created new ones crater lake in oregon mesa verde in utah platt in oklahoma and wind cave in south dakota.

576 chapter 20 meaning grassy meadows was a spectacular high walled valley popular with naturalists.
but many residents of san francisco worried about finding enough water to serve their growing population saw hetch hetchy as an ideal place for a dam which would create a large reservoir for the city a plan that muir and other naturalists furiously opposed.
in 1906 san francisco suffered a devastating earthquake and fire.
widespread sympathy for the city strengthened the case for the dam and theodore roosevelt who had initially expressed some sympathy for muirs position turned the decision over to gifford pinchot.
pinchot had no interest in muirs aesthetic and spiritual arguments.
he approved construction of the dam.
for over a decade a battle raged between naturalists and the advocates of the dam a battle that consumed the ener cqmfeting 8ies jhn mtm for the rest of his life conservationist ard that eventually many people be visions lieved led to his death.
dam hetch hetchy muir once said.
as well dam for water tanks the peoples cathedrals and churches for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man to pinchot there was no question that the needs of the city were more important than the claims of preservation.
muir helped place a referendum question on the ballot in 1908 certain that the residents of the city would oppose the project as soon as light is cast upon it instead san franciscans approved the dam by a huge margin.
although there were many more delays in succeeding years construction of the dam finally began after world war i.
this setback for the naturalists was not however a total defeat.
the fight against hetch hetchy helped mobilize a new coalition of people committed to preservation not rational use of wilderness.
the panic of 1907 despite the flurry of reforms roosevelt was able to enact the government still had relatively little control over the industrial economy.
that became clear in 1907 when a serious panic and recession began.
conservatives blamed roosevelts mad economic policies for the disaster.
and while the president naturally and correctly disagreed he nevertheless acted coa and ron quickly to reassure business leaders that he company would not interfere with their recovery ef forts.
j p morgan in a spectacular display of his financial power helped construct a pool of the assets of several important new york banks to prop up shaky financial institutions.
the key to the arrangement morgan told the president was the purchase by u s steel of the shares of the tennessee coal and iron company currently held by a threatened new york bank.
he would he insisted need assurances that the purchase would not prompt antitrust action.
roosevelt tacitly agreed and the morgan plan proceeded.
whether or not as a result the panic soon subsided.
roosevelt loved being president.
as his years in office produced increasing political successes as his public popularity continued to rise more and more observers began to assume roosevelt and muir in yosemite john muir founder and leader of the sierra club considered theodore roosevelt a friend and ally a relationship cemented by a four day camping trip the two men took together in yosemite national park in 1903.
roosevelt was indeed a friend to the national park and national forest systems and added considerable acreage to both.
among other things he expanded yosemite at muirs request.
but unlike muir roosevelt was also committed to economic development.
as a result he was not always a reliable ally of the most committed preservationists.
bettmann corbis the progressives 577 that he would run for reelection in 1908 despite the long standing tradition of presidents serving no more than two terms.
but the panic of 1907 combined with roosevelts growing radicalism during his second term so alienated conservatives in his own party that he might have had difficulty winning the republican nomination.
in 1904 moreover he had made a public promise to step down four years later.
and so in 1909 roosevelt fifty years old retired from public life briefly.
the troubled succession william howard taft who assumed the presidency in 1909 had been theodore roosevelt s most trusted lieutenant and his handpicked successor progressive reformers believed him to be one of their own.
but taft had also been a restrained and william moderate jurist a man with a punctilious howard taft regard for legal process conservatives expected him to abandon roosevelt s aggressive use of presidential powers.
by seeming acceptable to almost everyone taft easily won election to the white house in 1908.
he received his partys nomination virtually uncontested.
his victory in the general election in november over william jennings bryan running for the democrats for the third time was a foregone conclusion.
four years later however taft would leave office the most decisively defeated president of the twentieth century his party deeply divided and the government in the hands of a democratic administration for the first time in twenty years.
taft and the progressives tafts first problem arose in the opening months of the new administration when he called congress into special session to payne aldrich lower protective tariff rates an old prgres tariff sive demand but the president made no effort to overcome the opposition of the congressional old guard arguing that to do so would violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.
the result was the feeble payne aldrich tariff which reduced tariff rates scarcely at all and in some areas raised them.
progressives re sented the presidents passivity.
taft may not have been a champion of reform but neither was he a consistent opponent of change.
in 1912 he supported and signed legislation to create a federal childrens bureau to investigate all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life julia lathrop the first chief of the bureau was a veteran of hull house and a close associate of jane addams.
she helped make the childrens bureau a force for progressive change not just in federal policy but also in state and local governments.
but a sensational controversy broke out late in 1909 that helped put an end to tafts popularity with reformers.
many progressives had been unhappy when taft replaced roosevelts secretary of the interior james r garfield an aggressive william howard taft taft could be a jovial companion in small groups but his public image was of a dull stolid man who stood in sharp and unfortunate contrast to his dynamic predecessor theodore roosevelt.
taft also suffered public ridicule for his enormous size.
he weighed as much as 350 pounds at times and wide publicity accompanied his installation of an oversized bathtub in the white house.
bettmann corbis conservationist with richard a ballinger a conservative corporate lawyer.
suspicion of ballinger grew when he attempted to invalidate roosevelts removal of nearly 1 million acres of forests and mineral reserves from private development.
in the midst of this mounting concern louis glavis an interior department investigator charged ballinger with having once connived to turn over valuable public coal lands in alaska to a private syndicate for personal profit.
glavis took the evidence to gifford pinchot still head of the forest service and a critic of ballingers policies.
pinchot took the charges to the president.
taft investigated them and decided they were groundless.
but pinchot was not satisfied particularly after taft fired glavis for his part in the episode.
he leaked the story to the press and asked congress to investigate the scandal.
the president discharged him for insubordination.
the congressional committee appointed to study the controversy dominated by old guard republicans exonerated ballinger.
but ballinger plnchot dispute 578 chapter 20 progressives throughout the country supported pinchot.
the controversy aroused as much public passion as any dispute of its time and when it was over taft had alienated the supporters of roosevelt completely and it seemed irrevocably.
the return of roosevelt during most of these controversies theodore roosevelt was far away on a long hunting safari in africa and an extended tour of europe.
to the american public however roosevelt remained a formidable presence thanks to intensive newspaper coverage of his every move abroad.
his return to new york in the spring of 1910 was a major public event.
roosevelt insisted that he had no plans to reenter politics but within a month he announced that he would embark on a national speaking tour before the end of the summer.
furious with taft he was becoming convinced that he alone was capable of reuniting the republican party.
the real signal of roosevelts decision to assume leadership of republican reformers came in a speech he gave on september 1 new 1910 in osawatomie kansas.
in it he out nationalism lined a set of principles which he labeled the new nationalism that made clear he had moved a considerable way from the cautious conservatism of the first years of his presidency.
he argued that social justice was possible only through the vigorous efforts of a strong federal government whose executive acted as the steward of the public welfare those who thought primarily of property rights and personal profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare he supported graduated income and inheritance taxes workers compensation for industrial accidents regulation of the labor of women and children tariff revision and firmer regula tion of corporations.
spreading insurgency the congressional elections of 1910 provided further evidence of how far the progressive revolt had spread.
in primary elections conservative republicans suffered defeat after defeat while almost all the progressive incumbents were reelected.
in the general election the democrats who were now offering progressive candidates of their own won control of the house of representatives for the first time in sixteen years and gained strength in the senate.
but roosevelt still denied any presidential ambitions and claimed that his real purpose was to pressure taft to return to progressive policies.
two events however changed his mind.
the first on october 27 1911 was the announcement by the administration of a suit against u s steel which charged among other things that the 1907 acquisition of the tennessee coal and iron company had been illegal.
roosevelt had approved that acquisition in the midst of the 1907 panic and he was enraged by the implication that he had acted improperly.
roosevelt was still reluctant to become a candidate for president because senator robert la follette the great wisconsin progressive had been working since 1911 to secure the presidential nomination for himself.
but la follettes candidacy stumbled in february 1912 when exhausted and distraught over the illness of a daughter he appeared to suffer a nervous breakdown during a speech in philadelphia.
roosevelt announced his candidacy on february 22.
roosevelt versus taft la follette retained some diehard support.
but for all practical purposes the campaign for the republican nomination had now become a battle between roosevelt and taft.
roosevelt scored overwhelming victories in all thirteen presidential roosevelt at osawatomie roosevelt s famous speech at osawatomie kansas in 1910 was the most radical of his career and openly marked his break with the taft administration and the republican leadership.
the essence of any struggle for liberty he told his largely conservative audience has always been and must always be to take from some one man or class of men the right to enjoy power or wealth or position or immunity which has not been earned by service to his or their fellows the granger collection new york the progressives 579 primaries.
taft however remained the choice of most party leaders who controlled the nominating process.
the battle for the nomination at the chicago convention revolved around an unusually large number of contested delegates 254 in all.
roosevelt needed fewer than half the disputed seats to clinch the nomination.
but the republican national committee controlled by the old guard awarded all but 19 of them to taft.
at a rally the night before the convention opened roosevelt addressed 5 000 cheering supporters.
we stand at armageddon he told the roaring crowd and we battle for the lord the next day he led his supporters out of the convention and out of the party.
the convention then quietly nominated taft on the first ballot.
roosevelt summoned his supporters back to chicago in august for another convention this one to launch the new the progressive party and nominate himself as progressive its presidential candidate.
roosevelt party approached the battle feeling as he put it fit as a bull moose thus giving his new party an enduring nickname.
the bull moose party was notable for its strong commitment to a wide range of progressive causes that had grown in popularity over the previous two decades.
the party advocated additional regulation of industry and trusts sweeping reforms of many areas of government compensation by the government for workers injured on the job pensions for the elderly and for widows with children and alone among the major parties woman suffrage.
the delegates left the partys convention filled with hope and excitement.
roosevelt himself however entered the fall campaign aware that his cause was almost hopeless partly because many of the insurgents who had supported him during the primaries refused to follow him out of the republican party.
his pessimism was also a result of the man the democrats had nominated for president.
woodrow wilson and the new freedom the 1912 presidential contest was not simply one between conservatives and reformers.
it was also one between two brands of progressivism.
and it matched the two most important national leaders of the early twentieth century in unequal contest.
woodrow wilson reform sentiment had been gaining strength within the democratic as well as the republican party in the first years of the century.
at the 1912 democratic national convention in baltimore in june champ clark the conservative speaker of the house was unable to assemble the two thirds majority necessary for nomination because of progressive opposition finally on the forty sixth ballot woodrow wilson the governor of new jersey and the only genuinely progressive candidate in the race emerged as the partys nominee.
wilson had risen to political prominence by an unusual path.
he had been a professor of political science at princeton until 1902 when he was named president wilsons new c.
rxt freedom the university.
elected governor of new jersey in 1910 he demonstrated a commitment to reform.
during his two years in the statehouse he earned a national reputation for winning passage of progressive legislation.
as a presidential candidate in 1912 wilson presented a progressive program that came to be called the new freedom roosevelts new nationalism advocated accepting economic concentration and using government to regulate and control it.
but wilson seemed to side with those who like louis brandeis believed that bigness was both unjust and inefficient that the proper response to monopoly was not to regulate it but to destroy it.
the 1912 presidential campaign was an anticlimax.
william howard taft resigned to defeat barely campaigned.
roosevelt campaigned energetically until a gunshot wound from a would be assassin forced him to the sidelines during the last weeks before the election but he failed to draw any significant numbers of democratic progressives away from wilson.
in november roosevelt and taft split the republican vote wilson held on to most democrats and won.
he polled only 42 percent of the vote compared with 27 percent for roosevelt 23 percent for taft and 6 percent for the socialist eugene v debs.
but in the electoral college wilson won 435 of the 531 votes.
roosevelt had carried only six states taft two debs none.
lowering the tariff the scholar as president wilson was a bold and forceful president.
he exerted firm control over his cabinet and he delegated real authority only to those whose loyalty to him was beyond question.
his most powerful adviser colonel edward m house was an intelligent and ambitious texan who held no office and whose only claim to authority was his personal intimacy with the president.
in legislative matters wilson skillfully welded together a coalition that would support his program.
democratic majorities in both houses of congress made his task easier.
wilsons first triumph as president was the fulfillment of an old democratic and progressive goal a substantial lowering of the protective tariff.
the underwood simmons tariff provided cuts substantial enough progressives believed to introduce real competition into american markets and thus to help break the power of trusts.
to make up for the loss of revenue under the new tariff congress approved a graduated income tax which the recently adopted sixteenth amendment to the constitution now permitted.
this first modern income tax imposed a 1 percent tax on individuals and corporations earning more than 4 000 a year with rates ranging up to 6 percent on annual incomes over 500 000.
wilson held congress in session through the summer to work on a major reform of the american banking system 580.
chapter 20 woodrow wilson woodrow wilson the 28th president of the united states was a virginian the first southerner to be elected president since before the civil war a professor of political science and later president of princeton university governor of new jersey and known as a brilliant progressive.
his election to the presidency brought the first democrat to the white house since 1896.
the library of congress 3a21763v the federal reserve act which congress passed and the president signed on december 23 1913.
it created twelve regional banks each to be owned and controlled by ffufrai reserve act inc ivi ual banks of its district.
the re gional federal reserve banks would hold a certain percentage of the assets of their member banks in reserve they would use those reserves to support loans to private banks at an interest or discount rate that the federal reserve system would set they would issue a new type of paper currency federal reserve notes that would become the nations basic medium of trade and would be backed by the government.
most important they would be able to shift funds quickly to troubled areas to meet increased demands for credit or to protect imperiled banks.
supervising and regulating the entire system was a national federal reserve board whose members were appointed by the president.
nearly half the nations banking resources were represented in the system within a year and 80 percent by the late 1920s.
in 1914 turning to the central issue of his 1912 campaign wilson proposed two measures to deal with the problem of monopoly.
in the process he revealed how his own approach to the issue was beginning to change.
there was a proposal to create a federal agency through which the government would help business police itself a regulatory commission of the type roosevelt had advocated in 1912.
there were also proposals to strengthen candidate party electoral vote popular vote woodrow wilson democratic theodore roosevelt progressive bull moose mg wi 11 iam h taft hhb republican eugene v debs socialist 6 293 454 41 9 4 119 538 27 4 3 484 980 23 2 900 672 6 0 other parties noc nic prohibition socialist labor 58 8 of electorate voting election of 1912 the election of 1912 was one of the most unusual in american history because of the dramatic schism within the republican party.
two republican presidents william howard taft the incumbent and theodore roosevelt his predecessor ran against each other in 1912 opening the way for a victory by the democratic candidate woodrow wilson who won with only about 42 percent of the popular vote.
a fourth candidate the socialist eugene v debs received a significant 6 percent of the vote.
what events caused the schism between taft and roosevelt.
the governments ability to break up trusts a decentralizing approach characteristic of wilsons 1912 campaign.
the two measures took shape as the federal trade commission act and the clayton antitrust act.
the federal trade commission act created a regulatory agency that would help businesses determine in advance whether their actions would be acceptable to the government.
the agency would also have authority to launch prosecutions against unfair trade practices and it would have wide power to investigate corporate behavior.
wilson signed the federal trade commission bill happily.
but he seemed to lose interest in the clayton antitrust bill and did little to protect it from conservative assaults which greatly weakened it.
the future he had apparently decided lay with government supervision.
retreat and advance by the fall of 1914 wilson believed that the program of the new freedom was essentially complete and that agitation for reform would now subside.
he refused to support the movement for national woman suffrage.
deferring to southern democrats and reflecting his own southern background he condoned the reimposition of segregation in the agencies of the federal government in contrast to roosevelt who had ordered the elimination of many such barriers.
when congressional progressives attempted to enlist his support for new reform legislation wilson dismissed their proposals as unconstitutional or unnecessary.
the congressional elections of 1914 however shattered the presidents complacency.
democrats suffered major losses in congress and voters who in 1912 had supported the progressive party began returning to the republicans.
wilson would not be able to rely on a divided opposition when he ran for reelection in 1916.
by the end of 1915 therefore wilson had begun to support a second flurry of reforms.
in january 1916 he appointed louis brandeis to the supreme court making him not only the first jew but also the most progressive justice to serve there.
later he supported a measure to make it easier for farmers to receive credit and one creating a system of workers compensation for federal employees.
wilson was sponsoring measures that expanded the powers of the national government in important ways.
in 1916 the progressives 581 for example he supported the keating owen act the first federal law regulating child labor.
the laws measure prohibited the shipment of goods produced by underage children across state lines thus giving an expanded importance to the constitutional clause assigning congress the task of regulating interstate commerce.
the president similarly supported measures that used federal taxing authority as a vehicle for legislating social change.
after the court struck down keating owen a new law attempted to achieve the same goal by imposing a heavy tax on the products of child labor.
the court later struck it down too.
and the smith lever act of 1914 demonstrated another way in which the federal government could influence local behavior it offered matching federal grants to support agricultural extension education.
over time these innovative uses of government overcame most of the constitutional objections and became the foundation of a long term growth in federal power over the economy.
looking back the powerful surge of reform efforts in the last years of the nineteenth century and the first years of the twentieth reforms intended to help the united states deal with the extraordinary changes and the vexing problem of the modern industrial era caused many americans to come to identify themselves as progressives that label meant many different things to many different people but at its core was a belief that human effort and government action could improve society.
the reform crusades gained strength steadily driven by both men and women and by people of many races and ethnicities.
by the early twentieth century progressivism had become a powerful transformative force in american life.
this great surge of reform eventually reached the federal government and national politics as progressives began to understand the limits of state and local reform.
success they came to believe required the engagement of the federal government.
two national leaders theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson contributed to a period of national reform that made the government in washington a great center of power for the first time since the civil war a position it has never relinquished.
progressivism did not solve the nations problems but it gave movements organizations and governments new tools to deal with them.

3 why did the great war fail to become the war to end all wars.
the war to end all wars the horror of world war i was unprecedented in human history.
more than 9 million people died between july 28 1914 when the war started and november 11 1918 when it came to an end.
the astronomical number of casualties was due to advanced technologies of combat.

setting the stage the great war as it was known to a generation unaware that another greater war would soon follow began relatively inconspicuously in august 1914 when forces of the austro hungarian empire invaded the tiny balkan nation of serbia.
within weeks however it had grown into a conflagration that engaged the armies of almost all the major nations of europe.
most americans looked on with horror as the war became the most savage in history and dragged on murderously and inconclusively for two and a half years.
many americans believed that the conflict had little to do with them but they were wrong.
the united states in 1914 had been deeply involved in world affairs since at least the spanish american war and in the early years of the twentieth century had taken on many more international commitments and obligations.
so it should not have been surprising that the united states finally entered the war in 1917.
for america the war as a military struggle was brief decisive and in relative terms without great cost.
only 112 000 american soldiers died in the conflict half of them from influenza and other diseases rather than in combat.
economically the war was the source of a great industrial boom which helped spark the years of prosperity that would follow.
and the war propelled the united states into a position of international preeminence.
yet once the conflict ended the united states encountered frustration and disillusionment.
the war to end all wars the war to make the world safe for democracy became neither.
instead it led directly to twenty years of international instability that would ultimately generate another great conflict.
the big stick america and the world 1901 1917 to the general public foreign affairs remained largely remote.
walter lippmann once wrote i cannot remember taking any interest whatsoever in foreign affairs until after the outbreak of the first world war but to theodore roosevelt and later presidents that made foreign affairs even more appealing.
there the president could act with less regard for the congress or the courts.
there he could free himself from concerns about public opinion.
overseas the president could exercise power unfettered and alone.
roosevelt and civilization theodore roosevelt believed in the value and importance of using american power in the world a conviction he once described by citing the proverb speak softly but carry a big stick.
but he had two different standards for using that power.
roosevelt believed that an important distinction existed between the civilized and uncivilized nations of the world.
civilized nations as he defined them were predominantly white and anglo saxon or teutonic uncivilized nations were generally nonwhite latin or slavic.
but racism was only partly the basis of the distinction.
equally important was economic development.
he believed therefore that japan a rapidly industrializing society had earned admission to the ranks of the civilized.
a civilized society he argued had the right and duty to intervene in the affairs of a backward nation to preserve order and stability.
that belief was one important reason for roosevelts early support of the development of american sea power.
by 1906 the american navy had attained a size and strength surpassed only by that of great britain although germany was fast gaining ground.

the granger collection new york prevent either nation from becoming dominant there agreed to a japanese request to mediate an end to the conflict.
russia faring badly in the war had no choice but to agree.
at a peace conference in portsmouth new hampshire in 1905 roosevelt extracted from the embattled russians a recognition of japan s territorial gains and from the japanese an agreement to cease the fighting and expand no further.
at the same time he nego tiated a secret agreement with the japanese to ensure that the united states could continue to trade freely in the region.
roosevelt won the nobel peace prize in 1906 for his work in ending the russo japanese war.
but in the years that fol lowed relations between the united states and japan steadily deteriorated.
japan now emerged as the preeminent naval power in the pacific and soon began to ex great white dude american trade from many of the t territories it controlled.
to be sure the japanese government recognized the power of the united states he sent sixteen battleships of the new american navy known as the great white fleet because the ships were temporarily painted white for the voyage on an unprece dented journey around the world that included a call on japan.
the iron fisted neighbor roosevelt took a particular interest in events in what he and most other americans considered the nations special sphere of interest latin america.
he established a pattern of u s intervention in the region that would long survive his presidency.
early in 1902 the financially troubled government of venezuela began to renege on debts to european bankers.
naval forces of britain italy and germany blockaded the venezuelan coast in response.
then german ships began to bombard a venezuelan port amid rumors that germany planned to establish a permanent base in the region.
roosevelt used the threat of american naval power to pressure the german navy to withdraw.
the incident helped persuade roosevelt that european intrusions into latin america could result not only from aggression but also from instability or irre roosevelt sponsibility such as defaulting on debts corollary within the latin american nations themselves.
as a result in 1904 he announced what came to be known as the roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine.
chapter 21 united states british honduras honduras cuba u s troops v 1898 1902 1906 1909 1917 1922 protectorate 1898 1934 leased to u s canal zone not a possession but controlled through a lease from panama v dominican republic u s troops 1916 1924 financial haiti u s troops 1915 1934 financial supervision 1915 194j s atlantic ocean virgin islands purchased from denmark 1917 caribbean sea aragua roops 1909 1910 1925 1926 1933 supervision 1924 puerto rico acquired from spain 1898 rv british 3uiana the united states and latin america 1895 1941 except for puerto rico the virgin islands and the canal zone the united states had no formal possessions in latin america and the caribbean in the late nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth.
but as this map reveals the u s exercised considerable influence in these regions throughout this period political and economic influence augmented at times by military intervention.
note the particularly intrusive presence of the united states in the affairs of cuba haiti and the dominican republic as well as the canal related interventions in colombia and panama.
what were some of the most frequent reasons for u s intervention in latin america.
the united states he claimed had the right not only to oppose european intervention in the western hemisphere but also to intervene in the domestic affairs of its neighbors if those neighbors proved unable to maintain order and national sovereignty on their own.
the immediate motivation for the roosevelt corollary and the first opportunity for using it was a crisis in the dominican republic.
a revolution had toppled its corrupt and bankrupt government in 1903 but the new regime proved no better able to make good on the country s 22 million in debts to european nations.
roosevelt established in effect an american receivership assuming control of dominican customs and distributing 45 percent of the revenues to the dominicans and the rest to foreign creditors.
this arrangement lasted in one form or another for more than three decades.
in 1902 the united states granted political independence to cuba but only after the new government had agreed to the platt platt amendment to its constitution see p 545.
amendment t e amen ment gave the united states the right to prevent any other foreign power from intruding into the new nation.
in 1906 when domestic uprisings seemed to threaten the internal stability of the island american troops landed in cuba quelled the fighting and remained there for three years.
the panama canal the most celebrated accomplishment of roosevelts presidency was the construction of the panama canal which linked the atlantic and the pacific.
at first roosevelt and many advocates of a canal favored a route across nicaragua which would permit a sea level canal requiring no locks.
but they soon turned instead to the narrow isthmus of panama in colombia the site of an earlier failed effort by a french company to construct a channel.
although the panama route was not at sea level and would thus require locks it was shorter than the one in nicaragua.
and construction was already about 40 percent complete.
when the french company lowered the price for its holdings the united states chose panama.
roosevelt dispatched john hay his secretary of state to negotiate an agreement with colombian diplomats in washington that would allow construction to begin without delay.
under heavy american pressure the colombian charge d affaires tomas herren unwisely signed an agreement giving america and the great war 587 the united states perpetual rights to a six mile wide canal zoneacross colombia.
the outraged colombian senate refused to ratify it.
colombia then sent a new representative to washington with instructions to demand a higher payment from the americans plus a share of the payment to the french.
roosevelt was furious and began to look for ways to circumvent the colombian government.
philippe bunau varilla chief engineer of the french canal project was a ready ally.
in november 1903 he helped organize and finance a revolution in panama.
panamanian there had been many previous revolts all of revolt them failures but this one had the support of the united states.
roosevelt landed troops from the uss nashville in panama to maintain order their presence prevented colombian forces from suppressing the rebellion and three days later roosevelt recognized panama as an independent nation.
the new panamanian government quickly agreed to the terms the colombian senate had rejected.
work on the canal proceeded rapidly and it opened in 1914.
taft and dollar diplomacy like his predecessor william howard taft worked to advance the nations economic interests overseas.
but he showed little interest in roosevelts larger vision of world stability.
tafts secretary of state the corporate attorney philander c knox worked aggressively to extend american investments into less developed regions.
critics called his policies dollar diplomacy it was particularly visible in the caribbean.
when a revolution broke out in nicaragua in 1909 the administration quickly sided with the insurgents who had been intervention.

as soon as peace was restored knox encouraged american bankers to offer substantial loans to the new government thus increasing washingtons financial leverage over the country.
when the new pro american government faced an insurrection less than two years later taft again landed troops in nicaragua this time to protect the existing regime.
the troops remained there for more than a decade.

the military occupation lasted eight years.
in neighboring haiti wilson landed marines in 1915 to quell a revolution in the course of which a mob had murdered an unpopular president.
american military forces remained in the country until 1934 and american officers drafted the new haitian constitution adopted in 1918.
when wilson began to fear that the danish west indies might be about to fall into the hands of germany he bought the colony from denmark and renamed it the virgin islands.
concerned about the possibility of european influence in nicaragua he signed a treaty with that country s government ensuring that no other nation would build a canal there and winning for the united states the right to intervene in nicaragua to protect american interests.
but wilsons view of americas role in the world was not entirely similar to the views of his predecessors as became wilsons c ear in is ea in s wit mexico.
for moral many years under the friendly auspices of diplomacy the corrupt dictator porfirio diaz american businessmen had been establishing an enormous economic presence in mexico.
in 1910 however diaz had been overthrown by the popular leader francisco madero who seemed hostile to american businesses in mexico.
the united states quietly encouraged a reactionary general victoriano huerta to depose madero early in 1913 and the taft administration in its last weeks in office prepared to recognize the new huerta regime and welcome back a receptive environment for american investments in mexico.
before it could do so however the new government murdered madero shortly before woodrow wilson took office in washington.
the new president instantly announced that he would never recognize huertas government of butchers at first wilson hoped that simply by refusing to recognize huerta he could help topple the regime and bring to power the opposing constitutionalists led by venustiano carranza.
but when huerta with the support of american business interests established a full military dictatorship in october 1913 the president became more assertive.
in april 1914 an officer in huertas army briefly arrested several american sailors from the uss dolphin who had gone ashore in tampico on mexicos east coast.
the men were immediately released but the american admiral unsatisfied with the apology he received demanded that the huerta forces fire a twenty one gun salute to the american flag as a public display of penance.
the mexicans refused.
wilson used the trivial incident as a pretext for seizing the mexican port of veracruz.
wilson had envisioned a bloodless action but in a clash with mexican troops in veracruz the americans killed 126 veracruz mexican soldiers and suffered 19 casualties of their own.
now at the brink of war wilson began to look for a way out.
his show of force however had helped strengthen the position of the carranza faction which captured mexico city in august and forced huerta to flee the country.
at last it seemed the crisis might be over.
but wilson was not yet satisfied.
he reacted angrily when carranza refused to accept american guidelines for the creation of a new government and he briefly considered throwing his support to still another aspirant to leadership carranzas pancho villa and his troops pancho villa fourth from left in the front row poses with some of the leaders of his army whose members americans came to consider bandits once they began staging raids across the u s border.
he was a national hero in mexico.

when villas military position deteriorated however wilson abandoned him and finally in october 1915 granted preliminary recognition to the carranza government.
by now however he had created yet another crisis.
villa angry at what he considered an american betrayal retaliated in january 1916 by shooting sixteen american mining engineers in northern mexico.
two months later he led his soldiers or bandits as the united states called them across the border into columbus new mexico where they killed seventeen more americans.
with the permission of the carranza government wilson ordered general john j pershing to lead an american expedi intervention tionary force across the mexican border in in mexico pursuit of villa.
the american troops never found villa but they did engage in two ugly skirmishes with carranzas army in which forty mexicans and twelve americans died.
again the united states and mexico stood at the brink of war.
but at the last minute wilson drew back.
he quietly withdrew american troops from mexico and in march 1917 he at last granted formal recognition to the carranza regime.
by now however wilsons attention was turning elsewhere to the far greater international crisis engulfing the european continent and ultimately much of the world.
the road to war the causes of the war in europe indeed the question of whether there were any significant causes at all or whether the entire conflict was the result of a tragic series of blunders have been the subject of continued debate for nearly a century.
what is clear is that the european nations had by 1914 created an unusually precarious international system that careened into war very quickly on the basis of what most historians agree was a relatively minor series of provocations.
the collapse of the european peace the major powers of europe were organized by 1914 in two great competing alliances.
the triple entente linked britain france and russia.
the triple alliance united germany the austro hungarian empire and italy.
the chief rivalry however was not between the two alliances but between the competing great powers that dominated them great alliances britain and germany the former long established as the worlds most powerful colonial and commercial nation the latter ambitious to expand its own empire and become at least britains equal.
the anglo german rivalry may have been the most important underlying source of the tensions that led to world war i but it was not the immediate cause of its outbreak.
the conflict emerged most directly out of a controversy involving nationalist movements within the austro hungarian empire.
on june 28 1914 archduke franz ferdinand heir to the throne of the tottering empire was assassinated while paying a state visit to sarajevo.
sarajevo was the capital of bosnia a province of austria hungary that slavic nationalists wished to annex to neighboring serbia the archdukes assassin was a serbian nationalist.
this local controversy quickly escalated through the workings of the system of alliances that the great powers had constructed.
with support from germany austria hungary launched a punitive assault on serbia.
the serbians called on russia to help with their defense.
the russians began mobilizing their army on july 30.
things quickly careened out of control.
by august 3 germany had declared war on both russia and france and had invaded belgium in preparation for a thrust across the french border.
on august 4 great britain ostensibly to honor its alliance with france but more importantly to blunt the advance of its principal rival declared war on germany.
russia and the austro hungarian empire formally began hostilities on august 6.
italy although an ally of germany in 1914 remained neutral at first and later entered the war on the side of the british and french.
the ottoman empire centered in turkey and other smaller nations all joined the fighting later in 1914 or in 1915.
within less than a year virtually the entire european continent and part of asia were embroiled in a catastrophic war.
wilson s neutrality wilson called on his fellow citizens in 1914 to remain impartial in thought as well as deed but that was an impossible task for several reasons.
some americans sympathized with the german cause german americans because of affection for germany irish americans because of hatred of britain.
many more including wilson himself sympathized with britain.
wilson was only one of many americans who fervently admired england its traditions its culture its political system almost instinctively these americans attributed to the cause of the allies britain france italy russia a moral quality that they denied to the central powers germany the austro hungarian empire and the ottoman empire.
lurid reports of german atrocities in belgium and france skillfully exaggerated by british propagandists strengthened the hostility of many americans toward germany.
economic realities also made it impossible for the united states to deal with the belligerents on equal terms.
the british had imposed a naval blockade on germany to prevent muni economic ties tions an supp ies frm reaching the enemy.
to britain as a neutral the united states had the right in theory to trade with both britain and germany but for americans to trade with germany they would have to defy the british blockade.
a truly neutral response to the blockade would have been to stop trading with britain as well.
but while the united states could survive an interruption of its relatively modest trade with the central powers it could not easily weather an embargo on its much more extensive trade with the allies particularly when war orders from britain and france soared after 1914 helping to produce one of the greatest economic booms in the nations history.

at the beginning of world war i britain largely relied on a volunteer army.
to attract recruits the government used propaganda posters such as the one shown here.
while this was very successful in attracting recruits the need for soldiers was enormous compelling parliament to enact in january 1916 a military service bill that introduced conscription.
by the end of the war more than 5 million men had joined up.
archive photos alamy tacitly ignored the blockade of germany and continued trading with britain.
by 1915 the united states had gradually transformed itself from a neutral power into the arsenal of the allies.
the germans in the meantime were resorting to a new and in american eyes barbaric tactic submarine warfare.
unable to challenge british domination on the oceans surface germany began early in 1915 to use the newly improved submarine to try to stem the flow of supplies to england.
enemy vessels the germans announced would be sunk on sight.
months later on lusitania may 7 1915 a german submarine sank the british passenger liner lusitania without warning causing the deaths of 1 198 people 128 of them americans.
the ship was it later became clear carrying both passengers and munitions but most americans considered the attack what theodore roosevelt called it an act of piracy wilson angrily demanded that germany promise not to repeat such outrages and that the central powers affirm their commitment to neutral rights.
the germans finally agreed to wilsons demands but tensions between the nations continued to grow.
early in 1916 in response to an announcement that the allies were now arming merchant ships to sink submarines germany proclaimed that it would fire on such vessels without warning.
a few weeks later germany attacked the unarmed french steamer sussex injuring several american passengers.
again wilson demanded that germany abandon its unlawful tactics again the german government relented still hoping to keep america out of the war.
preparedness versus pacifism despite the presidents increasing bellicosity in 1916 he was still far from ready to commit the united states to war.
one obstacle was american domestic politics.
facing a difficult battle for reelection wilson could not ignore the powerful factions that continued to oppose intervention.
the question of whether america should make military and economic preparations for war provided the first issue over which pacifists and interventionists could openly debate.
wilson at first sided with the antipreparedness forces denouncing the idea of an american military buildup as needless and provocative.
as tensions between the united states and germany grew however he changed his mind.
in the fall of 1915 he endorsed an ambitious proposal for a large and rapid increase in the nations armed forces.
amid expressions of outrage from pacifists in congress and elsewhere he worked hard to win approval of it even embarking on a national speaking tour early in 1916 to arouse support for the proposal.
still the peace faction wielded considerable political strength as became clear at the democratic convention in the summer 1916 election f 1916.
the convention became especially enthusiastic when the keynote speaker punctuated his list of wilsons diplomatic achievements with the chant what did we do.
what did we do.
we didnt go to war.
we didnt go to war that speech helped produce one of the most prominent slogans of wilsons reelection campaign he kept us out of war during the campaign wilson did nothing to discourage those who argued that the republican candidate the progressive new york governor charles evans hughes supported by the bellicose theodore roosevelt was more likely than he to lead the nation into war.
and when pro war rhetoric became particularly heated wilson spoke defiantly of the nation being too proud to fight he ultimately won reelection by a small margin fewer than 600 000 popular votes and only 23 electoral votes.
the democrats retained a precarious control over congress.
a war for democracy the election was behind him and tensions between the united states and germany remained high.
but wilson still required a justification for american intervention that would unite public opinion and satisfy his own sense of morality m t e end he created that rationale himself.
the united states america and the great war 591 wilson insisted had no material aims in the conflict.
rather the nation was committed to using the war as a vehicle for constructing a new world order one based on some of the same progressive ideals that had motivated reform in america.
in a speech before congress in january 1917 he presented a plan for a postwar order in which the united states would help maintain peace through a permanent league of nations a peace that would ensure self determination for all nations a peace without victory these were wilson believed goals worth fighting for if there was sufficient provocation.
provocation came quickly.
in january after months of inconclusive warfare in the trenches of france the military leaders of germany decided on one last dramatic gamble to achieve victory.
they launched a series of major assaults on the enemy s lines in france.
at the same time they began unrestricted submarine warfare against american as well as allied ships to cut britain off from vital supplies.
the allied defenses would collapse they hoped before the united states could intervene.
zimmermann telegram the new german policy made american entry into the war virtually inevitable.
two additional events helped clear the way.
on february 25 candidate party woodrow wilson democratic charles e hughes republican a l benson socialist other parties x prohibition socialist labor electoral vote popular vote 277 9 129 606 49 4 254 8 538 221 46 2 585 113 3 2 233 909 61 6 of electorate voting election of 1916 woodrow wilson had good reason to be concerned about his reelection prospects in 1916.
he had won only about 42 percent of the vote in 1912 and the republican party which had been divided four years earlier was now reunited around the popular charles evans hughes.
in the end wilson won a narrow victory over hughes with just under 50 percent of the vote and an even narrower margin in the electoral college.
note the striking regional character of his victory.
how did wilson use the war in europe to bolster his election prospects.
the british gave wilson a telegram intercepted from the german foreign minister arthur zimmermann to the government of mexico.
it proposed that in the event of war between germany and the united states the mexicans should join with germany against the americans to regain their lost provinces texas and much of the rest of the american southwest when the war was over.
widely publicized by british propagandists and in the american press the zimmermann telegram inflamed public opinion and helped build popular sentiment for war.
a few weeks later in march 1917 a revolution in russia toppled the reactionary czarist regime and replaced it with a new republican government.
the united states would now be spared the embarrassment of allying itself with what most americans considered a despotic monarchy.
on the rainy evening of april 2 two weeks after german submarines had torpedoed three american ships wilson appeared before a joint session of congress and asked for a declaration of war it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars civilization itself seeming to be in the balance.
but the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments for the rights and liberties of small nations for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.
even then opposition remained.
for four days pacifists in congress carried on a futile struggle.
when the declaration of war finally passed on april 6 fifty representatives and six senators voted against it.
without stint armies on both sides in europe were decimated and exhausted by the time of woodrow wilsons declaration of war.
the german offensives of early 1917 had failed to produce an end to the struggle and french and british counteroffensives had stalemate accomplished little beyond adding to the casualties.
the allies looked to the united states for help.
wilson who had called on the nation to wage war without stint or limit was ready to oblige.
entering the war by the spring of 1917 great britain was suffering such vast losses from attacks by german submarines one of every four ships setting sail from british ports never returned that its ability to continue receiving vital supplies from across the atlantic was in question.
within weeks of joining the war a fleet of american destroyers began aiding the british navy in its assault on german submarines.
other american warships 592 chapter 21 escorted merchant vessels across the atlantic.
americans also helped sow antisubmarine mines in the north sea.
the results were dramatic.
sinkings of allied ships had totaled nearly 900 000 tons in april 1917 by december the figure had dropped to 350 000 and by october 1918 to 112 000.
the convoys also helped the united states protect its own soldiers en route to europe.
no american troop ship was lost at sea in world war i.
many americans had hoped that providing naval assistance alone would be enough to turn the tide in the war but it quickly became clear that american ground forces would also be neces russian sary t0 shre up t le totterin8 allies.
britain revolution an france had few remaining reserves.
by early 1918 russia had withdrawn from the war.
after the bolshevik revolution in november 1917 the new government led by v i.
lenin negotiated a hasty and costly peace with the central powers thus freeing additional german troops to fight on the western front.
the american expeditionary force there were only about 120 000 soldiers in the army in 1917 and perhaps 80 000 more in the national guard.
neither group had any combat experience and except for the small number of officers who had participated in the spanish american war two decades before and the mexican intervention of 1916 few commanders had any experience in battle either.
some politicians urged a voluntary recruitment process to raise the needed additional forces.
among the advocates of this approach was theodore roosevelt now old and ill who swallowed his hatred of wilson and called on him at the white house with an offer to raise a regiment to fight in europe.
wilson rejected his offer.
in the new age of warfare he sensed the old tradition of civilians becoming officers and recruiting troops a common practice in the civil war seemed obsolete.
the president and his secretary of war newton d baker decided that only a national draft could provide the needed men and despite the protests of those who agreed with house speaker champ clark that there is selective service act precious little difference between a con script and a convict he won passage of the selective service act in mid may.
the draft brought nearly 3 million men into the army another 2 million joined various branches of the armed services voluntarily.
together they formed what became known as the american expeditionary force aef.
it was the first time in american history that any substantial number of soldiers and sailors had fought overseas for an the wartime draft the world war i draft was the first centrally organized effort by the federal qo although some americans evaded the draft in 1917 and 1918 and were reviled by others as shirkers to re9uire military service from its citizens.

the military did its best to keep up morale among men who spent most of their time living in the trenches but it was a difficult task.
the trenches were frequently shelled and even when calm were muddy polluted and infested with rats.
but when soldiers had time away from the front they were usually less interested in the facilities the red cross tried to make available for them than in exploring the bars and brothels of local towns.
more than one in every ten american soldiers in europe contracted venereal disease during world war i which inspired elaborate official efforts to prevent infection and to treat it when it occurred.
in some respects the aef was the most diverse fighting force the united states had ever assembled.
for the first time women were permitted to enlist in the military more than ten thousand in the navy and a few hundred in the marines.
they were not allowed to participate in combat but they served auxiliary roles in hospitals and offices.
nearly 400 000 african americans enlisted in or were drafted into the army and navy as well.
the marines would not accept them.
and while most of them performed menial tasks on military bases in the united states more than 50 000 african went to france.
african american soldiers american served in segregated all black units under soldiers white commanders and even in europe most of them were assigned to noncombat duty.
but some black units fought valiantly in the great offensives of 1918.
most african american soldiers learned to live with the racism they encountered in part because they hoped their military service would ultimately improve their status.
but a few responded to provocations violently.
in august 1917 a group of black soldiers in houston texas subjected to continuing abuse by people in the community used military weapons to kill seventeen whites.
thirteen african american soldiers were hanged and another forty were sentenced to life terms in military jails.
having assembled this first genuinely national army the war department permitted the american psychological association to study it.
the psychologists gave thousands of soldiers new tests designed to measure intelligence the intelligence quotient or iq test and other newly designed aptitude tests.
in fact the tests were less effective in measuring intelligence than in measuring education and they reflected the educational expectations of the white middle class people who had devised them.
half the whites and the vast majority of the african americans taking the test scored at levels that classified them as morons in reality most of them were simply people who had not had much access to education.
the military struggle the engagement of these forces in combat was intense but brief.
not until the spring of 1918 were significant numbers of american ground troops available for pershing battle.
eight months later the war was over.
under the command of general john j pershing who had only recently led the unsuccessful american pursuit of pancho villa the american expeditionary force although it retained a command structure independent of the other allies joined the existing allied forces.
the experience of american troops during world war i was very different from those of other nations which had already been fighting for nearly four years by the time the u s forces arrived in significant numbers.
british french german and other troops had by then spent years living in the vast 594 chapter 21 life in the trenches for most british french german and ultimately american troops in france the most debilitating part of world war i was the seeming endlessness of life in the trenches.
some young men lived in these cold wet muddy dugouts for months even years surrounded by filth sharing their space with vermin eating mostly rotten food.
occasional attacks to try to dislodge the enemy from its trenches usually ended in failure and became the scenes of terrible slaughters.
national archives and records administration nwdns 111 sc 12151 network of trenches that had been dug into the french countryside.
modern weapons made conventional frontal battles a recipe for mass suicide.
instead the two sides relied on heavy shelling of each others trenches and occasional usually inconclusive and always murderous assaults across the no mans land dividing them.
life in the trenches was almost indescribably terrible.
the trenches were places of extraordinary physical stress and discomfort.
they were also places of intense boredom laced with fear.
by the time the americans arrived morale on both sides was declining and many soldiers had come to believe that the war would be virtually endless.
chateau thierry although the american forces had trench experiences of their own they were very brief compared to those of the european armies.
instead the united states tipped the balance of power in the battle and made it possible for the allies at last to break out of their entrenched positions and advance against the germans.
in early june 1918 american forces at chateau thierry assisted the french in repel ling a german offensive that had brought german forces within fifty miles of paris.
six weeks later after over a million american troops had flooded into france the americans helped turn away another assault at rheims farther south.
by july 18 the allies had halted the german advance and were beginning a successful offensive of their own.
on september 26 the american fighting force joined a large assault against the germans in the argonne forest that lasted nearly seven weeks.
by the end of october despite terrible weather they had helped push the germans back toward their own border and had cut the enemys major supply lines to the front.
faced with an invasion of their own country german military leaders now began to seek an armistice an immediate cease fire that would they hoped serve as a prelude to negotiations among the belligerents.
pershing wanted to drive on into germany itself but other allied leaders after first insisting on terms that made the agreement little different from a surrender accepted the german proposal.
on november 11 1918 the great war shuddered to a close.
meuse argonne offensive the new technology of warfare world war i was a proving ground for a range of military and other technologies.
the trench warfare that characterized the conflict was necessary because of the enormous destructive power of newly improved machine guns and higher powered artillery.
it was no longer feasible to send troops out into an open field or even to allow them to camp in the open.
the new weaponry would slaughter them in an instant.
trenches sheltered troops while allowing limited and usually inconclusive fighting.
but technology overtook the trenches too as mobile weapons tanks and flamethrowers proved capable of piercing entrenched positions.
most terrible of all new chemical weapons poisonous mustard gas which required troops to carry gas masks at all times made it possible to attack entrenched soldiers without direct combat.
the new forms of technological warfare required elaborate maintenance.
faster machine guns needed more ammunition.
motorized vehicles required fuel and spare parts and mechanics capable of servicing them.
the logistical difficulties of supply became a major factor in planning tactics and strategy late in the war when advancing toward germany allied armies frequently had to stop for days at a time to wait for their equipment to catch up with them.

the small map on the upper right helps locate the area of conflict within the larger european landscape.
the larger map at left shows the long snaking red line of the western front in france stretching from the border between france and southwest germany all the way to the northeast border between belgium and france.
along that vast line the two sides had been engaged in murderous inconclusive warfare for over three years by the time the americans arrived.
beginning in the spring and summer of 1918 bolstered by reinforcements from the united states the allies began to win a series of important victories that finally enabled them to begin pushing the germans back.
american troops as this map makes clear were decisive along the southern part of the front.
af what point did the germans begin to consider putting an end to the war.
world war i was the first conflict in which airplanes played a significant role.
the planes themselves were relatively simple and not very maneuverable but anti aircraft technology was not yet highly developed either so their effectiveness was still considerable.
planes began to be constructed to serve various functions bombers fighters planes that would engage in dogfights with other planes and reconaissance aircraft.
the most modern part of the military during world war i was the navy.
new battleships emerged of which the british dreadnought was perhaps the most visible example that made use of new technologies such as turbine propulsion hydraulic gun controls electric light and power wireless telegraphy and advanced navigational aids.
submarines which had made a brief appearance in the american civil war now became significant weapons as the german u boat campaign in 1915 and 1916 made clear.
the new submarines were driven by diesel engines which had the advantage of being more compact than a steam engine and whose fuel was less explosive than that of a gasoline engine.
the diesel engine also had a much greater range than ships powered by other fuels.
the new technologies were to a large degree responsible for the most stunning and horrible characteristic of world car i its appalling level of casualties.
a million men representing the british empire britain canada australia india and others died.
france lost 1 7 million men germany 2 million the for high casualty rates ancrm hiiriparian emnire.
1 5 million italy 460 000 and russia 1 7 million.
the number of turkish dead which was surely large was never known.
in britain one third of the men born between 1892 and 1895 died in the war.
similarly terrible percentages could be calculated for other warring nations.
even greater numbers of men returned 596 chapter 21 home with injuries some of them permanently crippling.
the united states which entered the war near its end and became engaged only in the last successful offensives suffered very light casualties in comparison 112 000 dead half of them victims of influenza not battle.
but the american casualties were very high in the battles in which u s troops were centrally involved.
the war and american society the american experience in world war i was relatively brief but it had profound effects on the government the economy and society.
mobilizing an industrial economy for total war required an unprecedented degree of government involvement in industry agriculture and other areas.
it also required many americans believed a strenuous effort to ensure the loyalty and commitment of the people.
organizing the economy for war financing the war by the time the war ended the u s government had spent 32 billion for expenses directly related to the conflict.
this was a staggering sum by the standards of the time.
the entire federal budget had seldom exceeded 1 billion before 1915 and as recently as 1910 the nations entire gross national product had been only 35 billion.
to finance the war the government relied on two devices.
first it launched a major drive to solicit loans from the american people by selling liberty bonds to the public.
by 1920 the sale of bonds to both individuals and institutions accompanied by elaborate patriotic appeals had produced 23 billion.
at the same time new taxes were bringing in an additional sum of nearly 10 billion some from levies on the excess profits of corporations much from new steeply graduated income and inheritance taxes that ultimately rose as high as 70 percent in some brackets.
an even greater challenge was organizing the economy to meet war needs.
in 1916 wilson established a council of national defense composed of members of his cabinet and a civilian advisory commission which set up local defense councils in every state and locality.
economic mobilization according to this first plan was to rest on a dispersal of power to local communities.
but this early administrative structure soon proved unworkable.
some members of the council of national defense many of them disciples of the social engineering gospel of thorstein veblen and the scientific management principles of frederick winslow taylor urged a centralized approach.
instead of dividing the economy geographically they proposed dividing it functionally by organizing a series of planning bodies each to supervise a specific sector of the economy.
the administrative structure that slowly emerged from such proposals was dominated by a series of war boards one to oversee the railroads one to supervise fuel supplies largely coal another to handle food a board that helped elevate to prominence the brilliant young engineer and business executive herbert hoover.
the boards generally succeeded in meeting essential war needs without paralyzing war industries board the domestic economy.
at the center of the effort to rationalize the economy was the war industries board wib an agency created in july 1917 to coordinate government purchases of military supplies.
casually organized at first it stumbled badly until march 1918 when wilson restructured it and placed it under the control of the wall street financier bernard baruch.
from then on the board wielded powers greater in theory at least than any other government agency had ever possessed.
baruch decided which factories would convert to the production of which war materials and set prices for the goods they produced.
when materials were scarce baruch decided to whom they should go.
when corporations were competing for government contracts he chose among them.
he was it seemed providing the centralized regulation of the economy that some progressives had long urged.
in reality the celebrated efficiency of the wib was something of a myth.
the agency was in fact plagued by mismanagement and inefficiency.
its apparent success rested in large part on the sheer extent of american resources and productive capacities.
nor was the wib in any real sense an example of state control of the economy.
baruch viewed himself as the partner of business and within the wib businessmen themselves the so called dollar a year men who took paid leave from their corporate jobs and worked for the government for a token salary supervised the affairs of the private economy.
baruch ensured that manufacturers who coordinated their efforts with his goals would be exempt from antitrust laws.
he helped major industries earn enormous profits from their efforts.
the effort to organize the economy for war produced some spectacular accomplishments hoovers efficient organization of domestic food supplies william mcadoos success in untangling the railroads and others.
in some areas however progress was so slow that the war was over before many of the supplies ordered lessons of or were ready.
even so many leaders of the managed both government and industry emerged economy from the experience convinced of the advantages of a close cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors.
some hoped to continue the wartime experiments in peacetime.
labor and the war the growing link between the public and private sectors extended although in greatly different form to labor.
the national war labor board established in april 1918 to resolve labor disputes pressured industry to grant important concessions to workers an eight hour day the maintenance of america and the great war 597 minimal living standards equal pay for women doing equal work recognition of the right of unions to organize and bargain collectively.
in return it insisted that workers forgo all strikes and that employers not engage in lockouts.
membership in labor unions increased by more than 1 5 million between 1917 and 1919.
the war provided workers with important if usually temporary gains.
but it did not stop labor militancy.
that was particularly clear in the west where the western federation of miners staged a series of strikes to improve the terrible conditions in the underground mines.
the bloodiest of them occurred just before the war.
in ludlow colorado in 1914 workers mostly italians greeks and slavs walked out of coal mines owned by john d rockefeller.
joined by their wives and daughters they continued the strike even after they had been evicted from company housing and had moved into hastily erected tents.
the state militia was called into the town to protect the mines but in fact as was often the case it actually worked to help employers defeat the strikers.
joined by strikebreakers and others the militia attacked the workers tent colony and in the battle that followed thirty nine people died among them eleven children.
but these events which became known as the ludlow massacre were only precursors to continued conflict in the mines that the war itself did little to discourage.
economic and social results of the war whatever its other effects the war helped produce a remarkable period of economic growth in the united states a boom that began in 1914 when european demands for american products began to increase and accelerated after ludlow massacre the town in harlem harlem once a suburb of manhattan where middle class commuters lived became in the lafayette theatre was the first new york theater to desegregate in as early as 1912.

industrial production soared and manufacturing activity expanded in regions that had previously had relatively little of it.
the shipbuilding industry for example grew rapidly on the west coast enabled by the panama canal.
employment increased dramatically and because so many white men were away at war new opportunities for female african american mexican and asian workers appeared.
some workers experienced a significant growth in income but inflation cut into the wage increases and often produced a net loss in purchasing power.
the agricultural economy profited from the war as well.
farm prices rose to their highest levels in decades and agricultural production increased dramatically as a result.
one of the most important social changes of the war years was the migration of hundreds of thousands of african americans from the rural south into northern industrial cities.
it became known as the great migration like most great migrations it was a result of both a push migration and a pull the push was the poverty indebtedness racism and violence many black men and women experienced in the south.
the pull was the prospect of factory jobs in the urban north and the opportunity to live in communities where blacks could enjoy more freedom and autonomy.
in the labor scarce economy of the war years northern factory owners dispatched agents to the south to recruit african american workers.
black newspapers advertised the prospects for employment in the north.
and perhaps most important those who migrated sent word back to friends and families of the opportunities they encoun tered which explains the heavy concentration of migrants from a single area of the south in certain cities in the north.
in chicago for example the more than 70 000 new black residents came disproportionately from a few areas of alabama and mississippi.
the result was a dramatic growth in black communities in northern industrial cities such as new york chicago cleveland and detroit.
some older more established african american residents of these cities were unsettled by these new arrivals with their country ways and their revivalistic religion many people in the existing african american communities considered the newcomers coarse and feared that their presence would increase their own vulnerability to white racism.
but the movement could not be stopped.
new churches sprang up in black neighborhoods many of them simple storefronts from which self proclaimed preachers searched for congregations.
low paid black workers crowded into inadequate housing.
as race riots black communities expanded they inevitably began to rub up against white neighborhoods with occasionally violent results.
in east st louis illinois a white mob attacked a black neighborhood on july 2 1917 burned down many houses and shot the residents of some of them as they fled.
as many as forty african americans died.
for american women black and white the war meant new opportunities for employment.
a million or more women worked in a wide range of industrial jobs that in peacetime were considered male preserves steel munitions trucking public transportation.
most of them had been working in other lower paying jobs.
but whatever changes the war brought were temporary ones.
as soon as the war was over almost all of the women working in previously male industrial jobs quit or were fired in fact the percentage of women working for wages actually declined between 1910 and 1920.
the government had created the women in industry board to oversee the movement of these women into the jobs left ehind by men.
after the war the board became the womens bureau a permanent agency dedicated to protecting the interests of women in the workforce.
america and the great war 599 the futile search for social unity the idea of unity not only in the direction of the economy but in the nation s social purpose as well had been the dream of many progressives for decades.
to them the war seemed to offer an unmatched opportunity for america to close ranks behind a great common cause.
in the process they hoped society could achieve a lasting sense of collective purpose.
the dream of social unity helped drive many efforts the peace movement the labor movement and even the government.
but it also drove a period of political and social oppression and an egregious violation of civil liberties.
the peace movement woman s peace party government leaders and many others realized that public sentiment about american involvement in the war had been deeply divided before april 1917 and remained so even after the declaration of war.
the peace movement in the united states before 1917 had many constituencies german americans irish americans religious pacifists quakers mennonites and others intellectuals and groups on the left such as the socialist party and the industrial workers of the world all of whom considered the war a meaningless battle among capitalist nations for commercial supremacy an opinion many others in america and europe later came to share.
but the most active and widespread peace activism came from the womens movement.
in 1915 carrie chapman catt a leader of the fight for woman suffrage helped create the womans peace party with a small but active membership.
as the war in europe intensified the partys efforts to keep the united states from intervening grew.
women peace activists were sharply divided once america entered the war in 1917.
the national american woman suffrage association the largest womens organization supported the war and more than that presented itself as a patriotic organization dedicated to advancing the war effort.
its membership grew dramatically as a result.
catt who was among those who abandoned the peace cause now began calling for woman suffrage as a war measure to ensure that women whose work was essential to the war effort would feel fully a part of the nation.
but many other women refused to support the war even after april 1917.
among them were jane addams who was widely reviled as a result and charlotte perkins gilman a leading feminist activist.
women peace activists shared many of the same objections to the war as did the members of the socialist party to which some of them belonged.
but some criticized the war on other grounds as well arguing that as the mother half of humanity they had a special moral and mater nal basis for their pacifism.
maternal opposition to war selling the war and suppressing dissent world war i was not as popular among the american people as world war ii would be but most of the country supported the intervention once it began.
in communities across the nation there were outbursts of fervent patriotism floods of voluntary enlistments in the military and greatly increased displays of patriotism.
women joined their local red cross in an effort to contribute to the war effort.
children raised money for war bonds in their schools.
churches included prayers for the president and the troops in their services.
and the war also gave a large boost to the wave of religious revivalism that had been growing for a decade before 1917 revivalism in turn became a source of support for the war.
billy sunday the leading revivalist of his time dropped his early opposition to intervention in 1917 and became a fervent champion of the american military effort.
nevertheless government leaders and many others remained deeply concerned about the significant minorities who continued to oppose the war even after the united states entered the conflict.
many believed that a crucial prerequisite wartime propaganda this poster one of many lurid images of imperial germany used by the u s government to generate enthusiasm for american involvement in world war shows bloodstained german boots with the german eagle clearly visible.
the demonization of germany was at the heart of government efforts to portray the war to americans.

in wartime nations typically clarify the terms of citizenship military service and service asking some people to fight others to stay home and appealing to the public for participation and support.
the government sets the terms of service but they must align with popular values to be successful.
during world war i as part of the broad national effort to explain justify and fight the war the government disseminated the two posters below the 1917 1918 documents.
the first poster was part of a recruiting drive for the u s navy the second was part of a campaign to sell liberty loans interest bearing bonds that funded roughly two thirds of the war s 32 billion price tag.
both images suggest that women not only served in the military and industrial sectors they also served as symbols.
by the time of the war on terrorism of the early twenty first century the landscape of military recruitment had changed dramatically.
the new war was more limited in scale than world war i and the draft had been suspended in 1973 converting the military to an allvolunteer force.
this put a high premium on recruiting and marketing and the materials used for those purposes remained just as illuminating as ever see the 2006 2014 documents.

601 602 chapter 21 for victory was an energetic even coercive effort to unite public opinion behind the military effort.
the most conspicuous government effort to rally public support was a vast propaganda campaign orchestrated by the cp new committee on public information cpi.
it was directed by the denver journalist george creel who spoke openly of the importance of achieving social unity.
the cpi supervised the distribution of tons of pro war literature 75 million pieces of printed material.
war posters plastered the walls of offices shops theaters schools churches and homes.
newspapers dutifully printed official government accounts of the reasons for the war and the prospects for quick victory.
creel encouraged reporters to exercise self censorship when reporting news about the conflict.
as the war continued the cpis tactics became increasingly crude.
government promoted posters and films became lurid portrayals of the savagery of the germans bearing such titles as the prussian cur and the kaiser beast of berlin encouraging americans to think of the german people as something close to savages.
the government soon began more coercive efforts to suppress dissent.
the cpi ran full page advertisements in popular magazines like the saturday evening post urging citizens to espionage act notify justice department when they encountered the man who spreads the pessimistic stories.
cries for peace or belittles our efforts to win the war the espionage act of 1917 gave the government new tools with which to respond to such reports.
it created stiff penalties for spying sabotage or obstruction of the war effort crimes that were often broadly defined and it empowered the post office department to ban seditious material from the mails.
sedition postmaster general albert sidney burleson said included statements that might impugn the motives of the government and thus encourage insubordination anything that suggested that the government is controlled by wall street or munitions manufacturers or any other special interests he included in that category all publi cations of the socialist party.
more repressive were two measures of 1918 the sabotage act of april 20 and the sedition act of may 16.
these bills sedition act expanded the meaning of the espionage act to make illegal any public expression of opposition to the war in practice it allowed officials to prose cute anyone who criticized the president or the government.
the most frequent targets of the new legislation and one of the reasons for its enactment in the first place were such anticapitalist groups and antiwar groups as the socialist party and the industrial workers of the world iww.
many americans had favored the repression of socialists and radicals even before the war the wartime policies now made it possible to move against them legally.
eugene v debs the humane leader of the socialist party and an opponent of the war was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1918.
only a pardon by president warren g harding ultimately won his release in 1921.
big bill haywood and members of the iww were especially energetically prosecuted.
only by fleeing to the soviet repressing dissent union did haywood avoid long imprisonment.
more than 1 500 people were arrested in 1918 for the crime of criticizing the government.
state and local governments corporations universities and private citizens contributed as well to the climate of repression.
vigilante mobs sprang up to discipline those who dared challenge the war.
a dissident protestant clergyman in cincinnati was pulled from his bed one night by a mob dragged to a nearby hillside and whipped in the name of the women and children of belgium an iww organizer in montana was seized by a mob and hanged from a railroad bridge.
a cluster of citizens groups emerged to mobilize respectable members of their communities to root out disloyalty.
the american protective league probably the largest of such groups enlisted the services of 250 000 people who served as agents prying into the activities and thoughts of their neighbors opening mail tapping telephones and in general attempting to impose unity of opinion on their communities.
it received government funds to support its work.
attorney general thomas w gregory a particularly avid supporter of repressing dissent described the league and similar organizations approvingly as patriotic organizations other vigilante organizations the national security league the boy spies of america the american defense society performed much the same function.
there were many victims of such activities socialists labor activists female pacifists.
but the most frequent targets of repression were immigrants irish americans because of their historic 100 percent animsity toward the british jews because americanism many had expressed opposition to the anti semitic policies of the russian government and others.
loyalist citizens groups policed immigrant neighborhoods.
they monitored meetings and even conversations for signs of disloyalty.
even some settlement house workers many of whom had once championed ethnic diversity contributed to such efforts.
the director of the national security league described the origins of the anti immigrant sentiment which was producing growing support for what many citizens were now calling 100 percent americanism the melting pot has not melted.
there are vast communities in the nation thinking today not in terms of america but in terms of old world prejudices theories and animosities.
the greatest target of abuse was the german american community.
most german americans supported the american war effort once it began.
still public opinion turned bitterly hostile.
a campaign to purge society of all things german quickly gathered speed at times assuming ludicrous forms.
sauerkraut was renamed liberty cabbage frankfurters became liberty sausage performances of german music were frequently banned.
german books were removed from the shelves of libraries.
courses in the german language were removed from school curricula the california board of education called it a language that disseminates the ideals of autocracy rutality and hatred germans were routinely fired from jobs america and the great war 603 in war industries lest they sabotage important tasks.
some were fired from positions entirely unrelated to the war for example karl muck the german born conductor of the boston symphony orchestra.
vigilante groups routinely subjected germans to harassment and beatings including a lynching in southern illinois in 1918.
relatively few americans favored such extremes but many came to agree with the belief of the eminent psychologist g stanley hall that there is something fundamentally wrong with the teutonic soul the search for a new world order woodrow wilson had led the nation into war promising a more just and stable peace at its conclusion.
well before the armistice he was preparing to lead the fight for what he considered a democratic postwar settlement.
the fourteen points wilsons idealistic vision on january 8 1918 wilson appeared before congress to present the principles for which he claimed the nation was fighting.
the war aims had fourteen distinct provisions widely known as the fourteen points but they fell into three broad categories.
first wilsons proposals contained eight specific recommendations for adjusting postwar boundaries and for establishing new nations to replace the defunct austro hungarian and ottoman empires.
those recommenda tions reflected his belief in the right of all peoples to self determination.
second there were five general principles to govern international conduct in the future freedom of the seas open covenants instead of secret treaties reductions in armaments free trade and impartial mediation of colonial claims.
finally there was a proposal for a league of nations that would help implement these new principles and territorial adjustments and resolve future controversies.
there were serious flaws in wilsons proposals.
he provided no formula for deciding how to implement the national self determination he promised for subjugated peoples.
he said little about economic rivalries and their effect on international relations even though such economic tensions had been in large part responsible for the war.
nevertheless wilsons international vision quickly came to enchant not only much of his own generation in both america and europe but also members of generations to come.
it reflected his belief strongly rooted in the ideas of progressivism that the world was as capable of just and efficient government as were individual nations that once the international community accepted certain basic principles f conduct and once it constructed modern institutions to implement them the human race could live in peace.
the fourteen points were also an answer to the new bolshevik government in russia.
in december 1917 lenin had issued his own statement of war aims strikingly similar to wilsons.
wilsons announcement which came just three weeks later was among other things a last minute and un successful effort to persuade the bolshevik lenins challenge regime to keep russia in the war.
but wilson also realized that lenin was now a competitor in the effort to lead the postwar order.
and he announced the fourteen points in part to ensure that the world looked to the united states not russia for guidance.
early obstacles wilson was confident as the war neared its end that popular support would enable him to win allied approval of his peace plan.
but there were ominous signs both at home and abroad that his path might be more difficult than he expected.
in europe leaders of the allied forces many resenting what they considered wilsons tone of moral superiority were preparing to resist him even before the armistice was signed.
they had reacted unhappily when wilson refused to make the united states their ally but had kept his distance as an associate of his european partners keeping american military forces separate from the allied armies they were joining.
most of all however britain and france having suffered incalculable losses in their long years of war and having stored.
up an enormous reserve of bitterness toward allied r intransigence germany as a result were in no mood for a benign and generous peace.
the british prime minister david lloyd george insisted for a time that the german kaiser be captured and executed.
he and georges clemenceau president of france remained determined to the end to gain something from the struggle to compensate them for the catastrophe they had suffered.
at the same time wilson was encountering problems at home.
in 1918 with the war almost over he unwisely appealed to the american voters to support his peace plans by electing democrats to congress in the november elections.
a republican victory he declared would be interpreted on the other side of the water as a repudiation of my leadership days later the republicans captured majorities in both houses.
domestic economic troubles more than international issues had been the most important factor in the voting but because of the presidents ill timed appeal the results damaged his ability to claim broad popular support for his peace plans.
the leaders of the republican party in the meantime were developing their own reasons for opposing wilson.
some were angry that he had tried to make the 1918 balloting a referendum on his war aims especially since many republicans had been supporting the fourteen points.
wilson further antagonized them when he refused to appoint any important republicans to the negotiating team that would represent the united states at the peace conference in paris.
but the president considered such matters unimportant.
only one member of the american negotiating party would have any real authority wilson himself.
and once he had produced a just and moral treaty he believed the weight of world and american opinion would compel his enemies to support him.
chapter 21 the paris peace conference wilson arrived in europe to a welcome such as few men in history have experienced.
to the war weary people of the continent he was nothing less than a savior the man who would create a new and better world.
when he entered paris on december 13 1918 he was greeted some observers claimed by the largest crowd in the history of france.
the negotiations themselves however proved less satisfying.
the principal figures in the negotiations were the leaders of the victorious allied nations david lloyd george representing great britain georges clemenceau representing france vittorio orlando the prime minister of italy and wilson who hoped to dominate them all.
from the beginning the atmo sphere of idealism wilson had sought to create was competing with a spirit of national aggrandizement.
there was moreover a strong sense of unease about the unstable situation in eastern europe and the threat of communism.
russia whose new bolshevik government was still fighting white counterrevolutionaries was unrepresented in paris but the radical threat it seemed to pose to western governments was never far from the minds of any of the delegates least of all wilson himself.
indeed not long before he came to paris wilson ordered the landing of american troops in the soviet union.
they were there he claimed to help a group of 60 000 czech soldiers trapped in russia to escape.
but the americans soon became involved at least indirectly in assisting the white russians the anti bolsheviks in their fight against the new regime.
some american troops remained in russia as late as april 1920.
lenins wilson s retreat regime survived these challenges.
wilson refused to recognize the new government.
diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union were not restored until 1933.
in the tense and often vindictive atmosphere of the negotiations in paris wilson was unable to win approval of many of the broad principles he had espoused freedom of the seas which the british refused even to discuss free trade open covenants openly arrived at the paris negotiations themselves were often conducted in secret.
despite his support for impartial mediation of colonial claims he was forced to accept a transfer of german colonies in the pacific to japan the british had promised them in exchange for japanese assistance in the war.
wilsons pledge of national self determination for all peoples suffered numerous assaults.
economic and strategic demands were constantly coming into conflict with the principle of cultural nationalism.
the treaty departed most conspicuously from wilsons ideals on the question of reparations.
as the conference began the president opposed demanding compensation from the defeated central powers.
the other allied reparations leaders however were insistent and slowly wilson gave way and accepted the principle of reparations the specific sum to be set later by a commission.
that figure established in 1921 was 56 billion supposedly to pay for damages to civilians and for military pensions.
continued negotiations over the next decade scaled the sum back considerably.
in the end germany paid only 9 billion which was still more than its crippled economy could afford.
the reparations combined with other territorial and economic penalties the big four in paris surface cordiality during the paris peace conference disguised serious tensions among the so called big four the leaders of the victorious nations in world war i.
as the conference progressed the european leaders developed increasing resentment of woodrow wilson s high and some of them thought sanctimonious moral posture in the negotiations.
shown here are from left to right david lloyd george of great britain vittorio orlando of italy georges clemenceau of france and wilson.
the library of congress lc dig ggbain 29038 america and the great war 605 constituted an effort to keep germany weak for the indefinite future.
never again the allied leaders believed should the germans be allowed to become powerful enough to threaten the peace of europe.
wilson did manage to win some important victories in paris in setting boundaries and dealing with former colonies.
he secured approval of a plan to place many former colonies and imperial possessions among them palestine in trusteeship under the league of nations the so called mandate system.
he blocked a french proposal to break up western germany into a group of smaller states.
he helped design the creation of two new nations yugoslavia and czechoslovakia which were welded together out of among other territories pieces of the former austro hungarian empire.
each nation contained an uneasy collection of ethnic groups that had frequently battled one another in the past.
but wilsons most visible triumph and the one most important to him was the creation of a permanent international organization to oversee world affairs and prevent future wars.
league of on january 25 1919 the allies voted to nations accept the covenant of the league of nations and with that wilson believed the peace treaty was transformed from a disappointment into a success.
whatever mistakes and inequities had emerged from the peace conference he was convinced could be cor rected later by the league.
the covenant provided for an assembly of nations that would meet regularly to debate means of resolving disputes and protecting the peace.
authority to implement league decisions would rest with a nine member executive council the united states would be one of five permanent members of the council along with britain france italy and japan.
the covenant left many questions unanswered most notably how the league would enforce its decisions.
wilson however was confident that once established the new organization would find suitable answers.
the ratification battle wilson was well aware of the political obstacles awaiting him at home.
many americans accustomed to their nations isolation from europe questioned the wisdom of this major new commitment to internationalism.
others had serious reservations about the specific features of the treaty and the covenant.
after a brief trip to washington in february 1919 during which he listened to harsh objections to the treaty from members of the senate and others he returned to europe and insisted on several modifications in the covenant to satisfy his critics.
the revisions ensured that the united states would not be obliged to accept a league mandate to oversee a territory and that the league would not challenge the monroe doctrine but the changes were not enough to mollify his opponents and wilson refused to go further.
wilson presented the treaty of versailles which took its name from the palace outside paris where the final negotiating sessions had taken place to the senate on july 10 1919 asking dare we reject it and break the heart of the world.
in the wilsons weeks that followed he refused to consider intransigence even the most innocuous compromise.
his deteriorating physical condition he was suffering from hardening of the arteries and had apparently experienced something like a mild stroke undiagnosed in paris may have contributed to his intransigence.
the senate in the meantime was raising many objections.
some senators the fourteen so called irreconcilables many of them western isolationists opposed the agreement on principle.
but other opponents with less fervent convictions were principally concerned with constructing a winning issue for the republicans in 1920 and with weakening a president whom some members of the senate had come to despise.
most notable of these was senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts the henry cabot powerful chairman of the foreign relations lodge committee.
a man of stunning arrogance and a close friend of theodore roosevelt who had died early in 1919 spouting hatred of wilson to the end lodge loathed the president with genuine passion.
i never thought i could hate a man as i hate wilson he once admitted.
he used every possible tactic to obstruct delay and amend the treaty.
wilson for his part despised lodge as much as lodge despised him.
public sentiment clearly favored ratification so at first lodge could do little more than play for time.
when the document reached his committee he spent two weeks slowly reading aloud each word of its 300 pages then he held six weeks of public hearings to air the complaints of every disgruntled minority irish americans for example angry that the settlement made no provision for an independent ireland.
gradually lodges general opposition to the treaty crystallized into a series of reservations amendments to the league covenant limiting american obligations to the organization.
at this point wilson might still have won approval if he had agreed to some relatively minor changes in the language of the treaty.
but the president refused to yield.
when he realized the senate would not budge he decided to appeal to the public.
wilson s ordeal what followed was a political disaster and a personal tragedy.
wilson embarked on a grueling cross country speaking tour to arouse public support for the treaty.
in a little more than three weeks he traveled over 8 000 miles by train speaking as often as four times a day resting hardly at all.
finally he reached the end of his strength.
after speaking at pueblo colorado on september 25 he collapsed with severe headaches.
canceling the rest of his itinerary he rushed back to washington d c where a few days later he suffered a major stroke.
for two weeks he was close to death for six weeks more he was so seriously ill that he could conduct virtually no public business.
his wife and his doctor formed an almost impenetrable barrier around him shielding him from any official pressures that might impede his recovery preventing the public from receiving any accurate information about the gravity of his condition.
606 chapter 21 league membership rejected wilson ultimately recovered enough to resume a limited official schedule but he was essentially an invalid for the remaining eighteen months of his presidency.
his left side was partially paralyzed more important like many stroke victims he had only partial control of his mental and emotional state.
his condition only intensified what had already been his strong tendency to view public issues in moral terms and to resist any attempts at compromise.
when the senate foreign relations committee finally sent the treaty to the full senate for ratification recommending nearly fifty amendments and reservations wilson refused to consider any of them.
when the full senate voted in november to accept fourteen of the reservations wilson gave stern directions to his democratic allies they must vote only for a treaty with no changes whatsoever any other version must be defeated.
on november 19 1919 forty two democrats following the presidents instructions joined with the thirteen republican irreconcilables to reject the amended treaty.
when the senate voted on the original version without any reservations thirty eight senators all but one democrats voted to approve it fifty five senators some democrats among them voted no.
there were sporadic efforts to revive the treaty over the next few months.
but wilsons opposition to anything but the precise settlement he had negotiated in paris remained too formidable an obstacle.
he was moreover becoming convinced that the 1920 national election would serve as a solemn referendum on the league.
by now however public interest in the peace process had begun to fade partly as a reaction against the tragic bitterness of the ratification fight but more in response to a series of other crises.
a society in turmoil even during the paris peace conference many americans were less concerned about international matters than about turbulent wt events at home.
the american economy ex new social environment perienced a severe postwar recession.
and much of middle class america responded to demands for change with a fearful conservative hostility.
the aftermath of war brought not the age of liberal reform that progressives had predicted but a period of repression and reaction.
industry and labor citizens of washington d c on the day after the armistice found it impossible to place long distance telephone calls the lines were jammed with officials of the war agencies canceling government contracts.
the fighting had ended sooner than anyone had anticipated and without warning without planning the nation was launched into the difficult task of economic reconversion.
at first the wartime boom continued.
but the postwar prosperity rested largely on the lingering effects of the war government deficit spending continued for some months after the armistice and on sudden temporary demands a union membership 1900 1920 this chart illustrates the steady increase in union membership in the first part of the twentieth century a membership dominated by unions associated with the afl.

w did the war years see such an expansion of union labor.
booming market for scarce consumer goods at home and a strong market for american products in the war ravaged nations of europe.
this brief postwar boom was accompanied however by raging inflation a result in part of the rapid abandonment of wartime price controls.
through most of 1919 and 1920 prices rose at an average of more than 15 percent a year.
finally late in 1920 the economic bubble burst as many of the temporary forces that had created it disappeared and as inflation began killing the market for consumer goods.
between postwar 1920 and 1921 the gross national product recession gnp declined nearly 10 percent 100 000 businesses went bankrupt 453 000 farmers lost their land nearly 5 million americans lost their jobs.
in this unpromising economic environment leaders of organized labor set out to consolidate the advances they had made in the war which now seemed in danger of being lost.
the raging inflation of 1919 wiped out the modest wage gains workers had achieved during the war many laborers worried about job security as hundreds of thousands of veterans returned to the workforce arduous working conditions such as the twelve hour workday in the steel industry continued to be a source of discontent.
employers aggravated the resentment by using the end of the war and the end of government controls to america and the great war 607 rescind benefits they had been forced to give workers in 1917 and 1918 most notably recognition of unions.
the year 1919 therefore saw an unprecedented wave of strikes more than 3 600 in all involving over 4 million workers.
in january a walkout by shipyard workers in seattle washington evolved into a general strike that brought the entire city almost to a standstill.
the mayor requested and received the assistance of u s marines to keep the city running and eventually the strike failed.
but the brief success of a general strike something americans associated with european radicals made the seattle incident reverberate loudly throughout the country.
in september there was a strike by the boston police force which was responding to layoffs and wage cuts by demanding recognition of its union.
seattle had re boston police.
strike mained generally calm during its strike but with its police off the job boston erupted in violence and looting.
efforts by local businessmen veterans and college students to patrol the streets proved ineffective and finally governor calvin coolidge called in the national guard to restore order.
his public statement that there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere any time attracted national steelworkers strike defeated acclaim.
eventually boston officials dismissed the entire police force and hired a new one.
in september 1919 the greatest strike in american history began when 350 000 steelworkers in several eastern and mid western cities walked off the job demanding an eight hour workday and recognition of their union.
the steel strike was long bitter and violent most of the violence coming from employers who hired armed guards to disperse picket lines and escort strikebreakers into factories.
it climaxed in a riot in gary indiana in which eighteen strikers were killed.
steel executives managed to keep most plants running with nonunion labor and public opinion was so hostile to the strikers that the afl having at first endorsed the strike soon timidly repudiated it.
by january the strike had collapsed.
it was a setback from which organized labor would not recover for more than a decade.
the demands of african americans the nearly 400 000 black men who had served in the armed forces during the war came home in 1919 and marched in front of a store where broken windows suggest looting has already occurred during the boston police strike the boston police strike national guardsmen stand guard f 1919.

and then in new york and other cities they marched again through the streets of black neighborhoods such as harlem led by jazz bands cheered by thousands of african americans worshiped as heroes.
the black soldiers were an inspiration to thousands of urban african americans a sign they thought that a new age had come that the glory of black heroism in the war would make it impossible for white society ever again to treat african americans as less than equal citizens.
du bois watching the african american soldiers returning home conveyed his hopes for a new life for them.
we are returning from war he wrote the crisis and tens of thousands of black men were drafted into the great struggle.
we fought gladly and to the last drop of blood for america and her highest ideals we fought in far off hope but recalling the past he added this country of ours despite all its better souls have done and dreamed is yet a shameful land in fact that black soldiers had fought in the war had almost no impact on white attitudes.
but it did have a profound effect on black attitudes it accentuated african american bitterness.
and increased black determination to fight new black attitudes fr r eir ri ts.
for soldiers there was an expectation of some social reward for their service.
for many other african americans the war had raised economic expectations as they moved into industrial and other jobs vacated by white workers jobs to which they had previously had no access.
just as black soldiers expected their military service to enhance their social status so black factory workers regarded their move north as an escape from racial prejudice and an opportunity for economic gain.
chicago race riots by 1919 however the racial climate had become savage and murderous.
in the south there was a sudden increase in lynchings more than seventy blacks some of them war veterans died at the hands of white mobs in 1919 alone.
in the north black factory workers faced widespread layoffs as returning white veterans displaced them from their jobs.
african american veterans found no significant new opportunities for advancement.
rural black migrants to northern cities encountered white communities unfamiliar with and generally hostile to them and as whites became convinced that black workers with lower wage demands were hurting them economically animosity grew rapidly.
the wartime riots in east st louis and elsewhere were a prelude to a summer of much worse racial violence in 1919.
in chicago a black teenager swimming in lake michigan on a hot july day happened to drift toward a white beach.
whites on shore allegedly stoned him unconscious he sank and drowned.
angry blacks gathered in crowds and marched into white neighborhoods to retaliate whites formed even larger crowds and roamed into black neighborhoods shooting stabbing and beating passersby destroying homes and properties.
for more than a week chicago was virtually at war.
in the end 38 people died 15 whites and 23 blacks and 537 were injured over 1 000 people were left homeless.
the chicago riot was the worst but not the only racial violence during the so called red summer of 1919 in all 120 people died in such racial outbreaks in little more than three months.
racial violence and even racially motivated urban riots was not new.
the deadliest race riot in american history had the fifteenth regiment on fifth avenue the all black fifteenth army regiment marches up fifth avenue in new york city in 1917 shortly after the united states entered world war i.
they are en route to an army training camp in new york state before traveling to the front in europe.
less than two years later many of these same men marched through harlem on their return from the war and again down fifth avenue before cheering crowds convinced wrongly that their service in the war would win them important new freedoms at home.

609 occurred in new york during the civil war.
but the 1919 riots were different in one respect they did not just involve white people attacking blacks they also involved blacks fighting back.
the naacp signaled this change by urging african americans not just to demand government protection but also to retaliate to defend themselves.
the poet claude mckay one of the major figures of what would shortly be known as the harlem renaissance wrote a poem after the chicago riot called if we must die like men well face the murderous cowardly pack.
pressed to the wall dying but fighting back.
marcus garveys black nationalism at the same time a jamaican marcus garvey began to attract a wide american following mostly among poor urban blacks with an ideology of black nationalism.
garvey encouraged african americans to take pride in their own achievements and to develop an awareness of their african heritage to reject assimilation into white society and develop pride in what garvey argued was their own superior race and culture.
his united negro improvement association unia launched a chain of black owned grocery stores and pressed for the creation of other black businesses.
eventually garvey began urging his supporters to leave america and return to africa where they could create a new society of their own.
in the 1920s the garvey movement experienced explosive growth for a time and the unia became notable for its mass rallies and parades for the opulent uniforms of its members and for the growth of its enterprises.
it began to decline however after garvey was indicted in 1923 on charges of business fraud.
he was deported to jamaica two years later.
but the allure of black nationalism which he helped make visible to millions of african americans survived in black culture long after garvey himself was gone.
the red scare to much of the white middle class at the time the industrial warfare the racial violence and other forms of dissent all appeared to be frightening omens of instability and radicalism.
this was in part because the russian revolution of november 1917 made it clear that communism was no longer simply a theory but now an important regime.
concerns about the communist threat grew in 1919 when the soviet government announced the formation of the communist international or comintern whose purpose was to export revolution around the world.
and in america itself there were in addition to the great number of imagined radicals a modest number of real ones.
the american communist party was formed in 1919 and there were other radical groups many of them dominated by immigrants from europe who had been involved in radical politics before coming to america.
some of these radicals were presumably responsible for a series of bombings in the spring of 1919 that produced great national alarm.
in april the post office department intercepted several dozen parcels addressed to leading businessmen and politicians that were triggered to explode when opened.
several of them reached their destinations and one of them exploded severely injuring a domestic servant of a public official in georgia.
two months later eight bombs exploded in eight cities within minutes of one another suggesting a nationwide conspiracy.

in 1920 there was a terrible explosion in front of the morgan bank on wall street which killed thirty people only one of them a clerk in the bank itself.
the bombings crystallized what was already a growing determination among many middle class americans and some government officials to fight back against antiradicalism radicalism a determination steeled by the repressive atmosphere of the war years.
this antiradicalism accompanied and reinforced the already strong commitment among old stock protestants to the idea of 100 percent americanism and it produced what became known as the red scare.
antiradical newspapers and politicians now began to portray almost every form of instability or protest as a sign of a radical threat.
race riots one newspaper claimed were the work of armed revolutionaries running rampant through our cities the steel strike the philadelphia inquirer claimed was penetrated with the bolshevik idea.
steeped in the doctrines of the class struggle and social overthrow nearly thirty states enacted new peacetime sedition laws imposing harsh penalties on those who promoted revolution some 300 people went to jail as a result many of them people whose crime had been nothing more than opposition to the war.
there were spontaneous acts of violence against supposed radicals in some communities.
a mob of off duty soldiers in new york city ransacked the offices of a socialist newspaper and beat up its staff.
another mob in centralia washington dragged an iww agitator from jail and castrated him before hanging him from a bridge.
citizens in many communities removed subversive books from the shelves of libraries administrators in some universities dismissed radical members from their faculties.
womens groups such as the national consumers league came under attack by antiradicals because so many feminists had opposed american intervention in the fighting in europe.
perhaps the greatest contribution to the red scare came from the federal government.
on new years day 1920 attorney general a mitchell palmer and his ambitious assistant j edgar hoover orchestrated a series of raids on alleged radical centers throughout the country and arrested more than 6 000 people.
the palmer raids had been intended to uncover large palmer raids caches of weapons and explosives they discovered only three pistols.
most of those arrested were ultimately released but about 500 who were not american citizens were summarily deported.
the ferocity of the red scare soon abated but its effects lingered well into the 1920s most notably in the celebrated sacco and case of sacco and vanzetti in mav l920 vanzetti two italian immigrants nicola sacco and bartolomeo vanzetti were charged with the murder of a paymaster in braintree massachusetts.
the evidence against them was questionable but because both men were confessed anarchists they faced a widespread public presumption of guilt.
they were convicted in a trial of extraordinary injudiciousness before an openly prejudiced judge webster thayer and were sentenced to death.
over the next several years public support for sacco and america and the great war.
611 vanzetti grew to formidable proportions.
but all requests for a new trial or a pardon were denied.
on august 23 1927 amid widespread protests around the world sacco and vanzetti still proclaiming their innocence died in the electric chair.
theirs was a cause that a generation of americans never forgot.
refuting the red scare an unexpected result of postwar turmoil was the emergence of a vigorous defense of civil liberties that not only discredited the red scare but helped give new force of the bill of rights as well.
the heavy handed actions of the federal government after the war created a powerful backlash.
it destroyed the career of a mitchell palmer.
it almost nipped in the bud the ascent of j edgar hoover.
it damaged the democratic party.
and it led to an organization committed to protecting civil liberties the national civil liberties bureau launched in 1917 which in 1920 was renamed the american civil liberties union aclu which remains a prominent institution today.
at the same time members of the supreme the palmer raids in the years following world war i many americans feared pohtica radicalism especially from the left.
the united states department of justice led by attorney general a mitchell palmer conducted raids and arrested and deported more than 500 foreign citizens including several prominent leftist leaders.
everett collection inc alamy court most notably justices oliver wendell holmes and louis brandeis gradually moved toward a strong position of defense of unpopular speech.
the clash of fighting faiths holmes wrote in a dissent in 1920 was best resolved by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the competition of the market this and other dissents eventually became law as other justices committed themselves to a robust defense of speech however unpopular.
the retreat from idealism on august 26 1920 the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote became part of the constitution.
to the woman suffrage movement this was the culmination of nearly a century of struggle.
to many progressives who had seen the inclusion of women in the electorate as a way of bolstering their political strength it seemed to promise new support for reform.
in some respects the amendment helped fulfill that promise.
because of woman suffrage members of congress concerned that women would vote as a bloc on the basis of womens issues passed the sheppard towner maternity and infancy act in 1921 one of the first pieces of federal welfare legislation that provided funds for supporting the health of women and infants.
concern about the womens vote also appeared to create support for the 1922 cable act which granted women the rights of u s citizenship independent of their husbands status and for the proposed but never ratified 1924 constitutional amendment to outlaw child labor.
in other ways however the nineteenth amendment marked less the beginning of an era of reform than an ending.
economic problems feminist demands labor unrest racial tensions and the intensity of the antiradicalism they helped create all combined in the years immediately following the war to produce a general sense of disillusionment.
that became particularly apparent in the election of 1920.
woodrow wilson wanted the campaign to be a referendum on the league of nations and the democratic candidates ohio governor james m cox and assistant secretary of the navy return to franklin d roosevelt tried to keep wilsons normalcy ideals alive.
the republican presidential nominee however offered a different vision.
he was warren gamaliel harding an obscure ohio senator whom party leaders had chosen as their nominee confident that he would do their bidding once in office.
harding offered few ideals only a vague promise of a return as he later phrased it to normalcy he won in a landslide.
the republican ticket received 61 percent of the popular vote and carried every state outside the south.
the party made major gains in congress as well.
woodrow wilson who had tried and failed to create a postwar order based on democratic ideals stood repudiated.
early in 1921 he retired to a house on s street in washington where he lived quietly until his death in 1924.
in the meantime for most americans a new era had begun.
612 chapter 21 looking back the greatest and most terrible war in human history to that point was also an important moment in the rise of the united states to global preeminence.
the powers of europe emerged from more than four years of carnage with their societies and economies in disarray.
the united states emerged from its own much briefer involvement in the war poised to become the most important political and economic force in the world.
for a time after the outbreak of war in europe in 1914 most americans president wilson among them wanted to stay out of the conflict.
gradually however as the war dragged on and the tactics of britain and germany began to impinge on american trade and on freedom of the seas the united states found itself drawn into the conflict.
in april 1917 finally congress agreed although not without considerable dissent to the presidents request that the united states enter the war as an ally of britain.
american forces quickly broke the stalemate that had bogged the european forces down in years of inconclusive trench warfare.
within a few months after the arrival of substantial numbers of american troops in europe germany agreed to an armistice and the war shuddered to a close.
american casualties although not inconsiderable were negligible compared to the millions suffered by the european combatants.
in the meantime the american economy experienced an enormous industrial boom as a result of the war.

although the war enhanced some reform efforts most notably prohibition and woman suffrage it also introduced an atmosphere of intolerance and repression into american life an atmosphere assisted by policies of the federal government designed to suppress dissent.
the aftermath of the war was even more disheartening to progressives both because of a brief but highly destabilizing recession and because of a wave of repression directed against labor radicals african americans and immigrants in 1919 and 1920.
at the same time woodrow wilsons bold and idealistic dream of a peace based on the principles of democracy and justice suffered a painful death.
the treaty of versailles which he helped to draft was itself far from what wilson had hoped.
it did however contain a provision for a league of nations which wilson believed could transform the international order.
but the league quickly became controversial in the united states and despite strenuous efforts by the president efforts that hastened his own physical collapse the treaty was defeated in the senate.

how did the technological innovations of the early twentieth century affect industry and american social life of the 1920s.
what were some of the cultural conflicts of the 1920s and what caused them.
is the term the new era a fitting description of the 1920s.
setting the stage the image of the 1920s in the american popular imagination is of an era of affluence conservatism and cultural frivolity.
in reality the decade was a time of significant and dramatic social economic and political change.
during this era the american economy enjoyed spectacular growth and developed new forms of organization as well.
a new urban industrial consumer oriented culture emerged.
american government for all its apparent conservatism experimented with new approaches to public policy.
to a large degree these changes were the result of industrialization the rapid growth of cities and the increasing size and power of the middle class.
contemporaries liked to refer to the 1920s as the new era an age in which america was becoming a modern nation.
the idea of a new era embraced the belief that the new era was a time of liberation in which people could reject traditional social restraints and live a freer life less constrained by tradition and propriety.
but these same challenges to traditional values and ways of life also made the 1920s a turbulent era in which the nation experienced substantial cultural conflict many americans rebelled against the new customs and morals of the urban middle class and sought to defend older values.
the intense cultural conflicts of the 1920s were evidence of how many americans remained outside the reach of the new affluent consumer culture some because their economic and social circumstances barred them from it others because they found the character of this culture alien and unfulfilling.
the new era s exuberant modernization in short contributed to deep divisions in both politics and culture.
the new economy after the recession of 1921 1922 the united states began a period of almost uninterrupted prosperity and economic expansion.
less visible at the time but equally significant was the survival and even the growth of inequalities and imbalances.
technology and economic growth no one could deny the remarkable some believed miraculous feats of the american economy in the 1920s.
the nations manufacturing output rose by more than 60 percent during the decade.
per capita income grew by a third.
inflation was negligible.
a mild recession in 1923 interrupted the pattern of growth but when it subsided early in 1924 the economy expanded with greater vigor than before.
the economic boom was a result of many factors.
an immediate cause was the debilitation of european industry in the aftermath of world war 1 which left the united states for the next ten years or so the only truly healthy industrial power in the world.
more important in the long run sources of was technology and the great industrial expansion it made possible.
the auto the boom mobile industry as a result of the development of the assembly line and other innovations now became one of the most important industries in the nation.
it stimulated growth in many related industries as well.
auto manufacturers purchased the products of steel rubber glass and tool companies.
auto owners bought gasoline from the oil corpora tions.
road construction in response to the proliferation of motor vehicles became an important industry.
the increased mobility the automobile made possible increased the demand for suburban housing fueling a boom in the construction industry.
other new industries benefiting from technological innovations contributed as well to the economic growth radio began to become a popular technology even before commercial broadcasting began in 1920.
early radio had been able to broadcast little besides pulses radi which meant that radio communication could occur only through the morse code but with the discovery of the theory of modulation pioneered by the canadian scientist reginald fessenden it became possible to transmit speech and music.
modulation also eventually made possible the transmission of video signals that later helped create radar and television.
