dams that he built during the depression and the reconstruction finance corporation lent him 300 million to build shipyards and manufacturing plants during the war.
working together in this way american business and government turned out a prodigious supply of military hardware 86 000 tanks 296 000 airplanes 15 million rifles and machine guns 64 000 landing craft and 6 500 cargo ships and naval vessels.
the american way of war wrote the scottish historian d w brogan in 1944 was mechanized like the american farm and kitchen americas productive industrial economy as much as or more than its troops proved the decisive factor in winning world war ii.
the system of allotting contracts along with the suspension of antitrust prosecutions during the war created giant corporate enterprises.
by 1945 the largest one hundred american companies produced 70 percent of the nations industrial output.
these corporations would form the core of what became known as the nations military industrial complex during the cold war chapter 25.
mobilizing the american fighting force the expanding federal bureaucracy also had a human face.
to fight the war the government mobilized tens of millions of soldiers civilians and workers coordinated on a scale unprecedented in u s history.
during world war ii the armed forces of the united states enlisted more than fifteen million men and women.
in no other military conflict have so many american citizens served in the armed services.
they came from every region and economic station black sharecroppers from alabama white farmers from the midwest the sons and daughters of european mexican and caribbean immigrants native men from navajo and choctaw reservations and other tribal communities women from every state in the nation even hollywood celebrities.
from urban rural and suburban areas from working class and middle class backgrounds they all served in the military.
in contrast to its otherwise democratic character the american army segregated the nearly one million african americans in uniform.
the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and other civil rights groups reprimanded the government saying a jim crow army cannot fight for a free world but the military continued to separate african americans and assign them menial duties.
the poet langston hughes observed the irony we are elevator boys janitors red caps maids a race in uniform the military uniform hughes implied was not assigned to african americans so readily.
native americans and mexican americans on the other hand were never officially segregated they rubbed elbows with the sons of european immigrants and native born soldiers from all regions of the country.
among the most instrumental soldiers were the native american code talkers in the pacific theater native navajo speakers communicated orders to fleet commanders.
japanese intelligence could not decipher the code because it was based on the navajo language which fewer than fifty non navajos in the world understood.
at the battle of iwo jima for instance one of the wars fiercest navajo code talkers working around the clock sent and received more than eight hundred messages without error.
in the european theater army commanders used comanche choctaw and cherokee speakers to thwart the nazis and exchange crucial military commands on the battlefield.
no axis nation ever broke these native american codes.
approximately 350 000 american women enlisted in the military.
about 140 000 served in the womens army corps wac and 100 000 served in the navys women accepted for volunteer emergency service waves.
one third of the nations registered nurses almost 75 000 overall volunteered for military duty.
in addition about 1 000 womens airforce service pilots wasps ferried planes and supplies in noncombat areas.
the armed forces limited the duties assigned to women however.
female officers could not command men and wacs and waves were barred from combat duty although nurses of both sexes served close to the front lines risking capture or death.
most of the jobs that women did in the military clerical work communications and health care resembled womens jobs in civilian life.
historians still debate how to characterize the world war ii american military.
as an army of citizen soldiers it represented a wide stratum of society.
military service gave a generation of men a noble purpose following a decade of economic depression.
and its ethic of patriotism further advanced the children of immigrants into mainstream american life.
yet the military embodied the tensions and contradictions of american society as well.
the draft revealed appalling levels of health fitness and education among millions of americans spurring reformers to call for improved literacy and nutrition.
womens integration into the military was marked by deep anxieties about their potentially negative effects on male soldiers as well as the threat to womanhood posed by service.
the american army was like the nation itself.
chapter 24 united in wartime purpose the military reflected the strengths and weaknesses of a diverse fractious society.
workers and the war effort as millions of working age citizens joined the military the nation faced a critical labor shortage.
consequently many women and african americans joined the industrial workforce taking jobs unavailable to them before the conflict.
unions benefitting from the demand for labor negotiated higher wages and improved conditions for americas workers.
by 1943 with the economy operating at full capacity the breadlines and doubledigit unemployment of the 1930s were a memory.

women made up 36 percent of the labor force in 1945 compared with 24 percent at the beginning of the war.
war work did not free women from traditional expectations and limitations however.
women often faced sexual harassment on the job and usually received lower wages than men did.
in shipyards women with the most seniority and responsibility earned 6 95 a day whereas the top men made as much as 22.
wartime work was thus bittersweet for women because it combined new opportunities with old constraints.
the majority labored in low wage service jobs.
child care was often unavailable despite the largest government sponsored child care program in history.
when the men returned from war rosie the riveter was usually out of a job.
government propaganda now encouraged women back into the home where it was implied their true calling lay in raising families and standing behind the returning soldiers.
but many married women refused or could not afford to put on aprons and stay home.
womens participation in the paid labor force rebounded by the late 1940s and continued to rise over the rest of the twentieth century bringing major changes in family life chapter 26.

i had all kinds of jobs.
during the war we had one line a big line where youd work ten hours and youd stand in one spot or sit in one spot.
it got terrible all day long.
so i suggested to my foreman the general foreman that we take turns of learning everybodys job and switching every half hour.
well they the management didnt like it but we were on the side every once in a while learning each others job and learning how to do it so eventually most all of us got so we could do all the jobs of which there were probably fifteen or twenty on the line.
we could do every job so we could go up and down the line and rotate.
and then they found out that that was really a pretty good thing to do because it made the people happier.
one day i was the steward and they wouldnt listen to me.
they cut our rates so i shut off the line and the boss came up and he said what are you doing i said well i have asked everybody that i know why we have gotten a cut in pay and why were doing exactly the same amount of work as we did.
so anyhow we wrote up a big grievance and they all signed it and then i called the president of the union and then we had a meeting.
at that point the president decided that i should be added to the bargaining committee so that i would go in and argue our case because i could do it better than any of the rest of them because i knew what it was.
we finally got it straightened out and we got our back pay too.
from then on i was on the bargaining committee all the years that i worked at rayovac.

ive always been very proud of that.
i certainly got educated in more ways than i ever expected being a very young girl.
but looking back i wouldnt trade my experiences for anything.
my feeling about the war in most instances was a conglomerate of mixed emotions.
i had lived a fairly sheltered life but i listened and learned and managed to survive but i must admit it left a scar on my memory that can never be erased.
i was living in one of my parents apartments during the war and since they were both retired they baby sat my young son.
my mother decided after a while that she too would like to do something in some little way to help.
so she applied for maintenance and between my father and the girl next door i managed to have a baby sitter available at all times.
the government was asking for rubber donations so my mother and i gave them our rubber girdles.
we liked to think that our girdles helped win the war.
my life took on a totally new perspective the longer i worked there.
i saw many tragic accidents none of which i care to talk about which haunt me to this day.
i couldnt do much socializing as i had a small infant at home to care for when off work and besides i was really pooped.
those midnight shifts were killers i hope i never have to do that again.
i tried to write weekly letters to my husband in between my other duties.
our community gathered together and collected scrap metals and such to help in the war effort and thanks to a good neighbor who was growing a victory garden we managed to get gifts of potatoes and lettuce etc.
the government issued coupon books that allowed us two bananas a week one pound of sugar and so many gallons of gas.
we traded back and forth depending on our individual needs.
i had a 1934 ford and fortunately it wasnt a gas eater and it managed to get me where i was going when i needed it.
there were no unions there at that time and no baby sitting service provided.
the single people formed a club and they entertained themselves after work but i was a married person with a child and so i didnt participate in any of their activities.

in 1940 only 240 of the nations 100 000 aircraft workers were black and most of them were janitors.
african american leaders demanded that the government require defense contractors to hire more black workers.
when washington took no action a philip randolph head of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters the largest black labor union in the country announced plans for a march on washington in the summer of 1941.
roosevelt was not a strong supporter of african american equality but he wanted to avoid public protest and a disruption of the understand nations war preparations.
so the points of view president made a deal he issued how does the slogan a executive order 8802 and in jim crow army cannot june 1941 randolph canceled the fight for a free world march.
the order prohibited disconnect the war abroad crimination in the employment with the civil rights of workers in defense industries struggle at home.
or government because of race creed color or national origin and established the fair employment practices commission fepc.
mary mcleod bethune called the wartime fepc a refreshing shower in a thirsty land this federal commitment to black employment rights was unprecedented but limited it did not affect segregation in the armed forces and the fepc could not enforce compliance with its orders.
nevertheless wartime developments laid the groundwork for the civil rights revolution of the 1960s.
the naacp grew ninefold to 450 000 members by 1945.
in chicago james farmer helped to found the congress of racial equality core in 1942 a group that would become known nationwide in the 1960s for its direct action protests such as sit ins.
the fepc inspired black organizing against employment discrimination in hundreds of cities and workplaces.
behind this combination of government action and black militancy the civil rights movement would advance on multiple fronts in the postwar years.
mexican americans too challenged long standing practices of discrimination and exclusion.
throughout much of the southwest it was still common for signs to read no mexicans allowed and mexican american workers were confined to menial low paying jobs.
several organizations including the league of united latin american citizens lulac and the congress of spanish speaking peoples pressed the government chapter 24 and private employers to end anti mexican discrimination.
mexican american workers themselves often in congress of industrial organizations cio unions such as the cannery workers and shipyard workers also led efforts to enforce the fepcs equal employment mandate.
exploitation persisted however.
to meet wartime labor demands the u s government brought tens of thousands of mexican contract laborers into the united states under the bracero program.
paid little and treated poorly the braceros who took their name from the spanish brazo arm highlighted the oppressive conditions of farm labor in the united states.
after the war the federal government continued to participate in labor exploitation bringing hundreds of thousands of mexicans into the country to perform low wage agricultural work.
future mexican american civil rights leaders dolores huerta and cesar chavez began to fight this labor system in the 1940s.
organized labor during the war unions solidified their position as the most powerful national voice for american workers and extended gains made during the new deal.
by 1945 almost 15 million workers belonged to a union up from 9 million in 1939.
representatives of the major unions made a no strike pledge for the duration of the war and roosevelt rewarded them by creating the national war labor board nwlb composed of representatives of labor management and the public.
the nwlb established wages hours and working conditions and had the authority to seize manufacturing plants that did not comply.
the boards maintenance of membership policy which encouraged workers in major defense industries to join unions also helped organized labor grow.
despite these arrangements unions endured government constraints and faced a sometimes hostile congress.
frustrated with limits on wage increases and the no strike pledge in 1943 more than half a million united mine workers went out on strike demanding a higher wage increase than that recommended by the nwlb.
congress responded by passing over roosevelts veto the smith connally labor act of 1943 which allowed the president to prohibit strikes in defense industries and forbade political contributions by unions.
congressional hostility would continue to hamper the union movement in the postwar years.
although organized labor would emerge from world war ii more powerful than at any time in u s history its business and corporate opponents too would emerge from the war with new strength.
the world at war 1937 1945 politics in wartime in his 1944 state of the union address fdr called for a second bill of rights one that would guarantee all americans access to education and jobs adequate food and clothing and decent housing and medical care.
like his four freedoms speech this was a call to extend the new deal by broadening the rights to individual security and welfare guaranteed by the government.
the answer to his call however would have to wait for the wars conclusion.
congress created new government benefits only for military veterans known as gis short for government issue.
the servicemens readjustment act 1944 an extraordinarily influential program popularly known as the gi bill of rights provided education job training medical care pensions and mortgage loans for men and women who had served in the armed forces chapter 26.
the presidents call for social legislation sought to reinvigorate the new deal political coalition.
in the election of 1944 roosevelt again headed the democratic ticket.
but party leaders aware of fdrs health problems and fearing that vice president henry wallaces outspoken support for labor and civil rights would alienate moderate voters dropped him from the ticket.
in his place they chose senator harry s truman of missouri a straight talking no nonsense politician with little national experience.
the republicans nominated governor thomas e dewey of new york.
dewey who accepted the general principles of welfarestate liberalism domestically and favored internationalism in foreign affairs attracted some of roosevelts supporters.
but a majority of voters preferred political continuity and roosevelt was reelected with 53 5 percent of the nationwide vote.
the democratic coalition retained its hold on government power and the era of republican political dominance 1896 1932 slipped further into the past.
life on the home front the united states escaped the physical devastation that ravaged europe and east asia but the war profoundly changed the country.
americans welcomed wartime prosperity but shuddered when they saw a western union boy on his bicycle fearing that he carried a war department telegram reporting the death of someones son husband or father.

the owi urged advertising agencies to link their clients products to the war effort arguing that patriotic ads would not only sell goods but also invigorate instruct and inspire citizens thinking like a historian p 784.
popular culture especially the movies reinforced connections between the home front and the war effort.
hollywood producers directors and actors offered their talents to the war department.
director frank capra created a documentary series titled why we fight to explain war aims to conscripted soldiers.
movie stars such as john wayne and spencer tracy portrayed heroic american fighting men in numerous films such as guadalcanal diary 1943 and thirty seconds over tokyo 1945.
in this pretelevision era newsreels accompanying the feature films kept the public up to date on the war as did on the spot radio chapter 24 broadcasts by edward r murrow and mary marvin breckenridge the first female radio correspondent for cbs.
for many americans the major inconvenience during the war years was the shortage of consumer goods.
beginning in 1942 federal agencies subjected almost everything americans ate wore or used to rationing or regulation.
the first major scarcity was rubber.
the japanese conquest of malaysia and dutch indonesia cut off 97 percent of americas imports of that essential raw material.
to conserve rubber for the war effort the government rationed tires so many of the nations 30 million car owners put their cars in storage.
as more people walked they wore out their shoes.
in 1944 shoes were rationed to two pairs per person a year.
by 1943 the government was rationing meat butter sugar and other foods.
most citizens cooperated with the complicated rationing and coupon system but at least one quarter of the population bought items on the black market especially meat gasoline cigarettes and nylon stockings.
migration and the wartime city the war determined where people lived.
when men entered the armed services their families often followed them to training bases or points of debarkation.
civilians moved to take high paying defense jobs.
about 15 million americans changed residences during the war years half of them moving to another state.
one of them was peggy terry who grew up in paducah kentucky worked in a shell loading plant in nearby viola and then moved to a defense plant in michigan.

this new mobility coupled with peoples distance from their hometowns loosened the authority of traditional institutions and made wartime cities vibrant and exciting.
around theclock work shifts kept people on the streets night and day and bars jazz clubs dance halls and movie theaters proliferated fed by the ready cash of war workers.
racial conflict migration and more fluid social boundaries meant that people of different races and ethnicities mixed in the booming cities.
over one million african americans left the rural south for california illinois michigan ohio and pennsylvania a continuation of the great migration earlier in the century chapter 21.
as blacks and whites competed for jobs and housing racial conflicts broke out in more than a hundred cities in 1943.

to many adults the zoot suit symbolized juvenile delinquency.
rumors circulating in los angeles in june 1943 that a pachuco gang had beaten an anglo white sailor set off a fourday riot in which hundreds of anglo servicemen roamed through mexican american neighborhoods and attacked zoot suiters taking special pleasure in slashing their pegged pants.

chapter 24 the military tried to screen out homosexuals but had limited success.
once in the services homosexuals found opportunities to participate in a gay culture often more extensive than that in civilian life.
in the last twenty years historians have documented thriving communities of gay and lesbian soldiers in the world war ii military.
some came out under fire as one historian put it but most kept their sexuality hidden from authorities because army officers doctors and psychiatrists treated homosexuality as a psychological disorder that was grounds for dishonorable discharge.
japanese removal unlike world war i which evoked widespread harassment of german americans world war ii produced relatively little condemnation of european americans.
federal officials held about 5 000 potentially dangerous german and italian aliens during the war.
despite the presence of small but vocal groups of nazi sympathizers and mussolini supporters german american and italian american communities were largely left in peace during the war.
the relocation and temporary imprisonment of japanese immigrants and japanese american citizens was a glaring exception to this otherwise tolerant policy.
immediately after the attack on pearl harbor the west coast remained calm.
then as residents began to fear spies sabotage and further attacks californias long history of racial animosity toward asian immigrants surfaced.
local politicians and newspapers whipped up hysteria against japanese americans who numbered only about 112 000 had no political power and lived primarily in small enclaves in the pacific coast states.

force japanese americans from their west coast homes and hold them in relocation camps for the rest of the war.
although there was no disloyal or seditious activity among the evacuees few public leaders opposed the plan.
a japs a jap snapped general john dewitt the officer charged with defense of the west coast.
it makes no difference whether he is an american citizen or not the relocation plan shocked japanese americans more than two thirds of whom were nisei that is their parents were immigrants but they were native born american citizens.
army officials gave families only a few days to dispose of their property.
businesses that had taken a lifetime to build were liquidated overnight.
the war relocation authority moved the prisoners to hastily built camps in desolate areas in california arizona utah colorado wyoming idaho and arkansas map 24 1.
ironically the japanese americans who made up one third of the population of hawaii and presumably posed a greater threat because of their numbers and proximity to japan were not imprisoned.
they provided much of the unskilled labor in the island territory and the hawaiian economy could not have functioned without them.
cracks soon appeared in the relocation policy.
an agricultural labor shortage led the government to furlough seasonal farmworkers from the camps as early as 1942.
about 4 300 students were allowed to attend colleges outside the west coast military zone.
other map 24 1 japanese relocation camps in 1942 the government ordered 112 000 japanese americans living on the west coast into internment camps in the nations interior because of their supposed threat to public safety.
some of the camps were as far away as arkansas.
the federal government rescinded the mass evacuation order in december 1944 but 44 000 people still remained in the camps when the war ended in august 1945.

miyatake secretly began shooting photographs of the camp with a handmade camera.
eventually miyatake received permission from the authorities to document life in the camp its births weddings deaths and high school graduations.
to communicate the injustice of internment he also took staged photographs such as this image of three young boys behind barbed wire with a watchtower in the distance.
for miyatake the image gave new meaning to the phrase prisoners of war toyo miyatake.

the 442nd regimental combat team a unit composed almost entirely of nisei volunteers served with distinction in europe.
gordon hirabayashi was among the nisei who actively resisted incarceration.
a student at the university of washington hirabayashi was a religious pacifist who had registered with his draft board as a conscientious objector.
he refused to report for evacuation and turned himself in to the fbi.
i wanted to uphold the principles of the constitution hirabayashi later stated and the curfew and evacuation orders which singled out a group on the basis of ethnicity violated them tried and convicted in 1942 he appealed his case to the supreme court in hirabayashi v united states 1943.
in that case and in korematsu v united states 1944 the court allowed the removal of japanese americans from the west coast on the basis of military necessity but avoided ruling on the constitutionality of the incarceration program.
the courts decision underscored the fragility of civil liberties in wartime.
congress issued a public apology in 1988 and awarded 20 000 to each of the eighty thousand surviving japanese americans who had once been internees.
fighting and winning the war world war ii was a war for control of the world.
had the axis powers triumphed germany would have dominated either directly or indirectly all of europe and much of africa and the middle east japan would have controlled most of east and southeast asia.
to prevent this outcome which would have crippled democracy in europe and restricted american power to the western hemisphere the roosevelt administration took the united states to war.
the combination of american intervention the perseverance of britain and the profound civilian and military sacrifices of the soviet union decided the outcome of the conflict and shaped the character of the postwar world.
wartime aims and tensions great britain the united states and the soviet union were the key actors in the allied coalition.
china france and other nations played crucial but smaller roles.
the leaders who became known as the big three president franklin roosevelt prime minister winston churchill of great britain and premier joseph stalin of the soviet union set military strategy.
however stalin was not a party to the atlantic charter which churchill and roosevelt had signed in august 1941 and disagreed fundamentally with some of its precepts such as a capitalist run international trading system.
the allies also disagreed about military strategy and timing.
the big three made defeating germany rather than japan the top military priority but they differed over how best to do it.
in 1941 a massive german force had invaded the soviet union and reached the outskirts of leningrad moscow and stalingrad before being halted in early 1942 by chapter 24 hard pressed russian troops.
to relieve pressure on the soviet army stalin wanted the british and americans to open a second front with a major invasion of germany through france.
roosevelt informally assured stalin that the allies would comply in 1942 but churchill opposed an early invasion and american war production was not yet sufficient to support it.
for eighteen months stalins pleas went unanswered and the soviet union bore the brunt of the fighting in the 1943 battle of kursk alone the soviet army suffered 860 000 casualties several times what the allies would suffer for the first two months of the european campaign after d day.
then at a conference of the big three in tehran iran in november 1943 churchill and roosevelt agreed to open a second front in france within six months in return for stalins promise to join the fight against japan.
both sides adhered to this agreement but the long delay angered stalin who became increasingly suspicious of american and british intentions.
the world at war 1937 1945 the war in europe throughout 1942 the allies suffered one defeat after another.
german armies pushed deep into soviet territory advancing through the wheat farms of the ukraine and the rich oil region of the caucasus.

favor of the allies.
in the epic battle of stalingrad soviet forces not only halted the german advance but also allowed the russian army to push westward map 24 2.
by early 1944 stalins troops had driven the german army out of the soviet union.
meanwhile as churchills temporary substitute hitting the beach at normandy these u s soldiers were among the 156 000 allied troops who stormed the beaches of normandy on d day june 6 1944 on that day alone more than 10 000 were killed or wounded.
within a month 1 million allied troops had come ashore.
most americans learned of the invasion at 3 30 a m eastern time when edward r murrow the well known radio journalist whose reports from war torn london had gripped the nation in 1940 read general eisenhowers statement to the troops.

the tide of battle turned in late 1942 when the german advance stalled at leningrad and stalingrad.
by early 1943 the soviet army had launched a massive counterattack at stalingrad and allied forces had driven the germans from north africa and launched an invasion of sicily and the italian mainland.
for a second front in france the allies launched a major counteroffensive in north africa.
between november 1942 and may 1943 allied troops under the leadership of general dwight d eisenhower and general george s patton defeated the german afrika korps led by general erwin rommel.
from africa the allied command followed churchills strategy of attacking the axis through its soft underbelly sicily and the italian peninsula.

by the end of 1944 british and american forces were ready to invade germany from the west and the russians were poised to do the same from the east.
germany surrendered on may 7 1945 than 1 5 million soldiers and thousands of tons of military supplies and equipment flowed into france.
much to the allies advantage they never faced more than one third of hitlers wehrmacht armed forces because the soviet union continued to hold down the germans on the eastern front.
in august allied troops liberated paris by september they had driven the germans out of most of france and belgium.
meanwhile long range allied bombers attacked german cities such as hamburg and dresden as well as military and industrial targets.
the air campaign killed some 305 000 civilians and soldiers and injured another 780 000 a grisly reminder of the wars human brutality.
the germans were not yet ready to give up however.
in december 1944 they mounted a final offensive in belgium the so called battle of the bulge before being pushed back across the rhine river into germany.
american and british troops drove toward berlin from the west while soviet troops advanced east through poland.
on april 30 1945 as russian troops massed outside berlin hitler committed suicide on may 7 germany formally surrendered.
the holocaust when allied troops advanced into poland and germany in the spring of 1945 they came face to face with hitlers final solution for the jewish population of germany and the german occupied part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 countries the extermination camps in which 6 million jews had been put to death along with another 6 million poles slavs gypsies homosexuals and other undesirables photographs of the nazi death camps at buchenwald dachau and auschwitz showed bodies stacked like cordwood and survivors so emaciated that they were barely alive.
published in life and other masscirculation magazines the photographs of the holocaust horrified the american public and the world.
the nazi persecution of german jews in the 1930s was widely known in the united states.
but when jews had begun to flee europe the united states refused to relax its strict immigration laws to take them in.
in 1939 when the ss st louis a german ocean liner carrying nearly a thousand jewish refugees sought permission from president roosevelt to dock at an american port fdr had refused.
its passengers futures uncertain the st louis was forced to return to europe where many would later be deported to auschwitz and other extermination camps.
american officials along with those of most other nations continued this exclusionist policy during world war ii as the nazi regime extended its control over millions of eastern european jews.
various factors inhibited american action but the most important was widespread anti semitism in the state department christian churches and the public at large.
the legacy of the immigration restriction legislation of the 1920s and the isolationist attitudes of the 1930s also discouraged policymakers from assuming responsibility for the fate of the refugees.
taking a narrow view of the national interest the state department allowed only 21 000 jewish refugees to enter the united states during the war.
but the war refugee board which president roosevelt established in 1944 at the behest of secretary of the treasury henry morgenthau helped move 200 000 european jews to safe havens in other countries.
the war in the pacific winning the war against japan was every bit as arduous as waging the campaign against germany.
after crippling the american battle fleet at pearl harbor the japanese quickly expanded into the south pacific with seaborne invasions of hong kong wake island and guam.
japanese forces then advanced into southeast asia conquering the solomon islands burma and malaya and threatening australia and india.
by may 1942 they had forced the surrender of u s forces in the philippine islands and in the bataan death march caused the deaths of 10 000 american prisoners of war.
at that dire moment american naval forces scored two crucial victories.
these were possible because the attack on pearl harbor had destroyed several american battleships but left all aircraft carriers unscathed.
in the battle of the coral sea off southern new guinea in may 1942 they halted the japanese offensive against australia.
then in june at the battle of midway island the american navy severely damaged the japanese fleet.
in both battles planes launched from american aircraft carriers provided the margin of victory.
the u s military command led by general douglas macarthur and admiral chester w nimitz now took the offensive in the pacific map 24 4.
for the next eighteen months american forces advanced slowly toward japan taking one island after another in the face of determined japanese resistance.
in october 1944 macarthur and nimitz began the reconquest of the philippines by winning the battle of leyte gulf a massive naval encounter in which the japanese lost practically their entire fleet map 24 5.
by early 1945 victory over japan was in sight.
japanese military forces had suffered devastating losses and american bombing of the japanese homeland had killed 330 000 civilians and crippled the nations economy.
the bloodletting on both sides was horrendous.
on the small islands of iwo jima and okinawa tens of thousands of japanese soldiers fought to the death killing 13 000 u s marines and wounding 46 000 more.
desperate to halt the american advance and short on ammunition japanese pilots flew suicidal kamikaze missions crashing their bomb laden planes into american ships.
among the grim realities of war in the pacific was the conflicts racial overtones.
the attack on pearl harbor reawakened the long tradition of anti asian sentiment in the united states.
in the eyes of many americans the japanese were yellow monkeys an inferior race whose humanity deserved minimal respect.
racism was evident among the japanese as well.
their brutal attacks on china including the rape of nanjing their forcing of korean comfort women to have sex with japanese soldiers and their treatment of american prisoners in the philippines flowed from their own sense of racial superiority.
anti japanese attitudes in the united states would subside in the 1950s as the island nation became a trusted ally.
but racism would again play a major role in the u s war in vietnam in the 1960s.

scholarly and popular debate.
the principal reason was straightforward truman and his american advisors including secretary of war henry stimson and army chief of staff general george marshall believed that japans military leaders would never surrender unless their country faced national ruin.
moreover at the potsdam conference on the outskirts of berlin in july 1945 the allies had agreed that only the unconditional surrender of japan was acceptable the same terms under which germany and italy had been defeated.
to win such a surrender an invasion of japan itself seemed necessary.
stimson and marshall told truman that such an invasion would produce between half a million and a million allied casualties.
chapter 24 the world at war 1937 1945 the big three at yalta with victory in europe at hand roosevelt journeyed in february 1945 to yalta on the black sea and met for what would be the final time with churchill and stalin.
the leaders discussed the important and controversial issues of the treatment of germany the status of poland the creation of the united nations and russian entry into the war against japan.
the yalta agreements mirrored a new balance of power and set the stage for the cold war.
franklin d roosevelt library.
before giving the order to drop the atomic bomb truman considered other options.
his military advisors rejected the most obvious alternative a nonlethal demonstration of the bombs awesome power perhaps on a remote pacific island.
if the demonstration failed not out of the question as the bomb had been tested only once it would embolden japan further.
a detailed advance warning designed to scare japan into surrender was also rejected.
given japans tenacious fighting in the pacific the americans believed that only massive devastation or a successful invasion would lead japans military leadership to surrender.
after all the deaths of more than 100 000 japanese civilians in the u s firebombing of tokyo and other cities in the spring of 1945 had brought japan no closer to surrender.
in any event the atomic bombs achieved the immediate goal.
the deaths of 100 000 people at hiroshima and 60 000 at nagasaki prompted the japanese government to surrender unconditionally on august 10 and to sign a formal agreement on september 2 1945.
fascism had been defeated thanks to a fragile alliance between the capitalist nations of the west and the communist government of the soviet union.
the coming of peace would strain and then destroy the victorious coalition.
even as the global war came to an end the early signs of the coming cold war were apparent as were the stirrings of independence in the european colonies.
the toll of the war after the battle of iwo jima one of the fiercest and bloodiest of the pacific war a rabbi chaplain in the marine corps delivered the eulogy for the fallen.
this shall not be in vain he said surveying a battlefield that part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 hiroshima march 1946 though the atomic bomb had been dropped on the port city of hiroshima six months previous to this photo being taken the devastation is still apparent.
the u s army report on the bombing described the immediate effects of the blast at 8 15 a m the bomb exploded with a blinding flash in the sky and a great rush of air and a loud rumble of noise extended for many miles around the city the first blast was soon followed by the sounds of falling buildings and of growing fires and a great cloud of dust and smoke began to cast a pall of darkness over the city the only buildings not leveled were those with concrete reinforcement meant to withstand earthquakes.
the human toll of this weapon was unprecedented of the estimated population of 350 000 100 000 were likely killed by the explosion and many tens of thousands more died slowly of the effects of radiation poisoning.
u s air force.
witnessed the deaths of nearly 30 000 american and japanese soldiers.
speaking of american losses he said from the suffering and sorrow of those who mourn this will come we promise the birth of a new freedom for the sons of man everywhere the toll of suffering and sorrow from world war ii was enormous.
worldwide more than 50 million soldiers and civilians were killed nearly 2 5 percent of the globes population.
the holocaust took the lives of 6 million european jews 2 6 million from poland alone.
nearly 100 million additional soldiers and civilians were wounded and 30 million people across the globe were rendered homeless.
it was one of the most wrenching disruptive and terrible wars in human history.
alongside the human toll stood profound economic and political transformations.
hundreds of cities in europe and asia had been bombed.
some of them like dresden warsaw hamburg and hiroshima had been simply obliterated.
much of the industrial infrastructure of germany and japan two of the worlds most important industrial economies before the war lay in ruins.
moreover despite emerging as one of the victors britain was no longer a global power.
the independence movement in india was only the most obvious sign of its waning influence.
indeed throughout the colonized world in asia and africa people had taken the atlantic charter and fdrs insistence that this was a war for democracy seriously.
for them resumption of european imperialism was unacceptable and the war represented a step toward national self determination.
in the united states too the toll of war was great.
more than 400 000 lives were lost and nearly 300 000 american soldiers were wounded.
yet millions returned home and in the coming decades veterans would play a central role in national life.
incredibly in 1950 world war ii veterans made up one third of all american men over the age of nineteen.
only the civil war involved a comparable commitment of military service from a generation.
americans paid dearly for that commitment though not it must be noted as dearly as other peoples in europe and asia and the legacies of the war shaped families politics and foreign policy for the remainder of the century.
chapter 24 summary the rise of fascism in germany italy and japan led to the outbreak of world war ii.
initially the american public opposed u s intervention.
but by 1940 president roosevelt was mobilizing support for the military and preparing the country for war.
the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 brought the nation fully into the conflict.
war mobilization dramatically expanded the federal government and led to substantial economic growth.
it also boosted geographical and social mobility as women rural whites and southern blacks found employment in new defense plants across the country.
government rules assisted both the labor movement and the african american campaign for civil rights.
however religious and racial animosity caused the exclusion of jewish refugees and the internment of 112 000 japanese americans.
by 1942 germany and japan seemed to be winning the war.
but in 1943 the allies took the offensive with chapter review advances by the soviet army in europe and the american navy in the pacific and by the end of 1944 allied victory was all but certain.
germany finally surrendered in may 1945 and japan surrendered in august after the atomic bombing of the japanese cities hiroshima and nagasaki.
the united states emerged from the war with an undamaged homeland sole possession of the atomic bomb and a set of unresolved diplomatic disputes with the soviet union that would soon lead to the four decade long cold war.
federal laws and practices established during the war the universal income tax a huge military establishment and multibillion dollar budgets to name but a few became part of american life.
so too did the active participation of the united states in international politics and alliances an engagement intensified by the unresolved issues of the wartime alliance with the soviet union and the postwar fate of colonized nations.

p a r t c h a p t e r 25 cold war america 1945 1963 c h a p t e r 26 triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 c h a p t e r 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 c h a p t e r 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 c h a p t e r 29 the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 between 1945 and 1980 the united states became the worlds leading economic and military power.
that development defines these decades as a distinct period of american history.
internationally a prolonged period of tension and conflict known as the cold war drew the united states into an engagement in world affairs unprecedented in the nations history.
domestically three decades of sustained economic growth whose benefits were widely though imperfectly distributed expanded the middle class and brought into being a mass consumer society.
these international and domestic developments were intertwined with the predominance of liberalism in american politics and public policy.
one might think of an age of liberalism in this era encompassing the social welfare liberalism that was a legacy of the new deal and the rights liberalism of the 1960s both of which fell under the larger umbrella of cold war liberalism.
global leadership abroad and economic prosperity at home were conditioned on further expansions in government power.
how that power was used proved controversial.
immediately following world war ii a national security state emerged to investigate so called subversives in the united states and through the clandestine central intelligence agency cia to destabilize foreign governments abroad.
meanwhile american troops went to war in korea and vietnam.
at home african americans women the poor and other social groups called for greater equality in american life and sought new laws and government initiatives to make that equality a reality.
here in brief are the three key dimensions of this convulsive turbulent era.
global leadership and the cold war the age of liberalism when the united states officially joined the combatants of world war ii it entered into an alliance with england and the soviet union.
that alliance proved impossible to sustain after 1945 as the united states and the soviet union became competitors to shape postwar europe east asia and the developing world.
the resulting cold war lasted four decades during which the united states extended its political and military reach onto every continent.
under the presidency of harry s truman american officials developed the policy of containment a combination of economic diplomatic and military actions to limit the expansion of communism that subsequent presidents embraced and expanded.
diplomatic and military intervention abroad was a hallmark of the cold war.
most american interventions took place in developing countries in recently independent decolonized nations and in countries where nationalist movements pressed for independence.
in the name of preventing the spread of communism the united states intervened directly or indirectly in china iran guatemala cuba indonesia and the dominican republic among many other nations and fought major wars in korea and vietnam.
this new global role for the united states inspired support but also spurred detractors.
the latter eventually included the antiwar movement during the war in vietnam.
chapter 25 focuses on the cold war and vietnam is addressed in chapter 28.
in response to the great depression president franklin roosevelts new deal expanded federal responsibility for the social welfare of ordinary citizens sweeping away much of the laissez faire individualism of earlier eras see chapter 23.
legislators from both parties embraced liberal ideas about the role of government and undertook such measures as the gi bill subsidies for suburban home ownership and investment in infrastructure and education.
poverty however affected nearly one third of americans in the 1960s and racial discrimination denied millions of nonwhites full citizenship.
lack of opportunity became a driving force in the civil rights movement and in the great society under president lyndon johnson.
inspired by african american civil rights other social movements sought equality based on gender sexuality ethnicity and other identities.
if new deal liberalism had focused on social welfare this rights liberalism focused on protecting people from discrimination and ensuring equal citizenship.
these struggles resulted in new laws such as the civil rights act of 1964 and transformative supreme court decisions.
conservative opponents however mobilized in the 1960s against what they saw as the excesses of liberal activism.
the resulting conflict began to reshape politics in the 1970s and laid the groundwork for a new conservative resurgence.
these developments are discussed in chapters 27 and 28.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 mass consumption and the middle class thematic understanding more than ever the postwar american economy was driven by mass consumption and the accompanying process of suburbanization.
rising wages increasing access to higher education and the availability of suburban home ownership raised living standards and allowed more americans than ever to afford consumer goods.
suburbanization transformed the nations cities and the sunbelt led the nation in population growth.
but the new prosperity had mixed results.
cities declined and new racial and ethnic ghettos formed.
suburbanization and mass consumption raised concerns that the nations rivers streams air and open land were being damaged and an environmental movement arose in response.
and prosperity itself proved short lived.
by the 1970s deindustrialization had eroded much of the nations once prosperous industrial base.
a defining characteristic of the postwar decades was the growth of the american middle class.
that growth was predicated on numerous demographic changes.
home ownership increased as did college enrollments.
women worked more outside the home and spurred a new feminism.
children enjoyed more purchasing power and a teen culture arose on television in popular music and in film.
the family became politicized too and by the late 1970s liberals and conservatives were divided over how best to address the nations family life.
all these developments are discussed in chapters 25 and 29.
this timeline arranges some of the important events of this period into themes.
consider the entries under america in the world and politics and power across all four decades.
what connections were there between international developments and domestic politics in this era of the cold war.

but tarring her with communism made her seem un american and nixon defeated the pink lady with nearly 60 percent of the vote.
a few months earlier u s tanks planes and artillery supplies had arrived in french indochina.
a french colony since the nineteenth century indochina present day vietnam laos and cambodia was home to an independence movement led by ho chi minh and supported by the soviet union and china.
in the summer of 1950 president harry s truman authorized 15 million worth of military supplies to aid france which was fighting hos army to keep possession of its indochinese empire.
neither national independence nor democratic evolution exists in any area dominated by soviet imperialism secretary of state dean acheson warned ominously as he announced u s support for french imperialism.
connecting these coincidental historical moments one domestic and the other international was a decades old force in american life that gained renewed strength after world war ii anticommunism.
the events in los angeles and vietnam however different on the surface were part of the global geopolitical struggle between the democratic united states and the communist authoritarian soviet union known as the cold war.
beginning in europe as world war ii ended and extending to asia latin america the middle east and africa by the mid 1950s the cold war reshaped international relations and dominated global politics for more than forty years.
in the united states the cold war fostered suspicion of subversives in government education and the media.
the arms race that developed between the two superpowers prompted congress to boost military expenditures.
the resulting militaryindustrial complex enhanced the power of the corporations that built planes munitions and electronic devices.
in politics the cold war stifled liberal initiatives as the new deal coalition tried to advance its domestic agenda in the shadow of anticommunism.
in these ways the line between the international and the domestic blurred and that blurred line was another enduring legacy of the cold war.
the perils of the cold war americans like much of the world lived under the threat of nuclear warfare during the tense years of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 containment and a divided global order the cold war began on the heels of world war ii and ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the soviet union.
while it lasted this conflict raised two critical questions at the center of global history what conditions and whose interests would determine the balance of power in europe and asia.
and how would the developing nations the european colonies in asia the middle east and africa gain their independence and take their places on the world stage.
cold war rivalry framed the possible answers to both questions as it drew the united states into a prolonged engagement with world affairs unprecedented in the nations history that continues to the present day.
origins of the cold war world war ii set the basic conditions for the cold war.
with germany and japan defeated and britain and france weakened by years of war only two geopolitical powers remained standing in 1945.
even had nothing divided them the united states and the soviet union would have jostled each other as they moved to fill the postwar power vacuum.
but of course the two countries were divided by geography history ideology and strategic interest.
little united them other than their commitment to defeating the axis powers.
president franklin roosevelt understood that maintaining the u s soviet alliance was essential for postwar global stability.
but he also believed that permanent peace and long term u s interests depended on the wilsonian principles of collective security self determination and free trade chapter 21.
yalta at the yalta conference of february 1945 wilsonian principles yielded to u s soviet power realities.
as allied forces neared victory in europe and advanced toward japan in the pacific roosevelt churchill and stalin met in yalta a resort in southern ukraine on the black sea.
roosevelt focused on maintaining allied unity and securing stalins commitment to enter the war against japan.
but the fates of the nations of eastern europe divided the big three.
stalin insisted that russian national security required prosoviet governments in eastern europe.
roosevelt pressed for an agreement the declaration on liberated europe that guaranteed self determination and democratic elections in poland and neighboring countries such as romania and hungary.
however given the east meets west with an east meets west placard providing inspiration private frank b huff of virginia on the left and a russian soldier shake hands.
huff was one of the first four americans to contact the russians when the two armies met at the river elbe seen in the background of this photo in eastern germany on april 25 1945.
the good will in evidence in the spring of 1945 as americans and russians alike celebrated the defeat of nazi germany would within two short years be replaced by cold war suspicion and hostility.
bettmann corbis.
chapter 25 presence of soviet troops in those nations fdr had to accept a pledge from stalin to hold free and unfettered elections at a future time.
the three leaders also formalized their commitment to divide germany into four administrative zones each controlled by one of the four allied powers and to similarly partition the capital city berlin which was located in the middle of the soviet zone.
at yalta the big three also agreed to establish an international body to replace the discredited league of nations.
based on plans drawn up at the 1944 dumbarton oaks conference in washington d c the new organization to be known as the united nations would have both a general assembly in which all nations would be represented and a security council composed of the five major allied powers the united states britain france china and the soviet union and seven other nations elected on a rotating basis.
the big three determined that the five permanent members of the security council should have veto power over decisions of the general assembly.
they announced that the united nations would convene for the first time in san francisco on april 25 1945.
potsdam following the yalta conference developments over the ensuing year further hardened relations between the soviets on one side and the americans and british on the other.
at the potsdam conference outside berlin in july 1945 harry truman replaced the deceased roosevelt.
inexperienced in world affairs and thrown into enormously complicated negotiations trumans instinct was to stand up to stalin.
unless russia is faced with an iron fist and strong language he said another war is in the making but truman was in no position to realign events in eastern europe where soviet imposed governments in poland hungary and romania were backed by the red army and could not be eliminated by trumans bluster.
in poland and romania in particular stalin was determined to establish communist governments punish wartime nazi collaborators and win boundary concessions that augmented soviet territory the soviet leader sought eastern polish lands for the soviet union and sought to make far northeastern germany part of poland.
yalta and potsdam thus set the stage for communist rule to descend over eastern europe.
the elections called for at yalta eventually took place in finland hungary bulgaria and czechoslovakia with varying degrees of democratic openness.
nevertheless stalin got the client regimes he desired in those countries and would soon exert near complete control over their governments.
stalins unwillingness to honor cold war america 1945 1963 self determination for nations in eastern europe was from the american point of view the precipitating event of the cold war.
germany represented the biggest challenge of all.
american officials at potsdam believed that a revived german economy was essential to ensuring the prosperity of democratic regimes throughout western europe and to keeping ordinary germans from turning again to nazism.
in contrast stalin hoped merely to extract reparations from germany in the form of industrial machines and goods.
in exchange for recognizing the new german polish border truman and secretary of state james byrnes convinced the soviet leader to accept german reparations only from the soviet zone which lay in the far eastern and largely rural portion of germany and promised little wealth or german industry to plunder.
as they had done for europe as a whole the yalta and potsdam agreements paved the way for the division of germany into east and west map 25 1.
yalta and potsdam had demonstrated that in private negotiations the united states and the soviet union had starkly different objectives.
subsequent public utterances only intensified those differences.
in february 1946 stalin delivered a speech in which he insisted understand that according to marxist points of view leninist principles the uneven how did american and ness of development of the soviet viewpoints differ capitalist countries was likely over the postwar fate of to produce violent disturbance europe.
and even another war.
he seemed to blame any future war on the capitalist west.
churchill responded in kind a month later.
while visiting truman in missouri to be honored for his wartime leadership churchill accused stalin of raising an iron curtain around eastern europe and allowing police government to rule its people.
he went further claiming that a fraternal association of english speaking peoples and not russians ought to set the terms of the postwar world.
the cities and fields of europe had barely ceased to run with the blood of world war ii before they were menaced again by the tense standoff between the soviet union and the united states.
with stalin intent on establishing client states in eastern europe and the united states equally intent on reviving germany and ensuring collective security throughout europe the points of agreement were few and far between.
among the allies anxiety about a nazi victory in world war ii had been quickly replaced by fear of a potentially more cataclysmic war with the soviet union.

map 25 1 cold war in europe 1955 this map vividly shows the cold war division of europe.
the nato countries colored green are allies of the united states the warsaw pact countries in purple are allied to the ussr.
at that point west germany had just been admitted to nato completing europes stabilization into two rival camps.
but berlin remained divided and one can see from its location deep in east germany why the former capital was always a flash point in cold war controversies.
the containment strategy in the late 1940s american officials developed a clear strategy toward the soviet union that would become known as containment.
convinced that the ussr was methodically expanding its reach the united states would counter by limiting stalins influence to eastern europe while reconstituting democratic governments in western europe.
in 1946 1947 three specific issues worried truman and his advisors.
first the soviet union was pressing iran for access to oil and turkey for access to the mediterranean.
second a civil war was roiling in greece between monarchists backed by england and insurgents supported by the greek and yugoslavian communist parties.
third as european nations suffered through terrible privation in 1946 and 1947 communist parties gained strength particularly in france and italy.
all three developments as seen from the united states threatened to expand the influence of the soviet union outside of eastern europe.
toward an uneasy peace in this anxious context the strategy of containment emerged in a series of incremental steps between 1946 and 1949.
in february 1946 american diplomat george f kennan first proposed the idea in an 8 000 word cable a confidential message to the u s state department from his post at the u s embassy in moscow.
kennan argued that the chapter 25 soviet union was an oriental despotism and that communism was merely the fig leaf justifying soviet aggression.
a year after writing this cable dubbed the long telegram he published an influential foreign affairs article arguing that the wests only recourse was to meet the soviets with unalterable counter force at every point where they show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable world kennan called for long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies containment the key word came to define americas evolving strategic stance toward the soviet union.
to see a longer excerpt of the long telegram along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
kennan believed that the soviet system was inherently unstable and would eventually collapse.
containment would work he reasoned as long as the united states and its allies opposed soviet expansion in all parts of the world.
kennans attentive readers included stalin himself who quickly obtained a copy of the classified long telegram.
the soviet leader saw the united states as an imperialist aggressor determined to replace great britain as the worlds dominant capitalist power.
just as kennan thought that the soviet system was despotic and unsustainable stalin believed that the west suffered from its own fatal weaknesses.
neither side completely understood or trusted the other and each projected its worst fears onto the other.
in fact britains influence in the world was declining.
exhausted by the war facing enormous budget deficits and a collapsing economy at home and confronted with a determined independence movement in india led by mohandas gandhi and growing nationalist movements throughout its empire britain was waning as a global power.
the reins of world leadership are fast slipping from britains competent but now very weak hands read a u s state department report.
these reins will be picked up either by the united states or by russia the united states was wedded to the notion dating to the wilson administration that communism and capitalism were incompatible on the world stage.
with britain faltering american officials saw little choice but to fill its shoes.
it did not take long for the reality of britains decline to resonate across the atlantic.
in february 1947 london informed truman that it could no longer afford to support the anticommunists in the greek civil war.
truman worried that a communist victory in greece would lead to soviet domination of the eastern cold war america 1945 1963 mediterranean and embolden communist parties in france and italy.
in response the president announced what became known as the truman doctrine.
in a speech on march 12 he asserted an american responsibility to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures to that end truman proposed largescale assistance for greece and turkey then involved in a dispute with the soviet union over the dardanelles a strait connecting the aegean sea and the sea of marmara.
if we falter in our leadership we may endanger the peace of the world truman declared thinking like a historian p 810.
despite the open endedness of this military commitment congress quickly approved trumans request for 300 million in aid to greece and 100 million for turkey.
soviet expansionism was part of a larger story.
europe was sliding into economic chaos.
already devastated by the war in 1947 the continent suffered the worst winter in memory.
people were starving credit was nonexistent wages were stagnant and the consumer market had collapsed.
for both humanitarian and practical reasons trumans advisors believed something had to be done.
a global depression might ensue if the european economy the largest foreign market for american goods did not recover.
worse unemployed and dispirited western europeans might fill the ranks of the communist party threatening political stability and the legitimacy of the united states.
secretary of state george c marshall came up with a remarkable proposal a massive infusion of american capital to rebuild the european economy.
speaking at the harvard university commencement in june 1947 marshall urged the nations of europe to work out a comprehensive recovery program based on u s aid.
this pledge of financial assistance required congressional approval but the plan ran into opposition in washington.
republicans castigated the marshall plan as a huge international wpa but in the midst of the congressional stalemate on february 25 1948 stalin supported a communist led coup in czechoslovakia.
congress rallied and voted overwhelmingly in 1948 to approve the marshall plan.
over the next four years the united states contributed nearly 13 billion to a highly successful recovery effort that benefitted both western place events europe and the united states.
in context european industrial production why did the united states enact the marshall plan increased by 64 percent and the and how did the program appeal of communist parties illustrate americas new waned in the west.
markets for role in the world.
american goods grew stronger thinking like a historian the global cold war until 1950 the u s policy of containment was confined to economic measures such as financial assistance to greece and turkey and the marshall plan and focused on europe.
that changed between 1950 and 1954.
in those years containment became militarized and its scope was expanded to include asia and latin america.
what had begun as a limited policy to contain soviet influence in war torn europe had by the mid 1950s become a global campaign against communism and social revolution.
president harry s truman address before joint session of congress march 12 1947.
known as the truman doctrine this speech outlined trumans plan to give large scale assistance to greece and turkey as part of a broader anticommunist policy.
to ensure the peaceful development of nations free from coercion the united states has taken a leading part in establishing the united nations.
the united nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members.
we shall not realize our objectives however unless we are willing to help free peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them totalitarian regimes.
at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life.
the choice is too often not a free one.
one way of life is based upon the will of the majority and is distinguished by free institutions representative government free elections guarantees of individual liberty freedom of speech and religion and freedom from political oppression.
the second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority.
it relies upon terror and oppression a controlled press and radio fixed elections and the suppression of personal freedoms.
i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.
i believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.
i believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.
syngman rhee president of south korea criticizing u s policy in 1950.
the korean war 1950 1953 represented the militarization of the truman doctrine.
a few days ago one american friend said that if the u s gave weapons to south korea she feared that south korea would invade north korea.
this is a useless worry of some americans who do not know south korea.
our present war is not a cold war but a real shooting war.
our troops will take all possible counter measures.
in south korea the u s has one foot in south korea and one foot outside so that in case of an unfavorable situation it could pull out of the country.
i daresay that if the u s wants to aid our country it should not be only lipservice.
secretary of state dean achesons testimony before the senate armed forces and foreign relations committee 1951.
the attack on korea was.
a challenge to the whole system of collective security not only in the far east but everywhere in the world.
it was a threat to all nations newly arrived at independence.
this was a test which would decide whether our collective security system would survive or would crumble.
it would determine whether other nations would be intimidated by this show of force.
as a people we condemn aggression of any kind.
we reject appeasement of any kind.
if we stood with our arms folded while korea was swallowed up it would have meant abandoning our principles and it would have meant the defeat of the collective security system on which our own safety ultimately depends.
shigeru yoshida prime minister of japan speech before the japanese diet parliament july 14 1950.
it is heartening.
that america and so many members of the united nations have gone to the rescue of an invaded country regardless of the heavy sacrifices involved.
in case a war breaks out on an extensive scale how would japans security be preserved since we are disarmed.
this has been hotly discussed.
however the measures taken by the united nations have done much to stabilize our peoples minds.

tonight i should like to speak with you about guatemala.
it is the scene of dramatic events.
they expose the evil purpose of the kremlin to destroy the inter american system and they test the ability of the american states to maintain the peaceful integrity of the hemisphere.
for several years international communism has been probing here and there for nesting places in the americas.
it finally chose guatemala as a spot which it could turn into an official base from which to breed subversion which would extend to other american republics.
this intrusion of soviet despotism was of course a direct challenge to our monroe doctrine the first and most fundamental of our foreign policies.

the answers are simple and evident.
the plan of national liberation being carried out with firmness by my government has necessarily affected the privileges of the foreign enterprises that are impeding the progress and the economic development of the country.
with construction of publically owned ports and docks we are putting an end to the monopoly of the united fruit company.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the marshall plan officials from the united states and britain watch as the first shipment of caribbean sugar provided under the marshall plan arrives in england lowered from the decks of the royal victoria.
passed by congress in 1948 the marshall plan known officially as the european recovery program committed the united states to spend 17 billion over a four year period to assist the war ravaged nations of western europe.
marshall plan funds helped the struggling british french and especially german economies but they also benefitted the united states itself the plan required european nations who participated to purchase most of their goods from american companies.
keystone getty images.
and fostered economic interdependence between europe and the united states.
notably however the marshall plan intensified cold war tensions.
u s officials invited the soviets to participate but insisted on certain restrictions that would virtually guarantee stalins refusal.
when stalin refused ordering soviet client states to do so as well the onus of dividing europe appeared to fall on the soviet leader and deprived his threadbare partners of assistance they sorely needed.
east and west in the new europe the flash point for a hot war remained germany the most important industrial economy and the key strategic landmass in europe.
when no agreement could be reached to unify the four zones of occupation into a single state the western allies consolidated their three zones in 1947.
they then prepared to establish an independent federal german republic.
marshall plan funds would jumpstart economic recovery.
some of those funds were slated for west berlin in hopes of making the city a capitalist showplace 100 miles deep inside the soviet zone.
stung by the wests intention to create a german republic in june 1948 stalin blockaded all traffic to west berlin.
instead of yielding as stalin had expected truman and the british were resolute.
we are going to stay period truman said plainly.
over the next year american and british pilots who had been dropping bombs on berlin only four years earlier improvised the berlin airlift which flew 2 5 million tons of food and fuel into the western zones of the city nearly a ton for each resident.
military officials reported to truman that general lucius d clay the american commander in berlin was nervous and on edge drawn as tight as a steel spring but after a prolonged stalemate stalin backed down on may 12 1949 he lifted the blockade.
until the cuban missile crisis in 1962 the berlin crisis was the closest the two sides came to actual war and west berlin became a symbol of resistance to communism.
the crisis in berlin persuaded western european nations to forge a collective security pact with the united states.
in april 1949 for the first time since the end of the american revolution the united states entered into a peacetime military alliance the north atlantic treaty organization nato.
under the nato pact twelve nations belgium canada denmark france great britain iceland italy luxembourg the netherlands norway portugal and the united states agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all in may 1949 those nations also agreed to the creation of the federal republic of germany west germany which eventually joined nato in 1955.
in response the soviet union established the german democratic republic east germany the council for mutual economic assistance comecon and in 1955 the warsaw pact a military alliance for eastern europe that included albania bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland romania and the soviet union.
in these parallel steps the two superpowers had institutionalized the cold war through a massive division of the continent.
by the early 1950s west and east were the stark markers of the new europe.
as churchill had observed chapter 25 cold war america 1945 1963 the berlin airlift for 321 days u s planes like this one flew missions to bring food and other supplies to berlin after the soviet union had blocked all surface routes into the former german capital.
the blockade was finally lifted on may 12 1949 after the soviets conceded that it had been a failure.
in 1946 the line dividing the two stretched from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic cutting off tens of millions of eastern europeans from the rest of the continent.
stalins tactics had often been ruthless but they were not without reason.
the soviet union acted out of the sort of self interest that had long defined powerful nations ensuring a defensive perimeter of allies seeking access to raw materials and pressing the advantage that victory in war allowed.
nsc 68 atomic developments too played a critical role in the emergence of the cold war.
as the sole nuclear power at the end of world war ii the united states entertained the possibility of international control of nuclear technology but did not wish to lose its advantage over the soviet union.
when the american bernard baruch proposed united nations oversight of atomic energy in 1946 for instance the plan assured the united states of near total control of the technology which further increased cold war tensions.
americas brief tenure as sole nuclear power ended in september 1949 however when the soviet union detonated an atomic bomb.
truman then turned to the u s national security council nsc established by the national security act of 1947 for a strategic reassessment.
in april 1950 the nsc delivered its report known as nsc 68.
bristling with alarmist rhetoric the document marked a decisive turning point in the u s approach to the cold war.
the reports authors described the soviet union not as a typical great power but as one with a fanatic faith that seeks to impose its absolute authority going beyond even the stern language used by george kennan nsc 68 cast soviet ambitions as nothing short of the domination of the eurasian landmass to prevent that outcome the report proposed a bold and massive program of rebuilding the wests defensive potential to surpass that of the soviet world america compared p 814.
this included the development of a hydrogen bomb a thermonuclear device that would be a thousand times more destructive than the atomic bombs dropped on japan as well as dramatic increases in conventional military forces.
critically nsc 68 called for americans to pay higher taxes to support the new military program and to accept whatever sacrifices were necessary to achieve national unity of purpose against the soviet enemy.
many historians see the report as having militarized the american approach to the cold war which had to that point relied largely on economic measures such as aid to greece and the marshall plan.
truman was reluctant to commit to a major defense buildup fearing that it would overburden the national budget.
but shortly after nsc 68 was completed events in asia led him to reverse course.
containment in asia as with germany american officials believed that restoring japans economy while limiting its military influence would ensure prosperity and contain communism in east asia.
after dismantling japans military american occupation forces under general douglas macarthur drafted a democratic constitution and america c o m pa r e d arming for the cold war to fight the cold war the united states and the soviet union increased overall military spending and assembled massive arsenals of nuclear weapons.

questions for analysis 1.
do you see evidence of the effects of nsc 68 in this table.
what kinds of changes did nsc 68 bring about.
in what ways does the data in this table suggest the emergence of two superpowers after world war ii.
paved the way for the restoration of japanese sovereignty in 1951.
considering the scorched earth war that had just ended this was a remarkable achievement thanks partly to the imperious macarthur but mainly to the japanese who embraced peace and accepted u s military protection.
however events on the mainland of asia proved much more difficult for the united states to shape to its advantage.
civil war in china a civil war had been raging in china since the 1930s as communist forces led by mao zedong mao tse tung fought nationalist forces under jiang jieshi chiang kai shek.
fearing a communist victory between 1945 and 1949 the united states provided 2 billion to jiangs army.
pressing truman to save china consercompare and vative republican ohio senator contrast robert a taft predicted that the how did u s containment far east is ultimately even more strategy in asia compare important to our future peace to containment in europe.
than is europe by 1949 maos forces held the advantage.
truman reasoned that to save jiang the united states would have to intervene militarily.
unwilling to do so he cut off aid and left the nationalists to their fate.
the peoples republic of china was formally established under mao on october 1 1949 and the remnants of jiangs forces fled to taiwan.
both stalin and truman expected mao to take an independent line as the communist leader tito had just done in yugoslavia.
mao however aligned himself with the soviet union partly out of fear that the united states would re arm the nationalists and invade the mainland.
as attitudes hardened many americans viewed maos success as a defeat for the united states.
the pro nationalist china lobby accused trumans state department of being responsible for the loss of china.
sensitive to these charges the truman administration refused to recognize red china and blocked chinas admission to the united nations.
but the united states pointedly declined to guarantee taiwans independence and in fact accepted the outcome on the chapter 25 cold war america 1945 1963 communist china people in beijing raise their clenched fists in a welcoming salute for chinese communist forces entering the city after the nationalists surrendered on january 31 1949.
the center portrait behind them is of general mao zedong the leader of the communist party of china.
maos victory in the civil war 1946 1950 meant that from east germany to the pacific ocean much of the eurasian landmass including eastern europe the soviet union and china was ruled by communist governments.
since 1982 however the united states has recognized taiwanese sovereignty.
the korean war the united states took a stronger stance in korea.
the united states and the soviet union had agreed at the close of world war ii to occupy the korean peninsula jointly temporarily the korean war as a result of president trumans 1948 executive order 9981 for the first time in the nations history all troops in the korean war served in racially integrated combat units.

as tensions rose in europe the 38th parallel hardened into a permanent demarcation line.
the soviets supported a communist government led by kim il sung in north korea the united states backed a rightwing nationalist syngman rhee in south korea.
the two sides had waged low level war since 1945 and part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 to authorize a police action against the invaders.
the soviet union was boycotting the security council to protest chinas exclusion from the united nations and could not veto trumans request.
with the security councils approval of a peacekeeping force truman ordered u s troops to korea.
the rapidly assembled un army in korea was overwhelmingly american with general douglas macarthur in command.
at first the north koreans held a distinct advantage but macarthurs surprise amphibious attack at inchon gave the un forces control of seoul the south korean both leaders were spoiling for a more definitive fight.
however neither kim nor rhee could launch an allout offensive without the backing of his sponsor.
washington repeatedly said no and so did moscow.
but kim continued to press stalin to permit him to reunify the nation.
convinced by the north koreans that victory would be swift the soviet leader finally relented in the late spring of 1950.
on june 25 1950 the north koreans launched a surprise attack across the 38th parallel map 25 2.
truman immediately asked the un security council chinese troops entered the conflict 4 pushing battle lines back into south korea 5.
united states united nations and south korean forces quickly regained most of the territory to the 38th parallel.

south and north korean deaths were estimated at more than 900 000.
although hostilities ceased in 1953 the south korean military with u s military assistance and the north korean army continue to face each other across the demilitarized zone more than fifty years later.
chapter 25 cold war america 1945 1963 dwight d eisenhower left korea divided at the original demarcation line.
north korea remained firmly allied with the soviet union south korea signed a mutual defense treaty with the united states.
it had been the first major proxy battle of the cold war in which the soviet union and united states took sides in a civil conflict.
it would not be the last.
the korean war had far reaching consequences.
trumans decision to commit troops without congressional approval set a precedent for future undeclared wars.
his refusal to unleash atomic bombs even when american forces were reeling under a massive chinese attack set ground rules for cold war conflict.
the war also expanded american involvement in asia transforming containment into a truly global policy and significantly boosting japans struggling postwar economy.
finally the korean war ended trumans resistance to a major military buildup.
defense expenditures grew from 13 billion in 1950 roughly onethird of the federal budget to 50 billion in 1953 nearly two thirds of the budget map 25 3.
american capital and almost all the territory up to the 38th parallel.
the impetuous macarthur then ordered his troops across the 38th parallel and led them all the way to the chinese border at the yalu river.
it was a major blunder certain to draw china into the war.
sure enough a massive chinese counterattack forced macarthurs forces into headlong retreat back down the korean peninsula.
then stalemate set in.
with weak public support for the war in the united states truman and his advisors decided to work for a negotiated peace.
macarthur disagreed and denounced the korean stalemate declaring there is no substitute for victory on april 11 1951 truman relieved macarthur of his command.
trumans decision was highly unpopular especially among conservative republicans but he had likely saved the nation from years of costly warfare with china.
notwithstanding macarthurs dismissal the war dragged on for more than two years.
an armistice in july 1953 pushed by the newly elected president map 25 3 the military industrial complex defense spending gave a big boost to the cold war economy but as the upper map suggests the benefits were by no means equally distributed.
the big winners were the middle atlantic states the industrialized upper midwest washington state with its aircraft and nuclear plants and california.
the epicenter of californias military industrial complex was los angeles which as is evident in the lower map was studded with military facilities and major defense contractors like douglas aircraft lockheed and general dynamics.
there was work aplenty for engineers and rocket scientists.

in 1961 u s defense spending reached 47 billion fully half of the federal budget and almost 10 percent of the gross domestic product.
billions total federal spending defense spending foreign policy had become more global more militarized and more expensive figure 25 1.
even in times of peace the united states now functioned in a state of permanent military mobilization.
the munich analogy behind much of u s foreign policy in the first two decades of the cold war lay the memory of appeasement chapter 24.
the generation of politicians and officials who designed the containment strategy had come of age in the shadow of munich the conference in 1938 at which the western democracies had appeased hitler by offering him part of czechoslovakia paving the road to world war ii.
applying the lessons of munich american presidents believed that appeasing stalin and subsequent soviet rulers nikita khrushchev and leonid brezhnev would have the same result wider war.
thus in germany greece and korea and later in iran guatemala and vietnam the united states staunchly resisted the soviets or what it perceived as soviet influence.
the munich analogy strengthened the u s position in a number of strategic conflicts particularly over the fate of germany.
but it also drew americans into armed conflicts and convinced them to support repressive right wing regimes that compromised as much as supported stated american principles.
cold war liberalism harry truman cast himself in the mold of his predecessor franklin roosevelt and hoped to seize the possibilities afforded by victory in world war ii to expand the new deal at home.
but the crises in postwar europe and asia combined with the spectacular rise of anticommunism in the united states forced him to take a different path.
in the end truman went down in history not as a new dealer but as a cold warrior.
the cold war consensus that he ultimately embraced the notion that resisting communism at home and abroad represented americas most important postwar objective shaped the nations life and politics for decades to come.
truman and the end of reform truman and the democratic party of the late 1940s and early 1950s forged what historians call cold war liberalism.
they preserved the core programs of the new deal welfare state developed the containment policy to oppose soviet influence throughout the world and fought so called subversives at home.
but there would be no second act for the new deal.
the democrats adopted this combination of moderate liberal policies and anticommunism cold war liberalism partly by choice and partly out of necessity.
a few high level espionage scandals and the communist victories in eastern europe and china reenergized the republican party which forced truman and the democrats to retreat to what historian arthur schlesinger called the vital center of american politics.
however americans on both the progressive left and the conservative right remained dissatisfied with this development.
cold war liberalism was a practical centrist policy for a turbulent era.
but it would not last.
organized labor remained a key force in the democratic party and played a central role in championing chapter 25 cold war liberalism.
stronger than ever union membership swelled to more than 14 million by 1945.
determined to make up for their wartime sacrifices unionized workers made aggressive demands and mounted major strikes in the automobile steel and coal industries after the war.
republicans responded.
they gained control of the house in a sweeping repudiation of democrats in 1946 and promptly passed over trumans veto the taft hartley act 1947 an overhaul of the 1935 national labor relations act.
taft hartley crafted changes in procedures and language that over time weakened the right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining.
unions especially disliked section 14b which allowed states to pass right to work laws prohibiting the union shop.
additionally the law forced unions to purge communists who had been among the most successful labor organizers in the 1930s from their ranks.
tafthartley effectively contained the labor movement.
trade unions would continue to support the democratic party but the labor movement would not move into the largely non union south and would not extend into the many american industries that remained unorganized.
the 1948 election democrats would have dumped truman in 1948 had they found a better candidate.
but truman triumphant in one of the most famous photographs in u s political history harry s truman gloats over an erroneous headline in the november 3 chicago daily tribune.
pollsters had predicted an easy victory for thomas e dewey.
their primitive techniques however missed the dramatic surge in support for truman during the last days of the campaign.
bettmann corbis.
cold war america 1945 1963 the party fell into disarray.
the left wing split off and formed the progressive party nominating henry a wallace an avid new dealer whom truman had fired as secretary of commerce in 1946 because wallace opposed americas actions in the cold war.
a rightwing challenge came from the south.
when northern liberals such as mayor hubert h humphrey of minneapolis pushed through a strong civil rights platform at the demo place events cratic convention the southern in context delegations bolted and calling how was the democratic themselves dixiecrats nominated party divided in 1948 and for president south carolina gov what were its primary ernor strom thurmond an ardent constituencies.
supporter of racial segregation.
the republicans meanwhile renominated thomas e dewey the politically moderate governor of new york who had run a strong campaign against fdr in 1944.
truman surprised everyone.
he launched a strenuous cross country speaking tour and hammered away at the republicans for opposing progressive legislation and in general for running a do nothing congress.
by combining these issues with attacks on the soviet menace abroad truman began to salvage his troubled campaign.
at his rallies enthusiastic listeners shouted give em hell harry truman won receiving 49 6 percent of the vote to deweys 45 1 percent map 25 4.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 candidate harry s truman democrat thomas e dewey republican j strom thurmond states rights 28 13 8 11 electoral vote popular vote percent of popular vote 24 105 182 49 6 21 970 065 45 1 1 169 063 2 5 1 157 326 2 5 henry a wallace progressive map 25 4 the presidential election of 1948 trumans electoral strategy in 1948 was to concentrate his campaign in areas where the democrats had their greatest strength.
in an election with a low turnout truman held on to enough support from roosevelts new deal coalition of blacks union members and farmers to defeat dewey by more than 2 million votes.
this remarkable election foreshadowed coming political turmoil.
truman occupied the center of fdrs sprawling new deal coalition.
on his left were progressives civil rights advocates and anti cold war peace activists.
on his right were segregationist southerners who opposed civil rights and were allied with republicans on many economic and foreign policy issues.
in 1948 truman performed a delicate balancing act largely retaining the support of jewish and catholic voters in the big cities black voters in the north and organized labor voters across the country.
but thurmonds strong showing he carried four states in the deep south demonstrated the fragile nature of the democratic coalition and prefigured the revolt of the partys southern wing in the 1960s.
as he tried to manage contending forces in his own party truman faced mounting pressure from republicans to denounce radicals at home and to take a tough stand against the soviet union.
the fair deal despite having to perform a balancing act truman and progressive democrats forged ahead.
in 1949 reaching ambitiously to extend the new deal truman proposed the fair deal national health insurance aid to education a housing program expansion of social security a higher minimum wage and a new agricultural program.
in its attention to civil rights the fair deal also reflected the growing role of african americans in the democratic party.
congress however remained a huge stumbling block and the fair deal fared poorly.
the same conservative coalition that had blocked roosevelts initiatives in his second term continued the fight against trumans.
cold war pressure shaped political arguments about domestic social programs while the nations growing paranoia over internal subversion weakened support for bold extensions of the welfare state.
trumans proposal for national health insurance for instance was a popular idea with strong backing from organized labor.
but it was denounced as socialized medicine by the american medical association and the insurance industry.
in the end the fair deals only significant breakthrough other than improvements to the minimum wage and social security was the national housing act of 1949 which authorized the construction of 810 000 low income units.
red scare the hunt for communists cold war liberalism was premised on the grave domestic threat posed many believed by communists and communist sympathizers.
was there any significant soviet penetration of the american government.
records opened after the 1991 disintegration of the soviet union indicate that there was although it was largely confined to the 1930s.
among american suppliers of information to moscow were fdrs assistant secretary of the treasury harry dexter white fdrs administrative aide laughlin currie a strategically placed midlevel group in the state department and several hundred more some identified only by code name working in a range of government departments and agencies.
how are we to explain this.
many of these enlistees in the soviet cause had been bright young new dealers in the mid 1930s when the soviet backed popular front suggested that the lines separating liberalism progressivism and communism were permeable chapter 24.
at that time the united states was not at war and never expected to be.
and when war did come the soviet union was an american ally.
for critics of the informants however there remained the time between the nazi soviet pact and the german invasion of the soviet union a nearly two year period during which cooperation with the soviet union could be seen in a less positive light.
moreover chapter 25 passing secrets to another country even a wartime ally was simply indefensible to many americans.
the lines between u s and soviet interests blurred for some for others they remained clear and definite.
after world war ii however most suppliers of information to the soviets apparently ceased spying.
for one thing the professional apparatus of soviet spying in the united states was dismantled or disrupted by american counterintelligence work.
for another most of the well connected amateur spies moved on to other careers.
historians have thus developed a healthy skepticism that there was much soviet espionage in the united states after 1947 but this was not how many americans saw it at the time.
legitimate suspicions and real fears along with political opportunism combined to fuel the national red scare which was longer and more far reaching than the one that followed world war i chapter 22.
loyalty security program to insulate his administration against charges of communist infiltration truman issued executive order 9835 on march 21 1947 which created the loyalty security program.
the order permitted officials to investigate any employee of the federal government some 2 5 million people for subversive activities.
representing a profound centralization of power the order sent shock waves through every federal agency.
truman intended the order to apply principally to actions designed to harm the united states sabotage treason etc.
but it was broad enough to allow anyone to be accused of subversion for the slightest reason for marching in a communistled demonstration in the 1930s for instance or signing a petition calling for public housing.
along with suspected political subversives more than a thousand gay men and lesbians were dismissed from federal employment in the 1950s victims of an obsessive search for anyone deemed unfit for government work.
following trumans lead many state and local governments universities political organizations churches and businesses undertook their own antisubversion campaigns which often included loyalty oaths.
in the labor movement charges of communist domination led to the expulsion of a number of unions by the congress of industrial organizations cio in 1949.
civil rights organizations such as the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and the national urban league also expelled communists and fellow travelers or communist sympathizers.
thus the red scare spread from the federal government to the farthest reaches of american organizational economic and cultural life.
cold war america 1945 1963 huac the truman administration had legitimized the vague and malleable concept of disloyalty others proved willing to stretch the concept even further beginning with the house un american activities committee huac which congressman martin dies of texas and other conservatives had launched in 1938.
after the war huac helped spark the red scare by holding widely publicized hearings in 1947 on alleged communist infiltration in the movie industry.
a group of writers and directors dubbed the hollywood ten went to jail for contempt of congress after they refused to testify about their past associations.
hundreds of other actors directors and writers whose names had been mentioned in the huac investigation were unable to get work victims of an unacknowledged but very real blacklist honored by industry executives.
other huac investigations had greater legitimacy.
one that intensified the anticommunist crusade in 1948 involved alger hiss a former new dealer and state department official who had accompanied franklin roosevelt to yalta.
a former communist whitaker identify causes chambers claimed that hiss was what factors led to the a member of a secret communist postwar red scare and cell operating in the government what were its ramifications and had passed him classified for civil liberties in the documents in the 1930s.
hiss united states.
denied the allegations but california republican congressman richard nixon doggedly pursued the case against him.
in early 1950 hiss was found guilty not of spying but of lying to congress about his communist affiliations and was sentenced to five years in federal prison.
many americans doubted at the time that hiss was a spy.
but the venona transcripts in the 1990s corroborated a great deal of chamberss testimony and though no definitive proof has emerged many historians now recognize the strong circumstantial evidence against hiss.
mccarthyism the meteoric career of senator joseph mccarthy of wisconsin marked first the apex and then the finale of the red scare.
in february 1950 mccarthy delivered a bombshell during a speech in wheeling west virginia i have here in my hand a list of 205.
a list of names that were made known to the secretary of state as being members of the communist party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the state department mccarthy later reduced his numbers gave different figures in different speeches and never released any names or proof.
but he had gained the attention he sought american voices p 822.
american voices hunting communists and liberals the onset of the cold war created an opportunity for some conservatives to use anticommunism as a weapon to attack the truman administration.
in senator joseph mccarthys case the charge was that the u s government was harboring soviet spies.
there was also a broader more amorphous attack on people accused not of spying but of having communist sympathies such fellow travelers were considered security risks and thus unsuitable for government positions.
the basis of suspicion for this targeted group was generally membership in organizations that supported policies that either overlapped with or seemed similar to policies supported by the communist party.
senator joseph mccarthy fulton lewis jr.
speech delivered in wheeling west virginia february 9 1950 radio address january 13 1949 though senator mccarthy was actually late getting on board the anticommunist rocket ship this was the speech that launched him into orbit.
no one else ever saw the piece of paper he waved about during this speech with the names of 57 spies in the state department.
over time the numbers he cited fluctuated in early versions of this speech he claimed to have a list of 205 names and never materialized into a single indictment for espionage.
still mccarthy had an extraordinary talent for whipping up anticommunist hysteria.
his downfall came in 1954 when the u s senate formally censured him for his conduct three years later he died of alcoholism at the age of forty eight.
today we are engaged in a final all out battle between communistic atheism and christianity.
the modern champions of communism have selected this as the time.
and ladies and gentlemen the chips are down they are truly down.
the reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade our shores but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this nation.
it has not been the less fortunate or members of minority groups who have been selling this nation out but rather those who have had all the benefits that the wealthiest nation on earth has had to offer the finest homes the finest college education and the finest jobs in government we can give.
i have in my hand 57 cases of individuals who would appear to be either card carrying members or certainly loyal to the communist party but who nevertheless are still helping to shape our foreign policy.
the groundwork for mccarthys anticommunist crusade was laid by the house un american activities committee huac which had been formed in 1938 by conservative southern democrats seeking to investigate alleged communist influence around the country.
one of its early targets had been dr frank p graham the distinguished president of the university of north carolina.
a committed southern liberal graham was a leading figure in the southern conference on human welfare the most prominent southern organization supporting the new deal free speech organized labor and greater rights for southern blacks causes that some in the south saw as pathways for communist subversion.
after the war huac stepped up its activities and kept a close eye on graham.
among grahams duties was to serve as the head of the oak ridge institute of nuclear studies a consortium of fourteen southern universities designed to undertake joint research with the federal governments atomic energy facility at oak ridge tennessee.
to enable him to carry on his duties the atomic energy commission aec granted graham a security clearance overriding the negative recommendation of the aecs security advisory board.
that was the occasion for the following statement by fulton lewis jr a conservative radio commentator with a nationwide following.
about dr frank p graham president of the university of north carolina and the action of the atomic energy commission giving him complete clearance for all atomic secrets despite the fact that the security officer of the commission flatly rejected him.
president truman was asked to comment on the matter today at his press and radio conference and his reply was that he has complete confidence in dr graham.
the defenders of dr graham today offered the apology that during the time he joined the various subversive and communist front organizations like the southern conference for human welfare organizations so listed by the attorney general of the united states this country was a co belligerent with soviet russia and numerous people joined such groups and causes.
that argument is going to sound very thin to most american citizens because the overwhelming majority of us would have no part of any communist or communist front connections at any time.
frank porter graham telegram to fulton lewis jr january 13 one can imagine grahams shock at hearing himself pilloried on national radio.
he had not even been aware of the aecs investigation of him.
the following is from his response to lewis.
in view of your questions and implications i hope you will use my statement to provide for my answers.
i have always been opposed to communism and all totalitarian dictatorships.
i opposed both nazi and communist aggression against czechoslovakia and the earlier russian aggression against finland and later communist aggression against other countries.
during the period of my active participation the overwhelming number of members of the southern conference were to my knowledge anti communists.
there were several isolationist stands of the conference with which i disagreed.
the stands which i supported as the main business of the conference were such as the following federal aid to the states for schools abolition of freight rate discrimination against southern commerce agriculture and industry anti poll tax bill anti lynching bill equal right of qualified negroes to vote in both primaries and general elections the unhampered lawful right of labor to organize and bargain collectively in our region.
minimum wages and social security in the southern and american tradition.
i have been called a communist by some sincere people.
i have been called a spokesman of american capitalism by communists and repeatedly called a tool of imperialism by the radio from moscow.
i shall simply continue to oppose ku kluxism imperialism fascism and communism whether in america.
or behind the iron curtain house un american activities committee report on frank graham february 4 1949 because of the controversy huac released a report on graham.
a check of the files records and publications of the committee on un american activities has revealed the following information letterheads dated september 22 1939 january 17 1940 and may 26 1940 as well as the daily worker of march 18 1939.
reveal that frank p graham was a member of the american committee for democracy and intellectual freedom.
in report 2277 dated june 25 1942 the special committee on un american activities found that the line of the american committee for democracy and intellectual freedom has fluctuated in complete harmony with the line of the communist party the organization was again cited by the special committee.
as a communist front which defended communist teachers.
a letterhead of february 7 1946 a letterhead of june 4 1947.
and an announcement of the third meeting april 19 21 1942 at nashville tennessee reveal that frank p graham was honorary president of the southern conference for human welfare.
in a report on the southern conference for human welfare dated june 16 1947 the committee on unamerican activities found the most conclusive proof of communist domination of the southern conference for human welfare is to be found in the organizations strict and unvarying conformance to the line of the communist party in the field of foreign policy.
it is also a clear indication of the fact that the real purpose of the organization was not human welfare in the south but rather to serve as a convenient vehicle in support of the current communist party line source 1819 frank porter graham papers.

questions for analysis 1.
on what grounds did fulton lewis jr and huac assert that frank graham was a security risk.
did they charge that he was a communist.
is there any evidence in these documents that graham might have been a security risk.
how did graham defend himself.
are you persuaded by his argument.
compare mccarthys famous speech at wheeling west virginia and the suspicions voiced against graham by lewis and huac a year earlier.
what similarities do you see.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 for the next four years from his position as chair of the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations mccarthy waged a virulent smear campaign.
critics who disagreed with him exposed themselves to charges of being soft on communism.
truman called mccarthys charges slander lies and character assassination but could do nothing to curb him.
republicans for their part refrained from publicly challenging their most outspoken senator and on the whole were content to reap the political benefits.
mccarthys charges almost always targeted democrats.
despite mccarthys failure to identify a single communist in government several national developments gave his charges credibility with the public.
the dramatic 1951 espionage trial of julius and ethel rosenberg followed around the world fueled mccarthys allegations.
convicted of passing atomic secrets to the soviet union the rosenbergs were executed in 1953.
as in the hiss case documents released decades later provided some evidence of julius rosenbergs guilt though not ethels.
their execution nevertheless remains controversial in part because some felt that antisemitism played a role in their sentencing.
also fueling mccarthys charges were a series of trials of american communists between 1949 and 1955 for violation of the 1940 smith act which prohibited americans from advocating the violent overthrow of the government.
though civil libertarians and two supreme court justices vigorously objected dozens of communist party members were convicted.
mccarthy was not involved in either the rosenberg trial or the smith act convictions but these sensational events gave his wild charges some credence.
in early 1954 mccarthy overreached by launching an investigation into subversive activities in the u s army.
when lengthy hearings the first of their kind the army mccarthy hearings these 1954 hearings contributed to the downfall of senator joseph mccarthy by exposing his reckless accusations and bullying tactics to the huge television audience that tuned in each day.
some of the most heated exchanges took place between mccarthy center and joseph welch seated left the lawyer representing the army.
when the gentlemanly welch finally asked have you no sense of decency sir at long last.
have you left no sense of decency he fatally punctured mccarthys armor.
the audience broke into applause because someone had finally had the courage to stand up to the senator from wisconsin.

chapter 25 cold war america 1945 1963 broadcast on the new medium of television brought mccarthys tactics into the nations living rooms support for him plummeted.
in december 1954 the senate voted 67 to 22 to censure mccarthy for unbecoming conduct.
he died from an alcohol related illness three years later at the age of forty eight his name forever attached to a period of political repression of which he was only the most flagrant manifestation.
the politics of cold war liberalism as election day 1952 approached the nation was embroiled in the tense cold war with the soviet union and fighting a hot war in korea.
though americans gave the republicans victory radical change was not in the offing.
the new president dwight d eisenhower set the tone for what his supporters called modern republicanism an updated gop approach that aimed at moderating not dismantling the new deal state.
eisenhower and his supporters were more successors of fdr than of herbert hoover.
foreign policy revealed a similar continuity.
like their predecessors republicans saw the world in cold war polarities.
republicans rallied around eisenhower the popular former commander of allied forces in europe but divisions in the party persisted.
more conservative party activists preferred robert a taft of ohio the republican leader in the senate who was a vehement opponent of the new deal.
a close friend of business he particularly detested labor unions.
though an ardent anticommunist the isolationist minded taft criticized trumans aggressive containment policy and opposed u s participation in nato.
taft ran for president three times and though he was never the republican nominee he won the loyalty of conservative americans who saw the welfare state as a waste and international affairs as dangerous foreign entanglements.
in contrast moderate republicans looked to eisenhower and even to more liberal minded leaders like nelson rockefeller who supported international initiatives such as the marshall plan and nato and were willing to tolerate labor unions and the welfare state.
eisenhower was a man without a political past.
believing that democracy required the military to stand aside he had never voted.
rockefeller the scion of one of the richest families in america was a cold war internationalist.
he served in a variety of capacities under eisenhower including as an advisor on foreign affairs.
having made his political name rockefeller was elected the governor of new york in 1959 and became the de facto leader of the liberal wing of the republican party.
dwight eisenhower in this photo taken during the 1952 presidential campaign dwight d eisenhower acknowledges cheers from supporters in chicago.
ike as he was universally known had been a popular five star general in world war ii also serving as supreme allied commander in the european theater and turned to politics in the early 1950s as a member of the republican party.
however eisenhower was a centrist who did little to disrupt the liberal social policies that democrats had pursued since the 1930s.

chapter 24 the world at war 1937 1945 adolf hitler adolf hitler salutes german troops during a parade at the nazi partys annual congress at nuremberg.
german fascism reveled in great public spectacles such as the famous nuremberg rallies held every year between the early 1920s and the late 1930s.
hitler used these mass rallies at which tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians gathered to build wide support for his policies of aggressive militarism abroad and suppression of jews and other minorities at home.
getty images.
1936 he sent troops into the rhineland a demilitarized zone under the terms of versailles.
again france and britain took no action.
later that year hitler and mussolini formed the rome berlin axis a political and military alliance between the two fascist nations.
also in 1936 germany signed a pact to create a military alliance with japan against the soviet union.
with these alliances in place and with france and great britain reluctant to oppose him hitler had seized the military advantage in europe by 1937.
war approaches as hitler pushed his initiatives in europe which was mired in economic depression as deeply as the united states the roosevelt administration faced widespread isolationist sentiment at home.
in part this desire to avoid european entanglements reflected disillusion with american participation in world war i.
in 1934 gerald p nye a progressive republican senator from north dakota launched an investigation into the profits of munitions makers during that war.
nyes committee alleged that arms manufacturers popularly labeled merchants of death had maneuvered president wilson into world war i.
although nyes committee failed to prove its charge against weapon makers its factual findings prompted an isolationist minded congress to pass a series of acts to prevent the nation from being drawn into another overseas war.
the neutrality act of 1935 imposed an embargo on selling arms to warring countries and declared that americans traveling on the ships of belligerent nations did so at their own risk.
in 1936 congress banned loans to belligerents and in 1937 it imposed a cash and carry requirement if a warring country wanted to purchase nonmilitary goods from the united states it had to pay cash and carry them in its own ships keeping the united states out of potentially dangerous naval warfare.
americans for the most part had little enthusiasm for war and a wide variety of groups and individuals espoused isolationism.
many isolationists looked to republican ohio senator robert taft who distrusted both roosevelt and european nations with equal conviction or to the aviator hero charles a lindbergh who delivered impassioned speeches against intervention in europe.
some isolationists such as the conservative national legion of mothers of america combined anticommunism christian morality and even anti semitism.
isolationists were primarily part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 as the united states france and britain remained neutral.
in the united states the popular front drew from a wide range of social groups.
the american communist party which had increased its membership to 100 000 as the depression revealed flaws in the capitalist system led the way.
african american civil rights activists trade unionists left wing writers and intellectuals and even a few new deal administrators also joined the coalition.
in time however many supporters in the united states grew uneasy with the popular front because of the rigidity of communists and the brutal political repression in the soviet union under joseph stalin.
nevertheless popular front activists were among a small but vocal group of americans encouraging roosevelt to take a stronger stand against european fascism.
charles lindbergh cartoon charles lindbergh the first person to fly solo nonstop across the atlantic ocean was an american hero in the 1930s.
in 1941 he had become the public face of the america first committee which was determined the keep the united states from entering the wars raging in europe and asia.
in this political cartoon from october 1941 lindbergh is shown standing on a soapbox labeled fascism looking up at the figure of democracy the implication is that lindbergh had been fooled by german propaganda into taking its side.
less than two months after the cartoon appeared japan attacked pearl harbor and isolationist sentiment all but disappeared in the united states.
library of congress.
conservatives but a contingent of progressives or liberals opposed americas involvement in the war on pacifist or moral grounds.
whatever their philosophies ardent isolationists forced roosevelt to approach the brewing war cautiously.
the popular front other americans responded to the rise of european fascism by advocating u s intervention.
some of the most prominent americans pushing for greater involvement in europe even if it meant war were affiliated with the popular front.
fearful of german and japanese aggression the soviet union instructed communists in western europe and the united states to join with liberals in a broad coalition opposing fascism.
this popular front supported various international causes backing the loyalists in their fight against fascist leader francisco franco in the spanish civil war 1936 1939 for example even the failure of appeasement encouraged by the weak worldwide response to the invasions of china ethiopia and the rhineland and emboldened by british and french neutrality during the spanish civil war hitler grew more aggressive in 1938.
he sent troops to annex german speaking austria while making clear his intention to seize part of czechoslovakia.
because czechoslovakia had an alliance with france war seemed imminent.
but at the munich conference in september 1938 britain and france capitulated agreeing to let germany annex the sudetenland a german speaking border area of czechoslovakia in return for hitlers pledge to seek no more territory.
the agreement declared british prime minister neville chamberlain guaranteed peace for our time hitler drew a different conclusion telling his generals our enemies are small fry.
i saw them in munich within six months hitlers forces had overrun the rest of czechoslovakia and were threatening to march into poland.
realizing that their policy of appeasement capitulating to hitlers demands had been disastrous britain and france warned hitler that further aggression meant war.
then in august 1939 hitler and stalin shocked the world by signing a mutual nonaggression pact.
for hitler this pact was crucial as it meant that germany would not have to wage a twofront war against britain and france in the west and the soviet union in the east.
on september 1 1939 hitler launched a blitzkrieg against poland.
two days later britain and france declared war on germany.
world war ii had officially begun.
two days after the european war started the united states declared its neutrality.
but president roosevelt made no secret of his sympathies.
when war broke out chapter 24 in 1914 woodrow wilson had told americans to be neutral in thought as well as in action fdr by contrast now said this nation will remain a neutral nation but i cannot ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well the overwhelming majority of americans some 84 percent according to a poll in 1939 supported britain and france rather than germany but most wanted america to avoid another european war.
at first the need for u s intervention seemed remote.
after germany conquered poland in september 1939 calm settled over europe.
then on april 9 1940 german forces invaded denmark and norway.
in may the netherlands belgium and luxembourg fell to the swift german army.
the final shock came in mid june when france too surrendered.
britain now stood alone against hitlers plans for domination of europe.
isolationism and internationalism what time magazine would later call americas thousand step road to war had already begun.
after a bitter battle in congress in 1939 roosevelt won a change in the neutrality laws to allow the allies to buy arms as well as nonmilitary goods on a cash and carry basis.
interventionists led by journalist william allen white and his committee to defend america by aiding the allies became increasingly vocal in 1940 as war escalated in europe.
interventionists were also known as internationalists since they believed in engaging with rather than withdrawing from international developments.
in response isolationists formed the america first committee afc with well respected figures such as lindbergh and senator nye urging the nation to stay out of the war.
the afc held rallies across the united states and its posters brochures and broadsides warning against american involvement in europe suffused many parts of the country especially the midwest.
because of the america firsters efforts roosevelt proceeded cautiously in 1940 as he moved the united states closer to involvement.
the president did not want war but he believed that most americans greatly underestimate the serious implications to our own future as he confided to white.
in may roosevelt created the national defense advisory commission and brought two prominent republicans henry stimson and frank knox into his cabinet as secretaries of war and the navy respectively.
during the summer the president traded fifty world war i destroyers to great britain in exchange for the right to build military bases on british possessions in the atlantic circumventing neutrality laws by using an executive order to complete the world at war 1937 1945 the deal.
in october 1940 a bipartisan vote in congress approved a large increase in defense spending and instituted the first peacetime draft in american history.
we must be the great arsenal of democracy fdr declared.
as the war in europe and the pacific expanded the united states was preparing for the 1940 presidential election.
the crisis had convinced roosevelt to seek an unprecedented third term.
the republicans nominated wendell willkie of indiana a former democrat who supported many new deal policies.
the two parties platforms differed only slightly.
both pledged aid to the allies and both candidates promised not to send an american boy into the shambles of a european war as willkie put it.
willkies spirited campaign resulted in a closer election than that of 1932 or 1936 nonetheless roosevelt won 55 percent of the popular vote.
having been reelected roosevelt now undertook to persuade congress to increase aid to britain whose survival he viewed as key to american security.
in january 1941 he delivered one of the most important speeches of place events his career.
defining four essen in context tial human freedoms freedom how did roosevelt use of speech freedom of religion the four freedoms speech freedom from want and freedom and the atlantic charter from fear roosevelt cast the to define the war for war as a noble defense of demo americans.
cratic societies.
he then linked the fate of democracy in western europe with the new welfare state at home.
sounding a decidedly new deal note roosevelt pledged to end special privileges for the few and to preserve civil liberties for all like president wilsons speech championing national selfdetermination at the close of world war i roosevelts four freedoms speech outlined a liberal international order with appeal well beyond its intended european and american audiences.
to see a longer excerpt of the four freedoms speech along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
two months later in march 1941 with britain no longer able to pay cash for arms roosevelt persuaded congress to pass the lend lease act.
the legislation authorized the president to lease lend or otherwise dispose of arms and equipment to britain or any other country whose defense was considered vital to the security of the united states.
when hitler abandoned his nonaggression pact with stalin and invaded the part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 soviet union in june 1941 the united states extended lend lease to the soviets.
the implementation of lendlease marked the unofficial entrance of the united states into the european war.
roosevelt underlined his support for the allied cause by meeting in august 1941 with british prime minister winston churchill who had succeeded chamberlain in 1940.
their joint press release which became known as the atlantic charter provided the ideological foundation of the western cause.
drawing from wilsons fourteen points and roosevelts four freedoms the charter called for economic cooperation national self determination and guarantees of political stability after the war to ensure that all men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want it would become the basis for a new american led transatlantic alliance after the wars conclusion.
its promise of national self determination however set up potential conflict in asia and africa where european powers would be reluctant to abandon their imperial holdings.
in the fall of 1941 the reality of u s involvement in the war drew closer.
by september nazi u boats and the american navy were exchanging fire in the atlantic.
with isolationists still a potent force roosevelt hesitated to declare war and insisted that the united states would defend itself only against a direct attack.
but behind the scenes the president openly discussed american involvement with close advisors and considered war inevitable.
the attack on pearl harbor the crucial provocation came not from germany but from japan.
after japan invaded china in 1937 roosevelt had denounced the present reign of terror one city and island at a time by late 1944 the victory of the united states and its allies was nearly certain but japanese and german troops continued to fight with great courage and determination.
many european cities and every pacific island had to be taken foot by foot.
here american troops from the 325th regiment of the 82nd airborne division advance slowly through the rubble filled street of a german city in early 1945.

chapter 24 and international lawlessness and suggested that aggressors be quarantined by peaceful nations.
despite such rhetoric the united states refused to intervene later that year when japanese troops sacked the city of nanjing massacred 300 000 chinese residents and raped thousands of women.
fdr and other american officials prioritized events in europe over those in east asia and without a counterweight japans military and imperial ambitions expanded.
in 1940 general hideki tojo became war minister.
after concluding a formal military alliance with germany and italy that year tojo dispatched japanese troops to occupy the northern part of the french colony of indochina present day vietnam cambodia and laos.
tojos goal supported by emperor hirohito was to create a greater east asia co prosperity sphere under japans control stretching from the korean peninsula south to indonesia.
like germany and italy japan sought to match the overseas empires of britain france holland and the united states.
the united states responded to the stationing of japanese troops in indochina by restricting trade with japan.
roosevelt hoped that these economic sanctions would deter japanese aggression.
but in july 1941 japanese troops staged a full scale invasion of indochina.
roosevelt then froze japanese assets in the united states and stopped all trade with japan including vital oil shipments that accounted for almost 80 percent of japanese consumption.
in october 1941 general tojo became prime minister and accelerated secret preparations for war against the united states.
by november american military intelligence knew that japan was planning an attack but did not know where it would occur.
early on sunday morning december 7 1941 japanese bombers attacked pearl harbor in hawaii killing more than 2 400 americans.
they destroyed or heavily damaged eight battleships three cruisers three destroyers and almost two hundred airplanes.
figure 24 1 although the assault was devastating it united the american people.
calling december 7 a date which will live in infamy president roosevelt asked congress for a declaration of war against japan.
the senate voted unanimously for war and the house concurred by a vote of 388 to 1.
the lone dissenter was jeannette rankin of montana a committed pacifist she also voted against entry into world war i and the first female member of congress.
three days later germany and italy declared war on the united states which in turn declared war on the axis powers.
the long shadows of two wars one in europe and one in asia had at long last converged over the united states.
organizing for victory the task of fighting on a global scale dramatically increased the power of the federal government.
shifting from civilian to military production raising an army and assembling the necessary workforce required a massive expansion in government authority.
when congress passed the war powers act in december 1941 it gave president roosevelt unprecedented control over all aspects of the war effort.
this act marked the beginning of what some historians call the imperial presidency the far reaching use and sometimes abuse of executive authority during the latter part of the twentieth century.
financing the war defense mobilization not the new deal efforts of the 1930s ended the great depression.
between 1940 and 1945 the annual gross national product doubled and after tax profits of american businesses nearly doubled america compared p 774.
federal spending on war production powered this advance.
by late 1943 twothirds of the economy was directly involved in the war effort figure 24 1.
the government paid for these government military and civilian spending as a percentage of gdp 1920 1980 government military spending was about 3 percent of the gross domestic product gdp in the 1920s and 1930s but it ballooned to more than 25 percent during world war ii to 13 percent during the korean war and to nearly 10 percent during the vietnam war.
federal government spending for civilian purposes doubled during the new deal and has remained at about 17 to 20 percent of gdp ever since.
percentage of gdp the world at war 1937 1945 nondefense defense america c o m pa r e d world war ii saw an extraordinary loss of life.
worldwide at least 50 million people perished between 1939 and 1945 from war related causes.
the majority of those who died were civilians though many millions of soldiers perished in battle as well.
for most countries we have reasonable estimates rather than precise figures.
the chart below compares the united states with other major combatants and nations caught in this global struggle.
on the other side of the scale the war fueled tremendous economic growth at least in the united states which was spared the physical devastation of europe and east asia.
military production for world war ii lifted the united states out of the great depression.
gross domestic product gdp nearly doubled between 1938 and 1945.

why did the united states experience so many fewer deaths than other nations.
why were there so many deaths in eastern europe and the soviet union.
note the relative position of u s gdp to other industrial nations in 1938 and in 1945.
how were some of the key domestic changes discussed in the chapter such as rural urban migration racial conflict and womens employment linked to this economic growth.
how might you use these comparisons to add to your understanding of key wartime developments such as the holocaust stalins demand for a second front or the entry of the united states into the war.
chapter 24 military expenditures by raising taxes and borrowing money.
the revenue act of 1942 expanded the number of people paying income taxes from 3 9 million to 42 6 million.
taxes on personal incomes and business profits paid half the cost of the war.
the government borrowed the rest both from wealthy americans and from ordinary citizens who invested in long term treasury bonds known as war bonds.
financing and coordinating the war effort required far reaching cooperation between government and private business.
the number of civilians employed by the government increased almost fourfold to 3 8 million a far higher rate of growth than that during the new deal.
the powerful war production board wpb awarded defense contracts allocated scarce resources such as rubber copper and oil for military uses and persuaded businesses to convert to military production.
for example it encouraged ford and general motors to build tanks rather than cars by granting generous tax advantages for re equipping existing factories and building new ones.
in other instances the board approved cost plus contracts which guaranteed corporations a profit and allowed them to keep new steel mills factories and shipyards after the war.
such government subsidies of defense shipyards in wartime the shipyard workers shown here are laying the keel of the joseph n teal a 10 500 ton liberty freighter bound for the war in the pacific in 1942.

kaiser was the king of shipbuilding on the west coast with massive yards in portland and the san francisco bay area.
in all kaisers workers built nearly 1 500 ships in three years one quarter of the total constructed during the war.

evolution in the schools at the state and local levels controversy erupted as fundamentalist protestants sought to mandate school curricula based on the biblical account of creation.

the aclu intervened in the trial of john t scopes a high school biology teacher who taught the theory of evolution to his class and faced a jail sentence for doing so.
the case attracted national attention because clarence darrow a famous criminal lawyer defended scopes while william jennings bryan the three time democratic presidential candidate spoke for the prosecution.
journalists dubbed the scopes trial the monkey trial this label referred both to darwins argument that human beings and other primates share a common ancestor and to the circus atmosphere at the trial which was broadcast live over a chicago radio station.

nativism some native born protestants pointed to immigration as the primary cause of what they saw as americas moral decline.
a nation of 105 million people had added more than 23 million immigrants over the previous four decades the newcomers included many catholics and jews from southern and eastern europe whom one maryland congressman referred to as indigestible lumps in the national stomach such attitudes recalled hostility toward irish and germans in the 1840s and 1850s.
in this case they fueled a momentous shift in immigration policy.

socialism and other radical doctrines.
responding to this pressure congress passed emergency immigration restrictions in 1921 and a permanent measure three years later.
the national origins act 1924 used backdated census data to establish a baseline in the future annual immigration from each country could not exceed 2 percent of that nationalitys percentage of the u s population as it had stood in 1890.
since only small numbers of italians greeks poles russians and other southern and eastern european immigrants had arrived before 1890 the law drastically limited immigration from those places.
in 1929 congress imposed even more restrictive quotas setting a cap of 150 000 immigrants per year from europe and continuing to ban most immigrants from asia.
the new laws however permitted unrestricted immigration from the western hemisphere.
as a result latin americans arrived in increasing numbers finding jobs in the west that had gone to other immigrants before exclusion.
more than 1 million mexicans entered the united states between 1900 and 1930 including many during world war i nativists lobbied congress to cut this flow so did labor leaders who argued that impoverished migrants lowered wages for other american workers.
but congress heeded the pleas of employers especially farmers in texas and california who wanted cheap labor.
only the great depression cut off migration from mexico.
other anti immigrant measures emerged at the state level.
in 1913 by an overwhelming majority californias legislature had passed a law declaring that aliens ineligible to citizenship could not own real property the aim was to discourage asians especially japanese immigrants from owning land though some had lived in the state for decades and built up prosperous farms.
in the wake of world war i california tightened these laws making it increasingly difficult for asian families to establish themselves.
california washington and hawaii also severely restricted any school that taught japanese language history or culture.
denied both citizenship and land rights japanese americans would be in a vulnerable position at the outbreak of world war ii when anti japanese hysteria swept the united states.
part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 the u s border patrol laredo texas 1926 in 1926 san antonio photographer eugene o goldbeck took this photograph of u s border patrol officers in laredo.
since 1917 mexicans like other immigrants had been subject to a head tax and literacy test.
the u s government had not enforced these provisions however because of pressure from southwestern employers eager for cheap mexican labor.
following passage of the national origins act in 1924 the united states established the border patrol.
its increasing efforts to police the border slowed the casual movement of mexican workers in and out of the united states.
why do you think the border patrol posed in this way for goldbecks picture.
notice that some of the officers depicted here were dressed as civilians.
what might this signify.

the national klan the 1920s brought a nationwide resurgence of the ku klux klan kkk the white supremacist group formed in the post civil war south.
soon after the premiere of birth of a nation 1915 a popular film glorifying the reconstructionera klan a group of southerners gathered on georgias stone mountain to revive the group.
with its blunt motto native white protestant supremacy the klan recruited supporters across the country thinking like a historian p 716.
kkk members did not limit their harassment to blacks but targeted immigrants catholics and jews as well with physical intimidation arson and economic boycotts.
at the height of its power the klan wielded serious political clout and counted more than three million members including many women.
the klans mainstream appeal was illustrated by president woodrow wilsons public praise for birth of a nation.
though the klan declined nationally after 1925 robbed of a potent issue by passage of the anti immigration bill it remained strong in the south and pockets of kkk activity persisted in all parts of the country map 22 1.
klan activism lent a menacing cast to political issues.
some local klansmen for example cooperated with members of the anti saloon league to enforce prohibition laws through threats and violent attacks.
the rise of the klan was part of an ugly trend that began before world war i and extended into the 1930s.
in 1915 for example rising anti semitism was marked by the lynching of leo frank a jewish factory supervisor in marietta georgia who was wrongly accused of the rape and murder of a thirteen year old girl.
the rise of the national klan helped prepare the way for white supremacist movements of the 1930s such as the los angeles based silver legion a fringe paramilitary group aligned with hitlers nazis.
far more influential were major figures such as industrialist henry ford whose dearborn independent railed against immigrants and warned that members of the proud gentile race must arm themselves against a jewish conspiracy aimed at world domination.
challenged by critics ford issued an apology in 1927 and admitted that his allegations had been based on gross forgeries but with his papers editorials widely circulated by the klan and other groups considerable long term damage had been done.

although the klan is often thought of as a rural movement some of the strongest klaverns were in chicago los angeles atlanta detroit and other large cities.
the organizations members operated as vigilantes in areas where they were strong elsewhere their aggressive tactics triggered riots between klansmen and their ethnic and religious targets.
presidential election in 1928.
democrats had traditionally drawn strength from white voters in the south and immigrants in the north groups that divided over prohibition immigration restriction and the klan.
by 1928 the northern urban wing gained firm control.
democrats nominated governor al smith of new york the first presidential candidate to reflect the aspirations of the urban working class.
a grandson of irish peasants smith had risen through new york citys democratic machine to become a dynamic reformer.
but he offended many small town and rural americans with his heavy new york accent and brown derby hat which highlighted his ethnic working class origins.
middle class reformers questioned his ties to tammany hall temperance advocates opposed him as a wet but the governors greatest handicap was his religion.
although smith insisted that his catholic beliefs would not affect his duties as president many protestants opposed him.
no governor can kiss the papal ring and get within gunshot of the white house vowed one methodist bishop.
smith proved no match for the republican nominee secretary of commerce herbert hoover who embodied the technological promise of the modern age.
women who had mobilized for hoovers conservation campaigns during world war i enlisted as hoover hostesses inviting friends to their homes to hear the candidates radio speeches.
riding on eight years of republican prosperity hoover promised that individualism and voluntary cooperation would banish poverty.
he won overwhelmingly with 444 electoral votes to smiths 87 map 22 2.

intellectual modernism the horrors of world war i prompted many intellectuals to question long standing assumptions about civilization progress and the alleged superiority of western cultures over so called primitive ways of life.
in the united states these questions contributed to struggles between modernity and tradition reflected not only in politics but also in art and literature.
some of these intellectual movements had their roots in the devastation of europe others such as the harlem renaissance emerged from social upheavals the great war had wrought at home.
the great migration tripled new yorks black population in the decade after 1910.
harlem stood as the symbol of liberty and the promised land to negroes everywhere as one minister put it.
talented african americans flocked to the district where they created bold new art forms and asserted ties to africa.

claude mckay and jean toomer represented in fiction what philosopher alain locke called in an influential 1925 book the new negro.
painter jacob lawrence who had grown up in crowded tenement districts of the urban north used bold shapes and vivid colors to portray the daily life aspirations and suppressed anger of african americans.
no one embodied the energy and optimism of the harlem renaissance more than zora neale hurston.
born in the prosperous black community of eatonville florida hurston had been surrounded as a child by examples of achievement though she struggled later with poverty and isolation.
in contrast to some other black thinkers hurston believed african american culture could be understood without heavy emphasis on the impact of white oppression.
after enrolling at barnard college and studying with anthropologist franz boas hurston traveled through the south and the caribbean for a decade documenting folklore songs and religious beliefs.
she incorporated this material into her short stories and novels celebrating the humor and spiritual strength of ordinary black men and women.

a native of new orleans armstrong learned his craft playing in the saloons and brothels of the citys vice district.
like tens of thousands of other african americans he moved north settling in chicago in 1922.
armstrong showed an inexhaustible capacity for melodic invention and his dazzling solos inspired other musicians.
by the late 1920s soloists became the celebrities of jazz thrilling audiences with their improvisational skill.

those who hailed primitive black music rarely suspended their racial condescension visiting a mixed race club became known as slumming the recording industry soon developed race records specifically aimed at urban working class blacks.
the breakthrough came in 1920 when otto k e heinemann a producer who sold immigrant records in yiddish swedish and other languages recorded singer mamie smith performing crazy blues this smash hit prompted big recording labels like columbia and paramount to copy heinemanns approach.

from boom to bust spurred by rapid expansion during the war american business thrived in the 1920s.
corporations expanded more and more into overseas markets while at home a national consumer culture emphasized leisure and fun.

meanwhile close observers worried over the rapid economic growth and easy credit that fueled the roaring twenties.

agriculture which still employed one fourth of all american workers never fully recovered from the postwar recession.
once europes economy revived its farmers flooded world markets with grain and other farm products causing agricultural prices to fall.
other industries including coal and textiles languished for similar reasons.
as a consequence many rural americans shared little of the decades prosperity.

in the excerpts below lewiss narrator describes the reactions of young urban carol kennicott wife of the towns new doctor and bea sorenson a swedish american farm girl.

anzia yezierska bread givers a child of jewish immigrants from eastern europe anzia yezierska grew up on the lower east side of new york city.
in her autobiographical novel bread givers 1925 yezierska described her arrival in the ohio town where she attended college.
before this new york was all of america to me.
but now i came to a town of quiet streets shaded with green trees.
no crowds no tenements.
no hurrying noise to beat the race of the hours.
only a leisured quietness whispered in the air peace.
each house had its own green grass in front its own free space all around and it faced the street with the calm security of being owned for generations and not rented by the month from a landlord.
in the early twilight it was like a picture out of fairyland to see people sitting on their porches lazily swinging in their hammocks or watering their own growing flowers.
so these are the real americans i thought thrilled by the lean straight bearing of the passers by.
they had none of that terrible fight for bread and rent that i always saw in the new york peoples eyes.
all the young people i had ever seen were shut up in factories.
but here were young girls and young men enjoying life free from the worry for a living.
the spick and span cleanliness of these people.
it smelled from them the soap and the bathing.
their fingernails so white and pink.
what a feast of happenings each day of college was to those other students.
societies dances letters from home packages of food midnight spreads and even birthday parties.
i never knew that there were people glad enough of life to celebrate the day they were born.

robert s lynd and helen merrell lynd locally are bought on time payment and a working man earning 35 00 a week frequently plans to use one weeks pay each month as payment for his car.
the automobile has apparently unsettled the habit of careful saving for some families.
ill go without food before ill see us give up the car said one woman emphatically.
many families feel that an automobile is justified as an agency holding the family group together.
but the fact that 348 boys and 382 girls in the three upper years of the high school placed use of the automobile fifth and fourth respectively in a list of twelve possible sources of disagreement between them and their parents suggests that this may be an increasing decentralizing agent.
if the automobile touches the rest of middletowns living at many points it has revolutionized its leisure.
making leisure time enjoyment a regularly expected part of every day and week rather than an occasional event.
the frequency of movie attendance of high school boys and girls is about equal business class families tend to go more often than do working class families and children of both groups attend more often without their parents than do all the individuals or combinations of family members put together.
it is probable that time formerly spent in lodges saloons and unions is now being spent in part at the movies at least occasionally with other members of the family.
like the automobile and radio the movies break up leisure time into an individual family or small group affair.

middletown in 1929 sociologists robert s lynd and helen merrell lynd published middletown a study of life in a small midwestern city.
middletown was not a single community but a composite of several communities studied by the lynds.
the first real automobile appeared in middletown in 1900.
at the close of 1923 there were 6 221 passenger cars in the city one for every 6 1 persons or roughly two for every three families.
as at the turn of the century business class people began to feel apologetic if they did not have a telephone so ownership of an automobile has now reached the point of being an accepted essential of normal living.
according to an officer of a middletown automobile financing company 75 to 90 percent of the cars purchased questions for analysis 1.

in times of crisis some families sold their furniture starting with pianos and phonographs and continuing if necessary to dining tables and beds.
in the los angeles suburb of south gate white working class men secured jobs in the steel and automobile industries but prices were high and families often found it difficult to make ends meet.
self help was the watchword as families bartered with neighbors and used their yards to raise vegetables rabbits and chickens.

this created risks not only for buyers but for the whole economy.

thousands of young women followed the lead of actress clara bow hollywoods famous flapper who flaunted her boyish figure.
decked out in knee length skirts flappers shocked the older generation by smoking and wearing makeup.
flappers represented only a tiny minority of women but thanks to the movies and advertising they became influential symbols of womens sexual and social emancipation.
in cities young immigrant women eagerly bought makeup and the latest flapper fashions and went dancing to jazz.
jazz stars helped popularize the style among working class african americans.
mexican american teenagers joined the trend though they usually found themselves under the watchful eyes of la duea the chaperone.
politicians quickly grasped the publicity value of american radio and film to foreign relations.
in 1919 with government support general electric spearheaded the creation of radio corporation of america rca to expand u s presence in foreign radio markets.
rca which had a federal appointee on its board of directors emerged as a major provider of radio transmission in latin america and east asia.
meanwhile by 1925 american films made up 95 percent of the movies screened in britain 80 percent in latin america and 70 percent in france america compared p 727.

working class europeans in particular preferred hollywoods offerings to the films produced in europe.
in this 1928 article from a cinematography journal german expressionist filmmaker erich pommer suggested new strategies for expanding an audience for european films.
expressionists influenced by romanticism and modernism explored dark themes such as spiritual crisis and insanity.
a famous example of expressionist painting is edvard munchs the scream.
pommer worked for american studios and later fled to the united states after the rise of hitler.
the towering importance of the american motion picture on the worlds markets cannot be safely explained by the unlimited financial resources at the disposal of the american producers.
its main reason is the mentality of the american picture which notwithstanding all attacks and claims to the contrary apparently comes nearest to the taste of international cinema audiences.
the specific and unique element of the american film is the fact of its being absolutely uncomplicated.
being what is called nave it knows no problems.
universal appeal.
it is really preferable to have a picture too light rather than too heavy because in the latter case there is a danger that the public will not understand the story.
this is the worst thing that can happen with a picture.
spectacular appeal.
the international appeal of a picture has its foundation in a story.
it is totally independent of the capital invested and of the splendor and luxury used in its production.
the fact that in most cases the supers and monumental pictures have proved to be such international successes does not disprove this claim.
other market players compounded risk by purchasing on margin.
an investor might for example spend 20 of his own money and borrow 80 to buy a 100 share of stock expecting to pay back the loan as the stock rose quickly in value.
this worked as long as the economy grew and the stock market climbed.
but those conditions did not last.
yet when the stock market fell in a series of plunges between october 25 and november 13 1929 few onlookers understood the magnitude of the crisis.
cyclical downturns had been a familiar part of the industrializing economy since the panic of the 1830s they tended to follow periods of rapid growth and speculation.
a sharp recent recession in 1921 had not such productions always have a simple story of universal appeal because it is simply impossible to use spiritual thoughts and impressions of the soul in a picture deluxe.

but splendour means show and a show is always and everywhere easy to understand.

the great depression threw millions of people out of work by 1933 one in four american workers was unemployed and the rate remained high until 1941 when the nation mobilized for world war ii.
vicious cycle of falling demand and forfeited loans.
in late 1930 several major banks went under victims of overextended credit and reckless management.
the following year as industrial production slowed a much larger wave of bank failures occurred causing an even greater shock.
since the government did not insure bank deposits accounts in failed banks simply vanished.
some people who had had steady jobs and comfortable savings found themselves broke and out of work.
not all americans were devastated by the depression the middle class did not disappear and the rich lived in accustomed luxury.
but incomes plummeted even among workers who kept their jobs.
salt lake city went bankrupt in 1931.
barter systems developed as barbers traded haircuts for onions and potatoes and laborers worked for payment in eggs or pork.
we do not dare to use even a little soap reported one jobless oregonian when it will pay for an extra egg a few more carrots for our children i would be only too glad to dig ditches to keep my family from going hungry wrote a north carolina man.
where did desperate people turn for aid.
their first hope lay in private charity especially churches and synagogues.
but by the winter of 1931 these institutions were overwhelmed unable to keep pace with the extraordinary need.
only eight states provided even minimal unemployment insurance.
there was no public support for the elderly statistically among the poorest citizens.
few americans had any retirement savings and many who had saved watched their accounts erased by failing banks.
even those who were not wiped out had to adapt to depression conditions.
couples delayed marriage and reduced the number of children they conceived.
as a result the marriage rate fell to a historical low and by 1933 the birthrate dropped from 97 births per 1 000 women to 75.
often the responsibility for birth control fell to women.
it was one of the worst problems of women whose husbands were out of work a californian told a reporter.
campaigns against hiring married women were common on the theory that available jobs should go to male breadwinners.

despite restrictions female employment increased as women expanded their financial contributions to their families in hard times.
the depression crossed regional boundaries though its severity varied from place to place.
bank failures clustered heavily in the midwest and plains while areas dependent on timber mining and other extractive industries suffered catastrophic declines.
although southern states endured less unemployment because of their smaller manufacturing base farm wages plunged.
in many parts of the country unemployment rates among black men stood at double that of white men joblessness among african american women was triple that of white women.
by 1932 comprehending the magnitude of the crisis americans went to the ballot box and decisively rejected the probusiness antiregulatory policies of the 1920s.
a few years earlier with business booming politics had been so placid that people chuckled when president coolidge disappeared on extended fishing trips.
now americans wanted bold action in washington.
faced with the cataclysm of the great depression americans would transform their government and create a modern welfare state.
summary although involvement in world war i strengthened the united states economically and diplomatically it left the nation profoundly unsettled.
racial tensions exploded after the war as african americans pursued new opportunities and asserted their rights.
meanwhile labor unrest grew as employers cut wages and sought to break unions.
labors power declined sharply in the wars aftermath while anxieties over radicalism and immigration prompted a nationwide red scare.
the politics of the 1920s brought a backlash against prewar progressivism.
the agenda of women reformers met very limited success.
republican administrations pursued probusiness normalcy at home and dollar diplomacy abroad.
prohibition and the scopes trial demonstrated the influence religion could exert on public policy while rising nativism fueled a resurgent ku klux klan and led to sweeping new restrictions on immigration.
postwar alienation found artistic expression in new forms of modernism which denounced the dehumanizing effects of war and criticized american materialism and hypocrisy.

only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment roosevelt his demeanor sincere and purposeful saw both despair and determination as he looked out over the country.
this nation asks for action and action now from congress he would request broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe with these words roosevelt launched a program of federal activism which he called the new deal that would change the nature of american government.
the new deal represented a new form of liberalism a fresh interpretation of the ideology of individual rights that had long shaped the character of american society and politics.
classical nineteenth century liberals believed that to protect those rights government should be small and relatively weak.
however the regulatory liberals of the early twentieth century had safeguarded individual freedom and opportunity by strengthening state and federal control over large businesses and monopolies.
new deal activists went much further their social welfare liberalism expanded individual rights to include economic security.
beginning in the 1930s and continuing through the 1960s they increased the responsibility of the national government for the welfare of ordinary citizens.
their efforts did not go unchallenged.
conservative critics of the new deal charged that its big government programs were paternalistic and dangerous undermining individual responsibility and constraining personal freedom.

before roosevelt was elected president between the onset of the depression in 1929 and november 1932 the dark realities of the moment wore down american society.
rising unemployment shuttered businesses failing banks and home foreclosures tore at the nations social fabric.
as crisis piled upon crisis and the federal governments initiatives under president hoover proved ineffectual americans had to reconsider more than the role of government in economic life they had to rethink many of the principles of individualism and free enterprise that had guided so much of the nations history.

this system had worked fairly well for a few decades but it was vulnerable during economic downturns when large financiers withdrew their investments and demanded gold payments.
the gold standard rendered the international monetary system inflexible at a moment that required great flexibility in global finance.
enter herbert hoover president herbert hoover and congress responded to the downturn by drawing on two powerful american traditions.
the first was the belief that economic outcomes were the product of individual character.
peoples fate was in their own hands and success went to those who deserved it.
the second place events tradition held that through volunin context tary action the business commuwhat economic principles nity could right itself and recover guided president hoover from economic downturns withand congress in their out relying on government assisresponse to the great tance.
following these principles depression.
hoover asked americans to tighten their belts and work hard.
after the stock market crash he cut federal taxes in an attempt to boost private spending and corporate investment.
any lack of confidence in the economic future or the strength of business in the united states is foolish hoover assured the country in late 1929.
treasury secretary andrew mellon suggested that the downturn would help americans work harder and live a more moral life while many factors caused the great depression hoovers adherence to the gold standard was a major reason for its length and severity in the united states.
faced with economic catastrophe both britain and germany abandoned the gold standard in 1931 when they did so their economies recovered modestly.
but the hoover administration feared that such a move would weaken the value of the dollar.
in reality an inflexible money supply discouraged investment and therefore prevented growth.
the roosevelt administration would ultimately remove the united states from the burdens of the gold standard in 1933.
by that time however the crisis had achieved catastrophic dimensions.
billions had been lost in business and bank failures and the economy had stalled completely.
along with their adherence to the gold standard the hoover administration and many congressional republicans believed in another piece of economic orthodoxy that had protected american manufacturing in good economic times but that proved damaging during the downturn high tariffs taxes on imported goods designed to encourage american manufacturing.
in 1930 republicans enacted the smoot hawley tariff.
despite receiving a letter from more than a thousand economists urging him to veto it hoover approved the legislation.
what served american interests in earlier eras now confounded them.
smoothawley triggered retaliatory tariffs in other countries which further hindered global trade and led to greater economic contraction throughout the industrialized world.
the president recognized that individual initiative voluntarism and high tariffs might not be enough given the depth of the crisis so he proposed government action as well.
he called on state and local governments to provide jobs by investing in public projects.
and in 1931 he secured an unprecedented increase of 700 million in federal spending for public works.
hoovers most innovative program was the reconstruction finance corporation rfc which provided federal loans to railroads banks and other businesses.
but the rfc lent money too cautiously and by the end of 1932 after a year in operation it had loaned out only 20 percent of its 1 5 billion in funds.
america c o m pa r e d the great depression in england and the united states in a 1954 book denis brogan a professor at cambridge university in england looked back at the descent into the great depression between 1929 and 1932 and explained the significance of franklin roosevelts election from an english perspective.

has so colored the european view of the united states as the depression the first news of the crash of 1929 was not ill received.
there was not only a marked feeling of schadenfreude at the snub that destiny had given to the overconfident masters of the new world but also a widespread belief that the extravagant gambling of the new york market was one of the chief causes of our ills.
but as the extent depth and duration of the american depression began to be appreciated as its impact on all the world especially on the dangerously unstable political and economic status quo of germany and austria became more evident as the old wound of unemployment was made to bleed more deeply in britain the tendency to blame the united states became overwhelming.
gone were the illusions about the secret of high wages if ever found it had now been lost.
american politics was seen as not only sterile but positively immoral and dangerous.
american business and its political arm the republican party had been tried in the balance and found wanting.
and it is safe to say that the election of f d roosevelt was welcomed in every country of europe as good news almost overshadowing the nomination of adolf hitler as chancellor of the german reich.
most of the unemployed were genuinely seeking work.
a heavy snowfall was a blessing when men with broken boots earned a little money by sweeping the streets.
the boroughs a form of local administration in london took on unemployed in strict rotation for thirteen weeks of unskilled work.
it sometimes put a man back in benefit and took him off the hated dole.
the situation began to change after munich when more men found work.
salvation came with the war when the despised unemployed became valued workers or serving helpers.
like most federal initiatives under hoover the rfc was not nearly aggressive enough given the severity of the depression.
with federal officials fearing budget deficits and reluctant to interfere with the private market caution was the order of the day.
few chief executives could have survived the downward economic spiral of 1929 1932 but hoovers reluctance to break with the philosophy of limited government and his insistence that recovery was always just around the corner contributed to his unpopularity.

how does the testimony of gladys gibson about the hated dole compare with what you have learned about attitudes in the united states in these years.
by 1932 americans perceived hoover as insensitive to the depth of the countrys economic suffering.
the nation had come a long way since the depressions of the 1870s and 1890s when no one except the most radical figures such as jacob coxey called for direct federal aid to the unemployed chapter 20.

to protest low prices for their goods in the spring of 1932 thousands of midwestern farmers joined the farmers holiday association which cut off supplies to urban areas by barricading roads and dumping milk vegetables and other foodstuffs onto the roadways.
agricultural prices were so low that the farmers holiday association favored a government supported farm program.
in the industrial sector layoffs and wage cuts led to violent strikes.
when coal miners in harlan county kentucky went on strike over a 10 percent wage cut in 1931 the mine owners called in the states national guard which crushed the union.

when newsreel footage showing the u s army attacking and injuring veterans reached movie theaters across the nation hoovers popularity plunged.
in another measure of how the country had changed since the 1890s what americans had applauded when done to coxey in 1894 was condemned in 1932.
the 1932 election despite rising discontent the national mood was mixed as the 1932 election approached.
many americans had internalized the ideal of the self made man and blamed themselves for their economic hardships.
despair not anger characterized their mood.
others out of work for a year or more perhaps homeless felt the deeper stirrings of frustration and rage.
regardless of their circumstances most americans believed that something altogether new had to be tried whatever that might be.
the republicans reluctant to dump an incumbent president unenthusiastically renominated hoover.
the democrats turned to new york governor franklin delano roosevelt whose state had initiated innovative relief and unemployment programs.

then in 1921 a crippling attack of polio left both of his legs permanently paralyzed.
supported by his wife eleanor he slowly returned to public life and campaigned successfully for the governorship of new york in 1928 and again in 1930.
running for the presidency in 1932 roosevelt pledged vigorous action but gave no indication what that action might be arguing simply that the country needs and unless i mistake its temper the country demands bold persistent experimentation he won easily receiving 22 8 million votes to hoovers 15 7 million.
elected in november roosevelt would not begin his presidency until march 1933.
the twentieth amendment ratified in 1933 set subsequent inaugurations for january 20.
meanwhile americans suffered through the worst winter of the depression.
unemployment continued to climb and in three major industrial cities in ohio it shot to staggering levels 50 percent in cleveland 60 percent in akron and 80 percent in toledo.
private charities and public relief agencies reached only a fraction of the needy.
the nations banking system was so close to collapse that many state governors closed banks temporarily to avoid further withdrawals.
several states were approaching bankruptcy their tax revenues too low to pay for basic services.
by march 1933 the nation had hit rock bottom.
part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 the new deal arrives 1933 1935 the ideological differences between herbert hoover and franklin roosevelt were not vast.
both leaders wished to maintain the nations economic institutions and social values to save capitalism while easing its worst downturns.
both believed in a balanced government budget and extolled the values of hard work cooperation and sacrifice.
but roosevelts personal charm political savvy and willingness to experiment made him far more effective and more popular than hoover.
most americans felt a kinship with their new president calling him simply fdr.
his new deal would put people to work and restore hope for the nations future.
roosevelt and the first hundred days a wealthy patrician roosevelt was an unlikely figure to inspire millions of ordinary americans.
but his close rapport with the american people was critical to his political success.
more than 450 000 letters poured into the explain white house in the week after his consequences inauguration.
the presidents what specific new roles masterful use of the new medium did the american governof radio especially his evening ment take up as a result of the legislation passed radio addresses to the american during the first hundred public known as fireside chats days.
made him an intimate presence in peoples lives.
thousands of citizens felt a personal relationship with fdr saying he gave me a job or he saved my home american voices p 742.
citing the national economic emergency roosevelt further expanded the presidential powers that theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson had increased previously.
to draft legislation and policy he relied heavily on financier bernard baruch and a brains trust of professors from columbia harvard and other leading universities.
roosevelt also turned to his talented cabinet which included harold l ickes secretary of the interior frances perkins at the labor department henry a wallace at agriculture and henry morgenthau jr secretary of the treasury.
these intellectuals and administrators attracted hundreds of highly qualified recruits to washington.
inspired by new deal idealism many of them would devote their lives to public service and the principles of social welfare liberalism.
roosevelt could have done little however without a sympathetic congress.
the 1932 election had swept democratic majorities into both the house and senate giving the new president the lawmaking allies he needed.
the first months of fdrs administration produced a whirlwind of activity on capitol hill.
in a legendary session known as the hundred days congress enacted fifteen major bills that focused primarily on four problems banking failures agricultural overproduction the business slump and soaring unemployment.
derided by some as an alphabet soup because of their many abbreviations ccc wpa aaa etc.
the new policies and agencies were more than bureaucracies they represented the emergence of a new american state.
banking reform the weak banking system hobbled the entire economy curtailing consumer spending and business investment.
widespread bank failures had reduced the savings of nearly nine million families and panicked account holders raced to withdraw their funds.
on march 5 1933 the day after his inauguration fdr declared a national bank holiday closing all the banks and called congress into special session.
four days later congress passed the emergency banking act which permitted banks to reopen if a treasury department inspection showed that they had sufficient cash reserves.
in his first sunday night fireside chat to a radio audience of sixty million the president reassured citizens that their money was safe.
when the banks reopened on march 13 calm prevailed and deposits exceeded withdrawals restoring stability to the nations basic financial institutions.
capitalism was saved in eight days quipped roosevelts advisor raymond moley.
four thousand banks had collapsed in the months prior to roosevelts inauguration only sixtyone closed their doors in all of 1934 table 23 1.
a second banking law the glass steagall act further restored public confidence by creating the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which insured deposits up to 2 500 and now insures them up to 250 000.
the act also prohibited banks from making risky unsecured investments with the deposits of ordinary people.
and in a profoundly important economic and symbolic gesture roosevelt removed the u s treasury from the gold standard in june 1933 which allowed the federal reserve to lower interest rates since 1931 it had been raising rates which had only deepened the downturn.
saving the banks and leaving the gold standard led to a mild and it would turn out brief recovery.

agriculture and manufacturing roosevelt and the new deal congress next turned to agriculture and manufacturing.
in those sectors a seeming paradox was evident the depression led to overproduction in agriculture and underproduction in manufacturing.
reversing both problematic trends was critical.
the agricultural adjustment act aaa began direct governmental regulation of the farm economy for the first time.
to solve the problem of overproduction which lowered prices the aaa provided cash subsidies to farmers who cut production of seven major commodities wheat cotton corn hogs rice tobacco and dairy products.
policymakers hoped that farm prices would rise as production fell.
by dumping cash in farmers hands the aaa briefly stabilized the farm economy.
but the acts benefits were not evenly distributed.
subsidies went primarily to the owners of large and medium sized farms who often cut production by reducing the amount of land they rented to tenants and sharecroppers.
in mississippi one plantation owner received 26 000 from the federal government while thousands of black sharecroppers living in the same county received only a few dollars in relief payments.
in manufacturing the new deal attacked declining production with the national industrial recovery act.
a new government agency the national recovery administration nra set up separate self governing private associations in six hundred industries.
each industry ranging from large corporations producing coal cotton textiles and steel to small businesses making pet food and costume jewelry regulated itself by agreeing on prices and production quotas.
because large companies usually ran these associations the nra solidified their power at the expense of smaller enterprises and consumer interests.
the aaa and the nra were designed to rescue the nations productive industries and stabilize the economy.
the measures had positive effects in some regions but most historians agree that overall they did little to end the depression.
unemployment relief the roosevelt administration next addressed the massive unemployment problem.
by 1933 local governments and private charities had exhausted their resources and were looking to washington for assistance.
although roosevelt wanted to avoid a budget deficit he asked congress to provide relief for millions of unemployed americans.
in may congress established the federal emergency relief administration fera.
directed by harry hopkins a hard driving social worker from new york the fera provided federal funds for state relief programs.
roosevelt and hopkins had strong reservations about the dole the nickname for government welfare payments.
as hopkins put it i dont think anybody can go year after year month after month accepting relief without affecting his character to support the traditional values of individualism the new deal put people to work.
early in 1933 congress established the public works administration pwa a construction program and several months later roosevelt created the civil works administration cwa and named hopkins its head.
within thirty days hopkins had put 2 6 million men and women to work at its peak in 1934 the cwa provided jobs for 4 million americans repairing bridges building highways and constructing public buildings.
a stopgap measure to get the country through the winter of 1933 1934 the cwa lapsed in the spring when republican opposition compelled new dealers to abandon it.
a longer term program the civilian conservation corps ccc mobilized american voices ordinary people respond to the new deal franklin roosevelts fireside chats and his relief programs prompted thousands of ordinary americans to write directly to the president and his wife eleanor.
taken together their letters offer a vivid portrait of depression era america that includes popular support for and opposition to the new deal.

june 14 1934 dear mrs roosevelt i know you are overburdened with requests for help and if my plea cannot be recognized ill understand it is because you have so many others all of them worthy.
my husband and i are a young couple of very simple almost poor families.
we married eight years ago on the proverbial shoe string but with a wealth of love.
we managed to build our home and furnish it comfortably.
then came the depression.

my salary could continue to keep us going but i am to have a baby.
i can get a leave of absence from my job for a year.
but cant you wont you do something so my husband can have a job at least during that year.
as i said before if it were only ourselves or if there were something we could do about it we would never ask for help.
we have always stood on our own feet and been proud and happy.
but you are a mother and youll understand this crisis.
very sincerely yours mrs m h a unsigned letter this unsigned letter came from a factory worker in paris texas.
november 23 1936 dear president n ow that we have had a land slide in the election of 1936 and done just what was best for our country.
i do believe you will strain a point to help the ones who helped you mostly that is the working class of people i am not smart or i would be in a different line of work better up in ever way yet i will know you are the one only president that ever helped a working class of people.
i am a white man american age 47 married wife 2children in high school am a finishing room foreman i mean a working foreman am in a furniture factory here in paris texas where thaire is 175 to 200 working when the nra national recovery administration came in i was proud to see my fellow workmen rec 30 per hour in place of 8 cents to 20 cents per hour.
i cant see for my life president why a man must toil work his life out in such factories 10 long hours ever day except sunday for a small sum of 15 cents to 35 cents per hour pay the high cost of honest deason living expences.
please see if something can be done to help this one class of working people the factories are a man killer not venelated or kept up just a bunch of republickins grafters 90 100 of them please help us some way i pray to god for relief.
i am a christian.
and a truthful man have not told you wrong am for you to the end.
not signed r a r a was sixty nine years old and an architect and builder in lincoln nebraska.
may 19 34 dear mrs roosevelt in the presidents inaugral address delivered from the capitol steps the afternoon of his inaugration he made mention of the forgotten man and i with thousands of others am wondering if the folk who was borned here in america some 60 or 70 years a go are this forgotten man the president had in mind if we are this forgotten man then we are still forgotten.
we who have tried to be diligent in our support of this most wonderful nation of ours boath social and other wise we in our younger days tried to do our duty without complaining.
and now a great calamity has come upon us and seemingly no cause of our own it has swept away what little savings we had accumulated and we are left in a condition that is imposible for us to correct for two very prominent reasons if no more.
first we have grown to what is termed old age this befalls every man.
we are confronted on every hand with the young generation taking our places this of corse is what we have looked forward to in training our children.
but with the extra ordinary crisese which left us helpless and placed us in the position that our fathers did not have to contend with.
we have been honorable citizens all along our journey calamity and old age has forced its self upon us please do not send us to the poor farm but instead allow us the small pension of 40 00 per month.
mrs roosevelt i am asking a personal favor of you as it seems to be the only means through which i may be able to reach the president some evening very soon as you and mr roosevelt are having dinner together privately will you ask him to read this.
and we american citizens will ever remember your kindness.
yours very truly.
r a m a m a was a woman who held a low level salaried position in a corporation.
jan 18 1937 dear mrs roosevelt i.
was simply astounded to think that anyone could be nitwit enough to wish to be included in the so called social security act if they could possibly avoid it.
call it by any name you wish it in my opinion and that of many people i know it is nothing but downright stealing.
i am not an economic royalist just an ordinary white collar worker at 1600 per year about 23 600 in 2009.
please show this to the president and ask him to remember the wishes of the forgotten man that is the one who dared to vote against him.
we expect to be tramped on but we do wish the stepping would be a little less hard.
security at the price of freedom is never desired by intelligent people.
m a m a h m a h was a widow who ran a small farm in columbus indiana.
december 14 1937 mrs roosevelt i suppose from your point of view the work relief old age pensions slum clearance and all the rest seems like a perfect remedy for all the ills of this country but i would like for you to see the results as the other half see them.
we have always had a shiftless never do well class of people whose one and only aim in life is to live without work.
i have been rubbing elbows with this class for nearly sixty years and have tried to help some of the most promising and have seen others try to help them but it cant be done.
we cannot help those who will not try to help themselves and if they do try a square deal is all they need.
let each one paddle their own canoe or sink.
i live alone on a farm and have not raised any crops for the last two years as there was no help to be had.
i am feeding the stock and have been cutting the wood to keep my home fires burning.
there are several reliefers around here now who have been kicked off relief but they refuse to work unless they can get relief hours and wages but they are so worthless no one can afford to hire them.
they are just a fair sample of the class of people on whom so much of our hard earned tax money is being squandered and on whom so much sympathy is being wasted.
you people who have plenty of this worlds goods and whose money comes easy have no idea of the heart breaking toil and self denial which is the lot of the working people who are trying to make an honest living and then to have to shoulder all these unjust burdens seems like the last straw.
no one should have the right to vote theirself a living at the expense of the tax payers.

housing crisis millions of americans also faced the devastating prospect of losing their homes.
the economic expansion of the 1920s had produced the largest inflationary housing bubble in american history to that point a scenario in which home prices rose wildly fueled by excessive borrowing.
in the early 1930s as home prices collapsed and banks closed home owners were dragged down with them.
more than half a million americans lost their homes between 1930 and 1932 and in cities such as cleveland and indianapolis half of all home mortgage holders faced possible foreclosure.
in response congress created the home owners loan corporation holc to refinance home mortgages.
in just two years the holc helped more than a million americans retain their homes.

the first camp opened in big meadows virginia in july 1933 and by the end of the decade ccc camps had appeared across the length of the country located in rural mountainous and forested regions alike.
young men constructed bridges and roads built hiking trails erected public campgrounds and performed other improvements.
by the early 1940s the ccc had planted three billion trees among its many other contributions to the national infrastructure.
and the subsequent housing act of 1937 permanently changed the mortgage system and set the foundation for the broad expansion of home ownership in the post world war ii decades chapter 25.
when an exhausted congress recessed in june 1933 at the end of the hundred days it had enacted roosevelts agenda banking reform recovery programs for agriculture and industry public works and unemployment relief.
few presidents had won the passage of so many measures in so short a time.
the new federal agencies were far from perfect and had their critics on both the radical left and the conservative right.
but the vigorous actions taken by roosevelt and congress had halted the downward economic spiral of the hoover years stabilized the financial sector and sent a message of hope from the nations political leaders.
for all that however the new deal did not break the grip of the depression.
the new deal under attack as new dealers waited anxiously for the economy to revive roosevelt turned his attention to the reform of wall street where reckless speculation and overleveraged buying of stocks had helped trigger the financial panic of 1929.
in 1934 congress established the securities and exchange commission sec to regulate the stock market.
the commission had broad powers to determine how stocks and bonds were sold to the public to set rules for margin credit transactions and to prevent stock sales by those with inside information about corporate plans.
the banking act of 1935 part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 authorized the president to appoint a new board of governors of the federal reserve system placing control of interest rates and other money market policies in a federal agency rather than in the hands of private bankers.
critics on the right such measures exposed the new deal to attack from economic conservatives also known as the political right.
a man of wealth roosevelt saw himself as the savior of american capitalism declaring simply to preserve we had to reform many bankers and business executives disagreed.
to them fdr became that man a traitor to his class.
in 1934 republican business leaders joined with conservative democrats in the liberty league to fight what they called the reckless spending and socialist reforms of the new deal.

in response to what many conservatives perceived as roosevelts antibusiness policies the nam promoted free enterprise and unfettered capitalism.
after world war ii the nam emerged as a staunch critic of liberalism and forged alliances with influential conservative politicians such as barry goldwater and ronald reagan.
for its part the supreme court repudiated several cornerstones of the early new deal.
in may 1935 in schechter v united states the court unanimously ruled the national industrial recovery act unconstitutional because it delegated congresss lawmaking power to the executive branch and extended federal authority to intrastate in contrast to interstate commerce.
roosevelt protested but watched helplessly as the court struck down more new deal legislation the agricultural adjustment act the railroad retirement act and a debt relief law known as the frazier lemke act.
critics on the populist left if business leaders and the supreme court thought that the new deal had gone too far other americans believed it had not gone far enough.
among these were public figures who in the tradition of american populism sought to place government on the side of ordinary citizens against father coughlin one of the foremost critics of the new deal was the radio priest father charles e coughlin.
coughlin believed that roosevelt and the democratic party had not gone far enough in their efforts to ensure the social welfare of all citizens.
for instance he and his organization the national union for social justice urged roosevelt to nationalize the banks.
coughlin whose radio audience reached 30 million at the height of his popularity was one of the most recognizable religious leaders in the country.
unfortunately his remarks in the early 1930s were often laced with anti semitism anti jewish sentiment.

chapter 23 managing the great depression forging the new deal 1929 1939 corporations and the wealthy.
francis townsend a doctor from long beach california spoke for the nations elderly most of whom had no pensions and feared poverty.
in 1933 townsend proposed the old age revolving pension plan which would give 200 a month about 3 300 today to citizens over the age of sixty.
to receive payments the elderly would have to retire and open their positions to younger workers.
townsend clubs sprang up across the country in support of the townsend plan mobilizing mass support for old age pensions.
the most direct political threat to roosevelt came from louisiana senator huey long.
as the democratic governor of louisiana from 1928 to 1932 the flamboyant long had achieved stunning popularity.
he increased taxes on corporations lowered the utility bills of consumers and built new highways hospitals and schools.
to push through these measures long seized almost dictatorial control of the state government.
now a u s senator long broke with the new deal in 1934 and like townsend established a national movement.
according to his share our wealth society inequalities in the distribution of wealth prohibited millions of ordinary families from buying goods which kept factories humming.
longs society advocated a tax of 100 percent on all income over 1 million and on all inheritances over 5 million.
he hoped that this populist program would carry him into the white house.
that prospect encouraged conservatives who hoped that a split between new dealers and populist reformers might return the republican party and its ideology of limited government and free enterprise to political power.
in fact roosevelt feared that townsend and long along with the popular radio priest father charles coughlin might join forces to form a third party.
he had to respond or risk the political unity of the countrys liberal forces map 23 3.
the second new deal and the redefining of liberalism 1935 1938 as attacks on the new deal increased roosevelt and his advisors moved politically to the left.
historians have labeled this shift in policy the second new deal.
roosevelt now openly criticized the money classes proudly stating we have earned the hatred of entrenched greed he also decisively countered the rising popularity of townsend coughlin and long by adopting parts of their programs.
the administrations revenue act of 1935 proposed a substantial tax increase on corporate profits and higher income and estate taxes on the wealthy.
when conservatives attacked this legislation as an attempt to soak the rich congress moderated its taxation rates.
but fdr was satisfied.
he had met the share our wealth societys proposal with a tax plan of his own.
the welfare state comes into being the revenue act symbolized the administrations new outlook.
unlike the first new deal which focused on economic recovery the second new deal emphasized social justice and the creation of a safety net the use of the federal government to assist working people and to provide compare and economic security for the old the contrast disabled and the unemployed.
how did the second new the resulting welfare state a deal differ from the first.
term applied to industrial democracies that adopted various government guaranteed social welfare programs fundamentally changed american society.
the wagner act and social security the first beneficiary of roosevelts second new deal was the labor movement.
section 7 a of the national industrial recovery act nira had given workers the right to organize unions producing a dramatic growth in rankand file militancy and leading to a strike wave in 1934.
when the supreme court voided the nira in 1935 labor unions called for new legislation that would allow workers to organize and bargain collectively with employers.
named for its sponsor senator robert f wagner of new york the wagner act 1935 upheld the right of industrial workers to join unions.
the act outlawed many practices that employers had used to suppress unions such as firing workers for organizing activities.
it also established the national labor relations board nlrb a federal agency with the authority to protect workers from employer coercion and to guarantee collective bargaining.
a second initiative the social security act of 1935 had an equally widespread impact.
other industrialized societies such as germany and britain had created national old age pension systems at the turn of the century but american reformers had failed to secure a similar program in the united states.
the townsend and long movements now pressed roosevelt to act giving political muscle to pension proponents within the administration.

some citizens expressed their discontent through popular movements and this map suggests the geography of discontent.
the industrial midwest witnessed union movements strikes and radio priest charles coughlins demands for social reform.
simultaneously farmers movements tenants in the south smallholders in the agricultural midwest engaged in strikes and dumping campaigns and rallied behind the ideas of progressives in wisconsin and huey long in the south.
protests took diverse forms in california which was home to strikes by farmworkers women and in san francisco all wageworkers.
the west was also the seedbed of two important reform proposals upton sinclairs end poverty in california epic movement and francis townsends old age revolving pension clubs.
concerned about the fate of fatherless families also pressured the president.
the resulting social security act had three main provisions old age pensions for workers a joint federal state system of compensation for unemployed workers and a program of payments to widowed mothers and the blind deaf and disabled.
roosevelt however limited the reach of the legislation.
knowing that compulsory pension and unemployment legislation alone would be controversial he dropped a provision for national health insurance fearing it would doom the entire bill.
the social security act was a milestone in the creation of an american welfare state.
never before had the federal government assumed such responsibility for the well being of so many citizens.
social security as old age pensions were known became one of the most popular government programs in american history.
on the other hand the assistance program for widows and children known as aid to dependent children adc became one of its most controversial measures.
adc covered only 700 000 youngsters in 1939 by 1994 its successor aid to chapter 23 managing the great depression forging the new deal 1929 1939 united auto workers strike trade unions were among the most active and vocal organizations of the 1930s.
organized labor led a number of major strikes between 1934 and 1936 in various industries.
none was more important to the future of trade unions than the sit down strikes at major automobile plants including general motors and chevrolet in flint michigan in 1936 and 1937.
these strikes in which workers stopped the assembly lines but refused to leave the factories compelled gm to recognize the united auto workers uaw which became one of the strongest trade unions in american history.

families with dependent children afdc enrolled 14 1 million americans.
a minor program during the new deal afdc grew enormously in the 1960s and remained an often maligned cornerstone of the welfare state until it was eliminated under president clinton in 1996.
new deal liberalism the second new deal created what historians call new deal liberalism.
classical liberalism held individual liberty to be the foundation of a democratic society and the word liberal had traditionally denoted support for freemarket policies and weak government.
roosevelt and his advisors along with intellectuals such as british economist john maynard keynes disagreed.
they countered that to preserve individual liberty government must assist the needy and guarantee the basic welfare of citizens.
this liberal welfare state was opposed by inheritors of the nineteenth century ideology of laissez faire capitalism who gradually became known as conservatives.
these two visions of liberty and government with liberals on one side and conservatives on the other would shape american politics for the next half century.
from reform to stalemate roosevelts first term had seen an extraordinary expansion of the federal state.
the great burst of government action between 1933 and 1935 was unequaled in the nations history though congress and president lyndon johnson nearly matched it in 1965 1966 see chapter 28.
roosevelts second term however was characterized by a series of political entanglements and economic bad news that stifled further reform.
the 1936 election fdr was never enthusiastic about public relief programs.
but with the election of 1936 on the horizon and 10 million americans still out of work he won funding for the works progress administration wpa.
under the energetic direction of harry hopkins the wpa employed 8 5 million americans between 1935 when it was established and 1943.
the agencys workers constructed or repaired 651 087 miles of road 124 087 bridges 125 110 public buildings 8 192 parks and 853 airports.
but although the wpa was an extravagant operation by 1930s standards it reached only about one third of the nations unemployed.
part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 as the 1936 election approached new voters joined the democratic party.
many had personally benefitted from new deal programs such as the wpa or knew people who had table 23 2.
one was jack reagan a down on his luck shoe salesman and the father of future president ronald reagan who took a job as a federal relief administrator in dixon illinois and became a strong supporter of the new deal.

he also commanded the support of intellectuals and progressive republicans.
with difficulty the democrats held on to the votes of their white southern constituency as well.
republicans recognized that the new deal was too popular to oppose directly so they chose as their candidate the progressive governor of kansas alfred m landon.
landon accepted the legitimacy of many new deal programs but criticized their inefficiency and expense.
he also pointed to authoritarian regimes in italy and germany and hinted that fdr harbored similar dictatorial ambitions.
these charges fell on deaf ears.
roosevelts victory in 1936 was one of the most lopsided in american history.
the assassination of huey long by a louisiana political rival in september 1935 had eliminated the threat of a serious third party challenge.
roosevelt received 60 percent of the popular vote and carried every state except maine and vermont.
organized labor in particular mobilized on behalf of fdr donating money canvassing door to door and registering hundreds of thousands of new voters.
the new republic a liberal publication boasted that it was the greatest revolution in our political history i see one third of a nation ill housed ill clad illnourished the president declared in his second inaugural address in january 1937.
but any hopes that fdr had for expanding the liberal welfare state were quickly dashed.
within a year staunch opposition to roosevelts initiatives arose in congress and a sharp recession undermined confidence in his economic leadership.
court battle and economic recession roosevelts first setback in 1937 came when he surprised the nation by asking for fundamental changes to the supreme court.
in 1935 the court had struck down a series of new deal measures by the narrow margin of 5 to 4.
with the wagner act the tennessee valley authority and social security all slated to come before the court the future of the new deal rested in the hands of a few elderly conservative minded judges.
to diminish their influence the president proposed adding a new justice to the court for every member over the age of seventy a scheme that would have brought six new judges to the bench at the time the legislation was proposed.
roosevelts opponents protested that he was trying to pack the court.
after a bitter months long debate congress rejected this blatant attempt to alter the judiciary to the presidents advantage.
chapter 23 managing the great depression forging the new deal 1929 1939 if roosevelt lost the battle he went on to win the war.
swayed in part by the presidents overwhelming electoral victory in the 1936 election the court upheld the wagner and social security acts.
moreover a series of timely resignations allowed roosevelt to reshape the supreme court after all.
his new appointees who included the liberal leaning and generally pro new deal hugo black felix frankfurter and william o douglas viewed the constitution as a living document that had to be interpreted in the light of present conditions.
the so called roosevelt recession of 1937 1938 dealt another blow to the president.
from 1933 to 1937 gross domestic product had grown at a yearly rate of about 10 percent bringing industrial output back to 1929 levels.
unemployment had declined from 25 percent to 14 percent.
the emergency has passed declared senator james f byrnes of south carolina.
acting on this assumption roosevelt slashed the federal budget.
following the presidents lead congress cut the wpas funding in half causing layoffs of about 1 5 million workers and the federal reserve fearing inflation raised interest rates.
these measures halted recovery.
the stock market responded by dropping sharply and unemployment jumped to 19 percent.
quickly reversing course roosevelt began once again to spend his way out of the recession by boosting funding for the wpa and resuming public works projects.
although improvised this spending program accorded with the theories of john maynard keynes a visionary british economist.
keynes transformed economic thinking in capitalist societies in the 1920s by arguing that government intervention could smooth out the highs and lows of the business cycle through deficit spending and the manipulation of interest rates which determined the money supply.
this view was sharply criticized by republicans and conservative democrats in the 1930s who disliked government intervention in the economy.
but keynesian economics gradually won wider acceptance as world war ii defense spending finally ended the great depression.
a reformer rather than a revolutionary roosevelt had preserved capitalism and liberal individualism even as he transformed them in significant ways.
at the same time conservatives had reclaimed a measure of power in congress and those who believed the new deal had created an intrusive federal bureaucracy kept reform in check after 1937.
throughout roosevelts second term a conservative coalition of southern democrats rural republicans and industrial interests in both parties worked to block or impede social legislation.
by 1939 the era of change was over.
the new deals impact on society whatever its limits the new deal had a tremendous impact.
its ideology of social welfare liberalism fundamentally altered americans relationship to their government and provided assistance to a wide range of ordinary people the unemployed the elderly workers and the poor.
in doing so new dealers created a sizable federal bureaucracy the number of civilian federal employees increased by 80 percent between 1929 and 1940 reaching a total of 1 million.
the expenditures and deficits of the federal government grew at an even faster rate.
in 1930 the hoover administration spent 3 1 billion and had a surplus of almost 1 billion in 1939 new dealers expended 9 4 billion and ran a deficit of nearly 3 billion still small by later standards.
but the new deal represented more than figures on a balance sheet.
across the country the new era in government inspired democratic visions among ordinary citizens thinking like a historian p 752.
a peoples democracy in 1939 writer john la touche and musician earl robinson produced ballad for americans a patriotic song it called for uniting everybody whos nobody.
irish negro jewish italian french and english spanish russian chinese polish scotch hungarian litvak swedish finnish canadian greek and turk and czech and double czech american the song captured the democratic aspirations that the new deal had awakened.
millions of ordinary people believed that the nation could and should become more egalitarian.
influenced by the liberal spirit of the new deal americans from all walks of life seized the opportunity to push for change in the nations social and political institutions.
organized labor demoralized and shrinking during the 1920s labor unions increased their numbers and clout during the new deal thanks to the wagner act.
the era of privilege and predatory individuals is over labor leader john l lewis declared.
by the end of the decade the number of unionized workers had tripled to 23 percent of the nonagricultural workforce.
a new union movement led by the congress of industrial organizations cio promoted industrial unionism organizing all the workers in an industry from skilled machinists to unskilled janitors into a single union.
the american federation of labor afl thinking like a historian the new deal and public works more than half a dozen new deal programs were devoted to building up the physical and cultural infrastructure of the country.
the former included roads bridges dams trails and national parks.
the latter included artwork murals plays and other forms of literary expression.
examine the following documents and use them collectively to analyze the new deals relationship to infrastructure art culture and politics.

to most in this town and i guess its not much different in this than any other new england place wpas just a racket set up to give a bunch of loafers and drunks steady pay to indulge in their vices.
they dont stop to consider that on wpa are men and women who have traveled places and seen things been educated and found their jobs folded up and nothing to replace them with.

i believe in the great potentialities for well being of the machine and technology and science and though they do hold a real threat of enslavement and frustration for the human spirit i believe those dangers can be averted.
i believe that through the practice of democracy the world of technology holds out the greatest opportunity in all history for the development of the individual according to his own talents aspirations and willingness to carry the responsibilities of a free man.
such are the things that have happened in the tennessee valley.
here men and science and organizational skills applied to the resources of waters land forests and minerals have yielded great benefits for the people.
and it is just such fruits of technology and resources that people all over the world will more and more demand for themselves.

both federations dramatically increased their membership in the second half of the 1930s.
labors new vitality translated into political action and a long lasting alliance with the democratic party.
the cio helped fund democratic campaigns in 1936 and its political action committee became a major democratic contributor during the 1940s.
these successes were real but limited.
the labor movement did not become the dominant force in the united states that it was in europe and unions never enrolled a majority of american wageworkers.
antiunion employer groups such as the national association of manufacturers and the chamber of commerce remained powerful forces in american business life.
after a decade of gains organized labor remained an important but secondary force in american industry.
women and the new deal because policymakers saw the depression primarily as a crisis of male breadwinners the new deal did not directly challenge gender inequities.
new deal measures generally enhanced womens welfare but few addressed their specific needs and concerns.
however the roosevelt administration did welcome women into the higher ranks of government.
frances perkins the first woman named to a cabinet post served as secretary of labor throughout roosevelts presidency.
while relatively few female appointees often worked to open up other opportunities in government for talented women.
the most prominent woman in american politics was the presidents wife eleanor roosevelt.
in the 1920s she had worked to expand positions for women in political parties labor unions and education.
a tireless advocate for womens rights during her years in the white house mrs roosevelt emerged as an independent public figure and the most influential first lady in the nations history.
descending into coal mines to view working conditions meeting with african americans seeking antilynching laws and talking to people on breadlines she became the conscience of the new deal pushing her husband to do more for the disadvantaged.

would have largely ignored the roosevelts visit camp tara franklin roosevelt was a wealthy patrician but one of his great political skills was the ability to connect with ordinary americans.
his wife eleanor shared a similar gift perhaps to an even greater degree.

needs of women.
a fourth of the national recovery acts employment rules set a lower minimum wage for women than for men performing the same jobs and only 7 percent of the workers hired by the civil works administration were female.
the civilian conservation corps excluded women entirely.
women fared better under the works progress administration at its peak 405 000 women were on the payroll.
most americans agreed with such policies.
when gallup pollsters in 1936 asked people whether wives should work outside the home when their husbands had jobs 82 percent said no.
such sentiment reflected a persistent belief in womens secondary status in american economic life.
african americans under the new deal across the nation but especially in the south african americans held the lowest paying jobs and faced harsh social and political discrimination.
though fdr did not fundamentally change this fact he was the most popular president among african americans since abraham lincoln.
african americans held 18 percent of wpa jobs although they constituted 10 percent of the population.
the resettlement administration established in 1935 to help small farmers and tenants buy land actively protected the rights of black tenant chapter 23 managing the great depression forging the new deal 1929 1939 farmers.
black involvement in the new deal however could not undo centuries of racial subordination nor could it change the overwhelming power of southern whites in the democratic party.
nevertheless black americans received significant benefits from new deal relief programs and believed that the white house cared about their plight which caused a momentous shift in their political allegiance.
since the civil war black voters had staunchly supported the republican party the party of abraham lincoln known as the great emancipator.
even in the depression year of 1932 they overwhelmingly supported republican candidates.
but in 1936 as part of the tidal wave of national support for fdr northern african americans gave roosevelt 71 percent of their votes and have remained solidly democratic ever since.
african americans supported the new deal partly because the roosevelt administration appointed a number of black people to federal office and an informal black cabinet of prominent african american intellectuals advised new deal agencies.
among the most important appointees was mary mcleod bethune.
born in 1875 in south carolina to former slaves bethune founded bethune cookman college and served during the 1920s as president of the national association of colored women.
she joined the new deal in 1935 confiding to a friend that she believed in the democratic and humane program of fdr.
americans bethune observed had to become accustomed to seeing negroes in high places bethune had access to the white house and pushed continually for new deal programs to help african americans.
but the new deal was limited in its approach to race.
roosevelt did not go further in support of black rights because of both his own racial blinders and his need for the votes of the white southern democrats in congress including powerful southern senators many of whom held influential committee posts in congress.
most new deal programs reflected prevailing racial attitudes.
roosevelt and other new dealers had to trim their proposals of measures that would substantially benefit african americans.
civilian conservation corps camps segregated blacks and most nra rules did not protect black workers from discrimination.
both social security and the wagner act explicitly excluded the domestic and agricultural jobs held by most african americans in the 1930s.
roosevelt also refused to support legislation making lynching a federal crime which was one of the most pressing demands of african americans in the 1930s.
between 1882 and 1930 more than 2 500 african americans were lynched by white mobs in the southern states which means that statistically one man woman or child was murdered every week for fifty years.
but despite pleas from black leaders and from mrs roosevelt herself fdr feared that southern white democrats would block his other reforms in retaliation for such legislation.
if lynching embodied southern lawlessness southern law was not much better.
in an infamous 1931 case in scottsboro alabama nine young black men were accused of rape by two white women hitching a ride on a freight train.
the womens stories contained many inconsistencies but within weeks a white jury had convicted all nine defendants eight received the death sentence.
after the u s supreme court overturned the sentences because the defendants had been denied adequate legal counsel five of the men were again convicted and sentenced to long prison terms.
across the country the scottsboro boys as they were known inspired solidarity within african american communities.
among whites the communist party took the lead in publicizing the case and was one of the only white organizations to do so helping to support the scottsboro defense committee which raised money for legal efforts on the defendants behalf.
in southern agriculture where many sharecroppers were black while landowners and government administrators were white the agricultural adjustment act hurt rather than helped the poorest african americans.
white landowners collected government subsidy checks but refused to distribute payments to their sharecroppers.
such practices forced 200 000 black families off the land.
some black farmers tried to protect themselves by joining the southern tenant farmers union stfu a biracial organization founded in 1934.
the same chain that holds you holds my people too an elderly black farmer reminded his white neighbors.
but landowners had such economic power and such support from local sheriffs that the stfu could do little.
a generation of african american leaders came of age inspired by the new deals democratic promise.
but it remained just a promise.
from the outset new dealers wrestled with potentially fatal racial politics.
franklin roosevelt and the democratic party depended heavily on white voters in the south who were determined to maintain racial segregation and white supremacy.
but many democrats in the north and west centers of new deal liberalism would come to oppose racial discrimination.
this meant ironically that the nations most liberal political forces and some of its most conservative political forces existed side by side in the same political party.
another thirty years part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 scottsboro defendants the 1931 trial in scottsboro alabama of nine black youths accused of raping two white women became a symbol of the injustices african americans faced in the souths legal system.
denied access to an attorney the defendants were found guilty after a three day trial and eight were sentenced to death.
when the u s supreme court overturned their convictions in 1932 the international labor defense organization hired noted criminal attorney samuel leibowitz to argue the case.
leibowitz eventually won the acquittal of four defendants and jail sentences for the rest.
this 1933 photograph taken in a decatur jail shows leibowitz conferring with haywood patterson in front of the other eight defendants.

in 1934 the average individual indian income was only 48 per year and the native american unemployment rate was three times the national average.
the plight of native americans won the attention of the progressive commissioner of the bureau of indian affairs bia john collier an intellectual and critic of past bia practices.
collier understood what native americans had long known that the governments decades long policy of forced assimilation prohibition of indian religions and confiscation of indian lands had left most tribes poor isolated and without basic self determination.
collier helped to write and push through congress the indian reorganization act of 1934 sometimes called the indian new deal.
on the positive side the law reversed the dawes act of 1887 chapter 16 by promoting indian self government through formal constitutions and democratically elected tribal councils.
a majority of indian peoples some 181 tribes accepted the reorganization policy but 77 declined to participate primarily because they preferred the traditional way of making decisions by consensus rather than by majority vote.
through the new law indians won a greater degree of religious freedom and tribal governments regained their status as semisovereign dependent nations.
when the latter policy was upheld by the courts indian people gained a measure of leverage that would have major implications for native rights in the second half of the twentieth century.
like so many other federal indian policies however the indian new deal was a mixed blessing.
for some peoples the act imposed a model of selfgovernment that proved incompatible with tribal traditions and languages.
the papagos of southern arizona for instance had no words for budget or chapter 23 managing the great depression forging the new deal 1929 1939 indian new deal commissioner of indian affairs john collier poses with chiefs of the blackfoot indian tribe in 1934.
collier helped reform the way the u s federal government treated native americans.
as part of what many called the indian new deal collier lobbied congress to pass the indian reorganization act.
the act gave indian tribes greater control over their own affairs and ended many of the most atrocious federal practices such as forcing indian children into white run boarding schools and dividing up and selling reservation land.
the legislations long term results were mixed but it signaled the beginning of greater autonomy for indian tribes across the country.
bettmann corbis.
representative and they made no linguistic distinctions among law rule charter and constitution.
in another case the nations largest tribe the navajos rejected the bias new policy largely because the government was simultaneously reducing navajo livestock to protect the boulder dam project.
in theory the new policy gave indians a much greater degree of self determination.
in practice however although some tribes did benefit the bia and congress continued to interfere in internal indian affairs and retained financial control over reservation governments.
struggles in the west by the 1920s agriculture in california had become a big business intensive diversified and export oriented.
large scale corporateowned farms produced specialty crops lettuce tomatoes peaches grapes and cotton whose staggered harvests allowed the use of transient laborers.
thousands of workers immigrants from mexico and asia and white migrants from the midwestern states trooped from farm to farm and from crop to crop during the long picking season.
some migrants settled in the rapidly growing cities along the west coast especially the sprawling metropolis of los angeles.
under both hoover and fdr the federal government promoted the repatriation of mexican citizens their deportation to mexico.
between 1929 and 1937 approximately half a million people of mexican descent were deported.
but historians estimate that more than 60 percent of these were legal u s citizens making the governments actions constitutionally questionable.
despite the deportations many mexican americans benefitted from the new deal and generally held roosevelt and the democratic party in high regard.
people of mexican descent like other americans took jobs with the wpa and the ccc or received relief in the worst years of the depression.
the national youth administration nya which employed young people from families on relief and sponsored a variety of school programs was especially important in part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 mexican american farm workers among the most hard pressed workers during the great depression were those who labored in the nations agricultural field orchards and processing plants.
agriculture was a big time corporate business by the 1930s and in california and other parts of the southwest it employed hundreds of thousands of poor mexican americans and mexican immigrants.
seizing on the spirit of social protest sweeping the country in the early 1930s many of these workers went on strike for better wages and working conditions.
here women from mexican american communities are heading to the cotton fields near corcoran california to urge workers to join a major strike of cotton pickers.
though the workers in corcoran won some wage improvements in this 1933 strike the fierce battle between employers and workers in american agriculture was far from over and continues to this day.

in california the mexican american movement mam a youth focused organization received assistance from liberal new dealers.
new deal programs did not fundamentally improve the migrant farm labor system under which so many people of mexican descent labored but mexicans joined the new deal coalition in large numbers because of the democrats commitment to ordinary americans.
franklin d roosevelts name was the spark that started thousands of spanish speaking persons to the polls noted one los angeles activist.
men and women of asian descent mostly from china japan and the philippines formed a small minority of the american population but were a significant presence in some western cities.
immigrants from japan and china had long faced discrimination.
a 1913 california law prohibited them from owning land.
japanese farmers who specialized in fruit and vegetable crops circumvented this restriction by putting land titles in the names of their american born children.
as the depression cut farm prices and racial discrimination excluded young japanese americans from nonfarm jobs about 20 percent of the immigrants returned to japan.
chinese americans were less prosperous than their japanese counterparts.
only 3 percent of chinese americans worked in professional and technical positions and discrimination barred them from most industrial jobs.
in san francisco the majority of chinese worked in small businesses restaurants laundries and firms that imported textiles and ceramics.
during the depression they turned for assistance to chinese social organizations such as huiguan district associations and to the city government in 1931 about one sixth of san franciscos chinese population was receiving public aid.
but few chinese benefitted from the new deal.
until the repeal of the exclusion act in 1943 chinese immigrants were classified as aliens ineligible for citizenship and therefore were excluded from most federal programs.
because filipino immigrants came from a u s territory they were not affected by the ban on asian chapter 23 managing the great depression forging the new deal 1929 1939 reshaped the use of natural resources especially water in the united states.
immigration enacted in 1924.
during the 1920s their numbers swelled to about 50 000 many of whom worked as laborers on large corporate owned farms.
as the depression cut wages filipino immigration slowed to a trickle and it was virtually cut off by the tydings mcduffie act of 1934.
the act granted independence to the philippines which since 1898 had been an american colony classified all filipinos in the united states as aliens and restricted immigration from the philippines to fifty people per year.
the dust bowl among the most hard pressed citizens during the depression were farmers fleeing the dust bowl of the great plains.
between 1930 and 1941 a severe drought afflicted the semiarid states of oklahoma texas new mexico colorado arkansas and kansas.
farmers in these areas had stripped the land of its native vegetation which destroyed the delicate ecology of the plains.

this ecological disaster prompted a mass exodus.
at least 350 000 okies so called whether or not they were from oklahoma loaded their belongings into cars and trucks and headed to california.
john steinbecks novel the grapes of wrath 1939 immortalized them and new deal photographer dorothea langes haunting images of california migrant camps made them the public face of the depressions human toll.
reshaping the environment attention to natural resources was a dominant theme of the new deal and the shaping of the landscape was among its most visible legacies.
franklin roosevelt and interior secretary harold ickes saw themselves as conservationists in the tradition of fdrs cousin theodore roosevelt.
in an era before environmentalism fdr practiced what he called the gospel of conservation the president cared primarily about making the land and other natural resources such as trees and water better serve human needs.
national policy stressed scientific land management and ecological balance.
preserving wildlife and wilderness was of secondary importance.

weather bureau scientist called the drought of the 1930s the worst in the climatological history of the country conditions were especially severe in the southern plains where farming on marginal land threatened the environment even before the drought struck.

the human face of the great depression migrant mother by dorothea lange is one of the most famous documentary photographs of the 1930s.
on assignment for the resettlement administration lange spent only ten minutes in a pea pickers camp in nipomo california.
there she captured this image though not the name of the woman whose despair and resignation she so powerfully recorded.
in the 1970s the woman was identified as florence thompson a native cherokee from oklahoma who disagreed with langes recollections of the circumstances of the taking of the photograph.
thompson and her family had left nipomo however by the time the publication of this image sparked a large relief effort directed at the camps migrant workers.

roosevelt and ickes believed that poor land practices made for poor people.
under their direction government agencies tackled the dust bowls human causes.
agents from the newly created soil conservation service for instance taught farmers to prevent soil erosion by tilling hillsides along the contours of the land.
they also encouraged and sometimes paid farmers to take certain commercial crops out of production and plant soil preserving grasses instead.
one of the u s forest services most widely publicized programs was the shelterbelts the planting of 220 million trees running north along the 99th meridian from abilene texas to the canadian border.
planted as a windbreak the trees also prevented soil erosion.
a variety of government agencies from the ccc to the tennessee valley authority the most extensive new deal environmental undertaking was the tennessee valley authority tva which roosevelt saw as the first step in modernizing the south.
funded by congress in 1933 the tva integrated flood control reforestation electricity generation and agricultural and industrial development.
the dams and their hydroelectric plants provided cheap electric power for homes and factories as well as ample recreational opportunities for the valleys residents.
the massive project won praise around the world map 23 5.
the tva was an integral part of the roosevelt administrations effort to keep farmers on the land by enhancing the quality of rural life.
the rural electrification administration rea established in 1935 was also central to that goal.
fewer than one tenth of the nations 6 8 million farms had electricity.
the rea addressed this problem by promoting nonprofit farm cooperatives that offered loans to farmers to install power lines.
by 1940 40 percent of the nations farms had electricity a decade later 90 percent did.
electricity brought relief from the drudgery and isolation of farm life.
electric irons vacuum cleaners and washing machines eased womens burdens and radios brightened the lives of the entire family.
along with the automobile and the movies electricity broke down the barriers between urban and rural life.
grand coulee as the nations least populated but fastest growing region the west benefitted enormously from the new deals attention to the environment.

the largest project in the west however took shape in an obscure corner of washington state where the pwa and the bureau of reclamation built the grand coulee dam on the columbia river.

the new deal and the arts the legacies of the new deal in response to the great depression many american writers and artists redefined their relationship to society.
never had there been a decade critic malcolm cowley suggested in 1939 when literary events followed so closely on the flying coat tails of social events new deal administrators encouraged artists to create projects that would be of interest to the entire community not just the cultured elite.
encouraged by the popular new deal slogan art for the millions artists painted murals in hundreds of public buildings.
the wpas federal art project gave work to many young artists who would become the twentieth centurys the new deal addressed the great depression by restoring hope and promising security.
fdr and congress created a powerful social welfare state that took unprecedented responsibility for the well being of american citizens.
during the 1930s millions of people began to pay taxes directly to the social security administration and more than one third of the population received direct government assistance from federal programs including old age pensions unemployment compensation farm loans relief work and mortgage guarantees.

in the 1960s lyndon johnson and the great society congress dramatically expanded social welfare programs most of which remained intact in the wake of the reagan revolution of the 1980s.
like all other major social transformations the new deal was criticized both by those who thought it did too much and by those who believed it did too little.
conservatives who prioritized limited government and individual freedom pointed out that the new deal state intruded deeply into the personal and financial lives of citizens and the affairs of business.

holes no national health care system welfare programs that excluded domestic workers and farm laborers and state governments that often limited the benefits distributed under new deal programs.
whatever the merits of its critics the new deal unquestionably transformed the american political landscape.
from 1896 to 1932 the republican party had commanded the votes of a majority of americans.
that changed as franklin roosevelts magnetic personality and innovative programs brought millions of voters into the democratic fold.
democratic recruits included first and second generation immigrants from southern and central europe italians poles slovaks and jews as well as african american migrants to northern cities.
organized labor aligned itself with a democratic administration that had recognized unions as a legitimate force in modern industrial life.
the elderly and the unemployed assisted by the social security act likewise supported fdr.
this new deal coalition of ethnic groups city dwellers organized labor african americans and a cross section of the middle class formed the nucleus of the northern democratic party and supported additional liberal reforms in the decades to come.

finally we examined the accomplishments of the new deal.
in 1933 new deal programs resolved the banking crisis while preserving capitalist institutions.
subsequently these programs expanded the federal government and through the social security system farm subsidy programs and public works projects launched federal policies that were important to nearly every american.
great dams and electricity projects sponsored by the tennessee valley authority the works progress administration in the west and the rural electrification administration permanently improved the quality of life for the nations citizens.

part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 the road to war the great depression disrupted economic life around the world and brought the collapse of traditional political institutions.
in response an antidemocratic movement known as fascism which had originated in italy during the 1920s developed in germany spain and japan.
by the mid 1930s these nations had instituted authoritarian militaristic governments led by powerful dictators benito mussolini in italy adolf hitler in nazi germany francisco franco in spain and after 1940 hideki tojo in japan.
as early as 1936 president roosevelt warned that other peoples had sold their heritage of freedom and urged americans to work for the survival of democracy both at home and abroad.
constrained by strong isolationist sentiment by 1940 fdr was cautiously leading the nation toward war against the fascist powers.
the rise of fascism world war ii had its roots in the settlement of world war i germany struggled under the harsh terms of the treaty of versailles and japan and italy had their desire for overseas empires thwarted by the treaty makers.
faced with the expansive ambitions and deep resentments of those countries the league of nations the collective security system established at versailles proved unable to maintain the existing international order.
fascism as instituted in germany by hitler combined a centralized authoritarian state a doctrine of aryan racial supremacy and intense nationalism in a call for the spiritual reawakening of the german people.
fascist leaders worldwide disparaged parliamentary government independent labor movements and individual rights.
they opposed both the economic collectivism of the soviet union where in theory the state managed the economy to ensure social equality and the competitive capitalist economies of the united states and western europe.
fascist movements arose around the world in the 1930s but managed to achieve power in only a handful of countries.
those countries were at the center of global war making in the 1930s.
japan and italy the first challenge came from japan.
to become an industrial power japan required raw materials and overseas maridentify causes kets.
like the western european what motivated japanese powers and the united states italian and german expanbefore it japan embraced an sionism.
expansionary foreign policy in pursuit of colonial possessions and overseas influence.
in 1931 its troops occupied manchuria an industrialized province in northern china and in 1937 the japanese launched a full scale invasion of china.
in both instances the league of nations condemned japans actions but did nothing to stop them.
japans defiance of the league encouraged a fascist leader half a world away italys benito mussolini who had come to power in 1922.
il duce the leader as mussolini was known had long denounced the versailles treaty which denied italys colonial claims in africa and the middle east after world war i.
as in japan the italian fascists desired overseas colonies for raw materials markets and national prestige.
in 1935 mussolini invaded ethiopia one of the few remaining independent countries in africa.
ethiopian emperor haile selassie appealed to the league of nations but the leagues verbal condemnation and limited sanctions its only real leverage did not stop italy from taking control of ethiopia in 1936.
hitlers germany germany however posed the gravest threat to the existing world order.
huge world war i reparation payments economic depression fear of communism labor unrest and rising unemployment fueled the ascent of adolf hitler and his national socialist nazi party.
when hitler became chancellor of germany in 1933 the reichstag the german legislature granted him dictatorial powers to deal with the economic crisis.
hitler promptly outlawed other political parties arrested many of his political rivals and declared himself fhrer leader.
under nazi control the reichstag invested all legislative power in hitlers hands.
hitlers goal was nothing short of european domination and world power as he had made clear in his 1925 book mein kampf my struggle.
the book outlined his plans to overturn the territorial settlements of the versailles treaty unite germans living throughout central europe in a great german fatherland and annex large areas of eastern europe.
the inferior races who lived in these regions jews gypsies and slavs would be removed or subordinated to the german master race these territories would provide germany with what hitler called lebensraum a new region of settlement and farming and a source of natural resources.
a virulent anti semite hitler had long blamed jews for germanys problems.
once in power he began a sustained and brutal persecution of jews which expanded into a campaign of extermination in the early 1940s.

the trick was to prevent trusts from unfairly using their power to curb such competition.
in the clayton antitrust act 1914 which amended the sherman act the definition of illegal practices was left flexible subject to the test of whether an action substantially lessen ed competition the new federal trade commission received broad powers to decide what was fair investigating companies and issuing cease and desist orders against anticompetitive practices.
labor issues meanwhile received attention from a blue ribbon u s commission on industrial relations chapter 20 whose government.
politics populists and progressives 1880 1917 appointed near the end of tafts presidency and charged with investigating the conditions of labor.
in its 1913 report the commission summed up the impact of industrialization on low skilled workers.
many earned 10 or less a week and endured regular episodes of unemployment some faced long term poverty and hardship.
workers held an almost universal conviction that they were denied justice the commission concluded that a major cause of industrial violence was the ruthless antiunionism of american employers.
in its key recommendation the report called for federal laws protecting workers right to organize and engage in collective bargaining.
though such laws were in 1915 too radical to win passage the commission helped set a new national agenda that would come to fruition in the 1930s.
guided by the commissions revelations president wilson warmed up to labor.
in 1915 and 1916 he championed a host of bills to benefit american workers.
they included the adamson act which established an eight hour day for railroad workers the seamens act which eliminated age old abuses of merchant sailors and a workmens compensation law for federal employees.
wilson despite initial modest goals presided over a major expansion of federal authority perhaps the most significant since reconstruction.
the continued growth of u s government offices during wilsons term reflected a reality that transcended party lines corporations had grown in size and power and americans increasingly wanted federal authority to grow too.
wilsons reforms did not extend to the african americans who had supported him in 1912.
in fact the president rolled back certain republican policies such as selected appointments of black postmasters.
i tried to help elect wilson w e b.
du bois reflected gloomily but under wilson came the worst attempt at jim crow legislation and discrimination in civil service that we had experienced since the civil war wilson famously praised the film birth of a nation 1915 which depicted the reconstruction era ku klux klan in heroic terms.
in this way democratic control of the white house helped set the tone for the klans return in the 1920s.
progressive legacies in the industrial era millions of americans decided that their political system needed to adjust to new conditions.
whatever their specific goals and whether they were rural working class or middle class reformers faced fierce opposition from powerful business interests.
when they managed to win key regulatory laws they often found these struck down by hostile courts and were forced to try again by different means.
thus the progressive era in the united states should be understood partly by its limitations.
elitism and racial prejudice embodied in new voting restrictions limited working class power at the polls african americans their plight ignored by most white reformers faced segregation and violence.
divided power in a federalist system blocked passage of uniform national policies on such key issues as child labor.
key social welfare programs that became popular in europe during these decades including national health insurance and old age pensions scarcely made it onto the american agenda until the 1930s.
an international perspective suggests several reasons for american resistance to such programs.
business interests in the united states were exceptionally successful and powerful flush with recent expansion.
at the time also voters in countries with older more native born populations tended to support government regulation and welfare spending to a greater extent than their counterparts in countries with younger populations and large numbers of immigrants.
younger voters understandably seem to have been less concerned than older voters about health insurance and old age security.
divisions in the american working class also played a role.
black immigrant and native born white laborers often viewed one another as enemies or strangers rather than as members of a single class with common interests.
this helps explain why the socialist party drew at peak less than 6 percent of the u s vote at a time when its counterparts in finland germany and france drew 40 percent or more.
lack of pressure from a strong selfconscious workingmens party contributed to more limited results in the united states.
but it would be wrong to underestimate progressive achievements.
over several decades in this period more and more prosperous americans began to support stronger economic regulations.
even the most cautious elite place events progressives recognized that the in context united states had entered a new what factors explain era.
multinational corporations the limits of progresovershadowed small businesses in sive reform in the vast cities old support systems united states.
based on village and kinship melted away.
outdated political institutions from the spoils system to urban machines would no longer do.
walter lippmann founding editor of the progressive magazine new republic observed in 1914 that americans had no precedents to guide us no wisdom part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 that wasnt made for a simpler age progressives created new wisdom.
by 1917 they had drawn blueprints for a modern american state one whose powers more suited the needs of an industrial era.
summary the progressive era emerged from the political turmoil of the 1880s and 1890s.
in the 1880s despite the limits imposed by close elections federal and state governments managed to achieve important administrative and economic reforms.
after 1888 republican leaders undertook more sweeping efforts including the sherman antitrust act but failed in a quest to protect black voting rights.
in the south and west the peoples party called for much stronger government intervention in the economy but its radical program drew bitter republican and democratic resistance.
the depression of the 1890s brought a wave of reaction.
labor unrest threw the nation into crisis and clevelands intransigence over the gold standard cost the democrats dearly in the 1894 and 1896 elections.
while republicans took over the federal government southern democrats restricted voting rights in the solid south.
federal courts struck down regulatory laws and supported southern racial discrimination.
after mckinleys assassination roosevelt launched a program that balanced reform and private enterprise.
at both the federal and state levels progressive reformers made extensive use of elite expertise.
at the grassroots black reformers battled racial discrimination women reformers worked on issues ranging from public health to womens working conditions and labor activists tried to address the problems that fueled persistent labor unrest.
the election of 1912 split the republicans giving victory to woodrow wilson who launched a democratic program of economic and labor reform.
despite the limits of the progressive era the reforms of this period laid the foundation for a modern american state.

americans he argued must help make the world fit and safe to live in we cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose wilson declared.
fifteen years later president franklin delano roosevelt made a similar call for solidarity during the great depression.
we face the arduous days that lie before us he said in the warm courage of national unity soon even more grit and determination were needed as americans faced another looming world war.
in these years americas political leaders met major challenges at home and abroad with bold responses.
the exception to this pattern was the 1920s a decade of limited government under republican presidents who deferred to business interests and to americans isolationist consumer oriented mood.
during the crises of world war i the great depression and world war ii however american voters called for and got what roosevelt called action and action now wilsons proposals met with failure at the end of world war i but roosevelt won immense popularity for his measures to combat the depression which helped millions of americans survive unemployment and hardship.
fdr however had limited success in ending the depression until world war ii reignited the american economy.
the united states emerged from the war with unprecedented global power and the federal government with a broad mandate for sustaining the new welfare state.
part 7 addresses these transformations.
americas rise to world power modernity and its discontents the united states became a major international power after the 1890s first in the western hemisphere and by the 1940s across the world renewing debates at home about americas global role.
after defeating spain in the war of 1898 the united states claimed overseas colonies and asserted control over the caribbean basin.
though president wilson attempted to maintain neutrality at the start of world war i trade ties and old alliances drew america into the conflict on the allied side.
wilson sought to influence the peace but allied leaders ignored his proposals and the senate rejected the treaty of versailles.
by wars end the united statess position on the world stage remained uncertain.
the 1920s was an era of dollar diplomacy and u s business expansion abroad.
in the 1930s faced with isolationist sentiment at home and the rise of fascist powers in europe and japan the roosevelt administration steered a middle course.
in the late 1930s it began to send aid to its traditional ally great britain without committing u s forces keeping the nation out of the brewing wars in europe and the pacific.
when the united states entered world war ii in 1941 it did so as part of an alliance with both england and the soviet union against germany and japan and their ally italy.
the united states emerged from the war as the dominant global power.
these events are covered in chapters 21 22 and 24.
world war i had a powerful domestic impact in the united states.
the great migration brought african americans northward and mexicans across the u s border to take up wartime jobs.
a full blown modern consumer culture also emerged by the 1920s as radio cars and hollywood movies transformed leisure pastimes.
while many americans embraced consumer culture others expressed deep fear and antagonism toward a new modern sensibility especially secularism and sexual freedoms.
repressive impulses also came from above during world war i the federal government introduced new laws to police dissent and the country took a sharp right turn.
a red scare rollback of labor and immigrant rights and rising nativism marked the political scene.
a resurgent nationwide klan arose to target catholics and jews as well as african americans.
many cultural conflicts emerged the teaching of evolution in the schools angered religious fundamentalists while wets and drys debated the prohibition of liquor.
later events showed that racism took many forms the u s government deported hundreds of thousands of people of mexican descent during the great depression including american citizens and temporarily imprisoned japanese americans in a mass relocation policy during world war ii.
these too represented battles over what a diverse modern nation would look like.
we explore these conflicts in chapters 21 22 and 24.
part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 creation of the welfare state in comparison with their progressive predecessors chapters 19 and 20 republican policymakers of the 1920s believed in hands off government.
their policies likely helped trigger the great depression and deepened its impact after it arrived.
starting in 1932 americans voted for change president franklin roosevelts new deal programs 1933 1937 expanded federal responsibility for the welfare of ordinary citizens sweeping away the laissez faire individualism of the previous decade.
though the new deal faced considerable challenges on the political right especially from business and corporate leaders and a hostile supreme court the popularity of its programs such as social security established a broad consensus that the united states needed a modern welfare state to regulate the economy and provide a basic safety net for the nations citizens.
for an exploration of the new deal see chapter 23.
wartime measures went even further as the government mobilized the entire economy and tens of millions of citizens to fight the axis powers.
the welfare state became a warfare state and congress gave the president broad powers to fight the war abroad and reorganize the economy at home.
under the government directed wartime economy business boomed and productivity grew but other policies such as the internment of japanese immigrants and japanese americans violated fragile civil liberties leaving a mixed legacy.

the love of liberty.
he never made a race of people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master at the time republican president william mckinley was leading an ambitious and popular plan of overseas expansion.
the united states had asserted control over the caribbean claimed hawaii and sought to annex the philippines.
bryan failed to convince a majority of voters that imperialism the exercise of military political and economic power overseas was the wrong direction.
he lost the election by a landslide.
by the 1910s however american enthusiasm for overseas involvement cooled.
despite efforts to stay neutral the united states got caught up in the global catastrophe of world war i which killed 8 million combatants including over 50 000 u s soldiers.
by the wars end european powers grip on their colonial empires was weakening.
the united states also ceased acquiring overseas territories and pursued a different path.
it did so in part because the war brought dramatic changes at home leaving americans a postwar legacy of economic upheaval and political disillusionment.
president woodrow wilson who in 1913 appointed bryan as his secretary of state tried to steer a middle course between revolutionary socialism and european style imperialism.
in wilsons phrase america would make the world safe for democracy while unapologetically working to advance u s economic interests.
the u s senate however rejected the 1919 treaty of versailles and with it wilsons vision leaving the nations foreign policy in doubt.

to what degree should the federal government seek to promote american business interests.
under what conditions was overseas military action justified.
when on the contrary did it impinge on others sovereignty endanger u s soldiers and invite disaster.
todays debates over foreign policy still center to a large degree on questions that americans debated in the era of mckinley bryan and wilson when the nation first asserted itself as a major world power.
american soldiers on a french battlefield 1918 as the united states asserted its power on the world stage american soldiers found themselves fighting on foreign battlefields.
this 1918 photograph shows a few of the 1 million u s soldiers who joined french and british troops fighting on the brutal western front to defeat germany in the great war.
over 26 000 american soldiers lost their lives on the battlefield during world war i and 95 000 were wounded.

part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 from expansion to imperialism historians used to describe turn of the twentiethcentury u s imperialism as something new and unprecedented.
now they stress continuities between foreign policy in this era and the nations earlier relentless expansion across north america.
wars against native peoples had occurred almost continuously since the countrys founding in the 1840s the united states had annexed a third of mexico.
the united states never administered a large colonial empire as did european powers like spain england and germany partly because it had a plentiful supply of natural resources in the american west.
but policymakers undertook a determined quest for global markets.
events in the 1890s opened opportunities to pursue this goal in new ways.
foundations of empire american empire builders around 1900 fulfilled a vision laid out earlier by william seward secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson who saw access to global markets as the key to power chapter 16.
sewards ideas had won only limited support at the time but the severe economic depression of the 1890s brought republicans into power and sewards ideas back into vogue.
confronting high unemployment and mass protests policymakers feared american workers would embrace socialism or marxism.
the alternative they believed was to create jobs and prosperity at home by selling u s products in overseas markets.
intellectual trends also favored imperialism.
as early as 1885 in his popular book our country congregationalist minister josiah strong urged protestants to proselytize overseas.
he predicted that the american anglo saxon race which represented the largest liberty the purest christianity the highest civilization would spread itself over the earth such arguments were grounded in american exceptionalism the idea that the united states had a unique destiny to foster democracy and civilization.
as strongs exhortation sugtrace change gested imperialists also drew on over time popular racial theories which how did imperialism in the claimed that people of anglo1890s reflect both contisaxon descent english and nuities and changes from often german were superior to earlier eras.
all others.
anglo saxon rule over foreign people of color made sense in an era when at home most american indians and asian immigrants were denied citizenship and most southern blacks were disenfranchised.
imperialists argued that free land on the western frontier was dwindling and thus new outlets needed to be found for american energy and enterprise.
responding to critics of u s occupation of the philippines theodore roosevelt scoffed if filipinos should control their own islands he declared then america was morally bound to return arizona to the apaches imperialists also justified their views through racialized social darwinism chapter 18.
josiah strong for example predicted that with the globe fully occupied a competition of races would ensue with victory based on survival of the fittest fear of ruthless competition drove the united states like european nations to invest in the latest weapons.
policymakers saw that european powers were amassing steel plated battleships and carving up africa and asia among themselves.
in his book the influence of sea power upon history 1890 u s naval officer alfred mahan urged the united states to enter the fray observing that naval power had been essential to past empires.
as early as 1886 congress ordered construction of two steel hulled battleships the uss texas and uss maine in 1890 it appropriated funds for three more a program that expanded over the next two decades.
during grover clevelands second term 1893 1897 his secretary of state richard olney turned to direct confrontation.
he warned europe to stay away from latin america which he saw as the united statess rightful sphere of influence.
without consulting the nation of venezuela olney suddenly demanded in 1895 that britain resolve a long standing border dispute between venezuela and britains neighboring colony british guiana.
invoking the monroe doctrine which stated that the western hemisphere was offlimits to further european colonization olney warned that the united states would brook no challenge to its interests.
startled britain agreed to arbitrate.
u s power was on the rise.
the war of 1898 events in the caribbean presented the united states with far greater opportunities.
in 1895 cuban patriots mounted a major guerrilla war against spain which had lost most of its other new world territories.
the spanish commander responded by rounding up cuban civilians into concentration camps where as many as 200 000 died of starvation exposure chapter 21 or dysentery.
in the united states yellow journalists such as william randolph hearst turned their plight into a cause clbre.
hearsts coverage of spanish atrocities fed a surge of nationalism especially among those who feared that industrialization was causing american men to lose physical strength and valor.
the government should not pass up this opportunity said indiana senator albert beveridge to manufacture manhood congress called for cuban independence.
president cleveland had no interest in supporting the cuban rebellion but worried over spains failure to end it.
the war disrupted trade and damaged americanowned sugar plantations on the island.
moreover an unstable cuba was incompatible with u s strategic interests including a proposed canal whose caribbean approaches had to be safeguarded.
taking office in 1897 president william mckinley took a tough stance.
in september a u s diplomat informed spain that it must ensure an early and certain peace or the united states would step in.
at first this hard line seemed to work spains conservative regime fell and a liberal government taking office in october 1897 offered cuba limited self rule.
but spanish loyalists in havana rioted against this proposal while cuban rebels held out for full independence.
in february 1898 hearsts new york journal published a private letter in which a spanish minister to the united states belittled mckinley.
the minister dupuy de lme resigned but exposure of the de lme letter intensified americans indignation toward spain.
the next week brought shocking news the u s battle cruiser maine had exploded and sunk in havana harbor with 260 seamen lost.
whole country thrills with the war fever proclaimed the new york journal.
remember the maine became a national chant.
popular passions were now a major factor in the march toward war.
mckinley assumed the sinking of the maine had been accidental.
improbably though a naval board of inquiry blamed an underwater mine fueling public outrage.
later investigators disagreed the more likely cause was a faulty ship design that placed explosive munitions too close to coal bunkers which were prone to fire.
no evidence linked spain to the purported mine but if a mine sank the maine then spain was responsible for not protecting the ship.
business leaders became impatient believing war was preferable to an unending cuban crisis.
on march 27 mckinley cabled an ultimatum to madrid an immediate ceasefire in cuba for six months and with the united states mediating peace negotiations with the rebels.
spain while desperate to avoid war balked at the added demand that mediation must result an emerging world power 1890 1918 in cuban independence.
on april 11 mckinley asked congress for authority to intervene in cuba in the name of civilization and in behalf of endangered american interests historians long referred to the ensuing fight as the spanish american war but because that name ignores the central role of cuban revolutionaries many historians now call the three way conflict the war of 1898.
though americans widely admired cubans aspirations for freedom the mckinley administration defeated a congressional attempt to recognize the rebel government.
in response senator henry m teller of colorado added an amendment to the war bill disclaiming any intention by the united states to occupy cuba.
the teller amendment reassured americans that their country would uphold democracy abroad as well as at home.
mckinleys expectations differed.
he wrote privately we must keep all we get when the war is over we must keep what we want on april 24 1898 spain declared war on the united states.
the news provoked full blown war fever.
across the country young men enlisted for the fight.
theodore roosevelt serving in the war department resigned to become lieutenant colonel of a cavalry regiment.
recruits poured into makeshift bases around tampa florida where confusion reigned.
rifles failed to arrive food was bad sanitation worse.
no provision had been made for getting troops to cuba so the government hastily collected a fleet of yachts and commercial boats.
fortunately the regular army was a disciplined professional force its 28 000 seasoned troops provided a nucleus for 200 000 volunteers.
the navy was in better shape spain had nothing to match americas seven battleships and armored cruisers.
the spanish admiral bitterly predicted that his fleet would like don quixote go out to fight windmills and come back with a broken head the first decisive military engagement took place in the pacific.
this was the handiwork of theodore roosevelt who in his government post had gotten the intrepid commodore george dewey appointed commander of the pacific fleet.
in the event of war dewey had instructions to sail immediately for the spanishowned philippines.
when war was declared roosevelt confronted his surprised superior and pressured him into validating deweys instructions.
on may 1 1898 american ships cornered the spanish fleet in manila bay and destroyed it.
manila the philippine capital fell on august 13.

four years later succeeding her brother as hawaiis monarch queen liliuokalani made known her frustration with these treaties.
in response an annexation club of u s backed planters organized secretly and in 1892 with the help of u s marines overthrew the queen and then negotiated a treaty of annexation.
grover cleveland however rejected it when he entered office declaring that it would violate americas unbroken tradition against acquiring territory overseas.
deweys victory in manila delivered what the planters wanted hawaii acquired strategic value as a halfway station to the philippines.
in july 1898 congress voted for annexation over the protests of hawaiis deposed queen.
oh honest americans she pleaded as christians hear me for my down trodden people.
their form of government is as dear to them as yours is precious to you.
quite as warmly as you love your country so they love theirs but to the great powers hawaii was not a country.
one congressman dismissed hawaiis monarchy as absurd grotesque tottering the aryan race he declared would rescue the islands from it.
hawaiis queen hawaiian queen liliuokalani 1838 1917 was the greatgranddaughter of keaweaheulu founder of the kamehameha dynasty that had ruled the islands since the late 1700s.

deweys victory directed policymakers attention to hawaii.
nominally independent these islands had long been subject to u s influence including a horde of resident american sugarcane planters.
an 1876 treaty between the united states and the islands monarch gave hawaiian sugar free access to the american market without tariff payments identify causes and hawaii pledged to sign no why did the united states such agreement with any other go to war against spain in power.

further u s annexations took on their own logic.
the navy pressed for another coaling base in the central pacific that meant guam a spanish island in the marianas.
a strategic base was needed in the caribbean that meant puerto rico.
by early summer before u s troops had fired a shot in cuba mckinleys broader war aims were crystallizing.
in cuba spanish forces were depleted by the long guerrilla war.
though poorly trained and equipped american forces had the advantages of a demoralized foe and knowledgeable cuban allies.
the main battle occurred on july 1 at san juan hill near santiago where the spanish fleet was anchored.
roosevelts rough riders took the lead but four african american regiments bore the brunt of the fighting.
observers credited much of the victory to the superb gallantry of these soldiers.
spanish troops retreated to a well fortified second line but u s forces were spared the test of a second assault.
on july 3 the spanish fleet in santiago harbor tried a desperate run through the american blockade and was destroyed.

spoils of war the united states and spain quickly signed a preliminary peace agreement in which spain agreed to liberate cuba and cede puerto rico and guam to the united states.
but what would happen to the philippines an immense archipelago that lay more than 5 000 miles from california.
initially the united states aimed to keep only manila because of its fine harbor.
manila was not defensible however without the whole island of luzon on which it sat.
after deliberating mckinley found a justification for annexing all of the philippines.
he decided that we could not leave the filipinos to themselves they were unfit for self rule this declaration provoked heated debate.
under the constitution as republican senator george f hoar argued no power is given to the federal government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as colonies or to conquer alien people and hold them in subjugation leading citizens and peace advocates including jane addams and mark twain enlisted in the anti imperialist cause.
steel king andrew carnegie offered 20 million to purchase philippine independence.
labor leader samuel gompers warned union members about the threat of competition from low wage filipino immigrants.
anti imperialists however were a diverse lot.
some argued that filipinos were perfectly capable of self rule others warned about part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 the dangers of annexing eight million filipinos of an inferior race no matter whether they are fit to govern themselves or not declared a missouri congressman they are not fit to govern us beginning in late 1898 anti imperialist leagues sprang up around the country but they never sparked a mass movement.
on the contrary mckinleys splendid little war proved immensely popular.
confronted with that reality democrats waffled.
their standard bearer william jennings bryan decided not to stake democrats future on explain opposition to a policy that he consequences believed to be irreversible.
he what were the long term threw his party into turmoil by results of the u s victory over spain in hawaii and declaring last minute support for in former spanish possesmckinleys proposed treaty.
ing met military defeat spanish representatives had little choice.
in the treaty of paris spain ceded the philippines to the united states for 20 million.
annexation was not as simple as u s policymakers had expected.
on february 4 1899 two days before the senate ratified the treaty fighting broke out between american and filipino patrols on the edge of manila.
confronted by annexation rebel leader emilio aguinaldo asserted his nations independence and turned his guns on occupying american forces.
though aguinaldo found it difficult to organize a mass based resistance movement the ensuing conflict between filipino nationalists and u s troops far exceeded in length and ferocity the war just concluded with spain.
fighting tenacious guerrillas the u s army resorted to the same tactics spain had employed in cuba burning crops and villages and rounding up civilians.
atrocities became commonplace on both sides.
in three years of warfare 4 200 americans and an estimated 200 000 filipinos died many of the latter were dislocated civilians particularly children who succumbed to malnutrition and disease.
mckinleys convincing victory over william jennings bryan in 1900 suggested popular satisfaction with americas overseas adventures even in the face of dogged filipino resistance to u s rule.
the fighting ended in 1902 and william howard taft appointed as governor general of the philippines sought to make the territory a model of roadbuilding and sanitary engineering.
yet misgivings lingered as americans confronted the brutality of the war.
philosopher william james noted that the united states had destroyed these islanders by the thousands their villages and cities.
could there be any more damning indictment of that whole bloated ideal termed modern civilization american voices p 680.
constitutional issues also remained unresolved.
the treaty while guaranteeing freedom of religion to inhabitants of ceded spanish territories withheld any promise of citizenship.
it was up to congress to decide filipinos civil rights and political status in 1901 the supreme court upheld this provision in a set of decisions known as the insular cases.
the constitution declared the court did not automatically extend citizenship to people in acquired territories congress could decide.
puerto rico guam and the philippines were thus marked as colonies not future states.
the next year as a condition for withdrawing from cuba the united states forced the newly independent island to accept a proviso in its constitution called the platt amendment 1902.
this blocked cuba from making a treaty with any country except the united states and gave the united states the right to intervene in cuban affairs if it saw fit.
cuba also granted the united states a lease on guantnamo bay still in effect where the u s navy built a large base.
cubans hard fought independence was limited so was that of filipinos.
eventually the jones act of 1916 committed the united states to philippine independence but set no date.
the philippines at last achieved independence in 1946.
though the wars carnage had rubbed off some of the moralizing gloss americas global aspirations remained intact.
a power among powers no one appreciated americas emerging influence more than the man who after william mckinleys assassination became president in 1901.
theodore roosevelt was an avid student of world affairs who called on the civilized and orderly powers to insist on the proper policing of the world he meant in part directing the affairs of backward peoples for roosevelt imperialism went hand in hand with domestic progressivism chapter 20.
he argued that a strong federal government asserting itself both at home and abroad would enhance economic stability and political order.
overseas roosevelt sought to arbitrate disputes and maintain a global balance of power but he also asserted u s interests.

fearful of being shut out u s secretary of state john hay sent these powers a note in 1899 claiming the right of equal trade access an open door for all nations seeking to do business in china.
the united states lacked leverage in asia and hays note elicited only noncommittal responses.
but he chose to interpret this as acceptance of his position.
when a secret society of chinese nationalists known outside china as boxers because of their pugnacious political stance rebelled against foreign occupation in 1900 the united states sent 5 000 troops to join a multinational campaign to break the nationalists siege of european offices in beijing.

united states to intervene.
but american voices debating the philippines as president mckinley privately acknowledged in writing when the war is over we must keep what we want seizing the philippines was an act of national self interest.
of the alternatives it was the one that seemed best calculated to serve americas strategic aims in asia.
but mckinleys geopolitical decision had unintended consequences.
for one it provoked a bloody insurrection.
for another it challenged the united statess democratic principles.
as these consequences hit home a divided senate set up a special committee and held closed hearings.
congressional testimony is a source much prized by historians.
though some of it is prepared once questioning begins testimony becomes unscripted and can be especially revealing.
the following documents are taken from the 1902 testimony before the senate committee on the philippines.
ideals general arthur macarthur 1845 1912 was in on the action in the philippines almost from the start.
he commanded one of the first units to arrive there in 1898 and in 1900 was reassigned as the islands military governor and general commander of the troops.
his standing as a military man holder of the congressional medal of honor from the civil war was matched later by his more famous son douglas macarthur who fought in the pacific during world war ii.
here the elder macarthur explains in prepared testimony his vision of americas mission to the philippines.
at the time i returned to manila may 1900 to assume the supreme command it seemed to me that.
our occupation of the island was simply one of the necessary consequences in logical sequence of our great prosperity and to doubt the wisdom of occupation was simply to doubt the stability of our own institutions and in effect to declare that a self governing nation was incapable of successfully resisting strains arising naturally from its own productive energy.
it seemed to me that our conception of right justice freedom and personal liberty was the precious fruit of centuries of strife.
and that we must regard ourselves simply as the custodians of imperishable ideas held in trust for the general benefit of mankind.
in other words i felt that we had attained a moral and intellectual height from which we were bound to proclaim to all as the occasion arose the true message of humanity as embodied in the principles of our own institutions.
all other governments that have gone to the east have simply planted trading establishments they have not materially affected the conditions of the people.
there is not a single establishment in my judgment in asia to day that would survive five years if the original power which planted it was withdrawn therefrom.
the contrasting idea with our idea is this in planting our ideas we plant something that can not be destroyed.
to my mind the archipelago is a fertile soil upon which to plant republicanism.
we are planting the best traditions the best characteristics of americanism in such a way that they can never be removed from that soil.
that in itself seems to me a most inspiring thought.
it encouraged me during all my efforts in those lands even when conditions seemed most disappointing when the people themselves not appreciating precisely what the remote consequences of our efforts were going to be mistrusted us but that fact was always before me that going deep down into that fertile soil were the indispensable ideas of americanism.
skepticism at this point the general was interrupted by colorado senator thomas patterson a populist democrat and a vocal anti imperialist.
sen patterson do you mean that imperishable idea of which you speak is the right of self government.
gen macarthur precisely so self government regulated by law as i understand it in this republic.
sen patterson of course you do not mean selfgovernment regulated by some foreign and superior power.
gen macarthur well that is a matter of evolution senator.
we are putting these institutions there so they will evolve themselves just as here and everywhere else where freedom has flourished.
sen patterson after the general concluded his statement do i understand your claim of right and duty to retain the philippine islands is based upon the proposition that they have come to us upon the basis of our morals honorable dealing and unassailable international integrity.
gen macarthur that proposition is not questioned by anybody in the world excepting a few people in the united states.
we will be benefited and the filipino people will be benefited and that is what i meant by the original proposition sen patterson do you mean the filipino people that are left alive.
gen macarthur i mean the filipino people.
sen patterson you mean those left alive after they have been subjugated.
gen macarthur i do not admit that there has been any unusual destruction of life in the philippine islands.
the destruction is simply the incident of war and of course it embraces only a very small percentage of the total population.
i doubt if any war either international or civil any war on earth has been conducted with as much humanity with as much careful consideration with as much self restraint as have been the american operations in the philippine archipelago.
realities brigadier general robert p hughes a military district commander testified as follows.
q in burning towns what would you do.
would the entire town be destroyed by fire or would only the offending portions of the town be burned.
gen hughes i do not know that we ever had a case of burning what you would call a town in this country but probably a barrio or a sitio probably half a dozen houses native shacks where the insurrectos would go in and be concealed and if they caught a detachment passing they would kill some of them.
q what did i understand you to say would be the consequences of that.
gen hughes they usually burned the village.
q all of the houses in the village.
gen hughes yes every one of them.
q what would become of the inhabitants.
gen hughes that was their lookout.
q if these shacks were of no consequence what was the utility of their destruction.
gen hughes the destruction was as a punishment.
they permitted these people to come in there and conceal themselves.
q the punishment in that case would fall not upon the men who could go elsewhere but mainly upon the women and little children.
gen hughes the women and children are part of the family and where you wish to inflict a punishment you can punish the man probably worse in that way than in any other.
q but is that within the ordinary rules of civilized warfare.
gen hughes these people are not civilized.
cruelties daniel j evans twelfth infantry describes the water cure q the committee would like to hear.
whether you were the witness to any cruelties inflicted upon the natives of the philippine islands and if so under what circumstances.
evans the case i had reference to was where they gave the water cure to a native in the ilicano province at ilocos norte.
about the month of august 1900.
there were two native scouts with the american forces.
they went out and brought in a couple of insurgents.
they tried to get from this insurgent.
where the rest of the insurgents were at that time.
the first thing one of the americans i mean one of the scouts for the americans grabbed one of the men by the head and jerked his head back and then they took a tomato can and poured water down his throat until he could hold no more.
then they forced a gag into his mouth they stood him up.
against a post and fastened him so that he could not move.
then one man an american soldier who was over six feet tall and who was very strong too struck this native in the pit of the stomach as hard as he could.
they kept that operation up for quite a time and finally i thought the fellow was about to die but i dont believe he was as bad as that because finally he told them he would tell and from that day on he was taken away and i saw no more of him.

part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 roosevelt reviewed americas weak position in the pacific and declined.
he conceded that japan had a paramount interest in what surrounds the yellow sea in 1908 the united states and japan signed the roottakahira agreement confirming principles of free oceanic commerce and recognizing japans authority over manchuria.
william howard taft entered the white house in 1909 convinced that the united states had been shortchanged in asia.
he pressed for a larger role for american investors especially in chinese railroad construction.
eager to promote u s business interests abroad he hoped that infusions of american capital would offset japanese power.
when the chinese revolution of 1911 toppled the manchu dynasty taft supported the victorious nationalists who wanted to modernize their country and liberate it from japanese domination.
the united states had entangled itself in china and entered a long term rivalry with japan for power in the pacific a competition that would culminate thirty years later in world war ii.
the united states and latin america roosevelt famously argued that the united states should speak softly and carry a big stick by big stick he meant naval power and rapid access to two oceans required a canal.
european powers conceded the united statess paramount interest in the caribbean.
freed by britains surrender of canal building rights in the hay pauncefote treaty 1901 roosevelt persuaded congress to authorize 10 million plus future payments of 250 000 per year to purchase from colombia a six mile strip of land across panama a colombian province.
furious when colombia rejected this proposal roosevelt contemplated outright seizure of panama but settled on a more roundabout solution.
panamanians long separated from colombia by remote jungle chafed under colombian rule.
the united states lent covert assistance to an independence movement triggering a bloodless revolution.
on november 6 1903 the united states recognized the new nation of panama two weeks later it obtained a perpetually renewable lease on a canal zone.
roosevelt never regretted the venture though in 1922 the united states paid colombia 25 million as a kind of conscience money.
to build the canal the u s army corps of engineers hired 60 000 laborers who came from many countries to clear vast swamps excavate 240 million cubic yards of earth and construct a series of immense locks.
the project a major engineering feat took eight years and cost thousands of lives among the workers who built it.
opened in 1914 the panama canal gave panama canal workers 1910 the 51 mile long panama canal includes seven sets of locks that can raise and lower fifty large ships in a twenty four hour period.
building the canal took eight years and required over 50 000 workers including immigrants from spain and italy and many west indians such as these men who accomplished some of the worst paid most dangerous labor.
workers endured the horrors of rockslides explosions and a yellow fever epidemic that almost halted the project.
but american observers hailed the canal as a triumph of modern science and engineering especially in medical efforts to eradicate the yellow fever and malaria that had stymied earlier canal building efforts.
theodore roosevelt insisted on making a personal visit in november 1906.
he made the men that were building there feel like they were special people recalled the descendant of one canal worker.
give them pride of what they were doing for the united states library of congress.
chapter 21 the united states a commanding position in the western hemisphere.
meanwhile arguing that instability invited european intervention roosevelt announced in 1904 that the united states would police all of the caribbean map 21 2.
this so called roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine actually turned that doctrine upside down instead of guaranteeing that the united states would protect its neighbors from europe and help preserve their independence it asserted the united statess unrestricted right to regulate caribbean affairs.
the roosevelt corollary was not a treaty but a unilateral declaration sanctioned only by americas military and economic might.
citing it the united states intervened regularly in caribbean and central american nations over the next three decades.
entering office in 1913 democratic president woodrow wilson criticized his predecessors foreign policy.
he pledged that the united states would never again seek one additional foot of territory by conquest this stance appealed to anti imperialists in the democratic base including longtime supporters of william jennings bryan.
but the new president soon showed that when american interests called for it his actions were not so different from those of roosevelt and taft.
since the 1870s mexican dictator porfirio daz had created a friendly climate for american companies that an emerging world power 1890 1918 purchased mexican plantations mines and oil fields.
by the early 1900s however daz feared the extraordinary power of these foreign interests and began to nationalize reclaim key resources.
american investors who faced the loss of mexican holdings began to back francisco madero an advocate of constitutional government who was friendly to u s interests.
in 1911 madero forced daz to resign and proclaimed himself president.
thousands of poor mexicans took this opportunity to mobilize rural armies and demand more radical change.
maderos position was weak and several strongmen sought to overthrow him in 1913 he was deposed and murdered by a leading general.
immediately several other military men vied for control.
wilson fearing that the unrest threatened u s interests decided to intervene in the emerging mexican revolution.
on the pretext of a minor insult to the navy he ordered u s occupation of the port of veracruz on april 21 1914 at the cost of 19 american and 126 mexican lives.
though the intervention helped venustiano carranza the revolutionary leader whom wilson most favored carranza protested it as illegitimate meddling in mexican affairs.
carranzas forces after nearly engaging the americans themselves entered mexico city in triumph a few months later.
though wilson had supported this outcome his interference caused lasting mistrust.

carranzas victory did not subdue revolutionary activity in mexico.
in 1916 general francisco pancho villa a thug to his enemies but a heroic robin hood to many poor mexicans crossed the u s mexico border killing sixteen american civilians and raiding the town of columbus new mexico.
wilson sent 11 000 troops to pursue villa a force that soon resembled an army of occupation in northern mexico.
mexican public opinion demanded withdrawal as armed clashes broke out between u s and mexican troops.
at the brink of war both governments backed off and u s forces departed.
but policymakers in washington had shown their intention to police not only the caribbean and central america but also mexico when they deemed it necessary.
the united states in world war i while the united states staked claims around the globe a war of unprecedented scale was brewing in europe.
the military buildup of germany a rising power terrified its neighbors.
to the east the disintegrating ottoman empire was losing its grip on the balkans.
out of these conflicts two rival power blocs emerged the triple alliance germany austriahungary and italy and triple entente britain france and russia.
within each alliance national governments pursued their own interests but were bound to one another by both public and secret treaties.
americans had no obvious stake in these developments.
in 1905 when germany suddenly challenged french control of morocco theodore roosevelt arranged an international conference to defuse the crisis.
germany got a few concessions but france with british backing retained morocco.
accomplished in the same year that roosevelt brokered peace between russia and japan the conference seemed another diplomatic triumph.
one u s official boasted that america had kept peace by the power of our detachment it was not to last.
from neutrality to war the spark that ignited world war i came in the balkans where austria hungary and russia competed for control.
austrias 1908 seizure of ottoman provinces including bosnia angered the nearby slavic nation of serbia and its ally russia.
serbian revolutionaries recruited bosnian slavs to resist austrian rule.
in june 1914 in the city of sarajevo university student gavrilo princip assassinated archduke franz ferdinand heir to the austro hungarian throne.
like dominos falling the system of european alliances pushed all the powers into war.
austria hungary blamed serbia for the assassination and declared war on july 28.
russia tied by secret treaty to serbia mobilized against austria hungary.
this prompted germany to declare war on russia and its ally france.
as a preparation for attacking france germany launched a brutal invasion of the neutral country of belgium which caused great britain to declare war on germany.
chapter 21 within a week most of europe was at war with the major allies great britain france and russia confronting the central powers of germany and austria hungary.
two military zones emerged.
on the western front germany battled the british and french on the eastern front germany and austriahungary fought russia.
because most of the warring nations held colonial empires the conflict soon spread to the middle east africa and asia.
the so called great war wreaked terrible devastation.
new technology some of it devised in the united states made warfare deadlier than ever before.
every soldier carried a long range high velocity rifle that could hit a target at 1 000 yards a vast technical advancement over the 300 yard range of rifles used in the u s civil war.
the machine gun was even more deadly.
its american born inventor hiram maxim had moved to britain in the 1880s to follow a friends advice if you want to make your fortune invent something which will allow those fool europeans to kill each other more quickly new technologies helped soldiers in defensive positions once advancing germans ran into french fortifications they stalled.
across a swath of belgium and northeastern france millions of soldiers on both sides hunkered down in fortified trenches.
during 1916 repeatedly trying to break through french lines at verdun germans suffered 450 000 casualties.
the french fared even worse with 550 000 dead or wounded.
it was all to no avail.
from 1914 to 1918 the western front barely moved.
at the wars outbreak president wilson called on americans to be neutral in fact as well as in name if the united states remained out of the conflict wilson reasoned he could influence the postwar settlement much as theodore roosevelt had done after previous conflicts.
even if wilson had wished to it would have been nearly impossible in 1914 to unite americans behind the allies.
many irish immigrants viewed britain as an enemy based on its continued occupation of ireland while millions of german americans maintained ties to their homeland.
progressive minded republicans such as senator robert la follette of wisconsin vehemently opposed taking sides in a european fight as did socialists who condemned the war as a conflict among greedy capitalist empires.
two giants of american industry andrew carnegie and henry ford opposed the war.
in december 1915 ford sent a hundred men and women to europe on a peace ship to urge an end to the war.

the struggle to remain neutral the united states wishing to trade with all the warring nations might have remained neutral if britain had not held commanding power at sea.
in september 1914 the british imposed a naval blockade on the central powers to cut off vital supplies of food and military equipment.
though the wilson administration protested this infringement of the rights of neutral carriers commerce with the allies more than made up for the economic loss.
trade with britain and france grew fourfold over the next two years to 3 2 billion in 1916 part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 by 1917 u s banks had lent the allies 2 5 billion.
in contrast american trade and loans to germany stood then at a mere 56 million.
this imbalance undercut u s neutrality.
if germany won and britain and france defaulted on their debts american companies would suffer catastrophic losses.
to challenge the british navy germany launched a devastating new weapon the u boat short for unterseeboot undersea boat or submarine.
in april 1915 germany issued a warning that all ships flying flags of britain or its allies were liable to destruction.
a few weeks later a u boat torpedoed the british luxury liner lusitania off the coast of ireland killing 1 198 people including 128 americans.
the attack on the passenger ship which was later revealed to have been carrying munitions incensed americans.
the following year in an agreement known as the sussex pledge germany agreed not to target passenger liners or merchant ships unless an inspection showed the latter carried weapons.
but the lusitania sinking prompted wilson to reconsider his options.
after quietly trying to mediate in europe but finding neither side interested in peace he endorsed a 1 billion u s military buildup.
american public opinion still ran strongly against entering the war a fact that shaped the election of 1916.
republicans rejected the belligerently prowar theodore roosevelt in favor of supreme court justice charles evans hughes a progressive former governor of new york.
democrats renominated wilson who campaigned on his domestic record and as the president who kept us out of war wilson eked out a narrow victory winning california by a mere 4 000 votes he secured a slim majority in the electoral college.
america enters the war despite wilsons campaign slogan events pushed him toward war.
in february 1917 germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare a decision dictated by the impasse on the western front.
in response wilson broke off diplomatic relations with germany.
a few weeks later newspapers published an intercepted dispatch from german foreign secretary arthur zimmermann to his minister in mexico.
the zimmermann teleidentify causes gram urged mexico to join the what factors led the central powers promising that if united states to enter the united states entered the war world war i despite germany would help mexico the desire of so many recover the lost territory of americans including the texas new mexico and arizona president to stay out of with pancho villas border raids the war.
still fresh in americans minds this threat jolted public opinion.
meanwhile german u boats attacked u s ships without warning sinking three on march 18 alone.
on april 2 1917 wilson asked congress for a declaration of war.
he argued that germany had trampled on american rights and imperiled u s trade and citizens lives.
we desire no conquest wilson declared no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make reflecting his progressive idealism wilson promised that american involvement would make the world safe for democracy on april 6 the united states declared war on germany.
reflecting the nations divided views the vote was far from unanimous.
six senators and fifty members of the house voted against entry including representative jeannette rankin of montana the first woman elected to congress.
you can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake rankin said.
i want to stand by my country but i cannot vote for war over there to americans europe seemed a great distance away.
many assumed the united states would simply provide munitions and economic aid.
good lord exclaimed one u s senator to a wilson administration official youre not going to send soldiers over there are you but when general john j pershing asked how the united states could best support the allies the french commander put it bluntly men men and more men amid war fever thousands of young men prepared to go over there in the words of george m cohans popular song make your daddy glad to have had such a lad.
tell your sweetheart not to pine to be proud her boys in line americans join the war in 1917 the u s army numbered fewer than 200 000 soldiers needing more men congress instituted a military draft in may 1917.
in contrast to the civil war when resistance was common conscription went smoothly partly because local civilian run draft boards played a central role in the new system.
still draft registration demonstrated governments increasing power over ordinary citizens.
on a single day june 5 1917 more than 9 5 million men between the ages of twenty one and thirty registered at local voting precincts for possible military service.
president wilson chose general pershing to head the american expeditionary force aef which had to be trained outfitted and carried across the submarineplagued atlantic.
this required safer shipping.
when chapter 21 an emerging world power 1890 1918 safe sex vintage 1919 to teach young american men how to avoid venereal diseases the war department used posters pep talks and films.
there were no effective treatments for venereal infections until 1928 when alexander fleming discovered penicillin and so the army urged soldiers to refrain from visiting prostitutes or to use condoms.

the united states entered the war german u boats were sinking 900 000 tons of allied ships each month.
by sending merchant and troop ships in armed convoys the u s navy cut that monthly rate to 400 000 tons by the end of 1917.
with trench warfare grinding on allied commanders pleaded for american soldiers to fill their depleted units but pershing waited until the aef reached full strength.
as late as may 1918 the brunt of the fighting fell to the french and british.
the allies burden increased when the eastern front collapsed following the bolshevik communist revolution in russia in november 1917.
to consolidate power at home the new bolshevik government led by vladimir lenin sought peace with the central powers.
in a 1918 treaty russia surrendered its claims over vast parts of its territories in exchange for peace.
released from war against germany the bolsheviks turned their attention to a civil war at home.
terrified by communism japan and several allied countries including the united states later sent troops to fight the bolsheviks and aid forces loyal to the deposed tsar.
but after a four year civil war lenins forces established full control over russia and reclaimed ukraine and other former possessions.
peace with russia freed germany to launch a major offensive on the western front.
by may 1918 german troops had advanced to within 50 miles of paris.
pershing at last committed about 60 000 u s soldiers to support the french defense.
with american soldiers engaged in massive numbers allied forces brought the germans to a halt in july by september they forced a retreat.
pershing then pitted more than one million american soldiers against an outexplain numbered and exhausted german consequences army in the argonne forest.
by how did u s military entry early november this attack broke into world war i affect the german defenses at a crucial rail course of the war.
the cost was high 26 000 americans killed and 95 000 wounded map 21 3.
but the flood of u s troops and supplies determined the outcome.
recognizing inevitable defeat and facing popular uprisings at home germany signed an armistice on november 11 1918.
the great war was over.
the american fighting force by the end of world war i almost 4 million american men popularly known as doughboys wore u s uniforms as did several thousand female nurses.
the recruits reflected americas heterogeneity one fifth had been born outside the united states and soldiers spoke forty nine different languages.
though ethnic diversity worried some observers most predicted that military service would promote americanization.
over 400 000 african american men enlisted accounting for 13 percent of the armed forces.
their wartime experiences were often grim serving in segregated units they were given the most menial tasks.
racial discrimination hampered military efficiency and provoked violence at several camps.
the worst incident occurred in august 1917 when after suffering a string of racial attacks black members of the 24th infantrys third battalion rioted in houston killing 15 white civilians and police officers.

unlike african americans american indians served in integrated combat units.
racial stereotypes about native americans prowess as warriors enhanced their military reputations but it also prompted officers to assign them hazardous duties as scouts and snipers.
about 13 000 or 25 percent of the adult male american indian population served during the war roughly 5 percent died compared to 2 percent for the military as a whole.
most american soldiers escaped the horrors of sustained trench warfare.
still during the brief period of u s participation over 50 000 servicemen died in action another 63 000 died from disease mainly the devastating influenza pandemic that began early in 1918 and over the next two years killed 50 million people worldwide.
the nations military deaths though substantial were only a tenth as many as the 500 000 american civilians who died of this terrible epidemic not to mention the staggering losses of europeans in the war america compared p 689.
war on the home front in the united states opponents of the war were a minority.
helping the allies triggered an economic boom that benefitted farmers and working people.
many progressives also supported the war hoping wilsons ideals and wartime patriotism would renew americans attention to reform.
but the war bitterly disappointed them.
rather than enhancing democracy it chilled the political climate as government agencies tried to enforce 100 percent loyalty mobilizing the economy american businesses made big bucks from world war i.
as grain weapons and manufactured goods flowed to britain and france the united states became a creditor nation.
moreover as the war drained british financial reserves u s banks provided capital for investments around the globe.
government powers expanded during wartime with new federal agencies overseeing almost every part of the economy.
the war industries board wib established in july 1917 directed military production.
after a fumbling start that showed the limits of voluntarism the wilson administration reorganized the board and placed bernard baruch a wall street financier and superb administrator at its head.
under his direction the wib allocated scarce resources among industries ordered factories to convert to war production set prices and standardized procedures.
though he could compel compliance baruch preferred to win voluntary cooperation.
a man of immense charm he usually succeeded helped by the lucrative military contracts at his disposal.
despite higher taxes corporate america c o m pa r e d the united states played a crucial role in financing world war i.
in its war related expenditures totaling 22 6 billion the united states ranked fourth among all nations that participated ranking behind only germany 37 7 billion britain 35 3 billion and france 24 3 billion.
in human terms however the u s role was different.

perhaps the most successful wartime agency was the food administration created in august 1917 and led by engineer herbert hoover.
with the slogan food part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 fighting the flu influenza traversed the globe in 1918 1919 becoming a pandemic that killed as many as 50 million people.
according to recent research the flu began as a virus native to wild birds and then mutated into a form that passed easily from one human to another.
in the united states one fifth of the population was infected and more than 500 000 civilians died ten times the number of american soldiers who died in combat during world war i.
the flu virus spread with frightening speed and the epidemic strained the resources of a u s public health system already fully mobilized for the war effort.
in october 1918 alone 200 000 americans died.

this increase allowed a threefold rise in food exports to europe.
among citizens the food administration mobilized a spirit of self denial rather than mandatory rationing.
female volunteers went from door to door to persuade housekeepers to observe wheatless mondays and porkless thursdays.
hoover a republican emerged from the war as one of the nations most admired public figures.
promoting national unity suppressing wartime dissent became a near obsession for president wilson.
in april 1917 wilson formed the committee on public information cpi a government propaganda agency headed by journalist george creel.
professing lofty goals educating citizens about democracy assimilating immigrants and ending the isolation of rural life the committee set out to mold americans into one white hot mass of war patriotism.
the cpi touched the lives of nearly all civilians.
it distributed seventyfive million pieces of literature and enlisted thousands of volunteers four minute men to deliver short prowar speeches at movie theaters.
the cpi also pressured immigrant groups to become one hundred percent americans german americans bore the brunt of this campaign thinking like a historian p 692.
with posters exhorting chapter 21 an emerging world power 1890 1918 selling liberty bonds two appeals once the united states entered the great war government officials sought to enlist all americans in the battle against the central powers.

one of these posters appeals to recent immigrants reminding them of their debt to american liberty.

in 1918 members of the league led violent raids against draft evaders and peace activists.
government propaganda helped rouse a nativist hysteria that lingered into the 1920s.
congress also passed new laws to curb dissent.
among them was the sedition act of 1918 which prohibited any words or behavior that might incite provoke or encourage resistance to the united states or promote the cause of its enemies because this and an earlier espionage act 1917 defined treason loosely they led to the conviction of more than a thousand people.

socialist party leader eugene v debs was sentenced to ten years in jail for the crime of arguing that wealthy capitalists had started the conflict and were forcing workers to fight.

in schenck v united states 1919 the supreme court upheld the conviction of a socialist who was jailed for circulating pamphlets that urged army draftees to resist induction.
the justices followed this with a similar decision in abrams v united states 1919 ruling that authorities could prosecute speech they believed to thinking like a historian german americans in world war i before 1917 americans expressed diverse opinions about the war in europe.
after the united states joined the allies however german americans loyalty became suspect.
german immigrant men who were not u s citizens were required to register as alien enemies and government propaganda fueled fear of alleged german spies.
in april 1918 in collinsville illinois a german born socialist named robert prager who had sought u s citizenship and tried to enlist in the navy was lynched by drunken miners.

the great majority of american citizens of german descent have in this great crisis in our history shown themselves splendidly loyal to our flag.
everyone has a right to sympathize with any warring nation.
but now that we are in the war there are only two sides and the time has come when every citizen must declare himself american or traitor.
the foreign minister of germany once said to me.
we have in your country 500 000 german reservists who will rise in arms against your government if you dare to make a move against germany well i told him that that might be so but that we had 500 001 lampposts in this country and that that was where the reservists would be hanging the day after they tried to rise.
and if there are any german americans here who are so ungrateful for all the benefits they have received that they are still for the kaiser there is only one thing to do with them.

great migrations world war i created tremendous economic opportunities at home.
jobs in war industries drew thousands of people to the cities.
with so many men in uniform jobs in heavy industry opened for the first time to african americans accelerating the pace of black migration from south to north.
during world war i more than 400 000 african americans moved to such cities as st louis chicago new york and detroit in what became known as the great migration.
the rewards were great and taking war jobs could be a source of patriotic pride.
if it hadnt been for the negro a carnegie steel manager later recalled we could hardly have carried on our operations blacks in the north encountered discrimination in jobs housing and education.
but in the first flush of opportunity most celebrated their escape from the repressive racism and poverty of the south.

continued political instability in mexico combined with increased demand for farmworkers in the united states also encouraged more mexicans to move across the border.
between 1917 and 1920 at least 100 000 mexicans entered the united states despite discrimination large numbers stayed.
if asked why many might have echoed the words of an african american man who left new orleans for chicago they were going north for a better chance the same was true for puerto ricans such as jsus coln who also confronted racism.
i came to new york to poor pay long hours terrible working conditions discrimination even in the slums and in the poor paying factories coln recalled where the bosses very dexterously pitted italians against puerto ricans and puerto ricans against american negroes and jews women were the largest group to take advantage of wartime job opportunities.
about 1 million women joined the paid labor force for the first time while another 8 million gave up low wage service jobs for higher paying industrial work.
americans soon got used to the sight of female streetcar conductors train engineers and defense workers.
though most people expected these jobs to return to men in peacetime the chapter 21 an emerging world power 1890 1918 women riveters at the puget sound navy yard 1919 with men at the front women took many new jobs during world war i as mail carriers police officers and farm laborers who joined the womens land army.
african american women generally limited by white prejudice to jobs in domestic service and agriculture found that the war opened up new opportunities and better wages in industry.
when the war ended women usually lost jobs deemed to be mens work.
in 1919 however these women were still hard at work in the puget sound navy yard near seattle.
what clues indicate their attitudes toward their work and toward one another.
national archives.
war created a new comfort level with womens employment outside the home and with womens suffrage.
womens voting rights the national american woman suffrage association nawsa threw the support of its 2 million members wholeheartedly into the war effort.
its president carrie chapman catt declared that women had to prove their patriotism to win the ballot.
nawsa members in thousands of communities promoted food conservation and distributed emergency relief through organizations such as the red cross.
alice paul and the national womans party nwp took a more confrontational approach.
paul was a quaker who had worked in the settlement movement and earned a phd in political science.
finding as a nawsa lobbyist that congressmen dismissed her paul founded the nwp in 1916.
inspired by militant british suffragists the group began in july 1917 to picket the white house.
standing silently with their banners paul and other nwp activists faced arrest for obstructing traffic and were sentenced to seven months in jail.
they protested by going on a hunger strike which prison authorities met with forced feeding.
public shock at the explain womens treatment drew attention consequences what were the different to the suffrage cause.
impressed by nawsas patri effects of african ameriotism and worried by the nwps cans mexican americans militancy the antisuffrage wilson and womens civilian reversed his position.
in january mobilization during world 1918 he urged support for woman war i.
suffrage as a war measure the constitutional amendment quickly passed the house of representatives it took eighteen months to get through the senate and another year to win ratification by the states.

this labor day parade float created by the womens union label league of san diego showed that activists championed equal pay for women in the workplace as well as womens voting rights.
union label leagues urged middle class shoppers to purchase only clothing with a union label certifying that the item had been manufactured under safe conditions and the workers who made it had received a fair wage.

amendment became law.
the state thus joined texas as one of two ex confederate states to ratify it.
in most parts of the south the measure meant that white women began to vote in this jim crow era african american womens voting rights remained restricted along with mens.
in explaining suffragists victory historians have debated the relative effectiveness of catts patriotic strategy and pauls militant protests.
both played a role in persuading wilson and congress to act but neither might have worked without the extraordinary impact of the great war.
across the globe before 1914 the only places where women had full suffrage were new zealand australia finland and norway.
after world war i many nations moved to enfranchise women.
the new soviet union acted first in 1917 with great britain and canada following in 1918 by 1920 the measure had passed in germany austria poland czechoslovakia and hungary as well as the united states.
major exceptions were france and italy where women did not gain voting rights until after world war ii and switzerland which held out until 1971.
thus while world war i introduced modern horrors on the battlefield machine guns and poison gas it brought some positive results at home economic opportunity and womens political participation.
catastrophe at versailles the idealistic wilson argued that no victor should be declared after world war i only peace among equals could last.
having won at an incredible price britain and france showed zero interest in such a plan.
but the devastation wrought by the war created popular pressure for a just and enduring outcome.
wilson scored a diplomatic victory at the peace conference held at versailles near paris in 1919 when the allies chose to base the talks on his fourteen points a blueprint for chapter 21 an emerging world power 1890 1918 collective military action.
wilson hoped the league would end all wars but his ideals had marked limits and in negotiations he confronted harsh realities.

clemenceau who was nicknamed the tiger turns his head and comments on the crying child.
even at the time astute observers such as dyson argued that the treaty might have horrific consequences particularly in the brutal conditions it imposed on germany.
dyson sketched 1940 class over the head of the child.
the young children of 1920 grew up to inherit the consequences of the versailles treaty which contributed to the rise of fascism nazism and world war ii.
british daily herald may 13 1919 peace that he had presented a year earlier in a speech to congress.
wilsons points embodied an important strand in progressivism.
they called for open diplomacy absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas arms reduction removal of trade barriers and national selfdetermination for peoples in the austro hungarian russian and german empires.
essential to wilsons vision was the creation of an international regulatory body eventually called the league of nations that would guarantee each countrys independence and territorial integrity the league would mediate disputes supervise arms reduction and according to its crucial article x curb aggressor nations through the peace conference included ten thousand representatives from around the globe but leaders of france britain and the united states dominated the proceedings.
when the japanese delegation proposed a declaration for equal treatment of all races the allies rejected it.
similarly the allies ignored a global pan african congress organized by w e b.
du bois and other black leaders they snubbed arab representatives who had been military allies during the war.
even italys prime minister included among the influential big four because in 1915 italy had switched to the allied side withdrew from the conference aggrieved at the way british and french leaders marginalized him.
the allies excluded two key players russia because they distrusted its communist leaders and germany because they planned to dictate terms to their defeated foe.
for wilsons peace among equals it was a terrible start.
prime minister david lloyd george of britain and premier georges clemenceau of france imposed harsh punishments on germany.
unbeknownst to others at the time they had already made secret agreements to divide up germanys african colonies and take them as spoils of war.
at versailles they also forced the defeated nation to pay 33 billion in reparations and surrender coal supplies merchant ships valuable patents and even territory along the french border.
these terms caused keen resentment and economic hardship in germany and over the following two decades they helped lead to world war ii.
given these conditions it is remarkable that wilson influenced the treaty of versailles as much as he did.
he intervened repeatedly to soften conditions imposed on germany.
in accordance with the fourteen points he worked with the other allies to fashion nine new nations stretching from the baltic to the mediterranean map 21 4.
these were intended as a buffer to protect western europe from communist russia the plan also embodied wilsons principle of self determination for european states.
elsewhere in the world the allies dismantled their enemies empires but did not create independent nations keeping colonized people subordinate to european power.
france for example refused to give up its long standing occupation of indochina clemenceaus snub of future vietnamese leader ho chi minh who sought representation at versailles had part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 the versailles treaty thus created conditions for horrific future bloodshed and it must be judged one of historys great catastrophes.
balfour astutely described clemenceau lloyd george and wilson as all powerful all ignorant men sitting there and carving up continents wilson however remained optimistic as he returned home even though his health was beginning to fail.
the president hoped the new league of nations authorized by the treaty would moderate the settlement and secure peaceful resolutions of other disputes.
for this to occur u s participation was crucial.
grave long term consequences for both france and the united states.
the establishment of a british in what ways did the mandate in palestine now israel treaty of versailles also proved crucial.
during the embody or fail to war brit ish foreign secretary sir embody wilsons balfour had stated that his arthur fourteen points.
country would work to establish there a national home for the jewish people with the condition that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing nonjewish communities in palestine under the british mandate thousands of jews moved to palestine and purchased land in some cases evicting palestinian tenants.
as early as 1920 riots erupted between jews and palestinians a situation that even before world war ii escalated beyond british control.

in central europe the collapse of the german russian and austro hungarian empires brought the reconstitution of poland and the creation of a string of new states based on the principle of national ethnic self determination.
the demise of the ottoman empire resulted in the appearance of the quasi independent territories or mandates of iraq syria lebanon and palestine.
the league of nations stipulated that their affairs would be supervised by one of the allied powers.
chapter 21 held a majority in the senate.
one group called the irreconcilables consisted of western progressive republicans such as hiram johnson of california and robert la follette of wisconsin who opposed u s involvement in european affairs.
another group led by senator henry cabot lodge of massachusetts worried that article x the provision for collective security would prevent the united states from pursuing an independent foreign policy.
was the nation lodge asked willing to have the youth of america ordered to war by an international body.
wilson refused to accept any amendments especially to placate lodge a hated rival.
i shall consent to nothing the president told the french ambassador.
the senate must take its medicine to mobilize support wilson embarked on an exhausting speaking tour.
his impassioned defense of the league of nations brought audiences to tears but the strain proved too much for the president.
while visiting colorado in september 1919 wilson collapsed.
a week later back in washington he suffered a stroke that left one side of his body paralyzed.
wilson still urged democratic senators to reject all republican amendments.
when the treaty came up for a vote in november 1919 it failed to win the required two thirds majority.
a second attempt in march 1920 fell seven votes short.
the treaty was dead and so was wilsons leadership.
the president never fully recovered from his stroke.
during the last eighteen months of his administration the government drifted as wilsons physician his wife and various cabinet heads secretly took charge.
the united states never ratified the versailles treaty or joined the league of nations.
in turn the league was weak.
when wilson died in 1924 his dream of a just and peaceful international order lay in ruins.
the impact of world war i can hardly be overstated.
despite bids for power by britain and france europes hold on its colonial empires never recovered.
the united states now a major world power appeared to turn its back on the world when it rejected the versailles treaty.
but in laying claim to hawaii and the philippines asserting power in latin america and intervening in asia the united states had entangled itself deeply in global politics.
by 1918 the nation had gained too much diplomatic clout and was too dependent on overseas trade for isolation to be a realistic long term option.
on the home front the effects of world war i were no less dramatic.
wartime jobs and prosperity ushered in an era of exuberant consumerism while the an emerging world power 1890 1918 achievements of womens voting rights seemed to presage a new progressive era.
but as peace returned it became clear that the war had not advanced reform.
rather than embracing government activism americans of the 1920s proved eager to relinquish it.
summary between 1877 and 1918 the united states rose as a major economic and military power.
justifications for overseas expansion emphasized access to global markets the importance of sea power and the need to police international misconduct and trade.
these justifications shaped u s policy toward european powers in latin america and victory in the war of 1898 enabled the united states to take control of former spanish colonies in the caribbean and pacific.
victory however also led to bloody conflict in the philippines as the united states struggled to suppress filipino resistance to american rule.
after 1899 the united states aggressively asserted its interests in asia and latin america.
in china the united states used the so called boxer rebellion to make good its claim to an open door to chinese markets.
later president theodore roosevelt strengthened relations with japan and his successor william howard taft supported u s business interests in china.
in the caribbean the united states constructed the panama canal and regularly exercised the right claimed under the roosevelt corollary to intervene in the affairs of states in the region.
president woodrow wilson publicly disparaged the imperialism of his predecessors but repeatedly used the u s military to police mexico.
at the outbreak of world war i the united states asserted neutrality but its economic ties to the allies rapidly undercut that claim.
in 1917 german submarine attacks drew the united states into the war on the side of britain and france.
involvement in the war profoundly transformed the economy politics and society of the nation resulting in an economic boom mass migrations of workers to industrial centers and the achievement of national voting rights.
at the paris peace conference wilson attempted to implement his fourteen points.
however the designs of the allies in europe undermined the treaty of versailles while republican resistance at home prevented ratification of the treaty.
although wilsons dream of a just international order failed the united states had taken its place as a major world power.

the arab civilization is one of the oldest in the world but to many american born protestants movies were morally dangerous vile and atrocious one womens group declared.
the appeal of dark stars like valentino and his predecessor japanese american actor sessue hayakawa was part of the problem.
hollywood became a focal point for political conflict as the nation took a sharp right turn.
a year before the sheik appeared the reverend wilbur crafts published a widely reprinted article warning of jewish supremacy in film he accused hebrew hollywood executives of gross immorality and claimed they were racially incapable of understanding the prevailing standards of the american people these were not fringe views.
craftss editorial first appeared in a newspaper owned by prominent automaker henry ford.
critics though failed to slow hollywoods success.
faced with threats of regulation movie makers did what other big businesses did in the 1920s they used their clout to block government intervention.
at the same time they expanded into world markets when valentino visited paris he was swarmed by thousands of french fans.
the sheik highlighted americas business success and its political and cultural divides.

part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 conflicted legacies of world war i the world war has accentuated all our differences a journalist observed in 1919.
it has not created those differences but it has revealed and emphasized them in the wars immediate aftermath thousands of strikes revealed continuing labor tensions.
violent riots exposed white resistance to the rising expectations of african americans while an obsessive hunt for foreign radicals like angry denunciations of hollywoods latin lover showed that ethnic pluralism would not win easy acceptance.
racial strife african americans emerged from world war i determined to achieve citizenship rights.
millions had loyally supported the war effort 350 000 had served in uniform.
at the same time the great migration drew hundreds of thousands from the south to northern industrial cities where they secured good wartime jobs and found they could vote and use their new economic clout to build community institutions and work for racial justice.
the black man one observer wrote realized that he was part and parcel of the great army of democracy.
with this realization came the consciousness of pride in himself as a man and an american citizen these developments sparked white violence.
in the south the number of lynchings rose from 48 in 1917 to 78 in 1919 including several murders of returning black soldiers in their military uniforms.
in 1921 after a brutal lynching in the railroad town of rosewood florida black residents armed for self defense mobs of furious whites responded by torching houses and hunting down african americans.
police and state authorities refused to intervene.
the town of rosewood vanished from the map.
in northern and midwestern cities the arrival of southern migrants deepened existing racial tensions.
blacks competed with whites including recent immigrants for scarce housing and jobs.
unionized white workers resented blacks who served as strikebreakers.
racism turned such conflicts into violent confrontations.
attacks on african americans broke out in more than twenty five cities.
one of the deadliest riots chicago race riot when racial violence exploded in chicago during the summer of 1919 chicago evening post photographer jun fujita was on the scene to capture it.
as one of the few japanese immigrants in chicago at the time fujita was probably no stranger to racism and it took personal courage to put himself in the midst of the escalating violence.
when the riot finally ended thirty eight people were dead and more than five hundred were injured.

chapter 22 cultural conflict bubble and bust 1919 1932 occurred in 1917 in east st louis illinois where nine whites and more than forty blacks died.
chicago endured five days of rioting in july 1919.
by september the national death toll from racial violence reached 120.
the oil boomtown of tulsa oklahoma was the site of a horrific incident in june 1921.
sensational false reports of an alleged rape helped incite white mobs who resented growing black prosperity.
anger focused on the 8 000 residents of tulsas prosperous greenwood district locally known as the black wall street the mob helped by national guardsmen who arrested blacks who resisted burned thirty five blocks of greenwood and killed several dozen people.
the citys leading paper acknowledged that semi organized bands of white men systematically applied the torch while others shot on sight men of color it took a decade for black residents to rebuild greenwood.
erosion of labor rights african americans were not the only ones who faced challenges to their hard won gains.
the war effort overseen by a democratic administration sympathetic to labor had temporarily increased the size and power of labor unions.
the national war labor board had instituted a series of prolabor measures including recognition of workers right to organize.
membership in the american federation of labor afl grew by a third during world war i reaching more than 3 million by wars end and continued to climb afterward.
workers expectations also rose as the war economy brought higher pay and better working conditions.
but when workers tried to maintain these standards after the war employers cut wages and rooted out unions prompting massive confrontations.
in 1919 more than four million wage laborers one in every five went on strike a proportion never since equaled.
a walkout of shipyard workers in seattle sparked a general strike that shut down the city.
another strike disrupted the steel industry as 350 000 workers demanded union recognition and an end to twelvehour shifts.
elbert h gary head of united states steel corporation refused to negotiate he hired mexican and african american replacements and broke the strike.
meanwhile business leaders in rising industries such as automobile manufacturing resisted unions creating more and more nonunionized jobs.
public employees fared no better.
late in 1919 bostons police force demanded a union and went on strike to get it.
massachusetts governor calvin coolidge won national fame by declaring there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere fear of bolshevism 1919 this cartoon from the post dispatch in cleveland ohio reflects nationwide panic over the general strike by 110 unions that paralyzed seattle in february 1919.
opponents of radical labor unrest had a deeper fear the bolshevik revolution in russia resulting in creation of the ussr had brought into existence the worlds first enduring communist state.
by crushing unions in seattle with a club of law and order this image suggests that uncle sam could beat back the global communist threat.
this aspect of the 1919 red scare prefigured at an early date the anxieties of the cold war era.
ohio historical society.
anytime coolidge fired the entire police force the strike failed.
a majority of the public supported the governor.
republicans rewarded coolidge by nominating him for the vice presidency in 1920.
antilabor decisions by the supreme court were an additional key factor in unions decline.
in coronado coal company v united mine workers 1925 the court ruled place events that a striking union could be in context penalized for illegal restraint what factors contributed of trade.
the court also struck to antiblack violence labor down federal legislation regulat defeats and the red scare and what connections ing child labor in adkins v childmight we draw among rens hospital 1923 it voided these events.
a minimum wage for women part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 workers in the district of columbia reversing many of the gains that had been achieved through the groundbreaking decision in muller v oregon chapter 20.
such decisions along with aggressive antiunion campaigns caused membership in labor unions to fall from 5 1 million in 1920 to 3 6 million in 1929 just 10 percent of the nonagricultural workforce.
in place of unions the 1920s marked the heyday of welfare capitalism a system of labor relations that stressed managements responsibility for employees well being.
automaker henry ford among others pioneered this system before world war i famously paying 5 a day.
ford also offered a profit sharing plan to employees who met the standards of its social department which investigated to ensure that workers private lives met the companys moral standards.
at a time when government unemployment compensation and social security did not exist general electric and u s steel provided health insurance and old age pensions.
other employers like chicagos western electric company built athletic facilities and selectively offered paid vacations.
employers hoped this would build a loyal workforce and head off labor unrest.
but such plans covered only about 5 percent of the industrial workforce.
facing new financial pressures in the 1920s even henry ford cut back his 5 day.
in the tangible benefits it offered workers welfare capitalism had serious limitations.
the red scare many well off americans sided with management in the upheavals of the postwar years.
they blamed workers for the rapidly rising cost of living which jumped nearly 80 percent between 1917 and 1919.
the socialist views of some recent immigrants frightened nativeborn citizens communism terrified them.
when in 1919 the soviet unions new bolshevik leaders founded the third international intended to foster revolutions abroad some americans began to fear that dangerous radicals were hiding everywhere.
wartime hatred of germans was replaced by hostility toward bolsheviks labeled reds after the color of communist flags.
ironically american communists remained few in number and had little political influence.
of the 50 million adults in the united states in 1920 no more than 70 000 belonged to either the fledgling u s communist party or the communist labor party.
in april 1919 alert postal workers discovered and defused thirty four mail bombs addressed to government officials.

general a mitchell palmer.
palmer escaped unharmed but he used the incident to fan public fears precipitating a hysterical red scare.
with president woodrow wilson incapacitated by stroke palmer had a free chapter 22 hand.
he set up an antiradicalism division in the justice department and appointed his assistant j edgar hoover to direct it shortly afterward it became the federal bureau of investigation fbi.
in november 1919 palmers agents stormed the headquarters of radical organizations.
the dragnet captured thousands of aliens who had committed no crimes but who held anarchist or revolutionary beliefs.
lacking the protection of u s citizenship many were deported without indictment or trial.
the palmer raids peaked on a notorious night in january 1920 when federal agents invaded homes and meeting halls arrested six thousand citizens and aliens and denied the prisoners access to legal counsel.
then palmer who had presidential ambitions overreached.
he predicted that on may 1 a radical conspiracy would attempt to overthrow the u s government.
state militia and police went on twenty four hour alert to guard against the alleged threat but not a single incident occurred.
as the summer of 1920 passed without major strikes or renewed bombings the red scare began to abate.
like other postwar legacies however antiradicalism had broad long lasting effects.
in may 1920 at the height of the red scare police arrested nicola sacco a shoemaker and bartolomeo vanzetti a fish peddler for the murder of two men during a robbery of a shoe company in south braintree massachusetts.
sacco and vanzetti were italian aliens and self proclaimed anarchists who had evaded the draft.
convicted of the murders sacco and vanzetti sat in jail for six years while supporters appealed their verdicts.
in 1927 judge webster thayer denied a motion for a new trial and sentenced them to death.
scholars still debate their guilt or innocence.
but the case was clearly biased by prosecutors emphasis on their ties to radical groups.
the execution of sacco and vanzetti was one of the ugly scars left by the ethnic and political hostilities of the great war.
politics in the 1920s as the plight of labor suggested the 1920s were a tough decade for progressives who had gained ground before world war i.
after a few early reform victories including achievement of national womens suffrage the dominant motif of the 1920s was limited government.
native born white protestants rallied against what they saw as big city values and advocated such goals as immigration restriction.
a series of republican presidents placed responsibility for the nations well being cultural conflict bubble and bust 1919 1932 in the hands of business.
president calvin coolidge declared the man who builds a factory builds a temple.
the man who works there worships there the same theme prevailed in continued u s interventions in latin america and elsewhere american business needs were the top priority.
women in politics at the start of the 1920s many progressives hoped the attainment of womens voting rights would offer new leverage to tackle poverty.
they created organizations like the womens joint congressional committee a washington based advocacy group.
the committees greatest accomplishment was the first federally funded health care legislation the sheppard towner federal maternity and infancy act 1921.
sheppard towner provided federal funds for medical clinics prenatal education programs and visiting nurses.
though opponents warned that the act would lead to socialized medicine sheppard towner improved health care for the poor and significantly lowered infant mortality rates.
it also marked the first time that congress designated federal funds for the states to encourage them to administer a social welfare program.
in 1923 alice paul founder explain of the national womans party consequences also persuaded congressional allies before world war i to consider an equal rights women didnt have full amendment era to the u s voting rights but they had constitution.
it stated simply considerable success as men and women shall have equal reformers.
after the war rights throughout the united they could vote but their states advocates were hopeful proposals met defeat.
how wisconsin had passed a similar might we account for this law two years earlier and it helped apparent contradiction.
women fight gender discrimination.
but opponents pointed out that the era would threaten recent labor laws that protected women from workplace abuses.
such laws recognized womens vulnerable place in a heavily sex segregated labor market.
would a theoretical statement of equality help poor and working women more than existing protections did.
this question divided womens rights advocates.
introduced repeatedly in congress over the next five decades but rarely making it out of committee the era was debated again and again until the bitter ratification struggle of the 1970s chapter 29.
horrified at the suffering caused by world war i some women joined a growing international peace movement.
while diplomats conducted negotiations at versailles women peace advocates from around the part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 such women faced serious opposition.
the wilpf came under fierce attack during the red scare because it included socialist women in its ranks.
and though women proved to be effective lobbyists they had difficulty gaining access to positions inside the republican and democratic parties.
finding that women did not vote as a bloc politicians in both parties began to take their votes for granted.
new reforms failed to gain support and others were rolled back.
many congressmen for example had supported the sheppard towner act because they feared the voting power of women but congress ended the program in the late 1920s.
republicans and business the league of women voters the league of women voters was the brainchild of carrie chapman catt president of the national american woman suffrage association.
formed in 1920 as the nineteenth amendment was about to give women the vote the league undertook to educate americans in responsible citizenship and to win enactment of legislation favorable to women.
the league helped secure passage of the sheppard towner act of 1921 which provided federal aid for maternal and child care programs.
in the 1930s members campaigned for the enactment of social security and other social welfare legislation.
the library of virginia world convened in zurich and called on all nations to use their resources to end hunger and promote human welfare.
treaty negotiators ignored them but the women organized for sustained activism.
in 1919 they created the womens international league for peace and freedom wilpf whose leading american members included jane addams.
members of the league denounced imperialism stressed the human suffering caused by militarism and proposed social justice measures.
with president wilson ailing in 1920 democrats nominated ohio governor james m cox for president on a platform calling for u s participation in the league of nations and continuation of wilsons progressivism.
republicans led by their probusiness wing tapped genial ohio senator warren g harding.
in a dig at wilsons idealism harding promised not nostrums but normalcy on election day he won in a landslide beginning an era of republican dominance that lasted until 1932.
hardings most energetic appointee was secretary of commerce herbert hoover well known as head of the wartime food administration.
under hoovers direction the commerce department helped create two thousand trade associations representing companies in almost every major industry.
government officials worked closely with the associations providing statistical research suggesting industry wide standards and promoting stable prices and wages.
hoover hoped that through voluntary business cooperation with government an associated state he could achieve what progressives had sought through governmental regulation.
this meant of course giving corporate leaders greater policymaking power.
more sinister links between government and corporate interests were soon revealed.
when president harding died suddenly of a heart attack in august 1923 evidence was just emerging that parts of his administration were riddled with corruption.
the worst scandal concerned secret leasing of government oil reserves in teapot dome wyoming and elk hills california to private companies.
secretary of the interior albert fall was eventually convicted of taking 300 000 in bribes and became the first cabinet officer in u s history to serve a prison sentence.
vice president calvin coolidge became president upon hardings death.
he maintained republican chapter 22 dominance while offering with his austere yankee morality a contrast to his predecessors cronyism.
campaigning for election in his own right in 1924 coolidge called for limited government and tax cuts for business.
rural and urban democrats deeply divided over such issues as prohibition and immigration restriction deadlocked at their national convention after 102 ballots delegates finally nominated john w davis a wall street lawyer.
coolidge easily defeated davis and staved off a challenge from senator robert m la follette of wisconsin who tried to resuscitate the progressive party.
the 1924 progressive platform called for stronger government regulation at home and international efforts to reduce weapons production and prevent war.
free men of every generation it declared must combat the renewed efforts of organized force and greed in the end coolidge received 15 7 million votes to daviss 8 4 million and la follettes 4 9 million.

for the most part republicans dropped progressive initiatives of the prewar years.
the federal trade commission failed to enforce antitrust laws.
the supreme court now headed by former republican president william howard taft refused to break up the mammoth u s steel corporation despite evidence of its near monopoly status.
with the agricultural sector facing hardship congress sought to aid farmers with the mcnary haugen bills of 1927 and 1928 which proposed a system of federal price supports for major crops.
but president coolidge opposed the bills as special interest legislation and vetoed them both.
while some state and municipal leaders continued to pursue ambitious agendas they were shut out of federal power.
dollar diplomacy political campaigns emphasized domestic issues in the 1920s but while the united states refused to join the league of nations the federal government remained deeply engaged in foreign affairs.
republican presidents worked to advance u s business interests especially by encouraging private banks to make foreign loans part of the broader government business alliance in republicans associated state.
policymakers hoped loans would stimulate growth and increase demand for u s products in developing markets.
bankers though wanted cultural conflict bubble and bust 1919 1932 government guarantees of repaycompare and ment in countries they perceived contrast as weak or unstable.

hefty profit state department officials pressured the south american nation to accept it.
diplomats also forced bolivia to agree to financial oversight by a commission under the banks control.
a similar arrangement was reached with el salvadors government in 1923.
in other cases the united states intervened militarily often to force repayment of debt.
to implement such policies the u s marines occupied nicaragua almost continuously from 1912 to 1933 the dominican republic from 1916 to 1924 and haiti from 1915 to 1934.
in these lengthy military deployments americans came to think of the occupied countries as essentially u s possessions much like puerto rico and the philippines.
sensational memoirs by marines who had served in haiti popularized the island as the american africa white americans became fascinated by vodou voodoo and other haitian religious customs reinforcing their view of haitians as dangerous savages or childlike people who needed u s guidance and supervision.
one commander testified that his troops saw themselves as trustees of a huge estate that belonged to minors.
the haitians were our wards at home critics denounced loan guarantees and military interventions as dollar diplomacy.
the term was coined in 1924 by samuel guy inman a disciples of christ missionary who toured u s occupied haiti and the dominican republic.
the united states inman declared cannot go on destroying with impunity the sovereignty of other peoples however weak african american leaders also denounced the haitian occupation.
on behalf of the womens international league for peace and freedom and the international council of women of the darker races a delegation conducted a fact finding tour of haiti in 1926.
their report exposed among other things the sexual exploitation of haitian women by u s soldiers.
by the late 1920s dollar diplomacy was on the defensive in keeping with a broader disgust over international affairs.

but the loans part 7 domestic and global challenges 1890 1945 often ended up in the pockets of local elites u s policies failed to build broad based prosperity overseas.
military intervention had even worse results.
in haiti for example the marines crushed peasant protests and helped the haitian elite consolidate power.
u s occupation thus helped create the conditions for harsh dictatorships that haitians endured through the rest of the twentieth century.
culture wars by 1929 ninety three u s cities had populations of more than 100 000.
new york citys population exceeded 7 million los angeless had exploded to 1 2 million.
the lives and beliefs of urban americans often differed dramatically from those in small towns and farming areas.
native born rural protestants faced with a dire perceived threat rallied in the 1920s to protect what they saw as american values.
prohibition rural and native born protestants started the decade with the achievement of a longtime goal national prohibition of liquor chapter 18.
wartime anti german prejudice was a major spur.
since breweries like pabst and anheuser busch were owned by german americans many citizens decided it was unpatriotic to drink beer.
mobilizing the economy for war congress also limited brewers and distillers use of barley and other scarce grains causing consumption to decline.
the decades long prohibition campaign culminated with congresss passage of the eighteenth amendment in 1917.
ratified over the next two years by nearly every state and taking effect in january 1920 the amendment prohibited manufacture sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors anywhere in the united states.
defenders hailed prohibition as a victory for health morals and christian values.
in urban areas though thousands flagrantly ignored the law.
patrons flocked to urban speakeasies or illegal drinking sites which flourished in almost every chicago neighborhood one raid on a south side speakeasy yielded 200 000 gallons of alcohol.
profits from the secret clubs enriched notorious gangsters such as chicagos al capone and new yorks jack diamond.
in california arizona and texas tens of thousands of americans streamed south of the border mexico regulated liquor but kept it legal along with gambling drugs and prostitution leading to the rise of booming vice towns such as tijuana and mexicali places that had been virtually uninhabited before 1900.
u s nightclub owners in these cities included such prominent figures as african american boxer jack johnson.
by 1928 the american investors who built a 10 million resort racetrack and casino in tijuana became known as border barons.

chapter 22.
roosevelt from a prominent family had chosen an unconventional path.
after graduating from harvard he plunged into politics winning a seat as a republican new york assemblyman.
disillusioned by his partys resistance to reform he left politics in the mid 1880s and moved to a north dakota ranch.
but his cattle herd was wiped out in the blizzards of 1887.
he returned east winning appointments as a u s civil service commissioner head of the new york city police commission and mckinleys assistant secretary of the navy.
an energetic presence in all these jobs roosevelt gained broad knowledge of the problems america faced at the municipal state and federal levels.
after serving in the war of 1898 chapter 21 roosevelt was elected as new yorks governor.
in this job he pushed through civil service reform and a tax on corporations.
seeking to neutralize this progressive and rather unpredictable political star republican bosses chose roosevelt as mckinleys running mate in 1900 hoping the vice presidency would be a political dead end.
instead they suddenly found roosevelt in the white house.
the new president who called for vigorous reform represented a major shift for the republicans.
antitrust legislation roosevelt blended reform with the needs of private enterprise but on occasion he challenged corporations in new ways.
during a bitter 1902 coal strike for example he threatened to nationalize the big coal companies if their owners refused to negotiate with the miners union.
the owners hastily came to the table.
roosevelt also sought better enforcement of the interstate commerce act and sherman antitrust act.
he pushed through the elkins act 1903 which prohibited discriminatory railway rates that favored powerful customers.
that same year he created the bureau of corporations empowered to investigate business practices and bolster the justice departments capacity to mount antitrust suits.
the department had already filed such a suit against the northern securities company arguing that this combination of northwestern railroads had created a monopoly in violation of the sherman antitrust act.
in a landmark decision in 1904 the supreme court ordered northern securities dissolved.
that year calling for every american to get what he called a square deal roosevelt handily defeated democratic candidate alton b parker.
now president in his own right roosevelt stepped up his attack on trusts.
he regarded large scale enterprise as the natural tendency of modern industry but he hoped to chapter 20 whose government.

after this ruling tafts attorney general undertook antitrust actions against other giant companies.

in its reference to the folktale jack the giant killer the cartoon suggests how difficult it will be for the president to limit the power of globally connected bankers and financiers.

identify and punish malefactors of great wealth who abused their power.
after much wrangling in congress roosevelt won a major victory with the passage of the hepburn act 1906 which enabled the interstate commerce commission to set shipping rates.
at the time roosevelt acted trusts had partially protected themselves with the help of two friendly states new jersey and delaware whose legislatures had loosened regulations and invited trusts to incorporate under their new state laws.
with its northern securities ruling however the supreme court began to recognize federal authority to dissolve the most egregious monopolies.
roosevelt left a powerful legacy environmental conservation roosevelt was an ardent outdoorsman and hunter.
it was after the president went bear hunting in mississippi in 1902 in fact that a russian jewish immigrant couple in new york began to sell stuffed teddys bears which became an american childhood tradition.
after john muir gave roosevelt a tour of yosemite valley the president described the transcendent experience of camping in the open air under the giant sequoias.
the majestic trunks beautiful in color and in symmetry he wrote rose round us like the pillars of a mightier cathedral than ever was conceived roosevelt translated his love of nature into environmental action.
by the end of his presidency he had issued fifty one executive orders creating wildlife refuges and signed a number of bills advocated by environmentalists.
he also oversaw creation of three national parks including colorados mesa verde the first to protect the works of man american indian archaeological sites.
also notable was his vigorous use of the antiquities act through which he set aside such beautiful sites as arizonas grand canyon and washingtons mt.
some of roosevelts conservation policies however had a probusiness bent.
he increased the amount of land held in federal forest reserves and turned their management over to the new independent u s forest service created in 1905.
but his forestry chief gifford pinchot insisted on fire suppression to maximize logging potential.
in addition roosevelt lent support to the newlands reclamation act 1902 which had much in common with earlier republican policies to promote economic development in the west.
under the act the federal government sold public lands to raise money for irrigation projects that expanded agriculture on arid lands.
the law interestingly fulfilled one of the demands of the unemployed men who had marched with coxeys army.
roosevelts legacies like the environmental laws enacted during his presidency theodore roosevelt was full of contradictions.
an unabashed believer in part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 what he called anglo saxon superiority roosevelt nonetheless incurred the wrath of white supremacists by inviting booker t washington to dine at the white house.
roosevelt called for elite best men to enter politics but he also defended the dignity of labor.
in 1908 roosevelt chose to retire bequeathing the republican nomination to talented administrator william howard taft.
taft portrayed himself as roosevelts man though he maintained a closer relationship than his predecessor with probusiness republicans in congress.
in 1908 taft faced off against democrat william jennings bryan who eloquent as ever attacked republicans as the party of plutocrats men who used their wealth to buy political influence.
bryan outdid taft in urging tougher antitrust and prolabor legislation but taft won comfortably.
in the wake of tafts victory however rising pressure for reform began to divide republicans.
conservatives dug in while militant progressives within the party thought roosevelt and his successor had not gone far enough.
reconciling these conflicting forces was a daunting task.
for taft it spelled disaster.
through various incidents he found himself on the opposite side of progressive republicans who began to call themselves insurgents and to plot their own path.
diverse progressive goals the revolt of republican insurgents signaled the strength of grassroots demands for change.
no one described these emerging goals more eloquently than jane addams who famously declared in democracy and social ethics 1902 the cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy it was a poignant statement given the sharply antidemocratic direction american politics had taken since the 1890s.
what now should more democracy look like.
various groups of progressives women antipoverty reformers african american advocates often disagreed about priorities and goals.
some frustrated by events in the united states traveled abroad to study inspiring experiments in other nations hoping to bring ideas home america compared p 653.
states also served as seedbeds of change.
theodore roosevelt dubbed wisconsin a laboratory of democracy under energetic republican governor robert la follette 1901 1905.
la follette promoted what he called the wisconsin idea greater government intervention in the economy with reliance on experts particularly progressive economists for policy recommendations.
like addams la follette combined respect for expertise with commitment to more democracy he won battles to restrict lobbying and to give wisconsin citizens the right of recall voting to remove unpopular politicians from office and referendum voting directly on a proposed law rather than leaving it in the hands of legislators.
continuing his career in the u s senate la follette like roosevelt advocated increasingly aggressive measures to protect workers and rein in corporate power.
protecting the poor the urban settlement movement called attention to poverty in americas industrial cities.
in the emerging social sciences experts argued that unemployment and crowded slums were not caused by laziness and ignorance as elite americans had long believed.
instead as journalist robert hunter wrote in his landmark study poverty 1904 such problems resulted from miserable and unjust social conditions charity work was at best a limited solution.
how vain to waste our energies on single cases of relief declared one reformer when society should aim at removing the prolific sources of all the woe by the early twentieth century reformers placed particular emphasis on labor conditions for women and children.
the national child labor committee created in 1907 hired photographer lewis hine to record brutal conditions in mines and mills where children worked.
see hines photograph on p.
impressed by the committees investigations theodore roosevelt sponsored the first white house conference on dependent children in 1909 bringing national attention to child welfare issues.
in 1912 momentum from the conference resulted in creation of the childrens bureau in the u s labor department.
those seeking to protect working class women scored a major triumph in 1908 with the supreme courts decision in muller v oregon which upheld an oregon law limiting womens workday to ten hours.
given the courts ruling three years earlier in lochner v new york it was a stunning victory.
to win the case the national consumers league ncl recruited louis brandeis a son of jewish immigrants who was widely known as the peoples lawyer for his eagerness to take on vested interests.
brandeiss legal brief in the muller case devoted only two pages to the constitutional issue of state police powers.
instead brandeis rested his arguments on data gathered by the ncl describing the toll that long work hours took on womens health.
the brandeis brief cleared the way for use of social science research in court decisions.
sanctioning a more expansive role for state governments the muller decision encouraged womens organizations to lobby for further reforms.
their achievements included america c o m pa r e d a progressive reports from new zealand henry demarest lloyd a reform journalist discouraged by populisms defeat in the united states toured new zealand in 1899.
lloyd wanted to study new zealands sudden burst of reform legislation stemming from a great industrial strike in 1890 and in its wake a labor party election victory that precipitated dramatic change.
lloyd was one of many reformers who looked overseas for progressive ideas.
the urban settlement movement in the united states was inspired by british examples.
municipal state and federal officials borrowed innovative policies from other parts of the industrializing world from scientific forest management to workmens compensation laws.
new zealand democracy is the talk of the world to day.

muller had drawbacks however.
though men as well as women suffered from long work hours the muller case did not protect men.
brandeiss brief treated all women as potential mothers focusing on the states from farms and factories to give health and education to the school and factory population and the people generally by cheap excursions.
women are enfranchised.

we are exhorted to take one step at a time but this theory does not fit the new zealand evolution.

it was a new zealand revolution one which without destruction passed at once to the tasks of construction.

questions for analysis 1.
what reforms had new zealand enacted according to lloyd and what problems did they solve.
new zealand had a population of one million in 1890 mostly british immigrants and their descendants with a smaller number of native maori.
why might reform have been easier to achieve there than in the united states.
interest in protecting future children.
brandeis and his allies hoped this would open the door to broader regulation of working hours.
the supreme court however seized on motherhood as the key issue asserting that the female worker because of her maternal function was in a class by herself and legislation for her protection may be sustained even when like legislation is not part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 robert m la follette la follette was transformed into a political reformer when in 1891 a wisconsin republican boss attempted to bribe him to influence a judge in a railway case.

necessary for men this conclusion dismayed labor advocates and divided female reformers for decades afterward.
male workers did benefit however from new workmens compensation measures.
between 1910 and 1917 all the industrial states enacted insurance laws covering on the job accidents so workers families would not starve if a breadwinner was injured or killed.
some states also experimented with so called mothers pensions providing state assistance after a breadwinners desertion or death.
mothers however were subjected to home visits to determine whether they deserved government aid injured workmen were not judged on this basis a pattern of gender discrimination that reflected the broader impulse to protect women while also treating them differently from men.
mothers pensions reached relatively small numbers of women but they laid foundations for the national program aid to families with dependent children an important component of the social security act of 1935.
while federalism gave the states considerable freedom to innovate it hampered national reforms.
in some states for example opponents of child labor won laws barring young children from factory work and strictly regulating hours and conditions for older childrens labor.
in the south however and in coal mining states like pennsylvania companies fiercely resisted such laws as did many working class parents who relied on childrens income to keep the family fed.
a proposed u s constitutional amendment to abolish child labor never won ratification only four states passed it.
tens of thousands of children continued to work in low wage jobs especially in the south.
the same decentralized power that permitted innovation in wisconsin hampered the creation of national minimum standards for pay and job safety.

returning from a yearlong safari in africa in 1910 and finding taft wrangling with the insurgents roosevelt itched to jump in.
in a speech in osawatomie kansas in august 1910 he called for a new nationalism.
in modern america he argued private property had to be controlled to whatever degree the public welfare may require it he proposed a federal child labor law more recognition of labor rights and a national minimum wage for women.

roosevelt won most states that held primary elections but taft controlled party caucuses elsewhere.
dominated by regulars the republican convention chose taft.
roosevelt then led his followers into what became known as the progressive party offering his new nationalism directly to the people.
though jane addams harbored private doubts especially about roosevelts mania for battleships she seconded his nomination calling the progressive party chapter 20 whose government.

the american exponent of a world wide movement for juster social conditions in a nod to roosevelts combative stance party followers called themselves bull mooses roosevelt was not the only rebel on the ballot the major parties also faced a challenge from charismatic socialist eugene v debs.
in the 1890s debs had founded the american railway union aru a broadbased group that included both skilled and unskilled workers.
in 1894 amid the upheavals of depression and popular protest the aru had boycotted luxury pullman sleeping cars in support of a strike by workers at the pullman company.
railroad managers claiming the strike obstructed the u s mail persuaded grover clevelands administration to intervene against the union.
the strike failed and debs served time in prison along with other aru leaders.
the experience radicalized him and in 1901 he launched the socialist party of america.
debs translated socialism into an american idiom emphasizing the democratic process as a means to defeat capitalism.
by the early 1910s his party had secured a minor but persistent role in politics.
both the progressive and socialist parties drew strength from the west a region with vigorous urban reform movements and a legacy of farmer labor activism.
watching the rise of the progressives and socialists democrats were keen to build on dramatic gains they had made in the 1910 midterm election.
among their younger leaders was virginia born woodrow wilson who as new jerseys governor had compiled an impressive reform record including passage of a direct primary workers compensation and utility regulation.
in 1912 he won the democrats compare and nomination.
wilson possessed to contrast a fault the moral certainty that why did the election of characterized many elite progres 1912 feature four candisives.
he had much in common dates and how did their with roosevelt.
the old time of platforms differ.
individual competition is probably gone by he admitted agreeing for more federal measures to restrict big business.
but his goals were less sweeping than roosevelts and only gradually did he hammer out a reform program calling it the new freedom.
if america is not to have free enterprise wilson warned then she can have freedom of no sort whatever he claimed roosevelts program represented collectivism whereas the new freedom would preserve political and economic liberty.
with four candidates in the field taft roosevelt wilson and debs the 1912 campaign generated intense excitement.
democrats continued to have an enormous blind spot their opposition to african american rights.
but republicans despite plentiful opportunities had also conspicuously failed to end segregation or pass antilynching laws.
though african american leaders had high hopes for the progressive party they were crushed when the new party refused to seat southern black delegates or take a stand for racial equality.
du bois considered voting for debs calling the socialists the only party which openly recognized negro manhood but he ultimately endorsed wilson.

how not to help our poorer brother 1897 in the 1890s roosevelt a rising republican star forcefully denounced populism and other radical movements.
the comments below were part of an exchange with populists 1896 vice presidential nominee tom watson of georgia.
there are plenty of ugly things about wealth and its possessors in the present age and i suppose there have been in all ages.
there are many rich people who so utterly lack patriotism or show such sordid and selfish traits of character.
that all right minded men must look upon them with angry contempt but on the whole the thrifty are apt to be better citizens than the thriftless and the worst capitalist cannot harm laboring men as they are harmed by demagogues.
the first lesson to teach the poor man is that as a whole the wealth of the community is distinctly beneficial to him that he is better off in the long run because other men are well off and that the surest way to destroy what measure of prosperity he may have is to paralyze industry and the well being of those men who have achieved success.
it may become necessary to interfere even more than we have done with the right of private contract and to shackle cunning as we have shackled force.
all i insist upon is that we must be sure of our ground before trying to get any legislation and that we must not expect too much from this legislation.
the worst foe of the poor man is the labor leader whether philanthropist or politician who tried to teach him that he is a victim of conspiracy and injustice when in reality he is merely working out his fate with blood and sweat as the immense majority of men who are worthy of the name always have done and always will have to do.
something can be done by good laws more can be done by honest administration of the laws but most of all can be done by frowning resolutely upon the preachers of vague discontent and by upholding the true doctrine of self reliance self help and self mastery.
this doctrine sets forth many things.
among them is that though a man can occasionally be helped when he stumbles yet that it is useless to try to carry him when he will not or cannot walk and worse than useless to try to bring down the work and reward of the thrifty and intelligent to the level of the capacity of the weak the shiftless and the idle.
if an american is to amount to anything he must rely upon himself and not upon the state.
it is both foolish and wicked to teach the average man who is not well off that some wrong or injustice has been done him and that he should hope for redress elsewhere than in his own industry honesty and intelligence.
new nationalism speech august 31 1910 roosevelt delivered this speech to a gathering of union veterans at osawatomie kansas a site associated with abolitionist john brown chapter 13.
why do you think roosevelt chose this occasion and audience.
of that civil war generation of men to whom we owe so much the man to whom we owe most is of course lincoln.
part of our debt to him is because he forecast our present struggle and saw the way out.
labor is prior to and independent of capital.
capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.
labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration if that remark was original with me i should be even more strongly denounced as a communist agitator than i shall be anyhow.
it is lincolns.
i am only quoting it and that is one side that is the side the capitalist should hear.
now let the working man hear his side.
capital has its rights which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.
nor should this lead to a war upon the owners of property.
property is the fruit of labor property is desirable.
it seems to me that in these words lincoln took substantially the attitude that we ought to take he showed the proper sense of proportion in his relative estimates of capital and labor of human rights and property rights.
one of the chief factors in progress is the destruction of special privilege.
the essence of any struggle for healthy liberty has always been and must always be to take from some one man or class of men the right to enjoy power or wealth or position or immunity which has not been earned by service to his or their fellows.
that is what you fought for in the civil war and that is what we strive for now.
practical equality of opportunity for all citizens when we achieve it will have two great results.
first every man will have a fair chance to make of himself all that in him lies to reach the highest point to which his capacities unassisted by special privilege of his own and unhampered by the special privilege of others can carry him and to get for himself and his family substantially what he has earned.
second equality of opportunity means that the commonwealth will get from every citizen the highest service of which he is capable.
when i say that i am for the square deal i mean not merely that i stand for fair play under the present rules of the game but that i stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service.
this means that our government national and state must be freed from the sinister influence or control of special interests.
exactly as the special interests of cotton and slavery threatened our political integrity before the civil war so now the great special business interests too often control and corrupt the men and methods of government for their own profit.
we must drive the special interests out of politics.
the constitution guarantees protections to property and we must make that promise good.
but it does not give the right of suffrage to any corporation.
the true friend of property the true conservative is he who insists that property shall be the servant and not the master of the commonwealth.
the citizens of the united states must effectively control the mighty commercial forces which they have themselves called into being.
there can be no effective control of corporations while their political activity remains.
to put an end to it will be neither a short nor an easy task but it can be done.
we are face to face with new conceptions of the relations of property to human welfare chiefly because certain advocates of the rights of property as against the rights of men have been pushing their claims too far.
the man who wrongly holds that every human right is secondary to his profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare.
no man can be a good citizen unless he has a wage more than sufficient to cover the bare cost of living and hours of labor short enough so that after his days work is done he will have time and energy to bear his share in the management of the community.
we keep countless men from being good citizens by the conditions of life with which we surround them.
we need comprehensive workmens compensation acts and laws to regulate child labor and work for women.
the new nationalism puts the national need before sectional or personal advantage.
it is impatient of the utter confusion that results from local legislatures attempting to treat national issues as local issues and the impotence which makes it possible for local selfishness or for legal cunning hired by wealthy special interests to bring national activities to a deadlock.
this new nationalism regards the executive power as the steward of the public welfare.
it demands of the judiciary that it shall be interested primarily in human welfare rather than in property.
the object of government is the welfare of the people.
the material progress and prosperity of a nation are desirable chiefly so far as they lead to the moral and material welfare of all good citizens.
sources article from review of reviews january 1897 speech from theodore roosevelt.
questions for analysis 1.
in what ways did roosevelts views change between 1897 and 1910.
what factors might have contributed to the change.
can you identify aspects of roosevelts thinking that remained the same.
how might the jobs roosevelt held or sought in 1897 and in 1910 have influenced his ideas.
if you were asked after reading these documents what roosevelt stood for how would you respond.
part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917 energy would benefit americans across racial lines.
the change helped lay the foundations for democrats new deal coalition of the 1930s.
despite the intense campaign republicans division between taft and roosevelt made the result fairly easy to predict.
wilson won though he received only 42 percent of the popular vote and almost certainly would have lost if roosevelt had not been in the race map 20 5.
in comparison with roosevelt and debs wilson appeared to be a rather old fashioned choice.
but with labor protests cresting and progressives gaining support wilson faced intense pressure to act.
party were important components of his base.
in the south many of those voters also upheld strong support for white supremacy.
despite many northern african americans support for wilson his administration did little for those constituents.
but he undertook bold economic reforms.
economic reforms in an era of rising corporate power many democrats believed workers needed stronger government to intervene on their behalf and they began to transform themselves into a modern state building party.
the wilson administration achieved a series of landmark measures at least as significant as those enacted during earlier administrations and perhaps more so table 20 1.
the most enduring was the federal progressive income tax.
progressive by this definition referred to the fact that it was not a flat tax but rose progressively toward the top of the income scale.
the tax passed in the 1890s but rejected by the supreme court was reenacted as the sixteenth amendment to the constitution ratified by the states in february 1913.
the next year congress used the new power to enact an income tax of 1 to 7 percent on americans with annual incomes of 4 000 or more.
at a time when white wilson and the new freedom 1913 1917 in his inaugural address wilson acknowledged that industrialization had precipitated a crisis.
there can be no equality of opportunity he said if men and women and children be not shielded.
from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they cannot alter control or singly cope with wilson was a democrat and labor interests and farmers some previously radicalized in the peoples map 20 5 the presidential election of 1912 8 12 29 15 10 12 electoral vote popular vote percent of popular vote 6 296 547 41 9 4 118 571 27 4 william h taft republican 3 486 720 23 2 eugene v debs socialist 900 672 6 0 candidate woodrow wilson democrat theodore roosevelt progressive other minor parties 1 5 the 1912 election reveals why the twoparty system is so strongly rooted in american politics especially in presidential elections.
the democrats though a minority party won an electoral landslide because the republicans divided their vote between roosevelt and taft.
this result indicates what is at stake when major parties splinter.
the socialist party candidate eugene v debs despite a record vote of 900 000 received no electoral votes.
chapter 20 whose government.
politics populists and progressives 1880 1917 the finishing touch november 2 1912 three days before the election harpers weekly which endorsed woodrow wilson suggested in this cartoon some of the reasons why he would win.
roosevelt supported protective tariffs while wilson called for tariff reform democrats also claimed that roosevelts antitrust proposals were not sufficiently aggressive and that in 1904 he had taken a large campaign contribution from standard oil.
such controversies showed the nations accelerating momentum for reform.
the man in the middle is wilsons campaign manager william mcadoo.
harpers weekly november 2 1912 p 26 male wageworkers might expect to make 800 per year the tax affected less than 5 percent of households.
three years later congress followed this with an inheritance tax.
these measures created an entirely new way to fund the federal government replacing republicans high tariff as the chief source of revenue.
over subsequent decades especially between the 1930s and the 1970s the income tax system markedly reduced americas extremes of wealth and poverty.
wilson also reorganized the financial system to address the absence of a central bank.
at the time the main function of national central banks was to back up commercial banks in case they could not meet their obligations.
in the united states the great private banks of new york such as j p morgans assumed this role if they weakened the entire system could collapse.
this had nearly happened in 1907 when the knickerbocker trust company failed precipitating a panic.
the federal reserve act 1913 gave the nation a banking system more resistant to such crises.
it created twelve district reserve banks funded and controlled by their member banks with a central federal reserve board to impose regulation.
the federal reserve could issue currency paper money based on assets held in the system and set the interest rate that district reserve banks charged to their members.
it thereby reg trace change ulated the flow of credit to the over time general public.
the act strength to what degree did ened the banking system and to a reforms of the wilson era modest degree discouraged risky fulfill goals that various agrarian labor advocates speculation on wall street.
wilson and the democratic and progressives had congress turned next to the sought.
in doing so wilson relied heavily on louis d brandeis the celebrated peoples lawyer.
brandeis denied that monopolies were efficient.
on the contrary he believed the best source of part 6 industrializing america upheavals and experiments 1877 1917.
