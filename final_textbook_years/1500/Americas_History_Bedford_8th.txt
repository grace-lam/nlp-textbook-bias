americas history transformations of north america 1450 1700 p a r t chapter 1 colliding worlds 1450 1600 chapter 2 american experiments 1518 1700 in 1450 north america europe and africa were each home to complex societies with their own distinctive cultures.
but their histories were about to collide bringing vast changes to all three continents.
european voyagers sailing in the wake of christopher columbus set in motion one of the most momentous developments in world history sustained contact among native americans europeans and africans in dozens of distinct colonial settings.
before the arrival of europeans a wide range of complex native american societies claimed the continent as their own.
although colonization brought profound change it did not erase what had come before because native american societies interacted with colonizers from the beginning.
they shaped colonial enterprise in important ways enabling some forms of colonization while preventing others.
native americans europeans and africans were surprisingly similar in many ways though the differences among them were important as well.
their distinctive ideas about gods and the spirit world informed their political systems and animated their approaches to trade and warfare.
whether they met in peace or war or whether peaceful interactions quickly turned violent native americans europeans and africans viewed one another through lenses that were shaped by these ideas.
in part 1 we compare native american european and african societies on the eve of colonization and then explore how europeans experimented with various models of colonization in the first two centuries of sustained transatlantic contacts.
the story in chapters 1 and 2 addresses three main developments that are central to this period native american diversity and complexity colonial settlement and the columbian exchange popular culture can lead us to think of native american societies as being substantially the same everywhere in north america they were organized into tribes with few material possessions and primitive beliefs and cultures and reliant mostly on hunting for their subsistence.
this impression distorts a much more complicated picture.
native american political organization ran the gamut from vast complex imperial states to kin based bands of hunters and gatherers.
patterns of political organization varied widely and the familiar label of tribe does more to obscure than to clarify their workings.
native americans economic and social systems were adapted to the ecosystems they inhabited.
many were extremely productive farmers some hunted bison and deer while others were expert salmon fishermen who plied coastal waters in large oceangoing boats.
native american religions and cultures also varied widely though they shared some broad characteristics.
these variations in native american societies shaped colonial enterprise.
europeans conquered and coopted native american empires with relative ease but smaller and more decentralized polities were harder to exploit.
mobile hunter gatherers appeared politically amorphous but they became especially formidable opponents of colonial expansion.
european colonization triggered a series of sweeping changes that historians have labeled the columbian exchange at the same time that people crossed the atlantic in large numbers so too did plants animals and germs.
old world grains like wheat and barley were planted in the americas for the first time and weeds like dandelions were carried across the ocean as well.
potatoes maize corn and tomatoes among other foods crossed the atlantic in the other direction and transformed dietary practices in asia as well as europe.
native americans domesticated very few animals the columbian exchange introduced horses pigs cattle and a variety of other creatures to the american landscape.
germs also made the voyage especially the deadly pathogens that had so disordered life in europe in the centuries prior to colonization.
smallpox influenza and bubonic plague among others took an enormous toll on native american populations.
inanimate materials made the voyage as well enough gold and silver traveled from the americas to europe and asia to transform the worlds economies intensifying competition and empire building in europe.
old world diseases devastated native american peoples.
on average they lost ninety percent of their numbers over the first century of contact forcing them to cope with european and african newcomers in a weakened and vulnerable state.
part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 transformations of north america 1450 1700 experimentation and transformation thematic understanding the collisions of american european and african worlds challenged the beliefs and practices of all three groups.
colonization was above all a long and tortured process of experimentation.
over time europeans carved out three distinct types of colonies in the americas each shaped by the constraints and opportunities presented by american landscapes and peoples.
where native american societies were organized into densely settled empires europeans conquered the ruling class and established tribute based empires of their own.
in tropical and subtropical settings colonizers created plantation societies that demanded large imported labor forces a need that was met through the african slave trade.
and in the temperate regions of the mainland north america where neither the landscape nor the native population yielded easy wealth european colonists came in large numbers hoping to create familiar societies in unfamiliar settings.
everywhere in the americas core beliefs and worldviews were shaken by contact with radically unfamiliar peoples.
native americans and africans struggled to maintain autonomy in their relations with colonizers while europeans labored to understand and profit from their relations with nonwhite peoples.
these transformations are the subject of part 1.
this timeline arranges some of the important events of this period into themes.
look at the entries for ideas beliefs and culture from 1450 to 1700.
how did the protestant reformation and the response of the catholic church influence the colonization of the americas in these years.
in the realm of work exchange and technology how did colonial economies evolve and what roles did native american and african labor play in them.

before seen or heard tell of in spain the sailor was christopher columbus just returned from his first voyage into the atlantic.
he and his party entered barcelonas fortress in a solemn procession.
the monarchs stood to greet columbus he knelt to kiss their hands.
they talked for an hour and then adjourned to the royal chapel for a ceremony of thanksgiving.
columbus now bearing the official title admiral of the ocean sea remained at court for more than a month.
the highlight of his stay was the baptism of the six natives whom columbus called indians because he mistakenly believed he had sailed westward all the way to asia.
in the spring of 1540 the spanish explorer hernando de soto met the lady of cofachiqui ruler of a large native american province in present day south carolina.
though an epidemic had carried away many of her people the lady of the province offered the spanish expedition as much corn and as many pearls as it could carry.
as she spoke to de soto she unwound a great rope of pearls as large as hazelnuts and handed them to the spaniard in return he gave her a gold ring set with a ruby.
de soto and his men then visited the temples of cofachiqui which were guarded by carved statues and held storehouses of weapons and chest upon chest of pearls.
after loading their horses with corn and pearls they continued on their way.
a portuguese traveler named duarte lopez visited the african kingdom of kongo in 1578.
the men and women are black he reported some approaching olive colour with black curly hair and others with red.
the men are of middle height and excepting the black skin are like the portuguese the royal city of kongo sat on a high plain that was entirely cultivated with a population of more than 100 000.
the city included a separate commercial district a mile around where portuguese traders acquired ivory wax honey palm oil and slaves from the kongolese.
three glimpses of three lost worlds.
soon these peoples would be transforming one anothers societies often through conflict and exploitation.
but at the moment they first met europeans native americans and africans stood on roughly equal terms.
even a hundred years after columbuss discovery of the americas no one could have foreseen the shape that their interactions would take in the generations to come.
to begin we need to understand the three worlds as distinct places each home to unique societies and cultures.
village of secoton 1585 english colonist john white painted this view of an algonquian village on the outer banks of present day north carolina.
its cluster of houses surrounded by fields of crops closely resembled european farming communities of the same era.

part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 the native american experience when europeans arrived perhaps 60 million people occupied the americas 7 million of whom lived north of mexico.
in mesoamerica present day mexico and guatemala and the andes empires that rivaled the greatest civilizations in world history ruled over millions of people.
at the other end of the political spectrum hunters and gatherers were organized into kinbased bands.
between these extremes semisedentary societies planted and tended crops in the spring and summer fished and hunted made war and conducted trade.
though we often see this spectrum as a hierarchy in which the empires are most impressive and important while hunter gatherers deserve scarcely a mention this bias toward civilizations that left behind monumental architecture and spawned powerful ruling classes is misplaced.
regardless of size or political complexity the energies and innovations of native american societies everywhere profoundly transformed american landscapes.
to be fully understood the americas must be treated in all their complexity with an appreciation for their diverse societies and cultures.
the first americans archaeologists believe that migrants from asia crossed a 100 mile wide land bridge connecting siberia and alaska during the last ice age sometime between 13 000 and 3000 b c.
and thus became the first americans.
the first wave of this migratory stream from asia lasted from about fifteen thousand to nine thousand years ago.
then the glaciers melted and the rising ocean submerged the land bridge beneath the bering strait map 1 1.
around eight thousand years ago a second movement of peoples traveling by water across the same narrow strait brought the ancestors of the navajos and the apaches to north america.
the forebears of the aleut and inuit peoples the eskimos came in a third wave around five thousand years ago.
then for three hundred generations the peoples of the western hemisphere were largely cut off from the rest of the world.
during this long era migrants identify causes dispersed through the continents what factors allowed as they hunted and gathered availfor the development of able resources.
the predominant empires in central mexico flow was southward and the densand the andes.
est populations developed in central mexico home to some 20 million people at the time of first contact with europeans and the andes mountains with a population of perhaps 12 million.
in north america a secondary trickle of migration pushed eastward across the rockies and into the mississippi valley and the eastern woodlands.
around 6000 b c some native american peoples in present day mexico and peru began raising domesticated crops.
mesoamericans cultivated maize into a nutritious plant with a higher yield per acre than wheat barley or rye the staple cereals of europe.
in peru they also bred the potato a root crop of unsurpassed nutritional value.
the resulting agricultural surpluses encouraged population growth and laid the foundation for wealthy urban societies in mexico and peru and later in the mississippi valley and the southeastern woodlands of north america map 1 2.
american empires in mesoamerica and the andes the two great empires of the americas the aztecs and incas dominated the landscape.
dense populations productive agriculture and an aggressive bureaucratic state were the keys to their power.
each had an impressive capital city.
tenochtitln established in 1325 at the center of the aztec empire had at its height around 1500 a population of about 250 000 at a time when the european cities of london and seville each had perhaps 50 000.
the aztec state controlled the fertile valleys in the highlands of mexico and aztec merchants forged trading routes that crisscrossed the empire.
trade along with tribute demanded from subject peoples comparable to taxes in europe brought gold textiles turquoise obsidian tropical bird feathers and cacao to tenochtitln.
the europeans who first encountered this city in 1519 marveled at the citys wealth and beauty.
some of the soldiers among us who had been in many parts of the world wrote spanish conquistador bernal daz del castillo in constantinople and all over italy and in rome said that they had never seen so large a market place and so full of people and so well regulated and arranged see american voices p 32.
ruled by priests and warrior nobles the aztecs subjugated most of central mexico.
captured enemies were brought to the capital where aztec priests brutally sacrificed thousands of them.
the aztecs believed that these ritual murders sustained the cosmos ensuring fertile fields and the daily return of the sun.
cuzco the inca capital located more than 11 000 feet above sea level had perhaps 60 000 residents.

i a a s i a b e r scandinavian ice sheet 160e greenland ice sheet evidence indicates that peoples came from asia to the americas during the ice age when the sea level was much lower than today and a large land bridge labeled beringia on the map connected the continents.
w co as scholars learn more about the advances and retreats of the ice sheets the camping sites of the migrating peoples and changes in vegetation zones a more complete picture of the peopling of the americas will emerge.

the ice lowered the level of the worlds oceans which created a broad bridge of land between siberia and alaska.
using that land bridge hunting peoples from asia migrated to north america as they pursued woolly mammoths and other large game animals and sought ice free habitats.
by 10 000 b c the descendants of these migrant peoples had moved south to present day florida and central mexico.
in time they would settle as far south as the tip of south america and as far east as the atlantic coast of north america.

the great diversity of native american peoples in language tribal identity and ways of life and the longstanding rivalries among neighboring peoples usually prevented them from uniting to resist the european invaders.
centers stitched together this improbable high altitude empire which ran down the 2 000 mile long spine of the andes mountains.
a king claiming divine status ruled the empire through a bureaucracy of nobles.
like the aztecs the empire consisted of subordinate kingdoms that had been conquered by the incas and tribute flowed from local centers of power to the imperial core.
chiefdoms and confederacies nothing on the scale of the aztec and inca empires ever developed north of mexico but maize agriculture spread from mesoamerica across much of north america beginning around a d 1000 laying a foundation for new ways of life there as well.
chapter 1 colliding worlds 1450 1600 understanding the cosmos of the aztecs using aztec sources german geographers drew this map of tenochtitln in 1524.
recent scholarship suggests that the aztecs viewed their city as a cosmic linchpin where the human world brushed up against the divine.
in the center of the city stand two elevated temples that represent coatepec the serpent mountain and the mythic birthplace of the aztecs tribal god huitzilopochtli.
priests sacrificed thousands of men and women here a ritual the aztecs believed transformed the temples into the sacred mountain and sustained the cosmos.

the mississippi valley the spread of maize to the mississippi river valley around a d 1000 led to the development of a large scale northern native american culture.
the older adena and hopewell cultures had already introduced moundbuilding and distinctive pottery styles to the region.
now residents of the mississippi river valley experienced the greater urban density and more complex social organization that agriculture encouraged.
the city of cahokia in the fertile bottomlands along the mississippi river emerged around 1000 as the foremost center of the new mississippian culture.
at its peak cahokias population exceeded 10 000 smaller satellite communities brought the regions population to 20 000 to 30 000.
in an area of 6 square miles archaeologists have found 120 mounds of varying size shape and function.
some contain extensive burials others known as platform mounds were used as bases for ceremonial buildings or rulers homes.
cahokia had a powerful ruling class and a priesthood that worshipped the sun.
after peaking in size around 1350 it declined rapidly.
scholars speculate that its decline was caused by an era of ruinous warfare exacerbated by environmental factors that made the site less habitable.
it had been abandoned by the time europeans arrived in the area.
mississippian culture endured however and was still in evidence throughout much of the southeast at the time of first contact with europeans.
the lady of cofachiqui encountered by hernando de soto in 1540 ruled over a mississippian community and others dotted the landscape between the carolinas and the lower part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 mississippi river.
in florida sixteenth century spanish explorers encountered the apalachee indians who occupied a network of towns built around mounds and fields of maize.
eastern woodlands in the eastern woodlands the mississippian influenced peoples of the southeast interacted with other groups many of whom adopted maize agriculture but did not otherwise display mississippian characteristics.
to the north algonquian and iroquoian speakers shared related languages and lifeways but were divided into dozens of distinct societies.
most occupied villages built around fields of maize beans and squash during the summer months at other times of the year they dispersed in smaller groups to hunt fish and gather.
throughout the eastern woodlands as in most of north america women tended crops gathered plants and oversaw affairs within the community while men were responsible for activities beyond it especially hunting fishing and warfare.
in this densely forested region indians regularly set fires in new england twice a year in spring and fall to clear away underbrush open fields and make it easier to hunt big game.
the catastrophic population decline accompanying european colonization quickly put an end to seasonal burning but in the years before europeans arrived in north america bison roamed east as far as modern day new york and georgia.
early european colonists remarked upon landscapes that resemble d a stately parke where men could ride among widely spaced trees on horseback and even a large army could pass unimpeded america compared p 14.
algonquian and iroquoian peoples had no single style of political organization.
many were chiefdoms with one individual claiming preeminent power in a community.
some were paramount chiefdoms in which numerous communities with their own local chiefs banded together under a single more powerful ruler.
for example the powhatan chiefdom which the great serpent mound scholars long believed that this mound was the work of the adena peoples 500 b c a d.

the head of the serpent is aligned with the sunset of the summer solstice june 20 or 21 in the northern hemisphere an event of great religious significance to a sun worshipping culture.

dominated the chesapeake bay region embraced more than thirty subordinate chiefdoms and some 20 000 people by the time englishmen established the colony of virginia in powhatan territory.
powhatan himself according to the english colonist john smith was attended by a guard of 40 or 50 of the tallest men his country affords elsewhere especially in the mid atlantic region the power of chiefs was strictly local.
along the delaware and hudson rivers lenni lenape or delaware and munsee indians lived in small independent communities without overarching political organizations.
early european maps of this region show a landscape dotted with a bewildering profusion of indian names.
european colonization would soon drive many of these groups into oblivion and force survivors to coalesce into larger groups.
some native american groups were not chiefdoms at all but instead granted political authority to councils of sachems or leaders.
this was the case with the iroquois confederacy.
sometime shortly before the arrival of europeans probably around 1500 five nations occupying the region between the hudson river and lake erie the mohawks oneidas onondagas cayugas and senecas banded together to form the iroquois.
these groups had been fighting among themselves for years caught in a destructive cycle of wars of retribution.
then according to iroquois legend a mohawk man named hiawatha lost his family in one of these america c o m pa r e d altered landscapes in the eastern woodlands native americans set fires once or twice a year to clear underbrush and open up landscapes that would otherwise have been densely wooded.
the burnings made it easier to plant corn beans and squash and drew big game animals into the clearings where hunters could fell them.
as european colonization displaced indian populations this practice ended.
some scholars have even suggested that the decline in burning caused a drop of carbon in the atmosphere large enough to account for the little ice age an episode of global cooling that lasted from about 1550 to 1850 though the claim is controversial.
thomas morton of the custome in burning the country and the reason thereof 1637 the savages are accustomed to set fire of the country in all places where they come and to burne it twize a yeare viz at the spring and the fall of the leafe.
the reason that mooves them to doe so is because it would other wise be so overgrowne with underweedes that it would be all a coppice wood and the people would not be able in any wise to passe through the country out of a beaten path.
the meanes that they do it with is with certaine minerall stones that they carry about them in baggs made for that purpose of the skinnes of little beastes which they convert into good lether carrying in the same a peece of touch wood very excellent for that purpose of their owne making.
these minerall stones they have from the piquenteenes which is to the southward of all the plantations in new england by trade and trafficke with those people.
the burning of the grasse destroyes the underwoods and so scorcheth the elder trees that it shrinkes them and hinders their grouth very much so that hee that will looke to finde large trees and good tymber must not depend upon the help of a woodden prospect to finde them on the uplandground but must seeke for them as i and others have done in the lower grounds where the grounds are wett when the country is fired by reason of the snow water that remaines there for a time untill the sunne by continuance of that hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth and dried up those places where the fire by reason of the moisture can have no power to doe them any hurt and if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly cedars hee must not seeke for them on the higher grounds but make his inquest for them in the vallies for the savages by this custome of theirs have spoiled all the rest for this custome hath bin continued from the beginninge.
and least their firing of the country in this manner should be an occasion of damnifying us and indaingering our habitations wee our selves have used carefully about the same times to observe the winds and fire the grounds about our owne habitations to prevent the dammage that might happen by any neglect thereof if the fire should come neere those howses in our absence.
for when the fire is once kindled it dilates and spreads it selfe as well against as with the winde burning continually night and day untill a shower of raine falls to quench it.
and this custome of firing the country is the meanes to make it passable and by that meanes the trees growe here and there as in our parks and makes the country very beautifull and commodious.

questions for analysis 1.
what benefits and dangers does morton attribute to the practice of indian burning.
how did he and his fellow colonists respond to the practice.
since europeans did not practice widespread burning in the indian manner they achieved deforestation only slowly through many years of backbreaking labor.
thinking comparatively about european and native american approaches to landscape management how would you assess the benefits and challenges of each approach.

stricken by grief he met a spirit who taught him a series of condolence rituals.
he returned to his people preaching a new gospel of peace and power and the condolence rituals he taught became the foundation for the iroquois confederacy.
once bound by these rituals the five nations began acting together as a political confederacy.
they avoided violence among themselves and became one of the most powerful native american groups in the northeast.
the iroquois did not recognize chiefs instead councils of sachems made decisions.
these were matriarchal societies with power inherited through female lines of authority.
women were influential in local councils though men served as sachems made war and conducted diplomacy.
along the southern coast of the region that would soon be called new england a dense network of powerful chiefdoms including the narragansetts wampanoags mohegans pequots and others competed for resources and dominance.
when the dutch and english arrived they were able to exploit these rivalries and play indian groups against one another.
farther north in northern new england and much of present day canada the short growing season and thin rocky soil were inhospitable to maize agriculture.
here the native peoples were hunters and gatherers and therefore had smaller and more mobile communities though they were no less complex than their agriculturally oriented cousins.
the great lakes to the west algonquian speaking peoples dominated the great lakes.
the tribal groups recognized by europeans in this region included the ottawas ojibwas and potawatomis.
but collectively they thought of themselves as a single people the anishinaabe.
clan identities beaver otter sturgeon deer and others crosscut tribal affiliations and were in some ways more fundamental.
the result was a social landscape that could be bewildering to outsiders.
here lived one french official remarked an infinity of undiscovered nations the extensive network of lakes and rivers and the use of birchbark canoes made great lakes peoples especially mobile.
they seem to have as many abodes as the year has seasons wrote one observer.
they traveled long distances to hunt and fish to trade or to join in important ceremonies or military alliances.
groups negotiated access to resources and travel routes.
instead of a map with clearly delineated tribal territories it is best to imagine the great lakes as a porous region where political power and social identity took on multiple forms as one scholar has written.
colliding worlds 1450 1600 the great plains and rockies farther west lies the vast arid steppe region known as the great plains which was dominated by the hunting and gathering activities of small dispersed groups.
the geopolitics of the plains indians was transformed by a european import the horse long before europeans themselves arrived.
livestock was introduced in the spanish colony of new mexico in the late sixteenth century and from there horses gradually dispersed across the plains.
bison hunters who had previously relied on stealth became much more successful on horseback.
indians on horseback were also more formidable opponents than their counterparts on foot and some plains peoples leveraged their control of horses to gain power over their neighbors.

clothing and other necessities.
eventually they controlled a vast territory.
from their humble origins their skill in making war on horseback made the comanches one of the regions most formidable peoples.
similarly horses allowed the sioux a confederation of seven distinct peoples who originated in present day minnesota to move west and dominate a vast territory ranging from the mississippi river to the black hills.
the crow indians moved from the missouri river to the eastern slope of the rocky mountains where they became nomadic bison hunters.
beginning in the mideighteenth century they became horse breeders and traders as well.
in some places farming communities were embedded within the much wider geographical range of hunter gatherers.
thus the hidatsa and mandan indians maintained settled agricultural villages along the missouri river while the more mobile sioux dominated the region around them.
similarly the caddo indians who lived on the edge of the southern plains inhabited agricultural communities that were like islands in a sea of more mobile peoples.
three broad swaths of numic speaking peoples occupied the great basin that separated the rockies from the sierra mountains bannocks and northern paiutes in the north shoshones in the central basin and utes and southern paiutes in the south.

kin based bands traveled great distances to hunt bison along the part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 yellowstone river where they shared territory with the crows and bighorn sheep in high altitudes to fish for salmon and to gather pine nuts when they were in season.
throughout the great basin some groups adopted horses and became relatively powerful while others remained foot borne and impoverished in comparison with their more mobile neighbors.
the arid southwest in the part of north america that appears to be most hostile to agriculture the canyon laced country of the arid southwest surprisingly large farming settlements developed.
anasazi peoples were growing maize by the first century a d earlier than anywhere else north of mexico and pueblo cultures emerged around a d 600.
by a d 1000 the hohokams mogollons and anasazis all pueblo peoples had developed irrigation systems to manage scarce water enabling them to build sizable villages and towns of adobe and rock that were often molded to sheer canyon walls.
chaco canyon in modern new mexico supported a dozen large anasazi towns while beyond the canyon a network of roads tied these settlements together with hundreds of small anasazi villages.
extended droughts and soil exhaustion caused the abandonment of chaco canyon and other large settlements in the southwest after 1150 but smaller communities still dotted the landscape when the first europeans arrived.
it was the spanish who called these groups pueblo indians pueblo means town in spanish and the name refers to their distinctive building style.
when europeans arrived pueblo peoples including the acomas zuis tewas and hopis were found throughout much of modern new mexico arizona and western texas.
the pacific coast hunter gatherers inhabited the pacific coast.
before the arrival of the spanish california was home to more than 300 000 people subdivided into dozens of small localized groups and speaking at least a hundred distinct languages.
this diversity of languages and cultures discouraged intermarriage and kept these societies independent.
despite these differences many groups did share common characteristics including clearly defined social hierarchies separating elites from commoners.
they gathered acorns and other nuts and seeds caught fish and shellfish and hunted game.
the pacific northwest also supported a dense population that was divided into many distinct groups who controlled small territories and spoke different languages.
their stratified societies were ruled by wealthy families.
to maintain control of their territories the more powerful nations including the chinooks coast salishes haidas and tlingits nurtured strong warrior traditions.

in areas where indians specialized in a particular economic activity regional trade networks allowed them to share resources.
thus nomadic hunters of the southern plains including the navajos and apaches conducted annual trade fairs with pueblo farmers exchanging hides and meat for maize pottery and cotton blankets.
similar patterns of exchange occurred throughout the great plains wherever hunters and farmers coexisted.
in some parts of north america a regional trade in war captives who were offered as slaves helped to sustain friendly relations among neighboring groups.
one such network developed in the upper mississippi river basin where plains indian captives were traded or given as diplomatic gifts to ottawas and other great lakes and eastern woodlands peoples.

after european contact indian hunters often traveled long distances to european trading posts to trade for cloth iron tools and weapons.
within native american groups powerful leaders controlled a disproportionate share of wealth and redistributed it to prove their generosity and strengthen their authority.
in small kin based bands the strongest hunters possessed the most food and sharing it was essential.
in chiefdoms rulers filled the same role often collecting the wealth of a community and then redistributing it to their followers.
powhatan the powerful chesapeake bay chief reportedly collected nine tenths of the produce of the communities he oversaw skins beads copper pearls deer turkeys wild beasts and corn but then gave much of it back to his subordinates.
his generosity was considered a mark of good leadership.
in the pacific northwest the chinook word potlatch refers to periodic festivals in which wealthy residents gave away belongings to friends family and followers.
sacred power most native north americans were animists who believed that the natural world was suffused with spiritual power.
they sought to understand the world by interpreting dreams and visions and their rituals appeased guardian spirits that could ensure successful hunts and other forms of good fortune.
although their views were subject to countless local variations certain patterns were widespread.
women and men interacted differently with these spiritual forces.
in agricultural communities women grew crops and maintained hearth home and village.
native american conceptions of female power linked their bodies generative functions with the earths fertility and rituals like the green corn ceremony a summer ritual of purification and renewal helped to sustain the life giving properties of the world around them.
for men spiritual power was invoked in hunting and war.
to ensure success in hunting men took care part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 not to offend the spirits of the animals they killed.

been killed properly its spirit would rise from the earth unharmed.
success in hunting and prowess in war were both interpreted as signs of sacred protection and power.
ideas about war varied widely.
war could be fought for geopolitical reasons to gain ground against an enemy but for many groups warfare was a crucial rite of passage for young men and raids were conducted to allow warriors to prove themselves in battle.
motives for war could be highly personal war was often more like a blood feud between families than a contest between nations.
if a community lost warriors in battle it often retaliated by capturing or killing a like number of warriors in response a so called mourning war.
some captives were adopted into new communities while others were enslaved or tortured.
understand points of view western europe the edge of the old world in 1450 western europe lay at the far fringe of the eurasian and african continents.
it had neither the powerful centralized empires nor the hunter gatherer bands and semisedentary societies of the americas it was instead a patchwork of roughly equivalent kingdoms duchies and republics vying with one another and struggling to reach out effectively to the rest of the world.
no one would have predicted that europeans would soon become overlords of the western hemisphere.
a thousand years after the fall of the roman empire europes populations still relied on subsistence agriculture and were never far from the specter of famine.
moreover around 1350 a deadly plague introduced from central asia the black death had killed one third of europes population.
the lives of ordinary people were afflicted by poverty disease and uncertainty and the future looked as difficult and dark as the past.
hierarchy and authority in traditional hierarchical societies american or european authority came from above.
in europe kings and princes owned vast tracts of land forcibly conscripted men for military service and lived off the peasantrys labor.
yet monarchs were far from supreme local nobles also owned large estates and controlled hundreds of peasant families.
collectively these nobles challenged royal authority with both their military power and their legislative institutions such as the french parlements and the english house of lords.
just as kings and nobles ruled society men governed families.
these were patriarchies in which property and social identity descended in male family lines.
rich or poor the man was the head of the house his power justified by the teachings of the christian church.
as one english clergyman put it the woman is a weak creature not embued with like strength and constancy of mind law and custom subjected her to the power of man once married an englishwoman assumed her husbands surname submitted to his orders and surrendered the right to her property.
when he died she received a dower usually the use during her lifetime of one third of the familys land and goods.
men also controlled the lives of their children who usually worked for their father into their middle or late twenties.
then landowning peasants would give land to their sons and dowries to their daughters and choose marriage partners of appropriate wealth and status.
in many regions fathers bestowed all their land on their eldest son a practice known as primogeniture forcing many younger children to join the ranks of the roaming poor.
few men and even fewer women had much personal freedom.
hierarchy and authority prevailed in traditional european society because of the power held by established institutions nobility church and village and because in a violent and unpredictable world they offered ordinary people a measure of security.
carried by migrants to america these security conscious institutions would shape the character of family and society well into the eighteenth century.
peasant society in 1450 most europeans were peasants farmworkers who lived in small villages surrounded by fields farmed cooperatively by different families.
on manorial lands farming rights were given in exchange for labor on the lords estate an arrangement that turned peasants into serfs.
gradually obligatory manorial services gave way to paying rent or as in france landownership.
once freed from the obligation to labor for their farming rights european farmers began to produce surpluses and created local market economies.
chapter 1 as with native americans the rhythm of life followed the seasons.
in march villagers began the exhausting work of plowing and then planting wheat rye and oats.
during the spring the men sheared wool which the women washed and spun into yarn.
in june peasants cut hay and stored it as winter fodder for their livestock.
during the summer life was more relaxed and families repaired their houses and barns.
fall brought the harvest followed by solemn feasts of thanksgiving and riotous bouts of merrymaking.
as winter approached peasants slaughtered excess livestock and salted or smoked the meat.
during the cold months they threshed grain and wove textiles visited friends and relatives and celebrated the winter solstice or the birth of christ.
just before the cycle began again in the spring they held carnivals celebrating with drink and dance the end of the long winter figure 1 1.
for most peasants survival meant constant labor and poverty corroded family relationships.
malnourished mothers fed their babies sparingly calling them greedy and gluttonous and many newborn girls were helped to die so that their brothers would have enough to eat.
half of all peasant children died before the age of twenty one victims of malnourishment and disease.
many peasants drew on strong religious beliefs counting blessings and accepting their harsh existence.
others hoped for a better life.
it was the peasants of spain germany and britain who would supply the majority of white migrants to the western hemisphere.

they celebrated civic humanism an ideology that praised public virtue and service to the state and in time profoundly influenced european and american conceptions of government.
they sponsored great artists michelangelo leonardo da vinci and others who produced an unprecedented flowering of genius.
historians have labeled the arts and learning associated with this cultural transformation from 1300 to 1450 the renaissance.
the economic revolution that began in italy spread slowly to northern and western europe.
englands principal export was woolen cloth which was prized in the colder parts of the continent but had less appeal in southern trace change europe and beyond.
northern over time europe had its own trade system how did the growth of controlled by an alliance of mercommerce shift the strucchant communities called the ture of power in european societies.
hanseatic league centered on the baltic and north seas which dealt in timber furs wheat and rye honey wax and amber.
as trade picked up in europe merchants and artisans came to dominate its growing cities and towns.
while the italian city states ruled themselves without having a powerful monarch to contend with in much of europe the power of merchants stood in tension with that of kings and nobles.
in general the rise of commerce favored the power of kings at the expense of the landed nobility.
the kings of western europe established royal law courts that gradually eclipsed the manorial courts controlled by nobles they also built bureaucracies that helped them centralize power while they forged alliances with merchants and urban artisans.
monarchs allowed merchants to trade throughout their realms granted privileges to guilds or artisan organizations that regulated trades and safeguarded commercial transactions thereby encouraging domestic manufacturing and foreign trade.
in return they extracted taxes from towns and loans from merchants to support their armies and officials.
myths religions and holy warriors the oldest european religious beliefs drew on a form of animism similar to that of native americans which held that the natural world the sun wind stones animals was animated by spiritual forces.
as in north america such beliefs led ancient european peoples to develop localized cults of knowledge and spiritual practice.
wise men and women developed rituals to protect their communities ensure abundant harvests heal illnesses and bring misfortunes to their enemies.
chapter 1 the pagan traditions of greece and rome overlaid animism with elaborate myths about gods interacting directly with the affairs of human beings.
as the roman empire expanded it built temples to its gods wherever it planted new settlements.
thus peoples throughout europe north africa and the near east were exposed to the roman pantheon.
soon the teachings of christianity began to flow in these same channels.
the rise of christianity christianity which grew out of jewish monotheism the belief in one god held that jesus christ was himself divine.
as an institution christianity benefitted enormously from the conversion of the roman emperor constantine in a d 312.
prior to that time christians were an underground sect at odds with the roman empire.
after constantines conversion christianity became romes official religion temples were abandoned or remade into churches and noblemen who hoped to retain their influence the last judgment 1467 1471 death and their fate in the afterlife loomed large in the minds of fifteenth century christians and artists depicted their hopes and fears in vividly rendered scenes.

colliding worlds 1450 1600 converted to the new state religion.
for centuries the roman catholic church was the great unifying institution in western europe.
the pope in rome headed a vast hierarchy of cardinals bishops and priests.
catholic theologians preserved latin the language of classical scholarship and imbued kingship with divine power.
christian dogma provided a common understanding of god and human history and the authority of the church buttressed state institutions.
every village had a church and holy shrines served as points of contact with the sacred world.
often those shrines had their origins in older animist practices now largely forgotten and replaced with christian ritual.
christian doctrine penetrated deeply into the everyday lives of peasants.
while animist traditions held that spiritual forces were alive in the natural world christian priests taught that the natural world was flawed and fallen.
spiritual power came from outside nature from a supernatural god who had sent his divine son jesus part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 christ into the world to save humanity from its sins.
the christian church devised a religious calendar that transformed animist festivals into holy days.
the winter solstice which had for millennia marked the return of the sun became the feast of christmas.
the church also taught that satan a wicked supernatural being was constantly challenging god by tempting people to sin.
people who spread heresies doctrines that were inconsistent with the teachings of the church were seen as the tools of satan and suppressing false doctrines became an obligation of christian rulers.
the crusades in their work suppressing false doctrines christian rulers were also obliged to combat islam the religion whose followers considered muhammad to be gods last prophet.
islams reach expanded until it threatened european christendom.
following the death of muhammad in a d 632 the newly converted arab peoples of north africa used force and fervor to spread the muslim faith into subsaharan africa india and indonesia as well as deep into spain and the balkan regions of europe.
between a d 1096 and 1291 christian armies undertook a series of crusades to reverse the muslim advance in europe and win back the holy lands where christ had lived.
under the banner of the pope and led by europes christian monarchs crusading armies aroused great waves of popular piety as they marched off to combat.
new orders of knights like the knights templar and the teutonic knights were created to support them.
the crusaders had some military successes but their most profound impact was on european society.
religious warfare intensified europes christian identity and prompted the persecution of jews and their expulsion from many european countries.
the crusades also introduced western european merchants to the trade routes that stretched from constantinople to china along the silk road and from the mediterranean sea through the persian gulf to the indian ocean.
and crusaders encountered sugar for the first time.
returning soldiers brought it back from the middle east and as europeans began to conquer territory in the eastern mediterranean they experimented with raising it themselves.
these early experiments with sugar would have a profound trace change impact on european enterprise over time in the americas and european how did the growing involvement with the african influence of the christian slave trade in the centuries to church affect events in come.
by 1450 western europe europe.
remained relatively isolated from the centers of civilization in eurasia and africa but the crusades and the rise of italian merchant houses had introduced it to a wider world.
the reformation in 1517 martin luther a german monk and professor at the university in wittenberg took up the cause of reform in the catholic church.
luthers ninety five theses condemned the church for many corrupt practices.
more radically luther downplayed the role of the clergy as mediators between god and believers and said that christians must look to the bible not to the church as the ultimate authority in matters of faith.
so that every literate german could read the bible previously available only in latin luther translated it into german.
meanwhile in geneva switzerland french theologian john calvin established a rigorous protestant regime.
even more than luther calvin stressed human weakness and gods omnipotence.
his institutes of the christian religion 1536 depicted god as an absolute sovereign.
calvin preached the doctrine of predestination the idea that god chooses certain people for salvation before they are born and condemns the rest to eternal damnation.
in geneva he set up a model christian community and placed spiritual authority in ministers who ruled the city prohibiting frivolity and luxury.
we know wrote calvin that man is of so perverse and crooked a nature that everyone would scratch out his neighbors eyes if there were no bridle to hold them in calvins authoritarian doctrine won converts all over europe including the puritans in scotland and england.
luthers criticisms triggered a war between the holy roman empire and the northern principalities in germany and soon the controversy between the roman catholic church and radical reformers like luther and calvin spread throughout much of western europe.
the protestant reformation as this movement came to be called triggered a counterreformation in the catholic church that sought change from within and created new monastic and missionary orders including the jesuits founded in 1540 who saw themselves as soldiers of christ.
the competition between these divergent christian traditions did much to shape european colonization of the americas.
roman catholic powers spain portugal and france sought to win souls in the americas for the church while protestant nations england and the netherlands viewed the catholic church as corrupt and exploitative and hoped instead to create godly communities attuned to the true gospel of christianity.
chapter 1 west and central africa origins of the atlantic slave trade homo sapiens originated in africa.
numerous civilizations had already risen and fallen there and contacts with the near east and the mediterranean were millennia old when western europeans began sailing down its atlantic coast.
home to perhaps 100 million in 1400 africa was divided by the vast expanse of the sahara.
north africa bordered on the mediterranean and its peoples fell under the domination of christian byzantium until the seventh century when muslim conquests brought the region under islamic influence.
in its coastal seaports the merchandise of asia the near east africa and europe converged.
south of the sahara by contrast the societies of west and central africa bordering on the atlantic were relatively isolated.
after 1400 that would quickly change.
empires kingdoms and ministates west africa the part of the continent that bulges into the atlantic can be visualized as a broad horizontal swath divided into three climatic zones.
the sahel is the mostly flat semiarid zone immediately south of the sahara.
below it lies the savanna a grassland region dotted with trees and shrubs.
south of the savanna in a band 200 to 300 miles wide along the west african coast lies a tropical rain forest.
a series of four major watersheds the senegal gambia volta and niger dominate west africa map 1 3.
sudanic civilization took root at the eastern end of west africa beginning around 9000 b c.
and traveled westward.
sudanic peoples domesticated cattle 8500 7500 b c.
and cultivated sorghum and millet 7500 7000 b c.
over several thousand years these peoples developed a distinctive style of pottery began to cultivate and weave cotton 6500 3500 b c.
and invented techniques for working copper and iron 2500 1000 b c.
sudanic civilization had its own tradition of monotheism distinct from that of christians muslims and jews.
most sudanic peoples in west africa lived in stratified states ruled by kings and princes who were regarded as divine.
from these cultural origins three great empires arose in succession in the northern savanna.
the first the ghana empire appeared sometime around a d 800.
ghana capitalized on the recently domesticated camel to pioneer trade routes across the sahara to colliding worlds 1450 1600 north africa where ghana traders carried the wealth of west africa.
the ghana empire gave way to the mali empire in the thirteenth century which was eclipsed in turn by the songhai empire in the fifteenth century.
all three empires were composed of smaller vassal kingdoms not unlike the aztec and inca empires and relied on military might to control their valuable trade routes.
gold abundant in west africa was the cornerstone of power and an indispensable medium of international trade.
by 1450 west african traders had carried so much of it across the sahara that it constituted one half to two thirds of all the gold in circulation in europe north africa and asia.
mansa musa the tenth emperor of mali was a devout muslim famed for his construction projects and his support of mosques and schools.
in 1326 he embarked on a pilgrimage to mecca with a vast retinue that crossed the sahara and passed through egypt.
they spent so much gold along the way that the regions money supply was devalued for more than a decade after their visit.
to the south of these empires the lower savanna and tropical rain forest of west africa were home to a complex mosaic of kingdoms that traded among themselves and with the empires to the north.
in such a densely populated resource rich region they also fought frequently in a competition for local power.
a few of these coastal kingdoms were quite large in size but most were small enough that they have been termed ministates by historians.
comparable to the city states of italy they were often about the size of a modern day county in the united states.
the tropical ecosystem prevented them from raising livestock since the tsetse fly which carries a parasite deadly to livestock was endemic to the region as was malaria.
in place of the compare and grain crops of the savanna these contrast peoples pioneered the cultivation how do the states of of yams they also gathered the savanna compare to those of the americas and resources from the rivers and europe.
trans saharan and coastal trade for centuries the primary avenue of trade for west africans passed through the ghana mali and songhai empires whose power was based on the monopoly they enjoyed over the trans saharan trade.
their caravans carried west african goods including gold copper salt and slaves from the south to the north across the sahara then returned with textiles and other foreign goods.

gold ivory and slaves moved north and east fine textiles spices and the muslim faith traveled south.
beginning in the 1430s the portuguese opened up maritime trade with the coastal regions of west africa which were home to many peoples and dozens of large and small states.
over the next century the movement of gold and slaves into the atlantic would surpass that across the sahara.
along the west african coast merchandise originating in the world beyond the sahara was scarce and expensive while markets for their own products were limited.
beginning in the mid fifteenth century a newly opening coastal trade with europeans offered many west african peoples a welcome alternative.
as european sailors made their way along the coast of west and then central africa they encountered a bewilderingly complicated political landscape.
around the mouths of the senegal and gambia rivers numerous mande speaking states controlled access to the trade routes into the interior.
proceeding farther along the coast they encountered the akan states a region of several dozen independent but culturally linked peoples.
the akan states had goldfields of their own and this region soon became known to europeans as the gold coast.
east of the akan states lay the bight of benin which became an early center of the slave trade and thus came to be called the slave coast.
bending chapter 1 colliding worlds 1450 1600 africans acknowledged multiple gods as well as spirits that lived in the earth animals and plants.
like animists in the americas and europe african communities had wise men and women adept at manipulating these forces for good or ill.
the sudanic tradition of divine kingship persisted and many people believed that their kings could contact the spirit world.
west africans treated their ancestors with great respect believing that the dead resided in a nearby spiritual realm and interceded in their lives.
most west african peoples had secret societies such as the poro for men and the sande for women that united people from different place events in lineages and clans.
these societies context conducted rituals that celebrated why were west african male virility and female fertility.

converts to islam knew the koran and worshipped only a single god.
some of their cities like timbuktu the legendary commercial center on the niger river became centers of islamic learning and instruction.
but most west exploration and conquest european engagement with the wider atlantic world began around 1400 when the portuguese monarchy propelled europe into overseas expansion.
portugal soon took a leading role in the african slave trade while the newly unified kingdom of spain undertook europes first conquests in the americas.
these two ventures though not initially linked eventually became cornerstones in the creation of the atlantic world portuguese expansion as a young soldier fighting north african moors with the crusading order of christ prince henry of portugal 1394 1460 learned of arab merchants rich trade in gold and slaves across the sahara.
seeking a maritime route to the source of this trade in west africa henry founded a center for oceanic navigation.
henrys mariners challenged to find a way through the treacherous waters off the northwest african coast designed a better handling vessel the caravel rigged with a lateen triangular sail that enabled the ship to tack into the wind.
this innovation allowed them to sail far into the atlantic where they discovered and colonized the madeira and azore islands.
from there they sailed in 1435 to sub saharan sierra leone where they exchanged salt wine and fish for african ivory and gold.

spanish soldiers went over a swampy land where the horsemen could not go.
a half league from camp they came upon some indian huts near the river but the people who were inside them plunged into the river.
they captured four indian women and twenty indians came at us and attacked us so stoutly that we had to retreat to the camp because of their being as they are so skillful with their weapons.
those people are so warlike and so quick that they make no account of foot soldiers for if these go for them they flee and when their adversaries turn their backs they are immediately on them.
the farthest they flee is the distance of an arrow shot.
they are never quiet but always running and crossing from one side to another so that the crossbows or the arquebuses can not be aimed at them and before a crossbowman can fire a shot an indian can shoot three or four arrows and very seldom t he kingdom of sofala lies between the two rivers magnice and cuama on the sea coast.

it is said that from these regions the gold was brought by sea which served for solomons temple at jerusalem a fact by no means improbable for in these countries of monomotapa are found several ancient buildings of stone brick and wood and of such wonderful workmanship and architecture as is nowhere seen in the surrounding provinces.
the kingdom of monomotapa is extensive and has a large population of pagan heathens who are black of middle stature swift of foot and in battle fight with great bravery their weapons being bows and arrows and light darts.
there are numerous kings tributary to monomotapa who constantly rebel and wage war against it.
the emperor maintains large armies which in the provinces are divided into legions after the manner of the romans for being a great ruler he must be at constant warfare in order to maintain his dominion.
amongst his warriors those most renowned for bravery are the female legions greatly valued by the emperor being the sinews of his military strength.

cut off from asia genoese traders sought an atlantic route to the lucrative markets of the indian ocean.
they began to work with portuguese and castilian mariners and monarchs to finance trading voyages and the african coast and its offshore islands opened to their efforts.

most of the islands were unpopulated.
the canaries were the exception it took castilian adventurers decades to conquer the guanches who lived there.
once defeated they were enslaved to labor in the canaries or on madeira where they carved irrigation canals into the islands steep rock cliffs.
europeans made no such inroads on the continent of africa itself.
the coastal kingdoms were well defended and yellow fever malaria and dysentery quickly struck down europeans who spent any time in the interior of west africa.
instead they maintained small fortified trading posts on offshore islands or along the coast usually as guests of the local king.
portuguese mariners continued to look for an atlantic route to asia.

da gama returned to india in 1502 with twenty one fighting vessels which outmaneuvered and outgunned the arab fleets.
soon the portuguese government set up fortified trading posts for its merchants at key points around the indian ocean in indonesia and along the coast of china map 1 4.

slaves were also central to the trans saharan trade.
when the renowned tunisian adventurer ibn battuta crossed the sahara from the kingdom of mali around 1350 he traveled with a caravan of six hundred female slaves destined for domestic service or concubinage in north africa egypt and the ottoman empire.
between a d 700 and 1900 it is estimated that as many as nine million africans were sold in the trans saharan slave trade.
europeans initially were much more interested in trading for gold and other commodities than in trading for human beings but gradually they discovered the enormous value of human trafficking.
to exploit and redirect the existing african slave trade portuguese merchants established fortified trading posts like those in the indian ocean beginning at elmina in 1482 where they bought gold and slaves from african princes and warlords.
first they enslaved a few thousand africans each year to work on sugar plantations on so tom cape verde the azores and madeira they also sold slaves in lisbon which soon had an african population of 9 000.

columbus and the caribbean simultaneously ferdinand and isabella sought trade and empire by subsidizing the voyages of christopher columbus an ambitious and daring mariner from genoa.
columbus believed that the atlantic ocean long feared by arab merchants as a 10 000 mile wide green sea of darkness was a much narrower channel of water separating europe from asia.
after cajoling and lobbying for six years columbus persuaded genoese investors in seville influential courtiers and finally ferdinand and isabella to accept his dubious theories and finance a western voyage to asia.

that the spanish had steel swords armor some guns horses and attack dogs certainly gave them a military advantage.
still concerted attack by the armies of the aztecs and their allies would have overwhelmed the invaders before they reached the capital of tenochtitln.
why was there no such attack.
one reason was that cortss force was bolstered by a sizable army from tlaxcala an independent kingdom hostile to the aztecs.
a later tradition also suggests that some aztecs including moctezuma thought that corts might be an emissary of their god quetzalcoatl.
these documents come from people who experienced the conquest.
consider them first as sources how trustworthy are they.
are they biased in any way.
then think about their contents do their accounts agree.
do they explain why the spaniards reached the city unmolested.
bernal daz del castillo corts and moctezuma meet bernal daz was an unlikely chronicler of great events.
born poor he went to america as a common soldier in 1514 and served under conquistadors in panama and cuba.
in 1519 bernal daz joined cortss expedition fought in many battles and as a reward received an estate in present day guatemala.
in his old age daz wrote the true history of the conquest of new spain a compelling memoir written from the perspective of a common soldier.
in fresh and straightforward prose it depicts the conquest as a divinely blessed event that saved the non aztec peoples of mexico from a barbarous regime.
the great moctezuma had sent these great caciques in advance to receive us and when they came before corts they bade us welcome in their language and as a sign of peace they touched their hands against the ground.
when we arrived near to tenochtitln.
the great moctezuma got down from his litter and those great caciques aristocrats supported him with their arms beneath a marvelously rich canopy of green coloured feathers with much gold and silver embroidery.
which was wonderful to look at.
the great moctezuma was richly attired according to his usage and he was shod with sandals the soles were of gold and the upper part adorned with precious stones.
many other lords walked before the great moctezuma sweeping the ground where he would tread and spreading cloths on it so that he should not tread on the earth.
not one of these chieftains dared even to think of looking him in the face but kept their eyes lowered with great reverence.
when corts was told that the great moctezuma was approaching and he saw him coming he dismounted from his horse and when he was near moctezuma they simultaneously paid great reverence to one another.
moctezuma bade him welcome and our corts replied through doa marina malinali also called malinche cortss indian interpreter who bore him a child wishing him very good health.
and then corts brought out a necklace which he had ready at hand made of glass stones.
which have within them many patterns of diverse colours these were strung on a cord of gold and with musk so that it should have a sweet scent and he placed it round the neck of the great moctezuma.
then corts through the mouth of doa marina told him that now his heart rejoiced having seen such a great prince and that he took it as a great honour that he had come in person to meet him.
thus space was made for us to enter the streets of mexico without being so much crowded.
but who could now count the multitude of men and women and boys who were in the streets and in canoes on the canals who had come out to see us.
it was indeed wonderful.
coming to think it over it seems to be a great mercy that our lord jesus christ was pleased to give us grace and courage to dare to enter into such a city and for the many times he has saved me from danger of death.
i give him sincere thanks.
they took us to lodge in some large houses where there were apartments for all of us for they had belonged to the father of the great moctezuma who was named axayaca.
corts thanked moctezuma through our interpreters and moctezuma replied malinche you and your brethren are in your own house rest awhile and then he went to his palaces which were not far away and we divided our lodgings by companies and placed the artillery pointing in a convenient direction and the order which we had to keep was clearly explained to us and that we were to be much on the alert both the cavalry and all of us soldiers.
a sumptuous dinner was provided for us according to their use and custom and we ate it at once.
so this was our lucky and daring entry into the great city of tenochtitlan mexico on the 8th day of november the year of our saviour jesus christ 1519.

ofttimes it was as if he sighed became weak felt weak.
wherefore he said what will now befall us.

it indeed bereft one of strength it shut off ones ears.
and when it discharged something like a round pebble came forth from within.

and their bodies were everywhere covered only their faces appeared.
they were very white they had chalky faces they had yellow hair though the hair of some was black.
and when moctezuma so heard he was much terrified.
it was as if he fainted away.
his heart saddened his heart failed him.
but he made himself resolute he put forth great effort he quieted he controlled his heart he submitted himself entirely to whatsoever he was to see at which he was to marvel.
he then greeted corts as described above.
and when the spaniards were well settled they thereupon inquired of moctezuma as to all the citys treasure.
the devices the shields.
much did they importune him with great zeal they sought gold.
thereupon were brought forth all the brilliant things the shields the golden discs the devils necklaces the golden nose crescents the golden leg bands the golden arm bands the golden forehead bands.

rumors of rich indian kingdoms encouraged other spaniards including hardened veterans of the reconquista to invade the mainland.
the spanish monarchs offered successful conquistadors noble titles vast estates and indian laborers.
with these inducements before him in 1519 hernn corts 1485 1547 led an army of 600 men to the yucatn peninsula.

chapter 1 conquerors cut off the citys supply of food and water and the residents of tenochtitln suffered spectacularly.
by 1521 corts and his men had toppled the aztec empire.
the spanish had a silent ally disease.
having been separated from eurasia for thousands of years the inhabitants of the americas had no immunities to common european diseases.
after the spaniards arrived a massive smallpox epidemic ravaged tenochtitln striking everywhere in the city according to an aztec source and killing moctezumas brother and thousands more.
they could not move they could not stir.
covered mantled with pustules very many people died of them subsequent outbreaks of smallpox influenza and measles killed hundreds of thousands of indians and sapped the survivors morale.
exploiting this demographic weakness corts quickly extended spanish rule over the aztec empire.
his lieutenants then moved against the mayan city states of the yucatn peninsula eventually conquering them as well.
in 1524 francisco pizarro set out to accomplish the same feat in peru.
by the time he and his small force of 168 men and 67 horses finally reached their destination in 1532 half of the inca population had already died from european diseases.
weakened militarily and divided between rival claimants to the throne the inca nobility was easy prey.
pizarro killed atahualpa the last inca emperor and seized his enormous wealth.
although inca resistance continued for a generation the conquest was complete by 1535 and spain was now the master of the wealthiest and most populous regions of the western hemisphere.
the spanish invasion changed life forever in the americas.
disease and warfare wiped out virtually all of the indians of hispaniola at least 300 000 people.
in peru the population of 9 million in 1530 plummeted to fewer than 500 000 a century later.
mesoamerica suffered the greatest losses in one of the great demographic disasters in world history its population of 20 million native americans in 1500 had dwindled to just 3 million in 1650.
