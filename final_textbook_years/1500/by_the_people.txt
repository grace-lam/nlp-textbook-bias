the columbian encounter led to unimagined power and wealth for many europeans.
it also led to the creation of new ethnic groups as children were born to american indian european couples.
and it shifted the balance of trade and commerce around the world from land to the worlds oceans.
for the american indians the encounter was even more of a surprise and much more devastating.
suddenly from across the ocean unimagined people arrived with a strange way of talking and dressing a strange religion and a different way of looking at the world.
in part because of differences in technology in part because of differences between european and indigenous peoples understandings of war and conquest and most of all because of differences in the two groups ability to withstand european diseases the encounter led to conquest disease and death for many indians.
understanding what happened in the history of the united states over the next 500 years depends on understanding the differences between those who arrived from europe especially from spain france and england as well as from africa and the diverse peoples who lived in the americas when they arrived.
with the arrival of columbus and the many europeans who followed him once news of his journey spread something new in human history took place a massive transit and mixing of peoples in north and south america.
columbus the columbian exchange and early conquests 2 1 explain the reasons behind the voyages of columbus and early spanish encounters with the peoples of the caribbean mexico and south america.
as delighted as columbus was by the taino welcome and generosity and what seemed to him the easy opportunity to convert them to christianity columbus also noted other things that would be more ominous for their future they do not carry arms nor are they acquainted with them because i showed them swords and they took them by the edge and through ignorance cut themselves.
they have no iron.
their javelins are shafts without iron and some of them have at the end a fish tooth.
conquest columbus came to believe would be easy.
28 parti contact and exploration 1491 1607 2 1 american voices the dedication of columbuss log to the king and queen of spain 1493 2 2 eturning from his first voyage in early 1493 columbus understood how much his exploration was linked to ferdinand and isabella s efforts to unify spain into a militant single minded nation.
he spelled out these links when he dedicated his report to the rulers.
whereas most christian and very noble and very excellent and very powerful princes king and queen of the spain s and of the islands of the sea our lords this present year of 1492 after your highnesses had brought to an end the war with the moors who ruled in europe and had concluded the war in the very great city of granada where this present year on the second day of the month of january i saw the royal standards of your highnesses placed by force of arms on the towers of the alhambra and your highnesses as catholic christians and princes lovers and promoters of the holy christian faith and enemies of the false doctrine of mahomet and of all idolatries and heresies you thought of sending me christobal colon to the said regions of india to see the said princes and the peoples and the lands and the characteristics of the lands and of everything and to see how their conversion to our holy faith might be undertaken.
so after having expelled all the jews from all of your kingdoms and dominions in the same month of january your highnesses commanded me to go with a suitable fleet to the said regions of india.

thinking critically 1.
documentary analysis what connection did columbus make between spain s defeat of muslim granada the expulsion of the jews from spain and his own voyage across the atlantic.
historical interpretation what does the document suggest about the role of religion in motivating spain s efforts at overseas exploration and expansion.
23 23 23 i i columbus described what would be the terms of much of the european contact with american indians they should be good and intelligent servants for i see that they say very quickly everything that is said to them columbus also looked closely at the ornaments and jewelry that some of the indians were wearing and wrote i was attentive and labored to find out if there was any gold the search for gold and the effort to subjugate the indians in its service had begun.
the four voyages of christopher columbus in spite of the friendly welcome he received columbus took some tainos as captives.
he wanted to teach them spanish and show them to his sponsors in spain.
columbus also wanted guides to the gold he was sure could be found since he had seen some tainos wearing gold ornaments.
led by native guides he sailed on to cuba and sent a party inland to find the local chief or cacique as the taino called their leaders who his guides said had access to gold.
when columbus did not find the leader or the gold he sailed to another island he named hispaniola modern haiti and the dominican republic.
he built a fort and left part of his crew there with instructions to search for gold.
in january 1493 columbus with six taino prisoners turned back to spain.
columbus never fully understood the importance of his voyage.
he set out to discover a route across the atlantic directly to asia and he thought he had indeed reached an unknown part of asia perhaps japan or korea.
thinking the people he met looked like those who came from the part of south asia europeans called the indies he called them indians.
of course he did not really discover a new land because the indians were already there.
columbus certainly discovered a new route across the atlantic but it led to a continent filled with people unknown to europeans.
the rest of columbuss life was a tragedy for himself and for the peoples he had encountered.
to impress the spanish court columbus exaggerated what he had chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 29 2 1 23 23 2 4 2 5 found especially the gold.
isabella and ferdinand gave him seventeen ships and 1 200 men for a second voyage to seek slaves and gold in this supposed part of asia just as the portuguese were finding both in africa.
when he arrived back on hispaniola in 1494 columbus found that the native residents had killed the sailors he had left behind in 1492.
a local chief initially offered protection to the europeans but when the sailors sought to make the tainos slaves they rebelled.
columbus ordered retribution and many tainos were killed.
as word spread of the harsh ways of the europeans the indians became less friendly and columbus found himself discovering deserted villages.
the caribbean had little gold despite columbuss desperate efforts to force the natives to find it and many tainos died from spanish swords or from forced labor that the spanish instituted.
columbus himself was a better explorer than administrator and less vicious than many of his successors see map 2 1.
during his third voyage to the caribbean in 1498 he tried to set up a government on hispaniola.
but many spaniards complained about hard lives there with little reward.
a new governor sent columbus back to spain in chains.
although the spanish monarchs forgave him and allowed him a fourth voyage in 1502 he never governed again.
amerigo vespucci inspires a continent s name columbus was not the first european to reach the americas.
archeologists have discovered evidence of a short lived norse settlement called lanse aux meadows on newfoundland somewhere between 900 and 1000 but the settlement was quickly forgotten on both sides of the atlantic.
if others crossed the atlantic or the pacific their voyages were also soon forgotten.
what was different about the voyage of columbus was that so much of europe took interest and so many europeans followed in his wake.
in the earliest exploration and conquest of the americas spain was the unquestioned leader.
portugal focused primarily on its rich trade routes around africa and iecona voyage third voyage 1498 1500 inset only fourth voyage 1502 1504 north america columbus de 3 total of four voyages starting and ending in the spanish port city of palos and enabling him to see and describe the islands of bahamas where he first landed hisoani modem dominican repul and haiffl cuba jamaica and much c he co a 3 to 30 parti contact and exploration 1491 1607 2 1 into the indian ocean.
however portuguese explorers also quickly followed routes across the atlantic similar to those of columbus exploring and claiming much of south america.
in 1494 spain and portugal agreed to the treaty of tordesillas in which a line drawn by the pope separated spanish and portuguese claims in south america.
to this day brazil east of the line is a portuguese speaking country while the rest of south america is spanish speaking.
in april 1495 only two years after columbus returned from his first voyage isabella and ferdinand authorized other spanish voyages across the atlantic.
a young italian merchant amerigo vespucci made three or four trips the historical record is not clear between 1497 and 1504 some authorized by spain others by portugal.
sailing along the coast of brazil much farther south than columbus ever ventured vespucci concluded that the land mass on the other side of the atlantic was much larger than the first reports indicated.
unlike columbus vespucci was convinced that europeans had reached a new continent rather than asia.
as a result a german publisher martin waldseemuller produced a new map of the world in 1507.
he called the new continent that vespucci described america in his honor.
treaty of tordesillas treaty confirmed by the pope in 1494 to resolve the claims of spain and portugal in the americas.
america the name given to the lands europeans encountered across the atlantic after 1492 in honor of the explorer amerigo vespucci.
22 23 24 23 the impact of european arms and disease the spanish governors who came after columbus were more efficient and more cruel.
as they learned more about the lands and peoples that columbus had claimed for them ferdinand and isabella pressed harder for gold.
they also ordered that the indians be treated well and not enslaved.
but spanish governors focused on the gold and ignored the command to show kindness.
nicolas de ovando who became governor on hispaniola in 1502 set a pattern.
he brought 2 500 spanish settlers families not just male explorers to build a permanent settlement.
in the future many spanish explorers also married native women creating new families of mixed ethnic heritage.
ovando attacked the tainos ruthlessly.
in 1502 he responded to a rebellion in higuey by capturing 600 700 indians and then ordering them all to be knifed to death and their bodies displayed.
later in 1503 he convened an ostensibly friendly meeting of the caciques the district chiefs and when some 80 of them had assembled in one building he ordered the doors locked and the building burned with them in it.
with that act the last independent chiefdoms of hispaniola were ended.
however the most devastating thing that columbus and his successors did was unintentional.
they brought european diseases.
the tainos like all natives of the americas had no immunity to smallpox measles or other diseases they had never known.
in europe where these diseases were common and had been for hundreds of years many people had developed immunity to them or at least to their worst effects.
american indians had no such immunity.
as a result while indians died by the hundreds from spanish swords they died by the thousands from disease.
there were probably 1 million people on hispaniola when columbus landed in 1492.
by the early 1500s only 1 000 tainos were left.
within a century all were gone.
the european destruction of the first people of the americas had begun.
from a total population of perhaps 70 80 million no one really knows when columbus arrived native peoples in both the americas dropped to 4 5 million as a result of war and disease in the decades after the first encounter.
however unintentional the introduction of european disease was the staggering numbers of indian deaths made their conquest easy and many europeans were happy to take advantage of their already cleared land.
for the indians tragedy followed tragedy.
soon on the islands where columbus first landed the only indian descendants were people of mixed races.
a spanish census of 1514 indicated that 40 percent of the spanish men had native wives.
the arrival of african slaves in the 1500s added african blood to the mix.
today many of the peoples of the americas are descendants of all three of the groups that met in the columbian encounter.
chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 31 european diseases especially smallpox killed more of the original inhabitants of the americas than any other cause.
this illustration originally done by aztec scribes before their conquest described a great sickness that came with sores so terrible that the victims could not lie face down nor on their backs nor move from one side to the other.
the making of an ocean world the atlantic and columbian exchange silk road the overland trading route first established by the venetian trader marco polo in the late 1200s.
news of the new contact with the americas changed the way many people looked at the world.
most educated europeans already believed that the world was round and not flat.
but until 1492 they were concerned primarily with the land.
traders had long gone over land on the silk road established between venice and china by marco polo between 1271 and 1295 that brought luxury goods to europe from asia.
portuguese sailors stayed close to the coast of africa as they sailed around that continent to asia.
norse sailors had explored the far north atlantic hopping from iceland to greenland and on to the nearest parts of north america seeking new fishing opportunities.
but columbus and his successors did something different they sailed directly across the ocean with no landmarks to guide their journey.
soon after that journey the oceans the atlantic the indian and very soon the pacific became the primary trade routes for europeans americans and increasing numbers of unwilling africans.
nations that had ports on the atlantic especially spain portugal and england moved from the margins of a land focused europe to become the key points of contact with an ocean focused world.
ihe shift from primarily land based or near shore sea trade to trade spanning the worlds oceans was a revolution in the way people thought and it had winners and losers.
i the trade and cultural exchanges across the interconnected continents of europe j asia and africa and did not end after 1492 but the relationships were different.
portugal and spain replaced genoa and venice as the primary european links to asia.
portuguese and spanish ships dominated the indian ocean.
many other spanish explorers followed columbus in very short order.
in addition to those who explored the atlantic i coast vasco nunez de balboa reached the isthmus of panama in 1513 and became the first european to view the pacific.
in 1519 five ships and their crews commanded by ferdinand magellan began a journey that led them around the tip of south america in 1520 and across the pacific to the philippines where magellan himself was killed.
three years after they had departed a handful of the explorers on one ship became the first contact and exploration 1491 1607 people to circumnavigate the globe arriving back in spain in 1522.
spanish galleons not only brought silver mined in the americas across the atlantic to spain but soon also brought silver across the pacific to manila in the philippines.
manila itself was founded by spanish traders in 1571.
the world of the 1500s was becoming an oceanic world including the atlantic the indian ocean and the pacific.
the atlantic ocean that had been the great barrier on the western edge of europe suddenly became the great highway connecting known and previously unknown continents.
portugal and spain were the first european states to establish trading routes across the oceans but during the 1500s england france and holland also assumed major roles in the new trade.
as europeans came to terms with the americas the people of the americas also had to come to terms with europe.
for each there were gains and losses.
what became known as the columbian exchange the interchange of diseases plants animals and human cultures between new and old worlds after 1492 reflected some of these changes.
the most tragic loss occurred with the transmission of disease bearing microbes that devastated populations in the americas.
new populations began to emerge after 1492 when the peoples who met in the americas produced offspring that carried the biological traits and the cultures of their ancestors from vastly different parts of the world.
the exchange also changed the eating habits of almost every person on the planet.
in europe asia and africa foods such as corn beans peanuts potatoes cassava columbian exchange the transatlantic exchange of plants animals and diseases that occurred after the first european contact with the americas.

horses changed the way many american indians lived.
a world without this variety is unimaginable today.
the conquest of the aztec and inca empires besides european diseases the peoples of the americas faced another threat armed conquest.
hernan cortes sailed from cuba to mexico with 600 soldiers in 1519.
within 2 years he conquered tenochtitlan the aztec capital and renamed it mexico city.
when he first arrived some of the aztecs may have thought cortes might be their lost god quetzalcoatl who was said to have vanished from the place where cortes landed.
in their initial encounter the aztec emperor motecuhzoma often written as montezuma welcomed cortes.
they exchanged gifts which cortes saw as a sign of submission to spain.
the relationship soured quickly.
cortes took the emperor prisoner but allowed him to maintain a facade of rule.
in july 1520 the aztecs turned on cortes and he and his soldiers fled the capital.
but they did not go far.
with support from thousands of non aztec tribes people who hated aztec dominance and who hated having their people being used for the human sacrifices that aztec religion demanded the spanish army regrouped and began a long bloody siege of tenochtitlan.
motecuhzoma himself was killed probably by his own people and cortes completed his conquest of the city in august 1521.
with tenochtitlan destroyed cortes set about building a new and grander city on the same spot.
on the site of the main aztec temple he ordered the building of a massive new catholic cathedral modeled on the one at granada which had recently been built in the former muslim stronghold in southern spain.
in both cases the religious architecture symbolized the defeat of the infidels within a generation a thriving new mexico city filled with great churches and government palaces had become the home of the spanish viceroy the kings representative and the capital of new spain as the spanish called their empire in mexico and central america.
one of the earliest images of hernan cortes on horseback fighting with aztec warriors.
contact and exploration 1491 1607 in 1532 in peru francisco pizarro and his army of 168 spanish soldiers defeated the inca emperor atahuallpa and his army of 80 000 soldiers.
within a few years the inca empire of 32 million people much larger than the aztec empire had become the viceroyalty of peru a second major outpost of distant spain.
its primary purpose was to supply gold and silver to finance spains european ambitions.
at potosi in bolivia 45 000 slaves at first indians then also africans worked the mines that created the wealth that made king charles v and his son philip ii the richest and most powerful rulers in europe.
the swiftness of the spanish conquest of the aztec and inca empires was possible for many reasons.
aztec resistance was undermined by a sense of fatalism fueled by early visions of their own defeat.
many non aztecs joined with cortes more than happy to be rid of the aztecs.
the incas could not imagine and therefore did not fear pizarros initial surprise attack since he claimed to come in the name of friendship.
pizarros dishonesty in announcing that he was coming in friendship followed by his surprise attack was simply inconceivable to people reared in the long history of inca civilization.
and both empires found spanish horses swords and armor terrifying.
the ruthless military skill of cortes and pizarro and the spanish mastery of guns steel swords and horses created an enemy who was simply unimaginable to aztec and inca armies and therefore very difficult to resist.
the aztecs and the incas could not match the spanish strategies and tools of war.
perhaps the most significant spanish advantage was smallpox.
the aztecs may have lost half of their population to smallpox during the 2 years of attack by cortes on their capital and the incas faced the same terrifying losses.
an inca emperor had died from smallpox shortly before pizarro arrived.
the disease traveled at a far faster pace than even spanish armies could march and often preceded them.
for people used to living in harmony with nature the terrible ravishing of the disease that occurred along with the arrival of these frightening white skinned bearded and horse mounted soldiers tore apart their world militarily culturally and spiritually all in a very short time.
2 1 thinking historically pizarro and atahuallpa in his popular book guns germs and steel the fate of human societies jared diamond traces the unequal competition between different groups of humans from the beginning of recorded history to the present.
his core question is why people of european origin came to dominate the planet despite the many advances asians africans and the peoples of the americas made.
in one chapter he focuses on the early encounter of europeans and americans describing why the inca emperor atahuallpa did not capture king charles i of spain.
the analysis focuses on the development of ideas technology and disease before 1492 that allowed atahuallpa and some 80 000 followers to be defeated by just 168 spaniards led by pizarro.
this kind of questioning is an important part of accurately understanding historical events.

chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 35 this statue of bartolome de las casas stands in a prominent place in modern mexico city as recognition of the respect in which he is held by many of the indigenous people of mexico and the americas.
encomienda in the spanish colonies the grant to a spanish settler of a certain number of american indian subjects who would pay him tribute in goods and labor.
conquistadores the name given to the early spanish conquerors of mexico and peru.
bartolome de las casas and the voices of protest spains treatment of the american indians did not occur without protest.
on hispaniola it was denounced within less than 20 years.
in 1511 on a sunday before christmas antonio de montesinos a dominican priest asked his spanish congregation tell me by what right do you keep these indians in cruel servitude.
you are in mortal sin for the cruelty and tyranny you deal out to these innocent people bartolome de las casas 1484 1566 may have heard montesinoss sermon.
certainly he had heard of it.
las casas edited the log of columbuss journey and moved to hispaniola to make his own fortune in 1502.
although he became a priest in 1510 he participated in the conquest of cuba in 1512 and was rewarded with a large ranch or encomienda worked by indian slaves.
but his conscience bothered him.
in 1514 he gave up the land and the slaves and began preaching and writing against the oppression of the indians which he continued to do for the next 50 years.
las casas documented in detail the cruelty of the spanish conquerors begging the spanish crown to stop the conquistadores the soldiers who were creating the spanish empire in the americas.
las casas also left an important record of the life and customs of the first peoples of the americas.
he wrote that among them marriage laws are nonexistent men and women alike choose their mates and leave them as they please without offense jealousy or anger they live he wrote in large communal bell shaped buildings housing up to 600 people at one time made of very strong wood and roofed with palm leaves they prize bird feathers of various colors beads made offish bones and green and white stones with which they adorn their ears and lips but they put no value on gold and other precious things they are extremely generous with their possessions and by the same token covet the possessions of their friends and expect the same degree of liberality.
if they worshipped at all it was not in a form that this catholic priest recognized.
nevertheless the key purpose of all of las casass writings was to ask the spanish authorities to intervene to protect the indians.
he described seeing native people worked although he never left europe theodore de bry 1528 1598 spent many years drawing illustrations of european indian encounters based on first hand reports including this one showing the attack by spanish soldiers on an indian village.

at times the distant monarchs seemed to heed him.
shortly before her death isabella ordered that the indians must be treated as freemen and not as slaves they must be given wages they must be treated well christians should receive better treatment than non christians las casas was determined to show just how far reality departed from these orders.
while las casas may have led the spanish authorities to make a few reforms the biggest effect of his work was not what he expected.
he was writing during the protestant reformation and protestants far more than catholics republished his words creating what came to be known as the black legend for the color of the priests robes of unique spanish cruelty.
history would show that the spanish were not unique in their treatment of american indians but the legend of their special cruelty persisted even as other europeans adopted the same techniques and attitudes.
2 1 quick review which factor do you believe was most responsible for the destruction of native populations.
justify your answer with evidence from the chapter.
american voices bartolome de las casas the history of the indies 1550 tr he publication of the history of the indies along with the many speeches and other writings from priests like las casas had multiple results.
las casas clearly documented for all time just how cruel the first europeans were in their treatment of the indigenous people of the americas.
on a few occasions it led spanish authorities to end some abuses or replace vicious officials but such steps were rare and seldom had lasting effect.
in the hands of enemies of catholic spain the documents were used to create a long lasting story of unique spanish cruelty.
ultimately the careful documentation created one of the best reports even if a romanticized one on the experience of american indians at the time of their first encounter with europeans.
the following is an excerpt from las casas s history the men were sent out to the mines as far as 80 leagues away while their wives remained to work the soil not with hoes or plowshares drawn by oxen but with their own sweat and sharpened poles that were far from equaling the equipment used for similar work in castile.
they had to make silo like heaps for cassava plants by digging 12 square feet 4 palms deep and 10 000 or 12 000 of such hills a giant s work next to one another had to be made and they had other tasks of the same magnitude of whatever nature the spaniards saw as fittest to make more money.
thus husbands and wives were together only once every 8 or 10 months and when they met they were so exhausted and depressed on both sides that they had no mind for marital communication and in this way they ceased to procreate.
as for the newly born they died early because their mothers overworked and famished had no milk to nurse them and for this reason while i was in cuba 7 000 children died in 3 months.
some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation while others caused themselves to abort with certain herbs that produced stillborn children.
in this way husbands died in the mines wives died at work and children died from lack of milk while others had not time or energy for procreation and in a short time this land which was so great so powerful and fertile though so unfortunate was depopulated.
if this concatenation of events had occurred all over the world the human race would have been wiped out in no time.

chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 37 martin luther s challenge to catholic teachings and practices in his day led to a decisive split in the unity among christians that had been known in western europe for centuries.
soon thereafter john calvin also challenged some of luther s teachings leading to a three way split between catholics lutherans and calvinists followed by further splits among protestants.

protestant reformation the process that began with martin luther s efforts to reform the catholic church s practices in the early 1500s and that eventually led followers of luther calvin and others to completely break from the catholic church.
nation state a relatively new development in europe during the 1300s and 1400s in which nations became the major political organizations replacing both the smaller kingdoms and city states.
when columbus sailed in 1492 he did so with a commission from the rulers of a newly unified spain.
spanish explorers and conquerors brought the same quest for unity to the americas.
they sought to convert all native peoples to catholic christianity as part of the expansion of spains realm.
in 1492 few western europeans would disagree with that mission.
soon however europes religious unity would disappear.
less than 30 years after columbus made his voyage across the atlantic the protestant reformation changed the way europeans thought about the world whether they became protestant or remained catholic.
the initial european encounter with the americas was led by representatives of a religiously united europe.
but nearly all of the subsequent exploration and settlement of north america was conducted by europeans who represented particular groups from a continent deeply divided by religious hostility.
that divide shaped the way they understood their efforts on both sides of the atlantic.
the birth of protestantism in 1517 before hernan cortes began his conquest of mexico a young german monk martin luther 1483 1546 asked for a debate about religious doctrine by posting his ninety five theses on the door of a church in wittenberg in the small independent german speaking state of saxony.
at this time some within the roman catholic church began to challenge some of the churchs practices prompted partly by new translations of the bible and by new attention to the writings of saint augustine a theologian of the early church.
the challenges questioned the catholic churchs insistence that bishops and not everyday christians should interpret the bible and the idea that one could reach salvation through good works in particular the challenge that luther posted questioned the catholic practice of using indulgences that granted forgiveness to sinners to raise money.
his action quickly led to a religious split first in germany and then across europe.
that split known as the protestant reformation would shape the cultural and political development of the future united states.
as word of luthers protests spread many germans including significant members of the nobility who controlled many of the small independent states of germany were drawn to the lutheran cause.
in the century that followed other protestants developed their own religious ideas including followers of the french swiss reformer john calvin 1509 1564 who were known as calvinists while other protestants went in other directions.
part of what fueled the extraordinary response to luthers challenge was the cumulating effect that the technology of printing had produced during the previous 62 years.
johannes gutenbergs creation of a printing press that used moveable type in 1455 and the subsequent rapid spread of printing hugely expanded literacy beyond a small educated elite mostly clergy who had monopolized literacy in the medieval world.
by 1500 at least 10 million individual books had been printed and many people learned to read thus new ideas could spread with a rapidity not known before.
sermons and pamphlets by catholics lutherans and calvinists circulated rapidly.
the printing press prompted a free flow of ideas that most people in europe had not experienced before.
religion and the nation state the idea of the nation state developed more or less at the same time as the protestant catholic split.
the modern idea that the world should be governed by independent nations or nation states was new in the europe of the 1500s.
indeed a world divided into separate independent nations clashed with a long standing ideal held by many of a unified europe unified in religion and government.
in reality the europe of the 1400s was not united at 9 part i contact and exploration 1491 1607 1 united scandinavia scotland north sea united ireland netherlands england amsterdam 5 s a bristol dublin plymouth german and other states london holy roman empire atlantic ocean normandy paris swltz.

in the years before columbus made his 1492 voyage across the atlantic western europe was being divided into nation states including england france and spain.
central europe remained a series of separate states loosely united in the holy roman empire.
real power rested in very local territories.
frederick elector or duke of saxony was luthers protector and had enough power to ensure luthers safety in spite of hostility from the holy roman emperor the pope and the kings of nearby france.
but most of europes modern nations did not exist.
even within the church distance and the difficulty of travel gave local catholic bishops great independence from papal authorities in rome.
by the late 1400s however something new was emerging in european views of the best forms of government.
ferdinand and isabella united spain by 1492.
kings in france sweden scotland and england had done the same earlier in the 1400s.
the idea of being part of a nation was taking on new importance see map 2 2.
virtually no one argued in favor of religious freedom for the citizens of these nations.
instead different religious parties catholics and assorted protestants lutherans calvinists and others sought to impose their religious beliefs on as many others as possible.
each party argued that it was defending truth and saw no reason to tolerate those they believed were defending error.
this belief in the absolute rightness of ones cause led to more than a century of bloody persecution and religious wars from ireland and scotland to france germany and hungary.
the peace of augsburg in 1555 that addressed divisions between lutherans and catholics and the treaty of westphalia that concluded the thirty years war between catholics and protestants in central europe in 1648 each provided that in each nation covered by the treaty the ruler would decide the faith of the people and that foreign armies would no longer intervene in the religious affairs of another state.
it was a long way from religious freedom but it brought an end to the worst religious bloodshed while linking national unity and religious uniformity more tightly together than ever.
the protestant reformation and the divisions that followed had a huge impact on european settlement in the americas.
different nations from a divided europe battled with each other for control of those new lands.
in addition the wars and divisions in europe led many to seek asylum in a new place preferably as far away from the old as possible.
peace of augsburg in 1555 an agreement among different smaller kingdoms in germany that no ruler would attack the kingdom of another on religious grounds.
treaty of westphalia a 1648 peace treaty between a number of european powers that significantly extended the ideas of the peace of augsburg.
quick review why might religious changes inspire people in europe to look outward to the rest of the world.
how would the link of religious and national unity in spain and other parts of europe affect the behavior of europeans when they conquered other people.
chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 39 exploration and encounter in north america the spanish 23 kntiylq early spanish exploration of america north of mexico.
23 conquests of the aztec and inca empires produced extraordinary wealth for spain.
exploration further north in the americas in the future united states was secondary for the conquistadores and much less lucrative for spain.
in spite of the wealth being generated from the empires in mexico and peru for more than a century most europeans showed more interest in getting through or around north america and on to asia than in exploring the lands north of new spain.
nevertheless the unknown lands north of mexico beckoned to some spaniards in the 1500s even if they were not considered as exciting as central and south america see map 2 3.
ponce de leon in florida 1513 1521 juan ponce de leon who had been part of the spanish army that conquered muslim granada in 1492 led the first known european expeditions to puerto rico and florida.
in 1508 1509 he founded the first spanish community near what would become san juan and was named governor of puerto rico.
in 1513 he led an expedition from puerto rico that arrived in what he thought was another island which he named la florida.
legend says he was seeking a fountain of youth that would keep him forever young.
certainly he was seeking an expansion of spains empire in the americas and greater wealth for himself.
ponce de leon was accompanied by free africans whose families were slaves in spain.
europeans africans and the native peoples of the americas first met on the soil of the future united states when ponce de leon landed.
in 1521 ponce de leon returned to florida with some 200 followers europeans africans and indians from puerto rico.
the native americans in florida did not welcome them.
ponce de leon was wounded by a poisoned arrow and died soon thereafter.
but the first of many contacts between native peoples and travelers from europe and africa in what are now the 50 united states had been made in florida.
narvaez 1528 coronado 1540 1542 cabeza de vaca drake 1577 1580 and esteban 1528 1536 map 2 3 north american exploration.
in the first one hundred years after columbus european exploi trave ed alon9 doth the atlantlc and pacific coasts and through much of the interior of what almost two hundred years later would become the united states.
by 1592 however most europeans had concluded that there was no easy route through north america to asia and little gold to be found so they lost intere in the regions north of mexico.
7 artl contact and exploration 1491 1607 1 exploring texas by accident cabeza de vaca 1528 1536 in 1528 there was another ill fated effort to colonize florida.
panfilo de narvaez sailed to tampa bay with about 400 men europeans and a few africans.
the narvaez expedition was a disaster.
leaving the ships in tampa bay about 300 men spent months tramping through swamps seeking gold and soon merely food and water.
along the way american indians attacked them shooting arrows that penetrated their heavy spanish armor.
the attackers quickly vanished into the forests and swamps while the surviving spaniards tramped on wearing 50 to 60 pounds of heavy armor.
finally ill under attack and starving the survivors decided to build new boats and leave.
years later one of them remembered this seemed impossible to all because we did not know how to build them nor were there one of all the things that are necessary nor anyone who would know any way to apply ingenuity.
and above all there was nothing to eat.
nevertheless they built five barges and 250 men set out for what they hoped would be home.
instead the currents winds and a hurricane took them west.
two or three of the five barges survived the storm and came ashore near what is now galveston texas.
american indians gave the survivors food water and shelter.
of the 80 explorers who survived the journey across the gulf of mexico only 15 lived through the first winter on the texas coast see map 2 2.
the others died of cold and disease.
many of the american indian hosts also died of european diseases that the spanish brought with them and the surviving indians grew hostile to these intruders who had brought so much disease and trouble.
while others from the narvaez expedition may have lived out their lives among the american indians of the texas coast only four of them three spaniards alvar nunez cabeza de vaca andres dorantes alonso del castillo maldonado and an african muslim slave from north africa named esteban decided to literally walk home to mexico city.
thus like florida texas was explored by europeans and africans together providing the indians there with their first exposure to both.
the foursomes 8 year adventure took them through southern texas the northern states of mexico and eventually to the pacific coast and on to mexico city.
the four travelers found villages developed a reputation as healers and traders and collected a trove of information about american indians who lived in permanent houses and had a good supply of corn and beans.
later cabeza de vaca described the ways of the people he met when indian men get into an argument in their villages they fist fight until exhausted then separate.
sometimes the women will go between and part them but men never interfere.
no matter what the disaffection they do not resort to bows and arrows all these plains tribes are warlike and have as much strategy for protection against enemies as if they had been reared in italy in continual feuds whoever fights them must show no fear and no desire for anything that is theirs.
i believe these people see and hear better and have keener sense in general than any in the world.
they know great hunger thirst and cold as if they were made for enduring these more than other men by habit and nature.
cabeza de vaca also described a big copper rattle that was given to them it had a face represented on it and the natives prized it highly it had been brought from the north where there was a lot of it replied the natives who considered copper very valuable.
wherever it came from we concluded the place must have a foundry to have cast the copper in hollow form.
the american indians refused to believe these men were of the same race as the spaniards they had previously known.
as cabeza de vaca wrote the four explorers appeared to be distinct from earlier spanish invaders because we cured the sick and they killed those who were healthy and that we came naked and barefoot and they 1 i i chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 41 were clothed and on horseback and with lances and.
had no other purpose but to steal everything they found when the four explorers finally reached mexico city in 1536 their story inspired further exploration.
ihe expeditions that followed however did not heed the four explorers peaceful approach to interactions but were instead motivated by suggestions of astounding riches.
23 i seven cities of cibola the name given by early spanish explorers to a number of native american pueblos.
exploring the southwest esteban de niza and coronado 1539 1542 the four texas explorers found great interest as they told their story in mexico city.
in their 8 years living with american indians the spaniards heard stories of seven wealthy and powerful cities with buildings of four or five stories and copper silver and gold everywhere upriver on the rio grande.
for the spaniards stories of fabulous wealth were alluring.
a spanish legend seemed to further validate what the four texas explorers shared.
the legend told about seven christian bishops who had fled from the muslim invasion of spain in the 700s and established seven wealthy cities far to the west.
as the spanish community in mexico city heard the stories brought from texas many of them remembered both the wealth that cortes had found and the ancient stories of the fleeing bishops.
the texas survivors showed the copper rattle they had been given which added to the allure.
many in mexico city now wanted to explore the territory to their north.
in 1539 a franciscan brother marcos de niza led an expedition to find the fabled cities.
de niza asked esteban the african who had walked across texas to scout for them.
thus an african was the first non indian many of the pueblo peoples met.
esteban knew that the native americans had never seen a black person.
from his years in texas he also thought he knew what would impress them he wore feathers bells and turquoise and took on aspects of a god.
he sent messages back to de niza indicating that he had come to wealthy towns.
esteban enjoyed his role until he came to the zuni pueblo of hawikuh.
the zuni told esteban to leave.
when he threatened them they killed him.
de niza came far enough north to see hawikuh from a distance but he did not want to risk estebans fate.
he returned to mexico city and reported to the viceroy that the city is better seated than any i have seen in these parts and he said i was told that there is much gold there and the natives make it into vessels and jewels for their ears and into little blades with which they wipe away their sweat de niza was careful not to claim more than he had seen.
he had seen irrigated fields buffalo hides and from a distance populous towns and he had only heard reports of gold and great wealth.
nevertheless such a report was enough to launch further expeditions.
de niza had also heard a name for the region cibola.
from then on the search for the seven cities of cibola became the stuff of legend.
in 1540 francisco vazquez de coronado led a large expedition across what is now the u s mexican border into modern arizona.
at the zuni pueblo of hawikuh in the confederation of cibola they had their first battle with the american indians of the southwest.
the zunis did not take kindly to the demand that they submit to previously unheard of spanish authority.
coronados men had gone without adequate food for quite some time by this point and they attacked the village primarily to gain access to food.
the coronado expedition then turned east to central new mexico.
although the spanish found many communities along the rio grande the pueblo indians of the area were no more enthusiastic about submitting to spanish power or supplying the spanish with food and provisions than the zuni had been.
the pueblos quickly found that rather than fight the best solution seemed to be to keep the spanish moving by assuring them that the real wealth was just over the horizon.
in 1541 the expedition set off into what are now northern texas oklahoma and kansas.
the spaniards met teya indians seminomadic peoples who had found ways to live well in a harsh countryside far better than the spaniards could.
coronado and his men did not however find gold or european style cities.
finally discouraged and with their supplies gone they returned to mexico city in 1542 with little to show for their efforts.
it was decades before spanish authorities would try again to settle in arizona or new mexico.
art i contact and exploration 1491 1607 exploring the mississippi river valley the de soto expedition 1539 1542 while coronado was roaming the southwest another spanish adventurer hernando de soto was exploring even more of the future united states.
de soto had won fame and gold through military exploits in panama in the 1520s and had been a part of pizarros conquest of the inca empire in the 1530s.
he was then given a royal charter to settle la florida and the lands beyond.
he would try again where ponce de leon and de narvaez had failed.
in 1539 he sailed to florida with some 500 to 600 spaniards and about 100 captive american indians and africans.
the expedition also brought blacksmiths to make chains for the new slaves they expected to capture.
in northern florida near modern day tampa they saw fields of corn and large towns led by powerful rulers.
in 1540 the expedition moved into georgia and the carolinas.
in a place they called cofitachiqui probably a creek indian village the ruler a young woman greeted de soto and presented unto him great store of clothes of the country and took from her own neck a great cordon of pearls and cast it about the neck of the governor entertaining him with very gracious speeches of love and courtesy de soto responded by taking the princess prisoner and demanding that she guide his expedition over the appalachian mountains to the gold he sought.
she did lead them over the mountains but then escaped taking the pearls that she had given de soto home with her.
other indians who happened to be in de sotos path would not be so fortunate.
as the expedition crossed the appalachian mountains into tennessee and on into alabama and mississippi they were met by native americans bringing gifts the spaniards quickly tried to make the natives into guides and slaves.
but as word of the spaniards spread they found fewer gifts and more hostility.
de soto reported well populated lands.
later european explorers however found far fewer indians most likely because of diseases unintentionally brought by de sotos expedition.
in 1541 de soto crossed the mississippi river and explored what is now arkansas and probably modern day texas.
when they turned back to the mississippi river de soto demanded that a nearby native american town provide supplies and porters to help with the river crossing.
when the village chief refused de soto ordered his soldiers to destroy the town his journal reports that the cries of the women and children were such as to deafen those who pursued them 2 3 jacques le moyne an early french colonist in florida drew this picture of an indian queen being carried by high ranking men.
while the picture is from the later 1500s in florida the princess that the de soto expedition met a few years earlier may well have been treated with similar respect.
chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 43 de soto himself died of fever on june 20 1542.
his fellow explorers sunk his body in the mississippi river so the now hostile indians would not know their leader was gone.
then they built rafts and drifted down the river.
after considerable hardship 311 survivors about half the original group reached mexico.
they had not found much in north america that interested them.
exploring california the cabrillo voyage 1542 1543 while coronado was exploring new mexico and de soto the mississippi valley the spanish authorities commissioned juan rodriguez cabrillo to investigate the pacific coast.
cabrillo had come to new spain as a young man and amassed a fortune which he was prepared to use to outfit his own expedition in hopes of great returns.
in 1542 cabrillo sailed north from mexico along the pacific coast with three ships to discover 2j the coast of new spain and continue until he reached china which was assumed to be not far distant.
cabrillo s three ships left navidad mexico in june 1542 and by september had reached san diego bay in california.
they exchanged gifts with friendly american indians and reported seeing a beautiful land of valleys savannas high mountains and smoke that indicated a large native population.
cabrillo called california a good country where you can make a settlement he continued north along the pacific coast as far as the russian river in northern california.
like many after him cabrillo overlooked the area of what is now san francisco because of the heavy fog.
he did however realize that in monterey bay the future capital of spanish and mexican california there was a fine harbor.
after cabrillo died of an injury while trying to rescue some of his men from an attack the expedition returned to mexico.
they had found neither china nor the gold they sought.
early settlements in florida fort caroline and st augustine 1562 1565 after all these failed efforts spanish interest in the lands north of mexico waned.
the first actual european settlements in north america reflected the growing divisions in europe itself.
catholic spain now had to compete with france a nation divided between catholicism and protestantism and with protestant england and holland.
only when these other european powers showed an interest in north america did spain set up permanent settlements there.
no nation was more deeply split by the protestant catholic divide than france which had a large protestant minority and a strong catholic majority.
it was from the french protestants that the first settlers in florida were recruited.
in 1562 gaspard de coligny a french protestant nobleman and admiral commissioned expeditions to florida.
although there was no european settlement in florida it seemed to be a strategic location on the sea lanes between spains empire in mexico and south america and spain itself.
as a loyal subject of the french king coligny wanted to secure lands for france.
he also wanted to create a safe haven for his fellow protestants.
in 1562 coligny commissioned jean ribault to make an initial trip to florida and then commissioned a larger french expedition including many families with their livestock supplies and tools which sailed in 1564.
the settlers moved to the mouth of the st johns river where jacksonville florida is today and built a town they named fort caroline after king charles ix of france.
they meant to stay and build their lives there.
it would be a useful outpost for france yet far enough away to avoid the political and religious turmoil of their homeland.
the spanish however considered this colony a major religious political and commercial threat to spain s control of the americas.
pedro menendez de aviles was given jurisdiction of a new spanish colony to reach from florida to newfoundland and told to establish cities in florida and oust the french protestants.
he did both.
in 1565 menendez de aviles founded st augustine today the oldest city of european origin in the united states.
all the lands north and west of it he declared now belonged to the king of spain.
he began a friendly trade with the timuca indians part i contact and exploration 1491 1607 this illustration by jacques le moyne shows the french led by jean ribault landing at the st johns river in florida in may 1562 and being greeted by friendly timuca indians.
who lived in northern florida and sought to convert them to catholicism.
the timucas valued spanish goods and provided the colony with food root vegetables wild fruit fish oysters game and corn but they resisted religious conversion.
having established st augustine de aviles attacked fort caroline killing all its inhabitants.
when the french fleet coming to aid fort caroline was shipwrecked along the coast by a hurricane de aviles killed the survivors too.
florida would remain in spanish hands for centuries and its bloody european beginnings mirrored europes divisions.
ihe founders of spains first colonies in north america like those who settled in latin america reflected the spirit of the reconquista or reconquest of spain itself when both muslims and jews were driven out of the country and religious and national unity were seen as one and the same.
for hundreds of years soldiers of christian spain fought against muslims whom they considered infidels seeking to win military glory wealth and spiritual honor on the battlefield.
it was a worldview in which religious fervor and military bravery were united in the service of the nation.
after the victory over the last muslim stronghold in spain in 1492 the next generation of spanish men could not hope for the success of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers in spain itself but they brought the same mixture of military heroics and religious fervor to the americas.
in the 1500s a way of looking at the world and especially at conquest that had been reshaping spain itself for hundreds of years became the key to creating an ever expanding empire in the americas.
cultural practices in spain and other parts of europe at the time may have also played a role in how ruthless the early europeans were.
under a system of primogeniture land was typically passed on to the oldest son.
younger sons then would not chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 45 23 have the same opportunities to acquire land and the wealth that went with it.
some would opt to spend their lives in the church but many would opt to spend their lives as soldiers where through conquest of new lands they might be rewarded.
unlike mexico and peru the spanish colonies in florida were settled by soldiers who did not want to create a vast empire but valued the independence that distance from imperial authorities gave them and by families of artisans and farmers who meant to build a richer life than they could have in spain.
as citizens on the border between european settlement and american indian territory these settlers wanted to enjoy the municipal liberties that the free cities of castile had enjoyed when they had represented the border between christian and muslim spain.
they also wanted to avoid the tightly ordered hierarchical society that was evolving in mexico.
the cities and the farms in florida prospered.
one settler recorded i have planted with my own hands grapevines pomegranates orange trees and figs wheat barley onions garlic and many vegetables that grow in spain the colonists quickly took to the corn that was the staple of the indian diet.
there were also slaves in st augustine from the beginning.
although his royal commission had authorized him to bring up to 500 african slaves to st augustine de aviles actually brought only about 50.
in time spanish florida had a black militia and included both african slaves and free africans.
there was also intermarriage and more casual sexual encounters among europeans native americans and africans in spanish florida.
in this outpost the races blended creating a new culture and new bloodlines.
in addition st augustine became a place where europeans from other nations settled.
some settled of necessity after their ships were wrecked on the florida coast.
others came to escape legal problems military commitments or families.
despite strict rules issued in madrid isolated places like st augustine reflected considerable diversity including jews escaping an increasingly intolerant europe as well as french flemish and german immigrants escaping religious persecution or simply wanting a new start in life.
after its founding in 1565 and up until 1705 st augustine was home to a large scale effort to send franciscan missionaries into the surrounding native american territories.
the franciscans who traveled into the interior of florida and georgia to make converts also sought alliances with the indians.
tribal leaders came to st augustine to trade and negotiate and they accepted however casually spanish rule.
eventually about 80 mission centers were established from the savannah river in georgia to as far south as modern daytona beach.
the franciscans however also brought european diseases along with their preaching and the american indian population fell drastically.
nevertheless for a century native americans missionaries and soldiers traded religious and cultural ideas as well as the tools of commerce and war.
they intermarried and substantially influenced each other and their offspring in florida.
despite occasional battles with the american indians raids by european navies and hurricanes life in spanish florida continued more or less uninterrupted well into the 1700s.
while the english focused their efforts further north and the spanish empire centered on mexico central and south america those who were in florida were left alone.
except for a brief period of british rule between 1763 and 1784 florida remained a spanish colony until it was ceded to the united states in 1821 256 years after the founding of st augustine.
settling new mexico 1598 after coronados expedition to explore the north american southwest returned to mexico city in 1542 there was little further exploration of new mexico for over half a century.
then in 1598 the spanish viceroy in mexico city decided it was time for another look at the lands of the north and appointed a new governor for what was called new mexico the rumors that great wealth existed there had never died.
more pragmatically the spanish were worried about the protestant english.
in 1579 francis 46 exploration 1491 1607 drake an english privateer a pirate working for the government sailed up the coast of california duplicating cabrillos route and his failure to find san francisco.
drake then turned west and duplicated the route of an earlier spanish explorer ferdinand magellan sailing across the pacific and on around the world before returning to london in 1580.
to the authorities in spain this achievement was a real threat.
settling the interior of north america suddenly seemed imperative.
don juan de onate was appointed governor of new mexico with instructions not to follow the harsh policies of cortes or pizarro.
the kings appointment letter said you will endeavor to attract the natives with peace friendship and good treatment and to induce them to hear and accept the holy gospel a succession of spanish monarchs never approved of the viciousness of the conquistadors though they accepted the gold and silver that flowed back to spain without asking too many questions about how it was acquired.
onates expedition included 400 men women and children among them a few spanish soldiers franciscan friars and indians along with supply wagons cattle sheep and mules.
onates wife isabel tolosa cortes montezuma was herself a granddaughter of cortes and a great granddaughter of the aztec emperor montezuma.
on april 30 1598 the expedition stopped on the banks of the rio grande and claimed all of the lands and peoples to the north for spain.
onate named the place where he crossed the river el paso del norte the pass to the north since coronados day the pueblo indians had seen spanish soldiers and missionaries come and go.
the spanish could be ruthless but they also seemed to have little staying power.
with the onate expedition spanish occupation of new mexico would come closer to being permanent.
onate sought political allegiance from the pueblos of southern new mexico.
in july 1598 he asked pueblo chiefs to swear allegiance to spain and convert to christianity.
onate chose to interpret their lack of hostility as agreement.
he also built a capital which he named san gabriel.
something resembling a permanent settlement of 400 europeans in the middle of thousands of pueblo indians took shape.
at first all was peaceful.
onate divided new mexico into administrative districts each with a priest in each to try to convert the american indians to christianity.
he allowed self government to continue in each pueblo he had little choice but insisted that each one must have a political governor.
he was more interested in exploring for the gold silver or pearls which he was sure were just over the horizon and did not try to force the native americans to labor for the spanish.
the peace did not last however.
zutucapan the leader of the acoma pueblo had avoided meeting onate because he did not want to cede any authority to the spaniards.
late in 1598 he attacked a spanish scouting party and in 1599 onate struck back.
after a fierce battle the spaniards whose guns swords and horses gave them a huge advantage burned acoma to the ground.
one thousand of its residents were killed and the remaining 500 were taken as slaves.
the male captives had one foot cut off.
when the jumano indians also resisted onate he hanged their chiefs and burned their village.
onates cruelty and his failure to find riches led to his recall in 1609.
the new royal governor don pedro de peralta moved the capital further north to a new town that he created and named santa fe inl610.
there peralta built the oldest public building still standing in the united states the governors mansion.
the colonys attention turned from gold to farming.
churches were built at the center of each pueblo.
the spanish hoped these churches would become new centers of indian life and faith but tensions would continue that would eventually culminate some 50 years later in a surprising revolt.
quick review how did spanish exploration in north america change overtime.
what was different between the exploration that took place between 1513 and 1543 and the latter developments between 1565 and 1598.
identify and explain factors that most contributed to this evolution.
chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 47 2 4 exploration and encounter in north america the french analyze early french exploration and claims in north america.
king francis i of france r 1515 1547 did not want to leave the americas to spain or portugal which was quickly developing its own empire in brazil.
in 1524 some 30 years after columbus made his journey the french king commissioned an italian sailor giovanni da verrazano to explore the atlantic coast and find a sea route to asia for france.
verrazano sailed from florida to newfoundland but concluded that an entire continent divided the atlantic from the pacific.
after verrazano french interest in north america focused further north on the st lawrence river valley and what became canada especially after jacques cartiers visit of 1534 to that region and after the destruction of fort caroline in 1565 as well as on islands in the caribbean.
eventually while the spanish explored the mississippi river valley north from the gulf of mexico the french would explore the same river coming south from their settlements near the mississippis headwaters and tributaries in what is today the midwest.
first french visit to the atlantic coast of the united states verrazano 1524 verrazanos ship la dauphine left france in january 1524 and landed on what is now cape fear north carolina 2 months later.
he described the people he met there as of color russet and not much unlike the saracens their hair black thick and not very long he wondered if they might be chinese.
on april 17 1524 verrazano became the first european to sail into new york harbor describing how the inhabitants of manhattan came towards us very cheerfully making shouts of admiration showing us where we might come to land most safely with our boat he continued north visiting rhode islands narragansett bay maine and newfoundland and he mapped much of the atlantic coast of the future united states and canada before returning to france.
jacques cartier seeks a sea route to asia 1534 in 1534 france tried again to find a northern sea route to asia.
jacques cartier was authorized to make the effort for france.
cartier did not find the route which did not exist except through then frozen arctic ice but he explored newfoundland and the gulf of the st lawrence river laying the basis for future french claims to these lands.
he also began a trade in furs that would have great significance for french and english relations with american indians.
on a second voyage in 1535 1536 cartier explored the st lawrence river far upstream see map 2 2 coming to the sites of quebec and montreal.
more than a thousand friendly indians came to the river to greet him.
he traded european goods including knives for food beginning a trading relationship that would transform the lives of native tribes and europeans.
but cartier stayed too long and when the winter closed in he could not return to france because the river froze over.
cartier spent a terrible winter on the st lawrence buried in deep snow and losing a quarter of his crew to disease and cold.
although cartiers travels would be the basis for future french land claims it would be another half century before the french developed a serious interest in north america after they discovered that there was no quick way around it to the asian lands they really wanted to find.

king henry vii of england commissioned another italian giovanni caboto or john cabot to sail across the atlantic in 1497.
cabot made landfall in north america most likely in newfoundland and may have traveled as far south as maine.
he did not meet any people but erected a cross and banner to claim the lands for england.
when he returned to london he was given a rich reward.
in 1498 cabot set out on a second voyage but he and his companions disappeared most likely their ships were sunk in a storm and there is no clear evidence of further english discoveries or claims in the americas until more than 50 years later when a very different england found new reasons to look more carefully across the atlantic.
england s reformation shapes the country in the early years of the protestant reformation few would have predicted that england would break with the roman catholic church.
when he became king in 1509 henry viii was a good catholic.
he even wrote a defense of traditional catholic doctrine that led the pope to give him the title defender of the faith he had married catherine of aragon daughter of the devoutly catholic ferdinand and isabella of spain.
his closest advisor was catholic cardinal thomas wolsey.
but henrys marriage problems would eventually reshape the country and help it gain a powerful role in the atlantic world.
by the late 1520s henry wanted to end his marriage with catherine.
five of their six children had died.
only a daughter named mary survived and henry wanted a male heir.
he had also fallen in love with anne boleyn a young woman at the court.
under pressure from the king the english clergy had agreed to dissolve the marriage.
but pope clement vii needed political support from catherines nephew charles v king of spain and holy roman emperor who opposed the divorce.
the pope stalled and refused to approve the divorce.
a century even a decade earlier henry would have had little room to maneuver.
now the protestant reformation gave him an opening.
in 1534 parliament passed legislation ending papal authority in england and declared henry and his successors to be the only supreme head in earth of the church of england henry annulled his marriage to catherine married anne and celebrated the birth of a new daughter elizabeth though he still longed for a son.
he closed monasteries and sold off church land or used it to reward loyal followers.
henry did not embrace many protestant teachings.
other than substituting his own authority for that of the pope official christianity in england remained closer to catholicism than to the protestantism of luther or calvin a fact that would become especially significant in the next century.
when henry died in 1547 england had three major religious groups.
some known as anglicans were perhaps a majority and supported henry s arrangement including independence from the pope and preserving traditional catholic religious forms.
however a growing protestant minority known as puritans wanted more radical religious change to purify the church of england of catholic practices especially the leadership of bishops.
in addition many roman catholics could not agree to the break with rome and remained loyal to the catholic church.
henrys successor was his 9 year old son edward vi r 1547 1553 from the kings marriage to his third wife jane seymour after he tired of anne and had her executed.
in the end henry had six wives but only three children.
the boy kings regents sought to make the english church more protestant in its doctrines and rituals.
but when edward died at age 15 his half sister mary i became queen and returned england briefly to catholicism.
however mary also died after a reign of only 5 years.
in 1558 elizabeth i r 1558 1603 daughter of henry viii and anne boleyn succeeded her.
anglicans within the church of england one group of protestants who wanted to establish a church that was led by the english monarchy.
puritans individuals who believed that reforms of the church of england had not gone far enough in improving the church.
23 23 23 24 23 chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 49 queen elizabeth ruled england from 1558 to 1603 during which time the country prospered internally and emerged as a major sea power in the world.
elizabeths reasons for embracing protestantism were strong.
if england were catholic then henrys marriage to her mother would be illegal and elizabeth would be an illegitimate child and unable to assume the throne.
if england were protestant she had every right to be queen of england.
and elizabeth meant to be queen.
she did not want her subjects fighting with each other however.
in the act of uniformity of 1559 parliament declared that she was supreme governor of the church of england.
worship should follow the book of common prayer which preserved many catholic rituals within a protestant theology.
every person in england was required to attend church once a week or face a fine.
catholics who refused to break with rome were persecuted.
but as long as protestants agreed to the act of uniformity and to attend church services that followed the book of common prayer elizabeths government left them free to disagree about their beliefs to their hearts content.
during elizabeths long reign england became a major power in europe and the world.
spain under king philip ii grandson of ferdinand and isabella was at the center of a catholic revival and philips spain and elizabeths england became bitter rivals.
queen elizabeth subsidized protestant rebels against spains rule of the netherlands and even engaged in a correspondence with ottoman sultan murad iii about a possible joint protestant muslim attack on catholic spain.
king philip in return plotted elizabeths overthrow and made plans to invade england to secure spains power and protect catholic unity.
when spain attacked england in july 1588 spains navy known as the spanish armada was defeated by the english navy and destroyed by storms.
after 1588 englands navy dominated the atlantic and eventually all of the worlds oceans.
english sailors grew more skilled the countrys shipbuilders became more sophisticated in their designs and its navigators gained new understanding of winds and currents as well as their charts and instruments.
for elizabeth and many of her subjects the defeat of the threatened spanish catholic invasion linked the protestant religion and english patriotism indissolubly in their minds.
a small nation on the margins of europe was suddenly a major player in an emerging atlantic world.
elizabethan explorers and pirates while elizabeth i ruled england english adventurers with her support set out to make a place for themselves in the new oceanic world.
english and other european fishermen had fished off the north atlantic coast of north america since the early 1500s.
by the 1580s however warfare and piracy became the dominant role of the english who visited the americas.
building settlements at that time was not a priority.
if powerful catholic spain was exploiting the continents for gold and silver england saw no reason not to relieve the spanish ships of some of their treasure without going to the trouble of mining it themselves.
francis drake was perhaps the most famous pirate or privateer as they were known when their exploits were commissioned by the government.
drake was licensed for piracy by queen elizabeth.
licensing individual captains to harass the spanish treasure fleets was far cheaper than supporting a large royal navy and the english government at minimal risk kept a fifth of whatever the pirates brought to england.
indeed pirates may have supplied 10 percent of english imports in the 1590s.
the decades of legalized piracy also helped expand the technical knowledge of english mariners.
the role of this piracy was instrumental in laying a foundation for englands sea power.
50 parti contact and exploration 1491 1607 exploration on myhistorylab how did global exploration change the old and new world.
beginning in the 1400s explorers left europe and headed west in search of faster trade routes to asia to keep up with the growing european demand for luxury goods such as silk and spices.
in the process they encountered huge civilizations in the americas complex societies that often had high levels of economic and social interconnectedness.
over the next 2 centuries europeans attempted to conquer these native american societies by force set up colonies and establish trade ties connecting the old world europe asia and africa with the new world the americas.
this age of global exploration had a profound impact on world history and was especially destructive to societies in the americas as vast numbers of people in new world succumbed to old world diseases.
this illustration c 1500 of italian origin is said to show the first european representation of people in the new world.
sadly it does not reflect much respect for the people who had so recently come to the attention of europe.

chapter 2 first encounters first conquests 51 2 1 22 23 2a john white himself an early english settler drew this picture of a woman and child of pomelooc in an effort to describe the algonquians with whom the first english explorers came into contact.
francis drake was an explorer as well as a privateer.
during his voyage around the globe from 1577 to 1580 the first commander of such an expedition to survive he confirmed the contours of the americas for the english.
he then continued across the pacific and around africa before returning to london.
in 1585 he attacked and burned st augustine florida.
in 1588 he helped defeat the spanish armada.
his exploits brought considerable wealth to queen elizabeths england while weakening spanish control of the seas.
by the time drake died in 1596 while again harassing the spanish in central america english sailors were confident that they could travel anywhere without trouble even if spain still controlled the most valuable land in the americas.
walter raleigh and the lost colony of roanoke in 1584 an ambitious young man walter raleigh was authorized by england to use his own funds to occupy lands in north america.
raleighs role was to fund and authorize the missions.
at the time england and raleigh himself were most interested in establishing a base from which privateers like drake could easily operate and profit financially from these missions.
ihe first mission in 1584 was a reconnaissance trip to identify potential sites.
ihe small group discovered roanoke island and was received warmly by the algonquian people two of whom manteo and wanchese returned to england with the crew.
in 1585 raleigh sent 100 young men back to roanoke on the outer banks of north carolina along with the two algonquian emissaries.
it was the first english colony in what is now the united states.
it was also short lived.
when the men landed one of their ships ran aground and most of the food they had brought was ruined.
ihe roanoke indians were not happy to feed the colonists whom they began to suspect of trying to dominate them and a battle broke out in 1586 in which the roanoke chief wingina was killed.
when francis drake arrived later that spring to rest his crews and refit his ships he found the survivors in disarray.
instead of refitting he agreed to take the survivors back to england when they decided to abandon the colony.
raleigh was not discouraged however.
if a colony of men could not succeed then perhaps one composed of families could.
in 1587 he convinced english investors to create a new colony in a location on the chesapeake bay which would have more navigable waters than the shallows around roanoke.
colonists were promised 500 acres per family a huge estate for the times though one might question englands authority to give away land claimed by the algonquians.
some 100 people left england to create this new colony but events along the way landed them instead back at roanoke amid the algonquians who had fought their predecessors.
nevertheless the colony was established houses built and the settlers began their new lives in this isolated place.
virginia dare was born and baptized in this colony soon after the families arrived.
she was the first english child known to be born in what is now the united states.
but the 1587 roanoke colony also failed.
indeed it came to be known as the lost colony the settlers had been left in what seemed like reasonably good shape with a promise that resupply ships would arrive the following spring.
however no ships were allowed to leave england in 1588 because of the threatened spanish attack.
the government commandeered every ship to oppose the mighty spanish armada.
nor did weather help the colony.
between 1587 and 1589 the worst drought in the area in 800 years struck.
if the experience of later col onies is any guide drought increased tensions with nearby american indians who became much more reluctant to provide food when they faced their own shortages.
when john white finally returned to roanoke with the promised supplies in 1590 52 parti contact and exploration 1491 1607 he found the colony abandoned.
whether the colonists were massacred or simply melted into the surrounding indian tribes is unknown.
quick review how did francis drake contribute to english wealth and power without establishing any colonies.
why were the english slower to establish colonies in the americas than the spanish or the french.
conclusion through most of the 1500s cabrillos de sotos and coronados expeditions for spain verrazanos and cartier s voyages for france and raleighs colonizing efforts for england were considered total failures.
fortunes had been spent but few permanent settlements had been made.
the explorers had found no gold and no quick route to china in the lands north of mexico.
nevertheless spain france and england now had a much clearer picture of the geography of north america.
many of the native peoples of north america also had at least a vague knowledge of the militaristic europeans whose presence would change everything for future generations.
half a century after columbus had first landed the atlantic and pacific coasts and most of the southern half of the united states had been the scene of many contacts between american indians europeans and often africans.
even more than 100 years after columbus settlement was limited to a few spanish posts in florida and new mexico.
for the american indians europeans were people who came quickly and left almost as quickly while disease decimated some tribes for most of the surviving native peoples of north america daily life in the early 1550s even in 1600 was barely different from what it had been a century before.
they might have a few new trade goods or may have engaged in an occasional skirmish with europeans but that was about it.
that situation would change quickly after 1600 however as three great european powers spain france and england and smaller ones including the netherlands and sweden would establish permanent settlements and vie for control of north america.
