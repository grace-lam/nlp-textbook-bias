an american history t h i r d e d i t i o n this page intentionally left blank part 1 american colonies to 1763 c t he colonial period of american history was a time of enormous change as the people of four continents north america south america europe and africa were suddenly and unexpectedly thrown into contact with one another.
the period also initiated a new era in the history of freedom.
it was not however a desire for freedom that drove early european explorations of north and south america.
contact between europe and the americas began as a byproduct of the quest for a sea route for trade with asia.
but it quickly became a contest for power between rival empires who moved to conquer colonize and exploit the resources of the new world.
at the time of european contact the western hemisphere was home to tens of millions of people.
within the present border of the united states there existed indian societies based on agriculture hunting or fishing with their own languages religious practices and forms of government.
all experienced wrenching changes after europeans arrived including incorporation into the world market and epidemics of disease that devastated many native groups.
the colonies that eventually came to form the united states originated in very different ways.
virginia the first permanent colony to be established was created by a private company that sought to earn profits through exploration for gold and the development of transatlantic trade.
individual proprietors wellconnected englishmen given large grants of land by the king established maryland and pennsylvania.
new york which had been founded by the dutch came into british hands as the result of a war.
religious groups seeking escape from persecution in england and hoping to establish communities rooted in their understanding of the principles of the bible founded colonies in new england.
in the seventeenth century all the british colonies experienced wrenching social conflicts as groups within them battled for control.
relations with indians remained tense and sometimes violent.
religious and political divisions in england which experienced a civil war in the 1640s and the ouster of the king in 1688 reverberated in the colonies.
so did wars between european powers which spilled over into north america.
nonetheless after difficult beginnings britains mainland colonies experienced years of remarkable growth in population and economic activity.
by the eighteenth century the non indian population of britains north american colonies had far outstripped that of the colonies of france and spain.
in every colony in british america well to do landowners and merchants dominated economic and political life.
nonetheless emigration to the colonies offered numerous settlers opportunities they had not enjoyed at home including access to land the freedom to worship as they pleased and the right to vote.
every british colony had an elected assembly that shared power with a governor who was usually appointed from london.
even this limited degree of self government contrasted sharply with the lack of representative institutions in the spanish and french empires.
all these circumstances drew thousands of english emigrants to north america in the seventeenth century and thousands more from ireland scotland and the european continent in the eighteenth century.
yet the conditions that allowed colonists to enjoy such freedoms were made possible by lack of freedom for millions of others.
for the native inhabitants of the western hemisphere european colonization brought the spread of devastating epidemics and either dispossession from the land or forced labor for the colonizers.
millions of africans were uprooted from their homes and transported to the new world to labor on the plantations of brazil the caribbean and englands north american colonies.
even among european immigrants the majority arrived not as completely free individuals but as indentured servants who owed a prearranged number of years of labor to those who paid their passage.
in colonial america many modern ideas of freedom did not exist or existed in very different forms than today.
equality before the law was unknown women non whites and propertyless men enjoyed far fewer rights than landowning white male citizens.
economic freedom today widely identified with participation in an unregulated market meant independence owning land or a shop and not relying on another person for a livelihood.
most colonies had official churches and many colonists who sought religious liberty for themselves refused to extend it to others.
speaking or writing critically of public authorities could land a person in jail.
nonetheless ideas about freedom played a major role in justifying european colonization.
the spanish and french claimed to be liberating native americans by bringing them advanced civilization and roman catholicism.
england insisted that true freedom for indians meant adopting english ways including protestantism.
moreover the expansion of englands empire occurred at a time when freedom came to be seen as the defining characteristic of the english nation.
slavery existed in every new world colony.
in many it became the basis of economic life.
yet most britons including colonists prided themselves on enjoying british liberty a common set of rights that included protection from the arbitrary exercise of governmental power.
thus freedom and lack of freedom expanded together in the colonies of british north america that would eventually form the united states.

he discovery of america the british writer adam smith announced in his celebrated work the wealth of nations 1776 was one of the two greatest and most important events recorded in the history of mankind historians no longer use the word discovery to describe the european exploration conquest and colonization of a hemisphere already home to millions of people.
but there can be no doubt that when christopher columbus made landfall in the west indian islands in 1492 he set in motion some of the most pivotal developments in human history.
immense changes soon followed in both the old and new worlds the consequences of these changes are still with us today.
the peoples of the american continents and europe previously unaware of each others existence were thrown into continuous interaction.
crops new to each hemisphere crossed the atlantic reshaping diets and transforming the natural environment.
because of their long isolation the inhabitants of north and south america had developed no immunity to the germs that also accompanied the colonizers.
as a result they suffered a series of devastating epidemics the greatest population catastrophe in human history.
within a decade of columbuss voyage a fourth continent africa found itself drawn into the new atlantic system of trade and population movement.
in africa europeans found a supply of unfree labor that enabled them to exploit the fertile lands of the western hemisphere.
indeed of approximately 10 million men women and children who crossed from the old world to the new between 1492 and 1820 the vast majority about 7 7 million were african slaves.
from the vantage point of 1776 the year the united states declared itself an independent nation it seemed to adam smith that the discovery of america had produced both great benefits and great misfortunes to the nations of western europe the development of american colonies brought an era of splendor and glory the emergence of the atlantic as the worlds major avenue for trade and population movement smith noted enabled millions of europeans to increase the enjoyments of life.
to the natives of the americas however smith went on the years since 1492 had been ones of dreadful misfortunes and every sort of injustice and for millions of africans the settlement of america meant a descent into the abyss of slavery.
long before columbus sailed europeans had dreamed of a land of abundance riches and ease beyond the western horizon.
once the discovery of this new world had taken place they invented an america of the imagination projecting onto it their hopes for a better life.
here many believed would arise unparalleled opportunities for riches or at least liberation from poverty.
europeans envisioned america as a religious refuge a society of equals a source of power lt w h a t w e r e t h e m a j o r p a t t e r n s o f na t i v e a m e r i c a n l i f e i n n o r t h a m e r i c a b e f o r e e u r o p e a n s a r r i v e d.
they searched the new world for golden cities and fountains of eternal youth.
some sought to establish ideal communities based on the lives of the early christian saints or other blueprints for social justice.
some of these dreams of riches and opportunity would indeed be fulfilled.
to many european settlers america offered a far greater chance to own land and worship as they pleased than existed in europe with its rigid unequal social order and official churches.
yet the conditions that enabled millions of settlers to take control of their own destinies were made possible by the debasement of millions of others.

1 a new world the first americans became the site of many forms of unfree labor including indentured servitude forced labor and one of the most brutal and unjust systems ever devised by man plantation slavery.
the conquest and settlement of the western hemisphere opened new chapters in the long histories of both freedom and slavery.
there was a vast human diversity among the peoples thrown into contact with one another in the new world.
exploration and settlement took place in an era of almost constant warfare among european nations each racked by internal religious political and regional conflicts.
native americans and africans consisted of numerous groups with their own languages and cultures.
they were as likely to fight one another as to unite against the european newcomers.
all these peoples were changed by their integration into the new atlantic economy.
the complex interactions of europeans american indians and africans would shape american history during the colonial era.
the first americans the settling of the americas the residents of the americas were no more a single group than europeans or africans.
they spoke hundreds of different languages and lived in numerous kinds of societies.
most however were descended from bands of hunters and fishers who had crossed the bering strait via a land bridge at various times between 15 000 and 60 000 years ago the exact dates are hotly debated by archaeologists.
others may have arrived by sea from asia or pacific islands.
around 14 000 years ago when glaciers began to melt at the end of the last ice age the land link became submerged under water once again separating the western hemisphere from asia.
history in north and south america did not begin with the coming of europeans.
the new world was new to europeans but an ancient homeland to those who already lived there.
the hemisphere had witnessed many changes during its human history.
first the early inhabitants and their descendants spread across the two continents reaching the tip of south america perhaps 11 000 years ago.
as the climate warmed they faced a food crisis as the immense animals they hunted including woolly mammoths and giant bison became extinct.
around 9 000 years ago at the same time that agriculture was being developed in the near east it also emerged in modern day mexico and the andes and then spread to other parts of the americas making settled civilizations possible.
throughout the hemisphere maize corn squash and beans formed the basis of agriculture.
the absence of livestock in the western hemisphere however limited farming by preventing the plowing of fields and the application of natural fertilizer.

the map shows the citys complex system of canals bridges and dams with the great temple at the center.
gardens and a zoo are also visible.
the first americans 250 000 tenochtitln the capital of the aztec empire in what is now mexico was one of the worlds largest cities.
its great temple splendid royal palace and a central market comparable to that of european capitals made the city seem like an enchanted vision according to one of the first europeans to encounter it.
further south lay the inca kingdom centered in modern day peru.
its population of perhaps 12 million was linked by a complex system of roads and bridges that extended 2 000 miles along the andes mountain chain.
when europeans arrived a wide variety of native peoples lived within the present borders of the united states.
indian civilizations in north america had not developed the scale grandeur or centralized organization of the aztec and inca societies to their south.
north american indians lacked the technologies europeans had mastered such as metal tools and machines gunpowder and the scientific knowledge necessary for longdistance navigation.
no society north of mexico had achieved literacy although some made maps on bark and animal hides.
they also lacked wheeled vehicles since they had no domestic animals like horses or oxen to pull them.
their backwardness became a central justification for european conquest.
but over time indian societies had perfected techniques of farming hunting and fishing developed structures of political power and religious belief and engaged in far reaching networks of trade and communication.

mound builders mississippi of river the valley remarkable physical remains still exist from some of the early civilizations in north america.
around 3 500 years ago before egyptians built the pyramids native americans constructed a large community centered on a series of giant semicircular mounds on a bluff overlooking the mississippi river in present day louisiana.
known today as poverty point it was a commercial and governmental center whose residents established trade routes throughout the mississippi and ohio river valleys.
archaeologists have found there copper from present day minnesota and canada and flint mined in indiana.
more than a thousand years before columbus sailed indians of the ohio river valley called mound builders by eighteenth century settlers who encountered the large earthen burial mounds they created had traded across half the continent.
after their decline another culture flourished in the mississippi river valley centered on the city of cahokia near presentday st louis a fortified community with between 10 000 and 30 000 inhabitants in the year 1200.
its residents too built giant mounds the largest of which stood 100 feet high and was topped by a temple.
little is known of cahokias political and economic structure.
but it stood as the largest settled community in what is now the united states until surpassed in population by new york and philadelphia around 1800.

the rectangular structures are the foundations of dwellings and the circular ones are kivas or places of religious worship.
indians in the arid northeastern area of present day arizona the hopi and zuni and their ancestors engaged in settled village life for over 3 000 years.
during the peak of the regions culture between the years 900 and 1200 these peoples built great planned towns with large multiple family dwellings in local canyons constructed dams and canals to gather and distribute water and conducted trade with groups as far away as central mexico and the mississippi river valley.
the largest of their structures pueblo bonita in chaco canyon new mexico stood five stories high and had over 600 rooms.
not until the 1880s was a dwelling of comparable size constructed in the united states.
after the decline of these communities probably because of drought survivors moved to the south and east where they established villages and perfected the techniques of desert farming complete with irrigation systems to provide water for crops of corn beans and cotton.
these were the people spanish explorers called the pueblo indians because they lived in small villages or pueblos when the spanish first encountered them in the sixteenth century.

on the pacific coast another densely populated region hundreds of distinct groups resided in independent villages and lived primarily by fishing hunting sea mammals and gathering wild plants and nuts.
as many as 25 million salmon swam up the columbia river each year providing indians with abundant food.
on the great plains with its herds of buffalo descendants of the prehistoric giant bison many indians were hunters who tracked animals on foot before the arrival of horses with the spanish but others lived in agricultural communities.
indians of eastern north america in eastern north america hundreds of tribes inhabited towns and villages scattered from the gulf of mexico to present day canada.
they lived on corn squash and beans supplemented by fishing and hunting deer turkeys and other animals.
indian trade routes crisscrossed the eastern part of the continent.
tribes frequently warred with one another to obtain goods seize captives or take revenge for the killing of relatives.
they conducted diplomacy and made peace.
little in the way of centralized authority existed until in the fifteenth century various leagues or confederations emerged in an effort to bring order to local regions.
in the southeast the choctaw cherokee and chickasaw each united dozens of towns in loose alliances.
in present day new york and pennsylvania five iroquois peoples the mohawk oneida cayuga seneca and onondaga formed a great league of peace bringing a period of stability to the area.
each year a great council with representatives from the five groupings met to coordinate behavior toward outsiders.
the most striking feature of native american society at the time europeans arrived was its sheer diversity.
each group had its own political system and set of religious beliefs and north america was home to literally hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages.
indians had no sense of w h a t w e r e t h e m a j o r p a t t e r n s o f na t i v e a m e r i c a n l i f e i n n o r t h a m e r i c a b e f o r e e u r o p e a n s a r r i v e d.

they did not think of themselves as a single unified people an idea invented by europeans and only many years later adopted by indians themselves.
indian identity centered on the immediate social group a tribe village chiefdom or confederacy.
when europeans first arrived many indians saw them as simply one group among many.
their first thought was how to use the newcomers to marginal horticultural hunters river based horticultural chiefdoms orchard growing alligator hunters tidewater horticulturalists fishers and wild rice gatherers the native population of north america at the time of first contact with europeans consisted of numerous tribes with their own languages religious beliefs and economic and social structures.
this map suggests the numerous ways of life existing at the time.
1 a new world the first americans enhance their standing in relation to other native peoples rather than to unite against them.
the sharp dichotomy between indians and white persons did not emerge until later in the colonial era.
native american religion nonetheless the diverse indian societies of north america did share certain common characteristics.
their lives were steeped in religious ceremonies often directly related to farming and hunting.
spiritual power they believed suffused the world and sacred spirits could be found in all kinds of living and inanimate things animals plants trees water and wind.
through religious ceremonies they aimed to harness the aid of powerful supernatural forces to serve the interests of man.
in some tribes hunters performed rituals to placate the spirits of animals they had killed.
other religious ceremonies sought to engage the spiritual power of nature to secure abundant crops or fend off evil spirits.
indian villages also held elaborate religious rites participation in which helped to define the boundaries of community membership.
in all indian societies those who seemed to possess special abilities to invoke supernatural powers shamans medicine men and other religious leaders held positions of respect and authority.
indian religion did not pose a sharp distinction between the natural and the supernatural or secular and religious activities.
in some respects however indian religion was not that different from popular spiritual beliefs in europe.
most indians held that a single creator stood atop the spiritual hierarchy.
nonetheless nearly all europeans arriving in the new world quickly concluded that indians were in dire need of being converted to a true christian faith.
land and property equally alien in european eyes were indian attitudes toward property.
numerous land systems existed among native americans.
generally however village leaders assigned plots of land to individual families to use for a season or more and tribes claimed specific areas for hunting.
unclaimed land remained free for anyone to use.
families owned the right to use land but they did not own the land itself.
indians saw land the basis of economic life for both hunting and farming societies as a common resource not an economic commodity.
in the nineteenth century the indian leader black hawk would explain why in his view land could not be bought and sold the great spirit gave it to his children to live upon and cultivate as far as necessary for their subsistence and so long as they occupy and cultivate it they have a right to the soil few if any indian societies were familiar with the idea of a fenced off piece of land belonging forever to a single individual or family.
there was no market in real estate before the coming of europeans.
nor were indians devoted to the accumulation of wealth and material goods.
especially east of the mississippi river where villages moved every few years when soil or game became depleted acquiring numerous possessions made little sense.
however status certainly mattered in indian societies.
tribal leaders tended to come from a small number of families and chiefs lived more splendidly than average members of society.

a catawba map illustrates the differences between indian and european conceptions of landed property.
the map depicts not possession of a specific territory but trade and diplomatic connections between various native groups and with the colony of virginia represented by the rectangle on the lower right.
reputation often rested on their willingness to share goods with others rather than hoarding them for themselves.
a few indian societies had rigid social distinctions.
among the natchez descendants of the mound building mississippian culture a chief or great sun occupied the top of the social order with nobles or lesser suns below him and below them the common people.
in general however wealth mattered far less in indian society than in european society at the time.
generosity was among the most valued social qualities and gift giving was essential to indian society.
trade for example meant more than a commercial transaction it was accompanied by elaborate ceremonies of gift exchange.
a central part of indian economies gift giving bound different groups in webs of mutual obligation.
although indians had no experience of the wealth enjoyed at the top of european society under normal circumstances no one in indian societies went hungry or experienced the extreme inequalities of europe.
there are no beggars among them reported the english colonial leader roger williams of new englands indians.
gender relations the system of gender relations in most indian societies also differed markedly from that of europe.
membership in a family defined womens lives but they openly engaged in premarital sexual relations and could even choose to divorce their husbands.
most although not all indian societies were matrilineal that is centered on clans or kinship groups in which children became members of the mothers family not the fathers.
tribal leaders were almost always men but women played an important role in certain religious ceremonies and female elders often helped to select male village leaders and took part in tribal meetings.

among the wildlife illustrated are hammerhead sharks and catfish.
the first americans legal identity.
in contrast indian women owned dwellings and tools and a husband generally moved to live with the family of his wife.
in indian societies men contributed to the communitys well being and demonstrated their masculinity by success in hunting or in the pacific northwest by catching fish with nets and harpoons.
because men were frequently away on the hunt women took responsibility not only for household duties but for most agricultural work as well.
among the pueblo of the southwest however where there was less hunting than in the east men were the primary cultivators.
european views of the indians europeans tended to view indians in extreme terms.
they were regarded either as noble savages gentle friendly and superior in some ways to europeans or as uncivilized and brutal savages.
giovanni da verrazano a florentine navigator who sailed up and down the eastern coast of north america in 1524 described indians he encountered as beautiful of stature and build for their part many indians whose diet was probably more nutritious than that of most europeans initially found the newcomers weak and ugly.
over time however negative images of indians came to overshadow positive ones.
early european descriptions of north american indians as barbaric centered on three areas religion land use and gender relations.
whatever their country of origin european newcomers concluded that indians lacked genuine religion or in fact worshiped the devil.
their shamans and herb healers were called witch doctors their numerous ceremonies and rituals at best a form of superstition their belief in a world alive with spiritual power a worship of false gods christianity presented w h a t w e r e t h e m a j o r p a t t e r n s o f na t i v e a m e r i c a n l i f e i n n o r t h a m e r i c a b e f o r e e u r o p e a n s a r r i v e d.
no obstacle to the commercial use of the land and indeed in some ways encouraged it since true religion was thought to promote the progress of civilization.
whereas the indians saw nature as a world of spirits and souls the europeans viewed it as a collection of potential commodities a source of economic opportunity.
europeans invoked the indians distinctive pattern of land use and ideas about property to answer the awkward question raised by a british minister at an early stage of englands colonization by what right or warrant can we enter into the land of these savages take away their rightful inheritance from them and plant ourselves in their places while the spanish claimed title to land in america by right of conquest and papal authority the english french and dutch came to rely on the idea that indians had not actually used the land and thus had no claim to it.
despite the indians highly developed agriculture and well established towns europeans frequently described them as nomads without settled communities.
the land was thus deemed to be a vacant wilderness ready to be claimed by newcomers who would cultivate and improve it.
european settlers believed that mixing ones labor with the earth which indians supposedly had failed to do gave one title to the soil.
in the indians gender division of labor and matrilineal family structures europeans saw weak men and mistreated women.
hunting and fishing the primary occupations of indian men were considered leisure activities in much of europe not real work.
because indian women worked in the fields europeans often described them as lacking freedom.
they were not much better than slaves in the words of one english commentator.
europeans considered indian men unmanly too weak to exercise authority within their families and restrain their wives open sexuality and so lazy that they forced their wives to do most of the productive labor.
throughout north america europeans promoted the ideas that women should confine themselves to household work and that men ought to exercise greater authority within their families.
europeans insisted that by subduing the indians they were actually bringing them freedom the freedom of true religion private property and the liberation of both men and women from uncivilized and unchristian gender roles.
indian freedom european freedom indian freedom and what of liberty as the native inhabitants of the new world understood it.
many europeans saw indians as embodying freedom.
the iroquois wrote one colonial official held such absolute notions of liberty that they allow of no kind of superiority of one over another and banish all servitude from their territories but most colonizers quickly concluded that the notion of freedom was alien to indian societies.
early english and french dictionaries of indian languages contained no entry for freedom or libert.
nor wrote one early trader did indians have words to express despotic power arbitrary kings oppressed or obedient subjects indeed europeans considered indians barbaric in part because they did not appear to live under established governments or fixed laws and had no indian women planting crops while men break the sod.

1 a new world indian freedom european freedom respect for authority.
they are born live and die in a liberty without restraint wrote one religious missionary.
in a sense they were too free lacking the order and discipline that europeans considered the hallmarks of civilization.
even slavery wrote richard eden an english writer of the mid sixteenth century was preferable to the indians condition before european contact which he described as rather a horrible licentiousness than a liberty when giovanni da verrazano described the indians as living in absolute freedom he did not intend this as a compliment.
the familiar modern understanding of freedom as personal independence often based on ownership of private property had little meaning in most indian societies.
but indians certainly had their own ideas of freedom.
while the buying and selling of slaves was unknown small scale slavery existed in some indian societies.
so too did the idea of personal liberty as the opposite of being held as a slave.
indians would bitterly resent the efforts of some europeans to reduce them to slavery.
although individuals were expected to think for themselves and did not always have to go along with collective decision making indian men and women judged one another according to their ability to live up to widely understood ideas of appropriate behavior.
far more important than individual autonomy were kinship ties the ability to follow ones spiritual values and the well being and security of ones community.
in indian culture group autonomy and self determination and the mutual obligations that came with a sense of belonging and connectedness took precedence over individual freedom.
ironically the coming of europeans armed with their own language of liberty would make freedom a preoccupation of american indians as part and parcel of the very process by which they were reduced to dependence on the colonizers.
christian liberty on the eve of colonization europeans held numerous ideas of freedom.
some were as old as the city states of ancient greece others arose during the political struggles of the early modern era.
some laid the foundations for modern conceptions of freedom others are quite unfamiliar today.
freedom was not a single idea but a collection of distinct rights and privileges many enjoyed by only a small portion of the population.
one conception common throughout europe understood freedom less as a political or social status than as a moral or spiritual condition.
freedom meant abandoning the life of sin to embrace the teachings of christ.
where the spirit of the lord is declares the new testament there is liberty in this definition servitude and freedom were mutually reinforcing not contradictory states since those who accepted the teachings of christ simultaneously became free from sin and servants to god christian liberty had no connection to later ideas of religious toleration a notion that scarcely existed anywhere on the eve of colonization.
every nation in europe had an established church that decreed what forms of religious worship and belief were acceptable.
dissenters faced persecution by the state as well as condemnation by church authorities.
religious uniformity was thought to be essential to public order the modern idea that a persons religious beliefs and practices are a matter of private choice not legal obligation was almost unknown.
the religious wars that racked how did indian and european ideas of freedom differ on the eve of contact.
europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries centered on which religion would predominate in a kingdom or region not the right of individuals to choose which church in which to worship.
freedom and authority in its secular form the equating of liberty with obedience to a higher authority suggested that freedom meant not anarchy but obedience to law.
aristotle had described the law as libertys salvation not its enemy.
the identification of freedom with the rule of law did not however mean that all subjects of the crown enjoyed the same degree of freedom.
early modern european societies were extremely hierarchical with marked gradations of social status ranging from the king and hereditary aristocracy down to the urban and rural poor.
inequality was built into virtually every social relationship.
the king claimed to rule by the authority of god.
persons of high rank demanded deference from those below them.
less than 5 percent of the population monopolized english economic wealth and political power.
within families men exercised authority over their wives and children.
according to the widespread legal doctrine known as coverture when a woman married she surrendered her legal identity which became covered by that of her husband.
she could not own property or sign contracts in her own name control her wages if she worked write a separate will or except in the rarest of circumstances go to court seeking a divorce.
the husband conducted business and testified in court for the entire family.
he had the exclusive right to his wifes company including domestic labor and sexual relations.
everywhere in europe family life depended on male dominance and female submission.
indeed political writers of the sixteenth century explicitly compared the kings authority over his subjects with the husbands over his family.
both were ordained by god.
to justify this argument they referred to a passage in the new testament as the man is the head of the woman so is christ the head of the church neither kind of authority could be challenged without threatening the fabric of social order.
liberty and liberties in this hierarchical society liberty came from knowing ones social place and fulfilling the duties appropriate to ones rank.
most men lacked the freedom that came with economic independence.
property qualifications and other restrictions limited the electorate to a minuscule part of the adult male population.
the law required strict obedience of employees and breaches of labor contracts carried criminal penalties.
european ideas of freedom still bore the imprint of the middle ages when liberties meant formal specific privileges such as self government exemption from taxation or the right to practice a particular trade granted to individuals or groups by contract royal decree or purchase.
one legal dictionary defined a liberty as a privilege.
by which men may enjoy some benefit beyond the ordinary subject only those who enjoyed the freedom of the city for example could engage in certain economic activities.
1 a new world the expansion of europe numerous modern civil liberties did not exist.
the law decreed acceptable forms of religious worship.
the government regularly suppressed publications it did not like and criticism of authority could lead to imprisonment.
in england members of the house of commons enjoyed freedom of speech during parliamentary sessions but the right did not extend to ordinary citizens.
personal independence was reserved for a small part of the population and this was one reason why authorities found masterless men those without regular jobs or otherwise outside the control of their social superiors so threatening.
nonetheless every european country that colonized the new world claimed to be spreading freedom for its own population and for native americans.
t h e e x pa n s i o n o f e u r o p e it is fitting that the second epochal event that adam smith linked to columbuss voyage of 1492 was the discovery by portuguese navigators of a sea route from europe to asia around the southern tip of africa.
the european conquest of america began as an offshoot of the quest for a sea route to india china and the islands of the east indies the source of the silk tea spices porcelain and other luxury goods on which international trade in the early modern era centered.
for centuries this commerce had been conducted across land from china and south asia to the middle east and the mediterranean region.
profit and piety the desire to eliminate islamic middlemen and win control of the lucrative trade for christian western europe combined to inspire the quest for a direct route to asia.
chinese and portuguese navigation at the beginning of the fifteenth century one might have predicted that china would establish the worlds first global empire.
between 1405 and 1433 admiral zheng he led seven large naval expeditions in the indian ocean.
the first convoy consisted of 62 ships that were larger than those of any european nation along with 225 support vessels and more than 25 000 men.
on his sixth voyage zheng explored the coast of east africa.
china was already the worlds most important trading economy with trade routes dotting the indian ocean.
zhengs purpose was not discovery but to impress other peoples with chinas might.
had his ships continued westward they could easily have reached north and south america.
but as a wealthy land based empire china did not feel the need for overseas expansion and after 1433 the government ended support for long distance maritime expeditions.
it fell to portugal situated on the western corner of the iberian peninsula far removed from the overland route to asia to take advantage of new techniques of sailing and navigation to begin exploring the atlantic.
the development of the caravel a ship capable of long distance travel and of the compass and quadrant devices that enabled sailors to determine their location and direction with greater accuracy than in the past made it possible to sail down the coast of africa and return to portugal.
portuguese seafarers initially hoped to locate the source of gold that for centuries had been transported in caravans across the sahara desert to north africa and what impelled european explorers to look west across the atlantic.

this commerce which passed through the african kingdom of mali on the southern edge of the sahara provided europe with most of its gold.
around 1400 it rivaled trade with the east in economic importance.
and like trade with asia it was controlled by muslim merchants.
portugal and west africa today africa is the worlds poorest continent.
in the fifteenth century it was known for its wealth.
mansa musa the ruler of mali had literally put his realm on the map in 1324 when he led a great pilgrimage to mecca distributing so much gold along the way that its price was depressed for a decade.
until 1434 however no european sailor had seen the coast of africa below the sahara or the forest kingdoms south of mali that contained the actual gold fields.
but in that year a portuguese ship brought a sprig of rosemary from west africa proof that one could sail beyond 1 000 1 000 2 000 miles 2 000 kilometers in the fifteenth century the world known to europeans was limited to europe parts of africa and asia.
explorers from portugal sought to find a sea route to the east in order to circumvent the italian city states and middle eastern rulers who controlled the overland trade.

the image suggests the extent of the city a center of government trade and the arts.
the desert and return.
little by little portuguese ships moved farther down the coast.
in 1485 they reached benin an imposing city whose craftsmen produced bronze sculptures that still inspire admiration for their artistic beauty and superb casting techniques.
the portuguese established fortified trading posts on the western coast of africa.
the profits reaped by these portuguese factories so named because merchants were known as factors inspired other european powers to follow in their footsteps.
portugal also began to colonize madeira the azores and the canary and cape verde islands which lie in the atlantic off the african coast.
sugar plantations worked by muslim captives and slaves from slavic areas of eastern europe had flourished in the middle ages on mediterranean islands like cyprus malta and crete.
now the portuguese established plantations on the atlantic islands eventually replacing the native populations with thousands of slaves shipped from africa an ominous precedent for the new world.
soon the center of sugar production would shift again to the western hemisphere.
freedom and slavery in africa slavery in africa long predated the coming of europeans.
traditionally african slaves tended to be criminals debtors and captives in war.
they worked within the households of their owners and had well defined rights such as possessing property and marrying free persons.
it was not uncommon for african slaves to acquire their freedom.
slavery was one of several forms of labor not the basis of the economy as it would become in large parts of the new world.
the coming of the portuguese soon followed by traders from other european nations accelerated the buying and selling of slaves within africa.
at least 100 000 african slaves were transported to what impelled european explorers to look west across the atlantic.
spain and portugal between 1450 and 1500.
in 1502 the first african slaves were transported to islands in the caribbean.
the transatlantic slave trade and its impact on africa will be discussed in chapter 4.
having reached west africa portuguese mariners pushed their explorations ever southward along the coast.
bartholomeu dias reached the cape of good hope at the continents southern tip in 1487.
in 1498 vasco da gama sailed around it to india demonstrating the feasibility of a sea route to the east.
with a population of under 1 million portugal established a vast trading empire with bases in india southern china and indonesia.
it replaced the italian city states as the major european commercial partner of the east.
but six years before da gamas voyage christopher columbus had he believed discovered a new route to china and india by sailing west.
the voyages of columbus a seasoned mariner and fearless explorer from genoa a major port in northern italy columbus had for years sailed the mediterranean and north atlantic studying ocean currents and wind patterns.
like nearly all navigators of the time columbus knew the earth was round.
but he drastically underestimated its size.
he believed that by sailing westward he could relatively quickly cross the atlantic and reach asia.
no one in europe knew that two giant continents lay 3 000 miles to the west.
the vikings to be sure had sailed from greenland to newfoundland around the year 1000 and established a settlement vinland at a site now known as lanse aux meadows.
but this outpost was abandoned after a few years and had been forgotten except in norse legends.
columbus sought financial support throughout europe for the planned voyage.
his brother bartholomew even visited henry vii of england to ask for assistance.
most of columbuss contemporaries however knew that he considerably underestimated the earths size which helps to explain why he had trouble gaining backers for his expedition.
eventually king ferdinand and queen isabella of spain agreed to become sponsors.
their marriage in 1469 had united the warring kingdoms of aragon and castile.
in 1492 they completed the reconquista the reconquest of spain from the moors african muslims who had occupied part of the iberian peninsula for centuries.
the capture of grenada the moors last stronghold accomplished spains territorial unification.
to ensure its religious unification ferdinand and isabella ordered all muslims and jews to convert to catholicism or leave the country.
along with the crown much of columbuss financing came from bankers and merchants of spain and the italian city states who desperately desired to circumvent the muslim stranglehold on eastern trade.
columbus set sail with royal letters of introduction to asian rulers authorizing him to negotiate trade agreements.

1 a new world contact c o n ta c t columbus columbuss landfall an engraving from la lettera dellisole letter from the islands.
this 1493 pamphlet reproduced in the form of a poem columbuss first letter describing his voyage of the previous year.
under the watchful eye of king ferdinand of spain columbus and his men land on a caribbean island while local indians flee.
in the new world on october 12 1492 after only thirty three days of sailing from the canary islands where he had stopped to resupply his three ships columbus and his expedition arrived at the bahamas.
his exact landing site remains in dispute but it was probably san salvador a tiny spot of land known today as watling island.
soon afterward he encountered the far larger islands of hispaniola today the site of haiti and the dominican republic and cuba.
when one of his ships ran aground he abandoned it and left thirty eight men behind on hispaniola.
but he found room to bring ten inhabitants of the island back to spain for conversion to christianity.
in the following year 1493 european colonization of the new world began.
columbus returned with seventeen ships and more than 1 000 men to explore the area and establish a spanish outpost.
columbuss settlement on the island of hispaniola which he named la isabella failed but in 1502 another spanish explorer nicols de ovando arrived with 2 500 men and established a permanent base the first center of the spanish empire in america.
before he died in 1506 columbus made two more voyages to the new world in 1498 and 1502.
he went to his grave believing that he had discovered a westward route to asia.
the explorations of another italian amerigo vespucci along the coast of south america between 1499 and 1502 made plain that a continent entirely unknown to europeans had been encountered.
the new world would come to bear not columbuss name but one based on vespuccis america.
vespucci also realized that the native inhabitants were distinct peoples not residents of the east indies as columbus had believed although the name indians applied to them by columbus has endured to this day.
exploration and conquest the speed with which european exploration proceeded in the aftermath of columbuss first voyage is remarkable.
the technique of printing with movable type invented in the 1430s by the german craftsman johannes gutenberg had made possible the rapid spread of information in europe at least among the educated minority.
news of columbuss achievement traveled quickly.
one writer hailed him as a hero such as the ancients made gods of others were inspired to follow in his wake.
john cabot a genoese merchant who had settled in england reached newfoundland in 1497.
soon scores of fishing boats from france spain and england were active in the region.
pedro cabral claimed brazil for portugal in 1500.
but the spanish took the lead in exploration and conquest.
inspired by a search for wealth national glory and the desire to spread catholicism spanish conquistadores often accompanied by religious missionaries and carrying flags emblazoned with the sign of the cross radiated outward from hispaniola.
in 1513 vasco nez de balboa trekked across the isthmus of panama and became the first european to gaze upon the pacific ocean.
between 1519 and 1522 ferdinand magellan led the first expedition what happened when the peoples of the americas came in contact with europeans.

magellan was killed in the philippines but his fleet completed the journey correcting once and for all columbuss erroneous assessment of the earths size.
the first explorer to encounter a major american civilization was hernn corts who in 1519 arrived at tenochtitln the nerve center of 1 000 1 000 2 000 miles 2 000 kilometers christopher columbuss first atlantic crossing in 1492 was soon followed by voyages of discovery by english portuguese spanish and italian explorers.
1 a new world engravings from the florentine codex of the forces of corts marching on tenochtitln and assaulting the city with cannon fire.
the difference in military technology between the spanish and aztecs is evident.
indians who allied with corts had helped him build vessels and carry them in pieces over mountains to the city.
the codex a volume formed by stitching together manuscript pages was prepared under the supervision of a spanish missionary in sixteenth century mexico.
contact the aztec empire whose wealth and power rested on domination of numerous subordinate peoples nearby.
the aztecs were violent warriors who engaged in the ritual sacrifice of captives and others sometimes thousands at a time.
this practice thoroughly alienated their neighbors and reinforced the spanish view of americas native inhabitants as barbarians even though in europe at this time thousands of men and women were burned at the stake as witches or religious heretics and criminals were executed in public spectacles that attracted throngs of onlookers.
with only a few hundred european men the daring corts conquered the aztec city relying on superior military technology such as iron weapons and gunpowder as well as shrewdness in enlisting the aid of some of the aztecs subject peoples who supplied him with thousands of warriors.
his most powerful ally however was disease a smallpox epidemic that devastated aztec society.
a few years later francisco pizarro conquered the great inca kingdom centered in modern day peru.
pizarros tactics were typical of the conquistadores.
he captured the incan king demanded and received a ransom and then killed the king anyway.
soon treasure fleets carrying cargoes of gold and silver from the mines of mexico and peru were traversing the atlantic to enrich the spanish crown.
the demographic disaster the transatlantic flow of goods and people sometimes called the columbian exchange altered millions of years of evolution.
plants animals and cultures that had evolved independently on separate continents were now thrown together.
products introduced to europe from the americas included corn tomatoes potatoes peanuts tobacco and cotton while people from the old world brought wheat rice sugarcane horses cattle pigs and sheep to the new.
but europeans also carried germs previously unknown in the americas.
no one knows exactly how many people lived in the americas at the time of columbuss voyages current estimates range between 50 and 90 million.
the european population in 1492 including russia was around 90 million the african population was around 40 million and about 210 million lived in china and modern day india.
most inhabitants of the new world lived in central and south america.
in 1492 the indian population within what are now the borders of the united states was between 2 and 5 million.
whatever their numbers the indian populations suffered a catastrophic decline because of contact with europeans and their wars enslavement and especially diseases like smallpox influenza and measles.
never having encountered these diseases indians had not developed antibodies to fight them.
the result was devastating.
many west indian islands were all but depopulated.
on hispaniola the native population estimated at between 300 000 and 1 million in 1492 had nearly disappeared fifty years later.
the what happened when the peoples of the americas came in contact with europeans.
population of mexico would fall by more than 90 percent in the sixteenth century from perhaps 20 million to under 2 million.
as for the area that now forms the united states its native american population fell continuously.
it reached its lowest point around 1900 at only 250 000.
overall the death of perhaps 80 million people close to one fifth of humankind in the first century and a half after contact with europeans represents the greatest loss of life in human history.
it was disease as much as military prowess and more advanced technology that enabled europeans to conquer the americas.
t h e s pa n i s h e m p i r e by the middle of the sixteenth century spain had established an immense empire that reached from europe to the americas and asia.
the atlantic and pacific oceans once barriers separating different parts of the world now became highways for the exchange of goods and the movement of people.
spanish galleons carried gold and silver from mexico and peru eastward to spain and westward to manila in the philippines and on to china.
the spanish empire included the most populous parts of the new world and the regions richest in natural resources.
stretching from the andes mountains of south america through present day mexico and the caribbean and eventually into florida and the southwestern united states spains empire exceeded in size the roman empire of the ancient world.
its center in north america was mexico city a magnificent capital built on the ruins of the aztec city of tenochtitln that boasted churches hospitals monasteries government buildings and the new worlds first university.
unlike the english and french new world empires spanish america was essentially an urban civilization an empire of towns for centuries its great cities notably mexico city quito and lima far outshone any urban centers in north america and most of those in europe.
governing spanish america spains system of colonial government rivaled that of ancient rome.
alarmed by the destructiveness of the conquistadores the spanish crown replaced them with a more stable system of government headed by lawyers and bureaucrats.
at least in theory the government of spanish america reflected the absolutism of the newly unified nation at home.
authority originated with the king and flowed downward through the council of the indies the main body in spain for colonial administration and then to viceroys in mexico and peru and other local officials in america.
the catholic church also played a significant role in the administration of spanish colonies frequently exerting its authority on matters of faith morals and treatment of the indians.
successive kings kept elected assemblies out of spains new world empire.
royal officials were generally appointees from spain rather than another scene from the florentine codex depicts the smallpox epidemic that ravaged the aztec capital after the arrival of corts.
1 a new world an eighteenth century view of the marketplace in havana cuba a major center of the spanish empire in america.
the spanish empire criollos as persons born in the colonies of european ancestry were called.
the imperial state was a real and continuous presence in spanish america.
but as its power declined in europe beginning in the seventeenth century the local elite came to enjoy more and more effective authority over colonial affairs.
given the vastness of the empire local municipal councils universities merchant organizations and craft guilds enjoyed considerable independence.
colonists in spanish america despite the decline in the native population spanish america remained populous enough that with the exception of the west indies and a few cities large scale importations of african slaves were unnecessary.
instead the spanish forced tens of thousands of indians to work in gold and silver mines which supplied the empires wealth and on large scale farms or haciendas controlled by spanish landlords.
in spanish america unlike other new world empires indians performed most of the labor and although the spanish introduced livestock wheat and sugar the main agricultural crops were the same ones grown before colonization corn beans and squash.
the maxim of the conqueror must be to settle said one spanish official.
the government barred non spaniards from emigrating to its american domains as well as non christian spaniards including jews and moors.
but the opportunity for social advancement drew numerous colonists from spain 225 000 in the sixteenth century and a total of 750 000 in the three centuries of spains colonial rule.
eventually a significant number came in families but at first the large majority were young single men many of them laborers craftsmen and soldiers.
many also came as government officials priests professionals and minor aristocrats what were the chief features of the spanish empire in america.
all ready to direct the manual work of indians since living without having to labor was a sign of noble status.
the most successful of these colonists enjoyed lives of luxury similar to those of the upper classes at home.
colonists and indians although persons of european birth called peninsulares stood atop the social hierarchy they never constituted more than a tiny proportion of the population of spanish america.
unlike in the later british empire indian inhabitants always outnumbered european colonists and their descendants in spanish america and large areas remained effectively under indian control for many years.
like the later french empire and unlike the english spanish authorities granted indians certain rights within colonial society and looked forward to their eventual assimilation.
indeed the success of the spanish empire depended on the nature of the native societies on which it could build.
in florida the amazon and caribbean islands like jamaica which lacked major indian cities and large native populations spanish rule remained tenuous.
the spanish crown ordered wives of colonists to join them in america and demanded that single men marry.
but with the population of spanish women remaining low the intermixing of the colonial and indian peoples soon began.
as early as 1514 the spanish government formally approved of such marriages partly as a way of bringing christianity to the native population.
by 1600 mestizos persons of mixed origin made up a large part of the urban population of spanish america.
in the century that followed mestizos repopulated the valley of mexico where disease had decimated the original inhabitants.
over time spanish america evolved into a hybrid culture part spanish part indian and in some areas part african but with a single official faith language and governmental system.

the people of huexotzinco a town near mexico city had aided hernn corts in his conquest of the aztec empire.
the codex was part of a successful lawsuit endorsed by corts in which the indians challenged excessive taxation by colonial officials.

justifications for conquest what allowed one nation the seventeenth century dutch legal thinker hugo grotius wondered to claim possession of lands that belonged to someone else.
this question rarely occurred to most of the europeans who crossed the atlantic in the wake of columbuss voyage or to rulers in the old world.
they had immense confidence in the superiority of their what were the chief features of the spanish empire in america.
own cultures to those they encountered in america.
they expected these societies to abandon their own beliefs and traditions and embrace those of the newcomers.
failure to do so reinforced the conviction that these people were uncivilized heathens non christians.
europeans brought with them not only a long history of using violence to subdue their internal and external foes but also missionary zeal to spread the benefits of their own civilization to others while reaping the rewards of empire.
spain was no exception.
the establishment of its empire in america took place in the wake of spains own territorial unification the rise of a powerful royal government and the enforcement of religious orthodoxy by the expulsion of muslims and jews in 1492.
to further legitimize spains claim to rule the new world a year after columbuss first voyage pope alexander vi divided the non christian world between spain and portugal.
the line was subsequently adjusted to give portugal control of brazil with the remainder of the western hemisphere falling under spanish authority.
spreading the fa i t h not surprisingly the pope justified this pronouncement by requiring spain and portugal to spread catholicism among the native inhabitants of the americas.
the missionary element of colonization already familiar because of the long holy war against islam within spain itself was powerfully reinforced in the sixteenth century when the protestant reformation divided the catholic church.
in 1517 martin luther a german priest posted his ninety five theses which accused the church of worldliness and corruption.
luther wanted to cleanse the church of abuses such as the sale of indulgences official dispensations forgiving sins.
he insisted that all believers should read the bible for themselves rather than relying on priests to interpret it for them.
his call for reform led to the rise of new protestant churches independent of rome and plunged europe into more than a century of religious and political strife.
spain the most powerful bastion of orthodox catholicism redoubled its efforts to convert the indians to the true faith national glory and religious mission went hand in hand.
convinced of the superiority of catholicism to all other religions spain insisted that the primary goal of colonization was to save the indians from heathenism and prevent them from falling under the sway of protestantism.
the aim was neither to exterminate nor to remove the indians but to transform them into obedient christian subjects of the crown.
indeed lacking the later concept of race as an unchanging inborn set of qualities and abilities many spanish writers insisted that indians could in time be brought up to the level of european civilization.
of course this meant not only the destruction of existing indian political structures but also a transformation of their economic and spiritual lives.
piety and profit to the spanish colonizers the large native populations of the americas were not only souls to be saved but also a labor force to be organized to extract gold and silver that would enrich the mother country.
the tension a banner carried by the forces of corts conqueror of the aztec kingdom features an image of the virgin mary illustrating how the desire to spread the roman catholic faith provided a justification for conquest.
1 a new world the spanish empire a benign view of spanish colonization.
this engraving from a 1621 book depicts spanish missionaries bringing christianity to new world natives while priests do construction work.
a fortified colonial town is visible in the background.
between these two outlooks would mark spanish rule in america for three centuries.
on the one hand spanish rulers proclaimed the goal of bringing true freedom to the indians by instructing them in christianity.
even enslaving the natives was justified as a means of liberating them from their own backwardness and savagery and enabling them to become part of christian civilization.
religious orders established missions throughout the empire and over time millions of indians were converted to catholicism.
on the other hand spanish rule especially in its initial period witnessed a disastrous fall in indian population not only because of epidemics but also because of the brutal conditions of labor to which indians were subjected.
the conquistadores and subsequent governors who required conquered peoples to acknowledge the catholic church and provide gold and silver saw no contradiction between serving god and enriching themselves.
others however did.
las casass complaint as early as 1537 pope paul iii who hoped to see indians become devout subjects of catholic monarchs outlawed their enslavement an edict never extended to apply to africans.
his decree declared indians to be truly men who must not be treated as dumb beasts fifteen years later the dominican priest bartolom de las casas published an account of the decimation of the indian population with the compelling title a very brief account of the destruction of the indies.
las casass father had sailed on columbuss second voyage and he himself had participated in the conquest of cuba.
but in 1514 las casas freed his own indian slaves and began to preach against the injustices of spanish rule.
las casass writings denounced spain for causing the death of millions of innocent people.
it has been spains practice he reported in every land they have discovered to stage a massacre in order to make the inhabitants tremble with fear he narrated in shocking detail the strange cruelties carried out by the christians including the burning alive of men what were the chief features of the spanish empire in america.
women and children and the imposition of forced labor.
the indians he wrote had been totally deprived of their freedom and were put in the harshest fiercest most terrible servitude and captivity long before the idea was common las casas insisted that indians were rational beings not barbarians and that spain had no grounds on which to deprive them of their lands and liberty.
the entire human race is one he proclaimed and while he continued to believe that spain had a right to rule in america largely on religious grounds he called for indians to enjoy all guarantees of liberty and justice from the moment they became subjects of spain.
nothing is certainly more precious in human affairs nothing more esteemed he wrote than freedom yet las casas also suggested that importing slaves from africa would help to protect the indians from exploitation.
reforming the empire like other spaniards las casas believed that the main justification for empire was converting the indians to christianity.
spanish cruelty he feared undermined this effort.
largely because of las casass efforts spain in 1542 promulgated the new laws commanding that indians no longer be enslaved.
not everyone welcomed the change.
gonzalo pizarro brother of the conqueror of peru organized an unsuccessful rebellion in protest.
in 1550 spain abolished the encomienda system under which the first settlers had been granted authority over conquered indian lands with the right to extract forced labor from the native inhabitants.
in its place the government established the repartimiento system whereby residents of indian villages remained legally free and entitled to wages but were still required to perform a fixed amount of labor each year.
the indians were not slaves they had access to land were paid wages and could not be bought and sold.
but since the requirement that they work for the spanish remained the essence of the system it still allowed for many abuses by spanish landlords and by priests who required indians to toil on mission lands as part of the conversion process.
indeed a long struggle ensued among settlers missionaries and colonial authorities for control of indian labor.
each party proclaimed itself a humane overlord and denounced the others for exploiting the native population.
by the end of the sixteenth century work in the spanish empire consisted largely of forced wage labor by native inhabitants and slave labor by africans on the west indian islands and a few parts of the mainland.
like all empires spains always remained highly exploitative.
over time the initial brutal treatment of indians improved somewhat.
but las casass writings translated almost immediately into several european languages contributed to the spread of the black legend the image of spain as a uniquely brutal and exploitative colonizer.
this would provide a potent justification for other european powers to challenge spains predominance in the new world.
spanish conquistadores murdering indians at cuzco in modern day peru.
the dutch born engraver theodor de bry and his sons illustrated ten volumes about new world exploration published between 1590 and 1618.
a protestant de bry created vivid images that helped to spread the black legend of spain as a uniquely cruel colonizer.

the spanish empire exploring north america while the spanish empire centered on mexico peru and the west indies the hope of finding a new kingdom of gold soon led spanish explorers into territory that now forms part of the united states.
juan ponce de len who had conquered puerto rico entered florida in 1513 in search of slaves wealth and a fabled fountain of youth only to be repelled by local indians.
in 1528 another expedition seeking plunder in florida embarked from spain but after a series of storms only a handful of men reached the gulf coast.
for seven years they traversed the southwest until a few survivors arrived in mexico in 1536.
one lvar nez cabeza de vaca wrote an account of his adventures including tales told by native inhabitants possibly to persuade the newcomers to move on of the seven golden cities of cibola somewhere over the horizon.
in the late 1530s and 1540s juan rodriguez cabrillo explored the pacific coast as far north as present day oregon and expeditions led by hernando de soto cabeza de vaca francisco vsquez de coronado and others marched through the gulf region and the southwest fruitlessly searching for another mexico or peru.
coronado explored much of the interior of the continent reaching as far north as the great plains and became the first european to encounter the immense herds of buffalo that roamed the west.
these expeditions really mobile communities with hundreds of adventurers priests potential settlers slaves and livestock spread disease and devastation among indian communities.
de sotos was particularly brutal.
his men tortured raped and enslaved countless indians and transmitted deadly diseases.
when europeans in the seventeenth century returned to colonize the area traversed by de sotos party little remained of the societies he had encountered.
where large towns had existed explorers found only herds of grazing bison.
what were the chief features of the spanish empire in america.
spanish florida nonetheless these explorations established spains claim to a large part of what is now the american south and southwest.
the first region to be colonized within the present day united states was florida.
spain hoped to establish a military base there to combat pirates who threatened the treasure fleet that each year sailed from havana for europe loaded with gold and silver from mexico and peru.
spain also wanted to forestall french incursions in the area.
in 1565 philip ii of spain authorized the nobleman pedro menndez de avils to lead a colonizing expedition to florida.
menndez destroyed a small outpost at fort caroline which a group of huguenots french protestants had established in 1562 near present day jacksonville.
menndez and his men massacred the 500 colonists and went on to establish spanish forts on st simons island georgia and at st augustine florida.
the latter remains the oldest site in the united states continuously inhabited by european settlers and their descendants.
spanish expeditions soon established forts from present day miami into south carolina and spanish religious missionaries set up outposts in florida and on the sea islands hoping to convert the local indians to christianity.
most of the forts fell into disuse and many of the missions were destroyed by local guale indians in an uprising that began in 1597.
the indians explained their revolt by noting that the missionaries had sought to eliminate our dances banquets feasts celebrations and wars.
they persecute our old people by calling them witches the missions were soon rebuilt only to be devastated again a century later this time by english and indian forces from south carolina.
in general florida failed to attract settlers remaining an isolated military settlement in effect a fortified outpost of cuba.
as late as 1763 spanish florida had only 4 000 inhabitants of european descent.

although de soto and others made incursions into the area in the sixteenth century their explorations were widely considered failures since they had discovered neither gold nor advanced civilizations whose populations could be put to work for the spanish empire.
spain then neglected the area for another half century.
it was not until 1598 that juan de oate led a group of 400 soldiers colonists and missionaries north from mexico to establish a permanent settlement.
while searching for fabled deposits of precious metals oates nephew and fourteen soldiers were killed by inhabitants of acoma the sky city located on a high bluff in present day new mexico.
oate decided to teach the local indians a lesson.
after a two day siege his forces scaled the seemingly impregnable heights and destroyed acoma killing more than 800 of its 1 500 or so inhabitants including 300 women.
of the 600 indians captured the women and children were consigned to servitude in spanish families while adult men were punished by the cutting off of one foot.

oates message was plain any indians who resisted spanish authority would be crushed.
but his method of rule coupled with his failure to locate gold alarmed authorities in mexico city.
in 1606 oate was ordered home and punished for his treatment of new mexicos indians.
in 1610 spain established the capital of new mexico at santa fe the first permanent european settlement in the southwest.
what were the chief features of the spanish empire in america.
the pueblo r e v o lt in 1680 new mexicos small and vulnerable colonist population numbered less than 3 000.
most were mestizos persons of mixed spanish and indian origin since few european settlers came to the region.
relations between the pueblo indians and colonial authorities had deteriorated throughout the seventeenth century as governors settlers and missionaries sought to exploit the labor of an indian population that declined from about 60 000 in 1600 to some 17 000 eighty years later.
franciscan friars worked relentlessly to convert indians to catholicism often using intimidation and violence.
their spiritual dedication and personal courage impressed many indians however as did the european goods and technologies they introduced.
some natives welcomed them as a counterbalance to the depredations of soldiers and settlers and accepted baptism even as they continued to practice their old religion adding jesus mary and the catholic saints to their already rich spiritual pantheon.
but as the inquisition the persecution of non catholics became more and more intense in spain so did the friars efforts to stamp out traditional religious ceremonies in new mexico.
by burning indian idols masks and other sacred objects the missionaries alienated far more indians than they converted.
a prolonged drought that began around 1660 and the authorities inability to protect the villages and missions from attacks by marauding navajo and apache indians added to local discontent.
the pueblo peoples had long been divided among themselves.
the spanish assumed that the indians could never unite against the colonizers.
in august 1680 they were proven wrong.
little is known about the life of pop who became the main organizer of an uprising that aimed to drive the spanish from the colony and restore the indians traditional autonomy.
a religious leader born around 1630 in san juan pueblo in present day new mexico pop first appears in the historical record in 1675 when he was one of forty seven pueblo indians arrested for sorcery that is practicing their traditional religion.
four of the prisoners were hanged and the rest including pop were brought to santa fe to be publicly whipped.
after this humiliation pop returned home and began holding secret meetings in pueblo communities.
under pops leadership new mexicos indians joined in a coordinated uprising.
ironically because the pueblos spoke six different languages spanish became the revolts lingua franca a common means of communication among persons of different linguistic backgrounds.
some 2 000 warriors destroyed isolated farms and missions killing 400 colonists including 21 franciscan missionaries.
they then surrounded santa fe.
the spanish resisted fiercely but eventually had no choice but to abandon the town.
most of the spanish survivors accompanied by several hundred christian indians made their way south out of new mexico.

recent h1 voices of freedom from bartolom de las casas history of the indies 1528 las casas was the dominican priest who condemned the treatment of indians in the spanish empire.
his widely disseminated history of the indies helped to establish the black legend of spanish cruelty.
food and to die.
when they fell ill which was very frequently because they are a delicate people unaccustomed to such work the spaniards did not believe them and pitilessly called them lazy dogs and kicked and beat them and when illness was apparent they sent them home as useless.
they would go then falling into the first stream and dying there in desperation others would hold on the indians of hispaniola were totally deprived of their freedom and were put in the harshest fiercest most horrible servitude and captivity which no one who has not seen it can understand.
even beasts enjoy more freedom when they are allowed to graze in the fields.
but our spaniards gave no such opportunity to indians and truly considered them perpetual slaves since the indians had not the free will to dispose of their persons but instead were disposed of according to spanish greed and cruelty not as men in captivity but as beasts tied to a rope to prevent free movement.
when they were allowed to go home they often found it deserted and had no other recourse than to go out into the woods to find longer but very few ever made it home.
i sometimes came upon dead bodies on my way and upon others who were gasping and moaning in their death agony repeating hungry hungry and this was the freedom the good treatment and the christianity the indians received.
about eight years passed under spanish rule and this disorder had time to grow no one gave it a thought and the multitude of people who originally lived on the island.
was consumed at such a rate that in these eight years 90 per cent had perished.
from here this sweeping plague went to san juan jamaica cuba and the continent spreading destruction over the whole hemisphere.
f r o m d e c l a r at i o n of josephe december 19 1681 josephe was a spanish speaking indian questioned by a royal attorney in mexico city investigating the pueblo revolt.
the revolt of the indian population in 1680 temporarily drove spanish settlers from present day new mexico.
asked what causes or motives the said indian rebels had for renouncing the law of god and obedience to his majesty and for committing so many of crimes he answered the causes they have were alleged ill treatment and injuries received from spanish authorities because they beat them took away what they had and made them work without pay.
thus he replies.
asked if he has learned if it has come to his notice during the time that he has been here the reason why the apostates burned the images churches and the temples and images crosses and rosaries burned and their function being over they all went to bathe in the rivers saying that they thereby washed away the water of baptism.
for their churches they placed on the four sides and in the center of the plaza some small circular enclosures of stone where they went to offer flour feathers and the seed of maguey a local plant maize and tobacco and performed other superstitious rites giving the children to understand that they must all do this in the future.
the captains and the chiefs ordered that the names of jesus and mary should nowhere be uttered.
he has seen many houses of idolatry which they have built dancing the dance of the cachina part of a traditional indian religious ceremony which this declarant has also danced.
thus he replies to the question.
things pertaining to divine worship making a mockery and a trophy of them killing the priests and doing the other things they did he said that he knows and had heard it generally stated that while they were besieging the villa the rebellious traitors burned the church and shouted in loud voices now questions 1.
why does las casas after describing the ill treatment of indians write and this was the freedom the good treatment and the christianity the indians received.
the god of the spaniards who was their father is dead and santa maria who was their mother and 2.
what role did religion play in the pueblo revolt.
the saints who were pieces of rotten wood saying that only their own god lived.
thus they ordered all 3.
what ideas of freedom are apparent in the two documents.
1 a new world the french and dutch empires in the area had been destroyed.
from their own point of view the pueblo indians had triumphantly reestablished the freedom lost through spanish conquest.
the pueblo revolt was the most complete victory for native americans over europeans and the only wholesale expulsion of settlers in the history of north america.
according to a royal attorney who interviewed the spanish survivors in mexico city the revolt arose from the many oppressions the indians had suffered.
the victorious pueblos turned with a vengeance on all symbols of european culture uprooting fruit trees destroying cattle burning churches and images of christ and the virgin mary and wading into rivers to wash away their catholic baptisms.
they rebuilt their places of worship called kivas and resumed sacred dances the friars had banned.
the god of the spaniards they shouted is dead cooperation among the pueblo peoples however soon evaporated.
by the end of the 1680s warfare had broken out among several villages even as apache and navajo raids continued.
pop died around 1690.
in 1692 the spanish launched an invasion that reconquered new mexico.
some communities welcomed them back as a source of military protection.
but spain had learned a lesson.
in the eighteenth century colonial authorities adopted a more tolerant attitude toward traditional religious practices and made fewer demands on indian labor.
the french and dutch empires st anthony and the infant jesus painted on a tanned buffalo hide by a franciscan priest in new mexico in the early eighteenth century.
this was not long after the spanish reconquered the area from which they had been driven by the pueblo revolt.
if the black legend inspired a sense of superiority among spains european rivals the precious metals that poured from the new world into the spanish treasury aroused the desire to try to match spains success.
the establishment of spains american empire transformed the balance of power in the world economy.
the atlantic replaced the overland route to asia as the major axis of global trade.
during the seventeenth century the french dutch and english established colonies in north america.
englands mainland colonies to be discussed in the next chapter consisted of agricultural settlements with growing populations whose hunger for land produced incessant conflict with native peoples.
new france and new netherland were primarily commercial ventures that never attracted large numbers of colonists.
more dependent on indians as trading partners and military allies these french and dutch settlements allowed native americans greater freedom than the english.
french colonization the first of spains major european rivals to embark on new world explorations was france.
the french initially aimed to find gold and to locate a northwest passage a sea route connecting the atlantic to the pacific.
but the hopes of the early french explorers were soon disappointed and north america came to seem little more than a barrier to be crossed not a promising site for settlement or exploitation.
for most of the sixteenth century only explorers fishermen pirates preying on spanish shipping farther south and as time went on fur traders visited the eastern coast of north what were the chief features of the french and dutch empires in north america.
french efforts to establish settlements in newfoundland and nova scotia failed beset by native resistance and inadequate planning and financing.
not until the seventeenth century would france as well as england and the netherlands establish permanent settlements in north america.
the explorer samuel de champlain sponsored by a french fur trading company founded quebec in 1608.
in 1673 the jesuit priest jacques marquette and the fur trader louis joliet located the mississippi river and by 1681 ren robert cavelier sieur de la salle had descended to the gulf of mexico claiming the entire mississippi river valley for france.
new france eventually formed a giant arc along the st lawrence mississippi and ohio rivers.
until 1663 when the population of european origin was fewer than 3 000 french canada was ruled by the company of new france through a governor general appointed in paris.
there was no representative assembly.
in that year the french government established a new company.
it granted land along the st lawrence river in seigneuries to well connected nobles and army officers who would transport colonists to take their place in a feudal society.
but most of the engags or indentured servants returned home after their contracts expired.
more than 80 percent of the migrants were men.
apart from nuns fewer than 1 800 women compared with more than 12 000 men emigrated to french canada in the seventeenth century.
and during the entire colonial period only about 250 complete families did so.
by 1700 the number of white inhabitants of new france had risen to only 19 000.
with a far larger population than england france sent many fewer emigrants to the western hemisphere.
the government at home feared that significant emigration would undermine frances role as a european great power and might compromise its effort to establish trade and good relations with the indians.
unfavorable reports about america circulated widely in france.
canada was widely depicted as an icebox a land of savage indians a dumping ground for criminals.
most french who left their homes during these years preferred to settle in the netherlands spain or the west indies.
the revocation in 1685 of the edict of nantes which had extended religious toleration to french protestants led well over 100 000 huguenots to flee their country.
but they were not welcome in new france which the crown desired to remain an outpost of catholicism.
new france and the indians with its small white population and emphasis on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlement the viability of new france depended on friendly relations with local indians.
the french prided themselves on adopting a more humane policy than their imperial rivals.
only our nation declared one french writer knows the secret of winning the indians affection lacking the voracious appetite for land of the english colonies and relying on indians to supply furs to trading posts the french worked out a complex series of military commercial and diplomatic connections the most enduring alliances between indians and settlers in colonial north america.
they neither appropriated substantial amounts a native american in present day nova scotia carved this image of a european ship on a rock.
long before explorers and colonists descended on the area its residents were familiar with europeans.
one chief membertou acquired a french ship and traded with fishermen out at sea.

new france new netherland 400 miles 400 kilometers of indian land like the english nor conquered native inhabitants militarily and set them to forced labor like the spanish.
samuel de champlain the intrepid explorer who dominated the early history of new france insisted on religious toleration for all christians and denied that native americans were intellectually or culturally inferior to europeans two positions that were unusual for his time.
although he occasionally engaged in wars with local indians he dreamed of creating a colony based on mutual respect between diverse peoples.
the jesuits a missionary religious order did seek with some success to convert indians to catholicism.
but unlike spanish missionaries in early new mexico they visions of freedom france bringing the faith to the indians of new france.
european nations justified colonization in part with the argument that they were bringing christianity without which true freedom was impossible to native americans.
in this painting from the 1670s attributed to a franciscan missionary an indian kneels before a female representation of france.
both hold a painting of the trinity.
the figure of france points skyward where god hands the earth to christ.
questions 1.
in what ways does the painting suggest that indians freely accepted catholicism and french rule.
how do the houses ship and dress of the indian reinforce the paintings message.
1 a new world this engraving which appears in samuel de champlains 1613 account of his voyages is the only likeness of the explorer from his own time.
champlain wearing european armor and brandishing an arquebus an advanced weapon of the period stands at the center of this pitched battle between his indian allies and hostile iroquois.
the french and dutch empires allowed christian indians to retain a high degree of independence and much of their traditional social structure and they did not seek to suppress all traditional religious practices.
like other colonists throughout north america however the french brought striking changes in indian life.
contact with europeans was inevitably followed by the spread of disease.
participation in the fur trade drew natives into the burgeoning atlantic economy introducing new goods and transforming hunting from a search for food into a quest for marketable commodities.
indians were soon swept into the rivalries among european empires and europeans into conflicts among indians.
as early as 1615 the huron of present day southern ontario and upper new york state forged a trading alliance with the french and many converted to catholicism.
in the 1640s however after being severely weakened by a smallpox epidemic the tribe was virtually destroyed in a series of attacks by iroquois armed by the dutch.
as in the spanish empire new france witnessed considerable cultural exchange and intermixing between colonial and native populations.
on the middle ground of the upper great lakes region in french america indians and whites encountered each other for many years on a basis of relative equality.
and mtis or children of marriages between indian women and french traders and officials became guides traders and interpreters.
like the spanish the french seemed willing to accept indians as part of colonial society.
they encouraged indians to adopt the european division of labor between men and women and to speak french.
indians who converted to catholicism were promised full citizenship.
in fact however it was far rarer for natives to adopt french ways than for french settlers to become attracted to the free life of the indians.
it happens more commonly one official complained that a frenchman becomes savage than a savage becomes a frenchman what were the chief features of the french and dutch empires in north america.
the dutch empire in 1609 henry hudson an englishman employed by the dutch east india company sailed into new york harbor searching for a northwest passage to asia.
hudson and his crew became the first europeans to sail up the river that now bears his name.
hudson did not find a route to asia but he did encounter abundant fur bearing animals and native americans more than willing to trade furs for european goods.
he claimed the area for the netherlands and his voyage planted the seeds for what would eventually become a great metropolis new york city.
by 1614 dutch traders had established an outpost at fort orange near present day albany.
ten years later the dutch west india company which had been awarded a monopoly of dutch trade with america settled colonists on manhattan island.
these ventures formed one small part in the rise of the dutch overseas empire.
in the early seventeenth century the netherlands dominated international commerce and amsterdam was europes foremost shipping and banking center.
the small nation had entered a golden age of rapidly accumulating wealth and stunning achievements in painting philosophy and the sciences.
the dutch invented the joint stock company a way of pooling financial resources and sharing the risk of maritime voyages which proved central to the development of modern capitalism.
with a population of only 2 million the netherlands established a far flung empire that reached from indonesia to south africa and the caribbean and temporarily wrested control of brazil from portugal.
dutch freedom the dutch prided themselves on their devotion to liberty.
indeed in the early seventeenth century they enjoyed two freedoms not recognized elsewhere in europe freedom of the press and broad religious toleration.
even though there was an established church the dutch reformed individuals could hold whatever religious beliefs they wished.
amsterdam had become a haven for persecuted protestants from all over europe including french huguenots german calvinists and those like the pilgrims who desired to separate from the church of england.
jews especially those fleeing from spain also found refuge there.
other emigrants came to the netherlands in the hope of sharing in the countrys prosperity.
during the seventeenth century the nation attracted about half a million migrants from elsewhere in europe.
many of these newcomers helped to populate the dutch overseas empire.
freedom in new netherland despite the dutch reputation for cherishing freedom new netherland was hardly governed democratically.
new amsterdam the main population center was essentially a fortified military outpost controlled by appointees of the west india company.
although the governor called on prominent citizens for advice from time to time neither an elected assembly nor a town council the basic unit of government at home was established.
1 a new world a view of new amsterdam from 1651 illustrates both the tiny size of the outpost but also its status as a center of international trade between europeans and native americans.
the french and dutch empires in other ways however the colonists enjoyed more liberty especially in religious matters than their counterparts elsewhere in north america.
even their slaves possessed rights.
the dutch dominated the atlantic slave trade in the early seventeenth century and they introduced slaves into new netherland as a matter of course.
by 1650 the colonys 500 slaves outnumbered those in the chesapeake.
some enjoyed half freedom they were required to pay an annual fee to the company and work for it when called upon but they were given land to support their families.
settlers employed slaves on family farms or for household or craft labor not on large plantations as in the west indies.
women in the dutch settlement enjoyed far more independence than in other colonies.
according to dutch law married women retained their separate legal identity.
they could go to court borrow money and own property.
men were used to sharing property with their wives.
their wills generally left their possessions to their widows and daughters as well as sons.
margaret hardenbroeck the widow of a new amsterdam merchant expanded her husbands business and became one of the towns richest residents after his death in 1661.
most striking was the religious toleration that attracted to new netherland a remarkably diverse population.
as early as the 1630s at least eighteen languages were said to be spoken in new amsterdam whose residents included not only dutch settlers but also africans belgians english french germans irish and scandinavians.
meanwhile puritan emigrants from new england established towns on long island.
religious toleration extended not only to protestants but also to catholics and grudgingly to jews.
twenty three jews arrived in new amsterdam in 1654 from brazil and the caribbean.
referring to them as members of a deceitful race governor peter stuyvesant ordered the newcomers to leave.
but the compa what were the chief features of the french and dutch empires in north america.
ny overruled him noting that jews at home had invested a large amount of capital in its shares.
settling new netherland in an attempt to attract settlers to north america the dutch west india company promised colonists not only religious toleration but also cheap livestock and free land after six years of labor.
eventually it even surrendered its monopoly of the fur trade opening this profitable commerce to all comers.
many settlers stuyvesant complained had been lured by an imaginary liberty and did not display much respect for the companys authority.
in 1629 the company adopted a plan of freedoms and exemptions offering large estates to patroons shareholders who agreed to transport tenants for agricultural labor.
the patroon was required to purchase title to the land from indians but otherwise his freedoms were like those of a medieval lord including the right to 10 percent of his tenants annual income and complete authority over law enforcement within his domain.
only one patroonship became a going concern that of kiliaen van rensselaer who acquired some 700 000 acres in the hudson valley.
his familys autocratic rule over the tenants as well as its efforts to extend its domain to include lands settled by new englanders who claimed that they owned their farms would inspire sporadic uprisings into the mid nineteenth century.
during the seventeenth century the netherlands sent 1 million people overseas many of them recent immigrants who were not in fact dutch to populate and govern their far flung colonies.
very few however made north america their destination.
by the mid 1660s the european population of new netherland numbered only 9 000.
new netherland remained a tiny backwater in the dutch empire.
so did an even smaller outpost near present day wilmington delaware established in 1638 by a group of dutch merchants.
to circumvent the west india companys trade monopoly they claimed to be operating under the swedish flag and called their settlement new sweden.
only 300 settlers were living there when new netherland seized the colony in 1655.
new netherland and the indians the dutch came to north america to trade not to conquer.
they were less interested in settling the land than in exacting profits from it.
mindful of the black legend of spanish cruelty the dutch determined to treat the native inhabitants more humanely than the spanish.
having won their own independence from spain after the longest and bloodiest war of sixteenth century europe many dutch identified with american indians as fellow victims of spanish oppression.
they justified their imperial ambitions in part as an effort to liberate the new world from the tyranny of spain and the catholic church.
initially however they aimed less to convert the indian population than to employ it in the profitable fur trade.
from the beginning dutch authorities recognized indian sovereignty over the land and forbade settlement in any area until it had been purchased.
but they also required tribes to make payments to colonial authorities.
the seal of new netherland adopted by the dutch west india company in 1630 suggests the centrality of the fur trade to the colonys prospects.
surrounding the beaver is wampum a string of beads used by indians in religious rituals and as currency.
1 a new world a map of the western hemisphere published in 1592 in antwerp then ruled by spain and now part of belgium.
it shows north america divided between new france and new spain before the coming of the english.
the french and dutch empires near the coast where most newcomers settled new netherland was hardly free of conflict with the indians.
the expansionist ambitions of governor william kieft who in the 1640s began seizing fertile farmland from the nearby algonquian indians sparked a three year war that resulted in the death of 1 000 indians and more than 200 colonists.
with the powerful iroquois confederacy of the upper hudson valley however the dutch established friendly commercial and diplomatic relations.
thus before the planting of english colonies in north america other european nations had established various kinds of settlements in the new world.
despite their differences the spanish french and dutch empires shared certain features.
all brought christianity new forms of technology and learning new legal systems and family relations and new forms of economic enterprise and wealth creation.
they also brought savage warfare and widespread disease.
these empires were aware of one anothers existence.
they studied and borrowed from one another each lauding itself as superior to the others.
from the outset dreams of freedom for indians for settlers for the entire world through the spread of christianity inspired and justified colonization.
it would be no different when at the beginning of the seventeenth century england entered the struggle for empire in north america.

l o n april 26 1607 three small ships carrying colonists from england sailed out of the morning mist at what is now called cape henry into the mouth of chesapeake bay.
after exploring the area for a little over two weeks they chose a site sixty miles inland on the james river for their settlement hoping to protect themselves from marauding spanish warships.
here they established jamestown named for the king of england as the capital of the colony of virginia named for his predecessor elizabeth i the virgin queen.
but despite these bows to royal authority the voyage was sponsored not by the english government which in 1607 was hard pressed for funds but by the virginia company a private business organization whose shareholders included merchants aristocrats and members of parliament and to which the queen had given her blessing before her death in 1603.
when the three ships returned home 104 settlers remained in virginia.
all were men for the virginia company had more interest in searching for gold and in other ways exploiting the areas natural resources than in establishing a functioning society.
nevertheless jamestown became the first permanent english settlement in the area that is now the united states.
the settlers were the first of tens of thousands of europeans who crossed the atlantic during the seventeenth century to live and work in north america.
they led the way for new empires that mobilized labor and economic resources reshaped societies throughout the atlantic world and shifted the balance of power at home from spain and portugal to the nations of northwestern europe.
the founding of jamestown took place at a time of heightened european involvement in north america.
interest in colonization was spurred by national and religious rivalries and the growth of a merchant class eager to invest in overseas expansion and to seize for itself a greater share of world trade.
as noted in chapter 1 it was quickly followed by the founding of quebec by france in 1608 and henry hudsons exploration in 1609 of the river that today bears his name leading to the founding of the dutch colony of new netherland.
in 1610 the spanish established santa fe as the capital of new mexico.

same less than fully free status as in england subject to laws regulating their labor and depriving them of a role in politics.
but for ordinary men and women emigration offered an escape from lives of deprivation and inequality.
no man wrote john smith an early leader of jamestown will go from england to have less freedom in america.
the charter of the virginia company granted by james i in 1606 promised that colonists would enjoy all liberties of those residing in our realm of england the settlers of english america came to enjoy greater rights than colonists of other empires including the power to choose members of elected assemblies protections of the common law such as the right to trial by jury and access to land the key to economic independence.
many degrees of freedom coexisted in seventeenth century north america from the slave stripped completely of liberty to the independent landowner who enjoyed a full range of rights.
during a lifetime a person might well occupy more than one place on this spectrum.
the settlers success however rested on depriving native americans of their land and in some colonies on importing large numbers of african slaves as laborers.

decades of religious strife followed.
under henrys son edward vi who became king at the age of ten in 1547 the regents who governed the country persecuted catholics.
when edward died in 1553 his half sister mary became queen.
mary temporarily restored catholicism as the state religion and executed a number of protestants.
her rule was so unpopular that reconciliation with rome became impossible.
marys successor elizabeth i reigned 1558 1603 restored the anglican ascendancy and executed more than 100 catholic priests.
