america a not so new world pa r t one history is filled with ironies.
luck and accidents the unexpected and unplanned happenings of life often shape events more than intentions.
long before christopher columbus lucked upon the caribbean sea and an unexpected continent in his effort to find a westward passage to the indies east asia the native peoples he mislabeled indians had occupied and transformed the lands of the western hemisphere also called the americas north central and south.
initially everyone in what came to be called america came from somewhere else.
by 1492 when columbus began his voyage west from spain across an uncharted ocean there were millions of native americans living in the western hemisphere.
the new world he found was new only to the europeans who began exploring conquering and exploiting the region at the end of the fifteenth century.
over thousands of years native american peoples had developed highly sophisticated societies.
some were rooted in agriculture others focused on trade or the conquest of others.
many native americans were healthier better fed and lived longer than europeans but they and their cultures were almost destroyed by the arrival of europeans and africans.
as the two different societies european and native a merican collided each having its own distinct heritage and worldview indian peoples were exploited infected enslaved displaced and exterminated.
yet the conventional story of invasion and occupation oversimplifies the complex process by which indians europeans and africans interacted in the colonial period.
the native americans also called first peoples were more than passive victims of european power they were also trading partners and military allies of the transatlantic newcomers.
they became neighbors and advisers religious converts and loving spouses.
as such they participated actively in the creation of the new society known as america.
the europeans who risked their lives to settle in the western hemisphere were themselves a diverse lot.
young and old men and women they came from spain portugal france the british isles the netherlands holland scandinavia italy and the german states germany would not become a united nation until the mid nineteenth century.
a variety of motives inspired europeans to undertake the o ften harrowing transatlantic voyage.
some were fortune seekers lusting for gold silver and spices.
others were passionate christians eager to create kingdoms of god in the new world.
still others were adventurers convicts debtors servants landless peasants and political or religious exiles.
many were simply seeking opportunities for a better way of life.
a settler in pennsylvania noted that poor people of all kinds can here get three times the wages for their labor than they can in england yet such wages never attracted sufficient numbers of workers to keep up with the rapidly expanding colonial economies so europeans early in the seventeenth century turned to africa for their labor needs.
in 1619 a dutch 3 warship brought the first twenty africans to the english settlement at jamestown near the coast of virginia and exchanged that human cargo for food and supplies.
this first of many transactions involving enslaved people in british america would transform american society in ways that no one at the time e nvisioned.
few europeans during the colonial era saw the contradiction between the promise of freedom in america for themselves and the bondage of slavery for africans and indians.
the intermingling of people cultures plants animals germs and diseases from the continents of africa europe and the western hemisphere gave colonial american society its distinctive vitality and variety.
in turn the diversity of the environment and the varying climate spawned different economies and patterns of living in the various regions of north america.
as the original settlements grew into prosperous and populous colonies the transplanted europeans had to create new communities and political systems to manage growth and control rising tensions.
at the same time bitter rivalries among the spanish french english and dutch triggered costly wars in europe and around the world.
the monarchs of europe struggled to manage o ften unruly colonies which they discovered played crucial roles in their frequent wars.
many of the colonists had brought with them to america a feisty independence which led them to resent government interference in their affairs.
a british official in north carolina reported that the colonists were without any law or order.
impudence is so very high as to be past bearing the americans and their british rulers maintained an uneasy partnership throughout the seventeenth century.
but as the royal authorities tightened their control during the m id eighteenth century they met resistance from colonists which exploded into revolution.

although artist theodor de bry never set foot in north america his engravings helped shape european perceptions of native americans in the sixteenth century.
a merica was born in melting ice.
tens of thousands of years ago during a long period known as the ice age vast glaciers some two miles thick inched their way southward from the arctic circle at the top of the globe.
their awesome power crushed hills rerouted rivers and scraped bare all the land in their path.
vast glacial ice sheets eventually covered much of north america canada alaska the upper midwest new england montana and washington.
then as the continents climate began to warm the ice started to melt year after year century after century.
so much of the worlds water was bound up in glacial ice that the slow melt ultimately caused sea levels to rise more than 400 feet.
as the ice sheets receded they left behind in the midwest a thick blanket of fertile topsoil that had been scoured from canada and pushed down the continent creating what would become the worlds richest farmland.
the shrinking glaciers also opened valley pathways for the first immigrants to begin a process of crossing the continent.
the american past belongs to many different peoples.
debate still rages about when and how humans first arrived in north america.
until recently archaeologists and anthropologists had assumed that ancient peoples risk takers from northeast asia clothed in animal hides and furs began following big game animals across the bering strait a sixty mile wide waterway that now connects the arctic and pacific oceans.
during the ice age however the bering strait was dry a vast treeless windswept landmass beringia that served as a wide inviting bridge connecting eastern siberia with alaska.

why were there so many diverse societies in the americas before europeans arrived.
what were the major developments in europe that enabled the age of exploration.
how were the spanish able to conquer and colonize the americas.
how did the columbian exchange between the old and new worlds affect both societies.

first proof mammoth a 14 000 year old site in central alaska where the first aboriginal peoples called p aleo indians old indians arrived in north america.
more recently archaeologists in central texas unearthed evidence of people dating back almost 16 000 years.
over hundreds of years as the climate kept warming and the glaciers continued to melt small hunting groups carrying their few possessions with them crossed into alaska and then fanned out during the summers southward across the entire western hemisphere from the arctic circle to the tip of south america.
some of them may also have traveled by boats hugging the coast.
one major land pathway followed the pacific coast while the other used an open land corridor between two ice sheets east of the rocky mountains.
early cultures in america 7 aleo indians were risk taking pioneers skilled hunters and gatherers who p moved in search of large grazing mammals rabbits whales seals fish and wild plants berries nuts roots and seeds.
as they moved southward toward warmer weather they trekked across the prairies and the plains encountering massive animals unlike any found there today mastodons giant sloths camels bison buffalos lions s aber toothed tigers cheetahs and giant wolves beavers and bears.
recent archaeological discoveries in pennsylvania virginia and chile however suggest that prehistoric humans may have arrived much earlier from various parts of a sia and some may even have crossed the atlantic ocean from southwestern europe.
regardless of when humans first set foot in north america the continent eventually became a crossroads for various adventurous peoples from around the world europeans africans asians and others all bringing with them distinctive backgrounds cultures technologies religions and motivations that helped form the multicultural society known as america.
early cultures in america archaeologists have labeled the earliest humans in north america the clovis peoples named after a site in new mexico where ancient hunters around 9500 b c e.
before the common era killed tusked woolly mammoths using distinctive clovis stone spearheads.
they also used a wooden device called an atlatl which gave them added leverage to hurl spears farther and more accurately.
over many centuries as the climate warmed days grew hotter and many of the largest m ammals mammoths mastodons giant bison and s ingle hump c amels died and grew extinct.
skeletal remains of paleo indians reveal that the women were much smaller than the men who were bold aggressive and hypermasculine.
more than half of the male skeletons show signs of injuries caused by violence.
four out of ten have fractured skulls.
the physical evidence is clear paleo indian men assaulted and killed each other with regularity.
over time the ancient indians adapted to their diverse environments coastal forests grassy plains southwestern deserts eastern woodlands.
some continued to hunt large animals others fished and trapped small game.
some gathered wild plants and herbs and collected acorns and seeds others farmed.
many did some of each.
contrary to the romantic myth of early indian civilizations living in perfect harmony with nature and one another they in fact often engaged in warfare exploited the environment by burning large wooded areas to plant fields and overhunted large game animals.
they also mastered the use of fire improved 8 chapter 1 the collision of cultures technology such as spear points basketry and pottery and developed their own nature centered religions.
by about 5000 b c e native americans had adapted to the warmer climate by transforming themselves into farming societies.
agriculture provided reliable nutritious food which accelerated population growth and enabled a once nomadic wandering people to settle down in villages.
indigenous peoples became expert at growing the plants that would become the primary food crops of the entire hemisphere chiefly maize corn beans and squash but also chili peppers avocados and pumpkins.
many of them also grew cotton.
the annual cultivation of such crops enabled indian societies to grow larger and more complex with their own distinctive social economic and political institutions.
the mayas incas and mexica around 1500 b c e farming towns first appeared in what is now mexico.
agriculture supported the development of sophisticated communities complete with gigantic t emple topped pyramids palaces and bridges in middle mayan society a fresco depicting the social divisions of mayan society.

the mayas who dominated central america for more than 600 years developed a rich written language and elaborate works of art.
they also used sophisticated mathematics and astronomy to create a yearly calendar more accurate than the one the europeans were using at the time of columbus.
the incas much farther south as many as 12 million people speaking at least twenty different languages made up the sprawling inca empire.
by the fifteenth century the incas vast realm stretched some 2 500 miles along the andes mountains in the western part of south america.
the mountainous inca empire featured irrigated farms enduring stone buildings and interconnected networks of roads made of stone.
the mexica aztecs during the twelfth century the mexica me shee ka whom europeans later called aztecs people from aztln the place they claimed as their original homeland began drifting southward aztec sacrifices to the gods renowned for their military prowess aztecs preferred to capture and then sacrifice their enemies.

disciplined determined and energetic they eventually took control of the sweeping valley of central mexico where they started building the city of tenochtitln in 1325 on an island in lake tetzcoco the site of present day mexico city.
tenochtitln would become one of the largest cities in the world.
warfare was a sacred ritual for the mexica but it was a peculiar sort of fighting.
the mexica fought with wooden swords intended to wound rather than kill since they wanted captives to sacrifice to the gods and to work as slaves.
gradually the mexica conquered many of the neighboring societies forcing them to pay tribute taxes in goods and services and developing a thriving trade in gold silver copper and pearls as well as agricultural products.
towering stone temples broad paved avenues thriving marketplaces and some 70 000 adobe huts dominated the dazzling capital city of tenochtitln.
when the spanish invaded mexico in 1519 they found a vast aztec empire connected by a network of roads serving 371 city states organized into thirty eight provinces.
as their empire had expanded across central and southern mexico the aztecs had developed elaborate urban societies supported by detailed legal systems efficient new farming techniques including irrigated fields and engineering marvels and a complicated political structure.
their arts were flourishing their architecture was magnificent.
aztec rulers were invested with godlike qualities and nobles priests and warrior heroes dominated the social order.
the emperor lived in a huge palace the aristocracy lived in large stone dwellings practiced polygamy multiple wives and were exempt from manual labor.
like most agricultural peoples the mexica were intensely spiritual.
their religious beliefs focused on the interconnection between nature and human life and the sacredness of natural elements the sun moon stars rain mountains rivers and animals.
to please the gods especially huitzilopochtli the lord of the sun and bring good harvests and victory in battle the mexica like most mesoamericans regularly offered live human sacrifices captives slaves women and children by the thousands.
in elaborate weekly rituals blood stained priests used stone knives to cut out the beating hearts of sacrificial victims and ceremonially offered them to the sun god to help his fight against the darkness of the night without the blood from human hearts he would be vanquished by the darkness.
the heads of the victims were then displayed on a towering skull rack in the central plaza.
the constant need for more human sacrifices fed the mexicas relentless warfare against other indigenous groups.
a mexica song celebrated their warrior code proud of itself is the city of mexico tenochtitln.

for all of their similarities the indigenous peoples of north america developed in different ways at different times and in different places often as strangers unaware of each other.
in north america alone there were probably 10 million native people organized into 240 different societies speaking many different languages when the europeans first arrived in the early sixteenth century.
early cultures in america 13 native americans owned land in common rather than separately and they had w ell defined social roles.
men were hunters warriors and leaders.
women tended children made clothes blankets jewelry and pottery dried animal skins wove baskets built and packed tipis and gathered grew and cooked food.
indians often lived together in extended family groups in a lodge or tipi a sioux word meaning dwelling.
the tipis were mobile homes made of buffalo skins.
their designs had a spiritual significance.
the round floor represented the earth the walls symbolized the sky and the supporting poles served as pathways from the human world to the spiritual world.
the southwest the dry southwest what is now arizona new mexico nevada and utah hosted corn growing societies elements of which exist today and heirs to which the hopis zunis and others still live in the multistory adobe sunbaked mud c liff side villages called pueblos by the spanish erected by their ancient ancestors.

14 chapter 1 the collision of cultures of irrigation canals to water crops.
they also crafted decorative pottery and turquoise jewelry and constructed temple mounds earthen pyramids used for sacred ceremonies.
perhaps because of prolonged drought the hohokam society disappeared during the fifteenth century.
the most widespread and best known of the southwest pueblo cultures were the anasazi ancient ones.
they developed extensive settlements in the four corners region where the m odern day states of arizona new mexico colorado and utah meet.
unlike the aztecs and incas anasazi society was remarkable for not having a rigid class structure.
the religious leaders and warriors worked much as the rest of the people did.
the anasazi engaged in warfare only as a means of s elf defense.
hopi means peaceful people environmental factors shaped anasazi culture and eventually caused its decline.
toward the end of the thirteenth century a lengthy drought and the aggressiveness of indian peoples migrating from the north led to the disappearance of anasazi society.
the northwest along the narrow coastal strip running up the heavily forested northwest pacific coast from northern california to alaska where shellfish salmon seals whales deer and edible wild plants were abundant there was little need for farming.
in fact many of the pacific northwest peoples such as the haida kwakiutl and nootka needed to work only two days to provide enough food for a week.
because of plentiful food and thriving trade networks the native american population was larger and more concentrated than in other regions.
such social density enabled the pacific coast peoples to develop intricate religious rituals and sophisticated woodworking skills.
they carved towering totem poles featuring decorative figures of animals and other symbolic characters.
for shelter they built large earthen floored c edar plank houses up to 100 feet long where whole groups of families lived together.
they also created sturdy oceangoing canoes carved out of red cedar tree trunks some large enough to carry fifty people.
socially the indian bands along the northwest pacific coast were divided into slaves commoners and chiefs.
warfare usually occurred as a means to acquire slaves.
the great plains the many different peoples living on the great plains plains indians a vast flat land of cold winters and hot summers west of the mississippi river and in the great basin present day utah and nevada included the arapaho blackfeet cheyenne comanche crow apache and sioux.
as nomadic hunter gatherers they tracked enormous herds of bison early cultures in america 15 across a sea of grassland collecting seeds nuts roots and berries as they roamed.
at the center of most hunter gatherer religions is the animistic idea that the hunted animal is a willing sacrifice provided by the gods spirits.
to ensure a successful hunt these nomadic peoples performed sacred rites of gratitude beforehand.
once a buffalo herd was spotted the hunters would set fires to drive the stampeding animals over cliffs.
the mississippians east of the great plains in the vast woodlands from the mississippi river to the atlantic ocean several mound building cultures flourished as predominantly agricultural societies.
between 800 b c e.
and 400 c e the adena and later the hopewell peoples both names derive from the archaeological sites in ohio developed communities along rivers in the ohio valley.
the a dena hopewell cultures focused on agriculture growing corn squash beans and sunflowers as well as tobacco for smoking.
they left behind enormous earthworks and 200 elaborate burial mounds shaped like great snakes birds and other animals several of which were nearly a quarter mile long.
artifacts buried in the mounds have revealed a complex social structure featuring a specialized division of labor whereby great serpent mound at over 1 300 feet in length and three feet high this s nake shaped burial mound in adams county ohio is the largest of its kind in the world.
16 chapter 1 the collision of cultures different groups performed different tasks for the benefit of the society as a whole.
some were fisher folk others were farmers hunters artists cooks and mothers.
like the adena the hopewell also developed an extensive trading network from the gulf of mexico to canada exchanging exquisite carvings metalwork pearls seashells copper ornaments and jewelry.
by the sixth century however the hopewell culture disappeared giving way to a new phase of native american development east of the mississippi river the mississippian culture which flourished from 800 to 1500 c e.
the mississippians centered in the southern mississippi valley were also mound building and corn growing peoples led by chieftains.
they grew corn beans squash and sunflowers and they built substantial towns around central plazas and temples.
the mississippian peoples the most powerful of which were the natchez developed a far flung trading network that extended to the rocky mountains.
their ability to grow large amounts of corn each year in the fertile flood plains of rivers spurred rapid population growth around regional centers.
cahokia the largest of these advanced regional centers called chiefdoms was cahokia 1050 1250 c e.
in southwest illinois just a few miles across the mississippi river from what is now st louis missouri.
there the mississippians constructed an intricately planned farming settlement with monumental public buildings spacious ceremonial plazas and more than 100 flat topped earthen pyramids with t hatch roofed temples on top.
over the years the cahokians cut whole forests to create their huge village and to protect it with a two mile long stockade built of 15 000 oak and hickory logs t wenty one feet tall.
at the height of its influence prosperous cahokia hosted 15 000 people on some 3 200 acres making it the largest city north of mexico.
outlying towns and farming settlements ranged up to fifty miles in all directions.
cahokia however vanished after 1250 and its people dispersed.
what caused its collapse remains a mystery but environmental changes are the most likely reason.
the overcutting of trees may have set in motion ecological changes that doomed the community when a massive earthquake struck around 1200 c e.
the loss of trees led to widespread flooding and the erosion of topsoil that finally forced people to seek better lands.
as cahokia disappeared however its former residents carried with them its cultural traditions and spread its advanced ways of life to other areas across the midwest and into what is now the american south.
early cultures in america 17 eastern woodlands peoples after the collapse of cahokia the eastern woodlands peoples rose to dominance along the atlantic seaboard from maine to florida and along the gulf coast to louisiana.
they included three regional groups distinguished by their different languages the algonquian the iroquoian and the muskogean.
these were the societies the europeans would first encounter when they arrived in north america.
the algonquians the algonquian speaking peoples stret ched from the new england seaboard to lands along the great lakes and into the upper midwest and south to new jersey virginia and the carolinas.
they constructed no great mounds or temple topped pyramids.
most algonquians lived in small round shelters called wigwams or multifamily longhouses.
their villages typically ranged in size from 500 to 2 000 people but they often moved their villages with the seasons.
the algonquians along the atlantic coast were skilled at fishing and gathering shellfish the inland algonquians excelled at hunting deer moose elk bears bobcats and mountain lions.
they often traveled the regions waterways using canoes made of h ollowed out tree trunks dugouts or birch bark.
all of the algonquians foraged for wild food nuts berries and fruits and practiced agriculture to some extent regularly burning dense forests to improve soil fertility and provide grazing room for deer.
to prepare their vegetable gardens women broke up the ground with hoes tipped with clam shells or the shoulder blades from algonquian in war paint from the deer.
in the spring they planted corn notebook of english settler john white this sketch depicts a native american beans and squash in mounds.
as the chieftain.
cornstalks rose the tendrils from the 18 chapter 1 the collision of cultures climbing bean plants wrapped around them for support.
once the crops ripened women made a nutritious mixed meal of succotash combining corn beans and squash.
the iroquoians west and south of the algonquians were the powerful iroquoian speaking peoples including the seneca onondaga mohawk oneida and cayuga nations as well as the cherokee and tuscarora whose lands spread from upstate new york southward through pennsylvania and into the upland regions of the carolinas and georgia.
the iroquois were farmer hunters who lived together in extended family groups clans sharing bark c overed longhouses in towns of 3 000 or more people.
the oldest woman in each longhouse was deemed the clan mother of the residents.
villages were surrounded by palisades tall fences made of trees intended to fend off attackers.
their most important crops were corn and squash both of which figure prominently in iroquois mythology.
unlike the algonquian culture in which men were dominant women held the key leadership roles in the iroquoian culture.
as an iroquois elder explained in our society women are the center of all things.
nature we believe has given women the ability to create therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function men and women were not treated as equals.
rather the two genders operated in two separate social domains.
no woman could be a chief no man could head a clan.
women selected the chiefs controlled the distribution of property and planted and harvested the crops.
after marriage the man moved in with the wifes family.
in part the iroquoian matriarchy reflected the frequent absence of iroquois men who as skilled hunters and traders traveled extensively for long periods requiring women to take charge of domestic life.
war between rival groups of native americans especially the algonquians and iroquois was commonplace usually as a means of settling feuds or gaining slaves.
success in fighting was a warriors highest honor.
as a cherokee explained in the eighteenth century we cannot live without war.
should we make peace with the tuscaroras we must immediately look out for some other nation with whom we can engage in our beloved occupation eastern woodlands indians the third major native american group in the eastern woodlands included the southern peoples along the gulf coast who spoke the muskogean language the creeks chickasaws and choctaws.
like the iroquois they were often matrilineal societies meaning that ancestry was traced only through the mothers line but they had a more european visions of america 19 rigid class structure.
the muskogeans lived in towns arranged around a central plaza.
in the region along the coast of the gulf of mexico many of their thatch roofed houses had no walls because of the hot humid summers.
over thousands of years the native north americans had displayed remarkable resilience adapting to the uncertainties of frequent warfare changing climate and varying environments.
they would display similar resilience in the face of the challenges created by the arrival of europeans.
european visions of america the european exploration of the western hemisphere resulted from several key developments during the fifteenth century.
in europe dramatic intellectual changes and scientific discoveries transformed religion warfare family life and the economy.
in addition the resurgence of old vices greed conquest exploitation oppression racism and slavery would help fuel european expansion abroad.
a severe population decline caused by warfare famine and plagues the black death left once great noble estates without enough agricultural workers to maintain them.
by the end of the fifteenth century medieval feudalisms static agrarian social system in which serfs worked for local nobles in exchange for living on and farming the land began to disintegrate.
people were no longer forced to remain in the same locality and keep the same social status in which they were born.
a new middle class of profit hungry bankers merchants and investors emerged.
they were committed to a more dynamic commercial economy fueled by innovations in banking currency accounting and insurance.
the growing trade based economy in europe freed monarchs from their dependence on feudal nobles enabling them to unify the scattered cities ruled by princes principalities into large kingdoms with stronger more centralized governments.
the rise of towns cities and a merchant class provided kings and queens with new tax revenues and the once dominant nobility was gradually displaced by powerful new merchants bankers and monarchs.
the renaissance at the same time the rediscovery of ancient greek and roman writings about representative government republics spurred an intellectual revolution known as the renaissance rebirth.
educated people throughout europe began to challenge prevailing beliefs as well as the absolute authority of rulers and churchmen.
they discussed controversial new ideas about politics religion and science engaged in scientific research and unleashed their artistic creativity.
20 chapter 1 the collision of cultures the renaissance also brought the practical application of new ideas that sparked the age of exploration.
new knowledge and new technologies made possible the construction of larger sailing ships capable of oceanic voyages.
the development of more accurate magnetic compasses maps and navigational instruments such as astrolabes and quadrants helped sailors determine their ships location.
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries also brought the invention of gunpowder cannons and firearms and the printing press.
the rise of global trade by 1500 trade between western european nations and the middle east africa and asia was flourishing.
the portuguese blessed with expert sailors and fast t hree masted ships called caravels took the lead roaming along the west coast of africa collecting grains gold ivory spices and slaves.
eventually these mariners continued all the way around africa in search of the fabled indies india and southeast asia and continued on to china and japan where they found what they had dreamed about spices silk cloth and other exotic trade goods.
by the end of the fifteenth century four powerful nations had emerged in western europe england france portugal and spain.
the marriage of king ferdinand of aragon and queen isabella of castile in 1469 led to the unification of their two kingdoms into a single new nation spain.
the spanish king and queen were christian expansionists eager to spread the catholic faith to peoples around the world.
on january 1 1492 after nearly eight centuries of religious warfare between spanish christians and moorish muslims on the iberian peninsula ferdinand and isabella declared victory for catholicism at granada the last muslim stronghold.
the christian monarchs gave the defeated muslims and soon thereafter the jews living in spain and portugal called sephardi the same desperate choice convert to catholicism or leave.
the forced exile of muslims and jews was one of the many factors that prompted europes involvement in global expansion.
other factors urbanization world trade the rise of centralized nations plus advances in knowledge technology and fi repower combined with natural human curiosity greed and religious zeal to spur the exploration and conquest of the western hemisphere.
beginning in the late fifteenth century europeans set in motion the events that as one historian has observed would bind together four continents three races and a great diversity of regional parts the voyages of columbus these were the circumstances that led christopher columbus to pursue his own dream of finding a route to the indies west across the atlantic.
born european visions of america 21 in genoa italy in 1451 the son of a weaver columbus took to the sea at an early age teaching himself geography navigation and latin.
by the 1480s he was eager to spread christianity across the globe and win glory and riches.
the tall red haired columbus eventually persuaded ferdinand and isabella to finance his voyage.
they agreed to award him a o ne tenth share of any riches he gathered they would keep the rest.
crossing the atlantic on august 3 1492 columbus and a crew of ninety men and boys mostly from spain but from seven other nations as well set sail on three tiny ships the santa mara the pinta and the nia respectively about sixty fi fty five and fifty feet long.
they traveled first to lisbon portugal and then headed west.
for weeks they journeyed across the open sea hoping with each dawn to sight the shore of asia only to be disappointed.
by early october the worried sailors rebelled at the madness of sailing blindly and forced columbus to promise that they would turn back if land were not sighted within three days.
then at dawn on october 12 a sailor named rodrigo on watch atop the masthead yelled tierra.
tierra land.
he had spotted a small island in the bahamas east of florida that columbus named san salvador blessed savior.
columbus mistakenly assumed that they must be near the indies so he called the island people indios at every encounter with these peaceful native people known as tainos or arawaks his first question was whether they had any gold.
if they did the spaniards seized it if they did not the europeans forced them to search for it.
the arawaks unable to understand or repel the strange visitors welcomed the europeans by offering gifts of food water and parrots.
columbus described them as well built with good bodies and handsome features.
their hair is short and coarse almost like the hairs of a horses tail he marveled that they would make fine servants boasting that with fifty men we could subjuchristopher columbus a portrait by gate them all and make them do what sebastiano del piombo ca.

he promised ferdinand and isabella that his discoveries would provide them as much gold as they need.
and as many slaves as they ask thanks to the newly invented printing press news of columbuss pathbreaking voyage spread rapidly across europe.
the spanish monarchs told columbus to prepare for a second voyage instructing him to treat the indians very well and lovingly and abstain from doing them any injury columbus and his men would repeatedly defy this order.
spain worked quickly to secure its legal claim to the new world.
with the help of the s panish born pope alexander vi spain and portugal signed the treaty of tordesillas 1494.
with the stroke of a pen it divided the non christian world giving most of the western hemisphere to spain while africa and what would become brazil were granted to portugal.
in practice this meant that while spain developed its american empire in the sixteenth century portugal would provide it with enslaved african laborers.
the treaty of tordesillas was a remarkable illustration of the catholic worldview and the power of the papacy.
pope alexanders effort to give spain his homeland of less than 7 million people control over virtually the entire western hemisphere reflected his desire to convert all the native peoples to catholicism and to train them in good morals this missionary impulse of the catholic church joined with the quest for gold and silver among the explorers to drive the efforts of columbus and others to lay claim to the as yet unknown boundaries of the new world.
in 1493 columbus returned across the atlantic with seventeen ships and 1 400 men.
also on board were catholic priests eager to convert the native peoples to christianity.
upon his arrival back in hispaniola columbus discovered that the men he had left behind had lost their senses raping women robbing villages and as columbuss son later added committing a thousand excesses for which they were mortally hated by the indians the europeans also carried with them to the americas a range of infectious diseases smallpox measles typhus that would prove disastrous for the indigenous peoples who had no natural immunities to them.
the spaniards found little gold so they loaded their ships with hundreds of enslaved indians to be sold in europe half of whom died during the voyage to spain.
naming america columbus would make two more voyages to the caribbean.
to the end of his life he insisted that he had discovered the outlying parts of asia not a new continent.
by one of historys greatest ironies 24 chapter 1 the collision of cultures this led europeans to name the new world not for columbus but for another italian sailor explorer astronomer amerigo vespucci.
in 1499 with the support of portugals monarchy vespucci sailed across the atlantic landing first at brazil and then sailing along 3 000 miles of the south american coastline in hope of finding a passage to asia.
in the end vespucci reported that south america was so large that it must be a new continent rather than asia.
in 1507 a german mapmaker paid tribute to vespuccis navigational skills by labeling the new world using a variant of his first name america.
professional explorers news of the remarkable voyages of columbus and vespucci raced across europe and stimulated other expeditions to the western hemisphere.
over the next two centuries spain portugal france britain the netherlands and russia dispatched ships and claimed territory in the americas by right of discovery the first explorer to sight the north american continent was john cabot an italian sponsored by king henry vii of england.
his landfall in 1497 at what the king called the new founde lande in p resent day canada gave england the basis for a later claim to all of north america.
during the early sixteenth century however the english grew so preoccupied with internal d ivisions and war with france that they failed to follow up on cabots discoveries.
lusting for gold and sudden riches the spanish still sought a passage from the atlantic to the pacific to reach asia.
in 1505 a spanish ship unloaded pigs and goats in puerto rico intending them to grow and multiply in anticipation of settling a colony there.
puerto rico would be the first european settlement on what would become in 1902 a territory of the united states of america.
in 1519 ferdinand magellan a portuguese sea captain hired by the spanish discovered the strait at the southern tip of south america that now bears his name.
magellan then kept sailing north and west across the pacific ocean making landfall on the island of guam and eventually the philippines where indigenous people killed him.
surviving crew members made their way back to spain arriving in 1522.
their dramatic accounts of the voyage around the world quickened spanish interest in global exploration.
religious conflict in europe at the same time that explorers were crossing the atlantic powerful religious conflicts were tearing europe apart in ways that would greatly influence settlement in the new world.
religious conflict in europe 25 when columbus sailed west in 1492 all of europe acknowledged the thousand year old supremacy of the roman catholic church and its pope in rome.
the brutal efforts of the spanish to convert native peoples to roman catholicism illustrated the murderous intensity with which european christians embraced religious life in the sixteenth century.
spiritual concerns inspired comforted and united them.
people fervently believed in heaven and hell devils and witches demons and angels magic and miracles.
and they were willing to kill and die for their beliefs.
martin luther the enforced unity of catholic europe began to crack in 1517 when martin luther a thirty three year old german priest who taught at the university of wittenburg changed the course of history by launching what became known as the protestant reformation.
luther was a genuine spiritual revolutionary who undermined the authority of the catholic church by showing that many of its officials were corrupt.
he called the pope the greatest thief and robber that has appeared or can appear on earth and denounced the catholic church as the kingdom of sin death and hell luthers beliefs luther especially criticized the sale of indulgences whereby priests would forgive sins in exchange for money or goods.
god alone through christ he insisted offered people salvation people could not earn it through their good deeds or buy it from priests.
salvation in other words resulted from belief.
christ is the only savior.
one does not save oneself as luther exclaimed by faith alone are you saved luther tried to democratize christianity by centering faith on the individual believer rather than in the authority of the church and its priests.
he urged believers to read the bible themselves rather than blindly follow the dictates of catholic priests and the distant pope.
the people he claimed represented a priesthood of all believers perhaps his most revolutionary idea.
to help germans be their own priests luther produced the first bible in a german translation and he reassured christians that god was not an angry judge but a forgiving father.
the catholic reaction lutheranism exploded catholic assumptions and certainties like a bomb.
angry catholic officials lashed out at luthers dangerous doctrines luther fought back with equal fury d eclaring 26 chapter 1 the collision of cultures that he was born to war when pope leo x expelled luther a wild boar from the catholic church in 1521 and sentenced him to death civil war erupted throughout the german principalities.
amid the fighting a powerful german prince protected luther from the churchs wrath.
what had begun as a fierce religious drama now became a political reformation too.
luther was no longer simply an outspoken priest he was a spiritual revolutionary a folk hero and a political prophet encouraging german princes and dukes to separate themselves from the italian papacy.
the wars of the reformation were especially brutal conflicts involving tortures and burnings of believers from both sides of the religious divide.
a settlement between warring lutherans and catholics did not come until 1555 when each prince was allowed by the treaty of augsburg to determine the religion of his subjects.
john calvin soon after martin luther began his revolt against the shortcomings of catholicism swiss protestants also challenged papal authority.
they were led by john calvin 1509 1564 a brilliant french scholar who had fled catholic france to more tolerant geneva and brought the swiss city under the sway of his powerful beliefs.
calvinism in his great theological work the institutes of the christian religion 1536 calvin set forth a stern doctrine.
all christians he taught were damned by adams original sin but christs sacrifice on the cross made possible the redemption of those whom god elected to be saved and thus had predestined to salvation from the beginning of time.
intoxicated by godliness calvin insisted that a true christian life practiced strict morality and hard work.
moreover he taught that god valued every form of work however lowly it might be.
calvin also permitted church members a share in the governance through a body of elders and ministers called the presbytery.
calvins doctrines formed the basis for the german reformed church the dutch reformed church the presbyterians in scotland some of the puritans in england and eventually in america and the huguenots in france.
calvins impact through these and other protestant groups john calvin exerted a greater influence upon religious belief and practice in the english colonies than did any other leader of the reformation.
his insistence on the freedom of individual believers as well as his recognition that monarchs and political officials were sinful like everyone else helped contribute religious conflict in europe 27 to the evolving ideas of representative democracy whereby the people elected their rulers and of the importance of separating church power from state governmental power.
the protestant revolution even though the catholic church launched an aggressive c ounter reformation the protestant revolt continued to spread rapidly during the sixteenth century.
most of northern germany along with scandinavia became lutheran the areas that did so often called themselves the protesting estates from which came the label protestants the reformation thus formed in part a theological dispute in part a political movement and in part a catalyst for social change civil strife and imperial warfare.
throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries catholics and protestants persecuted imprisoned tortured and killed each other in large numbers in europe and in the americas.
every major international conflict involved to some extent a religious holy war between catholic and protestant nations.
equally important the protestant worldview with its emphasis on the freedom of the individual conscience and personal bible reading would play a major role in the colonization of america.
the reformation in england in england the reformation followed a unique course blending aspects of protestantism with catholicism.
the church of england or the anglican church emerged through a gradual process of integrating calvinism with english catholicism.
in early modern england the church and government were united and mutually supportive.
the monarchy required people to attend religious services and to pay taxes to support the church.
the english rulers also supervised the church officials two archbishops twenty six bishops and thousands of parish clergy.
the royal rulers often instructed religious leaders to preach sermons in support of particular government policies.
as one english king explained people are governed by the pulpit more than the sword in time of peace king henry viii purely political reasons initially led to the rejection of papal authority in england.
brilliant and energetic henry viii ruled between 1509 and 1547.
the second monarch of the tudor dynasty he had won from the pope the title defender of the faith for refuting martin luthers rebellious ideas.
henrys marriage to catherine of aragon his brothers widow had produced no male heir however and for him to marry again required that 28 chapter 1 the collision of cultures he convince the pope to annul or cancel his marriage.
catherine however was the aunt of charles v king of spain and ruler of the holy roman empire whose support was vital to the church in rome.
the pope refused to grant an annulment.
henry angrily responded by severing englands nearly 900 year old connection with the catholic church.
he then named a new archbishop of canterbury who granted the annulment thus freeing henry to marry his mistress the lively anne boleyn.
in one of historys greatest ironies anne boleyn gave birth not to the male heir that henry demanded but to a remarkable daughter named elizabeth.
the disappointed king took vengeance on his wife.
he accused her of adultery ordered her beheaded and declared the infant elizabeth a bastard.
yet elizabeth received a first rate education and grew up to be quick witted and nimble cunning and courageous.
the reign of elizabeth after the bloody reigns of her protestant half brother edward vi and her catholic half sister mary i she ascended the throne in 1558 at the age of twenty five.
over the next forty five years elizabeth proved to be the greatest female ruler in history.
her long reign over the troubled island kingdom was punctuated by frequent political turmoil religious strife between protestants and catholics economic crises and foreign wars.
yet queen elizabeth came to rule confidently over englands golden age.
born into a traditionally mans world and given a traditionally mans role elizabeth could not be a catholic for her birth was illegitimate.
during her long reign from 1558 to 1603 therefore the church of england became protestant but in its own way.
the anglican organizational structure centered on bishops and archbishops remained much the same as the roman catholic church but the church service changed the clergy were permitted to marry and the popes authority was no longer recognized.
the spanish empire during the sixteenth century spain was creating the worlds most powerful empire at the same time it was trying to repress the protestant reformation.
at its height spain controlled much of europe most of the americas parts of africa and various trading outposts in asia.
but it was the gold and silver looted from the americas that fueled spains golden empire by plundering conquering and colonizing the americas the spanish empire 29 and converting and enslaving its inhabitants the spanish planted christianity in the western hemisphere and gained the resources to rule the world.
spain in the caribbean the caribbean sea served as the gateway through which spanish power entered the americas.
after establishing colonies on hispaniola including santo domingo which became the capital of the west indies the spanish proceeded eastward to puerto rico 1508 and westward to cuba 1511 1514.
their motives as one soldier explained were to serve god and the king and also to get rich bartolom de las casas 1474 1566 a catholic priest whose father sailed with columbus described the native cubans as generally peaceful people who lived in large communal wood buildings roofed with palm fronds.
marriage laws he explained are non existent men and women alike choose their mates and leave them as they please without offense jealousy or anger native cubans wore colorful feathers on their heads fashioned bead necklaces from fish bones and shells and put no value on gold and other precious things they lived lives of simple sufficiency relying solely on nature for their basic needs.
las casas noted with regret that the spaniards committed irreparable crimes against the indians soldiers thought nothing of knifing indians by tens and twenties and of cutting off slices of them to test the sharpness of their blades cuban men were forced to work f ull time in the mountains digging for gold while their wives stayed behind to tend vast fields of cassava a starchy root vegetable known as the bread of the tropics within a few years after the arrival of europeans most of the indians throughout the caribbean had died.
disunity e verywhere civil disorder rebellion and tribal warfare left them vulnerable to foreign conquest.
attacks by w ell armed soldiers and deadly germs from europe overwhelmed entire indian societies.
a clash of cultures the often violent relationship between the spanish and indians involved more than a clash between different peoples.
it also involved contrasting forms of technological development.
the indians of mexico used wooden canoes for transportation while the europeans crossed the ocean in heavily armed sailing vessels.
the spanish with their steel swords firearms explosives and armor terrified most indians whose arrows and tomahawks were seldom a match for guns cannons and warhorses.
a spanish priest in florida observed 30 chapter 1 the collision of cultures that gunpowder frightens the most valiant and courageous indian and renders him slave to the white mans command the europeans enjoyed other cultural advantages.
before their arrival for example the only domesticated four legged animals in north america were dogs and llamas.
the spanish brought with them strange beasts horses pigs sheep and cattle.
horses provided greater speed in battle and gave the spanish a decided psychological advantage.
the most essential thing in new lands is horses reported one spanish soldier.
they instill the greatest fear in the enemy and make the indians respect the leaders of the army even more feared among the indians were the fighting dogs that the spanish used to guard their camps.
cortss conquest the most dramatic european conquest on the north american mainland occurred in mexico.
on february 18 1519 thirty four year old hernn corts driven by dreams of gold and glory set sail for mexico from cuba.
his fleet of eleven ships carried nearly 600 soldiers and sailors.
also on board were 200 indigenous cubans sixteen horses and cannons.
after the invaders landed on the coast of the gulf of mexico corts convinced the totomacs a society conquered by the mexica to join his assault against the dominant mexica their hated rivals.
to prevent any of his heavily armed and helmeted soldiers called conquistadores conquerors from retreating or deserting corts had the ships dismantled.
conquistadores were then widely recognized as the best soldiers in the world loyal to the monarchy and the catholic church.
they received no pay they were pitiless professional warriors willing to risk their lives for a share in the expected plunder.
one conquistador explained that he went to america to serve god and his majesty to give light to those who were in darkness and to grow rich as men desire to do with his small army cannons horses and indian allies corts brashly set out to conquer the sprawling mexica aztec empire which extended from central mexico to what is today guatemala.
the nearly 200 mile march of cortss army through the mountains to the magnificent mexica capital of tenochtitln modern mexico city took nearly three months.
along the way corts used treachery and terror to intimidate and then recruit the native peoples most of whom had been conquered earlier by the mexica.
after entering the city of cholula home to the largest pyramid in the americas as well as 40 000 people corts learned of a plot to ambush his army.
he turned the tables on his hosts by inviting the local chieftains and nobles to the citys ceremonial plaza to talk and exchange gifts.
when they the spanish empire 31 arrived however the spanish and their indian allies the tlaxcalans killed the leaders as well as thousands of other cholulans.
spanish invaders as corts and his invading army continued their march across mexico they heard fabulous accounts of the carefully planned mexica city of tenochtitln.
with some 200 000 inhabitants it was larger than most european cities.
graced by wide canals and bridges stunning gardens and formidable stone pyramids the l ake encircled city and its stone buildings seemed impregnable.
one of the spanish conquistadores described their first glimpse of the great capital city gazing on such wonderful sights we did not know what to say or whether what appeared before us was real for on the one hand there were great cities and in the lake ever so many more and the lake itself was crowded with canoes and in the causeway were many bridges at intervals and in front of us stood the great city of mexico and we we did not number even four hundred soldiers yet the vastly outnumbered spanish made the most of their assets their fighting experience superior weapons numerous indian allies and an aggressive sense of religious and racial superiority.
through a combination of threats and deceptions the invaders entered tenochtitln peacefully and captured the corts in mexico page from the lienzo de tlaxcala a historical narrative from the sixteenth century.
the scene in which corts is shown seated on a throne depicts the arrival of the spanish in tlaxcala.
32 chapter 1 the collision of cultures emperor montezuma ii.
corts explained to the emperor why the invasion was necessary we spaniards have a disease of the heart that only gold can cure montezuma submitted in part because he mistook corts for a god.
after taking the mexicas gold and silver sending 20 percent of it to the spanish king referred to as the royal fifth and dividing the rest among themselves the spanish forced the native mexicans to mine more of the precious metals.
then in the spring of 1520 disgruntled mexica decided that montezuma was a traitor.
they rebelled stoned him to death and armed only with swords and wicker shields they attacked the conquistadores.
forced to retreat the spaniards lost about a third of their men.
the spaniards 20 000 indian allies remained loyal however and cortss forces gradually regrouped.
they surrounded the imperial city the most beautiful city in the world said corts for eighty five days cutting off its access to water and food and allowing a highly infectious smallpox epidemic to devastate the inhabitants.
bernal diaz del castillo a spanish soldier recalled that god saw fit to send the indians small pox one of the mexica reported that the smallpox spread over the people as great destruction.
some it covered on all parts their faces their heads their breasts and so on.
there was great havoc.
very many died of it.
they could not move they could not stir for three months the mexica bravely defended their capital.
then the siege came to a bloody end.
the ravages of smallpox and the support of thousands of a nti aztec indians help explain how such a small force of determined spaniards was able to vanquish a proud nation of nearly 1 million people.
after the aztecs surrendered a merciless corts ordered the leaders hanged and the priests devoured by dogs.
he reported that in the end 117 000 aztecs were killed.
in two years corts and his disciplined army and indian allies had conquered a fabled empire that had taken centuries to develop.
corts became the first governor of new spain and began replacing the mexica leaders with spanish bureaucrats and church officials.
the spanish conquest of mexico established the model for waves of plundering conquistadores to follow.
within twenty years spain had established a vast empire in the new world.
in 1531 francisco pizarro led a band of conquistadores down the pacific coast of south america from panama toward peru where they brutally subdued the huge inca empire.
the spanish invaders seized inca palaces took royal women as mistresses and wives and looted the empire of its gold and the spanish empire 33 spanish explorations of the mainland r iv e o ohi america de s santa fe oto atlantic st augustine rio ocean a gr gul f of m e x i co ne s cort w aztecs tenochtitln veracruz mayas caribbean hispaniola s pa de le n cuba in puerto rico santo domingo sea ocean 500 miles piz ar r pacific on ce p nd e r.

from peru spain extended its control southward through chile by about 1553 and north to present day colombia by 1538 spanish explorers throughout the sixteenth century the spanish expanded their control over much of north america bullying and brutalizing looting and destroying the native peoples then forcing them to work the mines and plantations in return for learning the spanish language and embracing the catholic religion.
34 chapter 1 the collision of cultures juan ponce de len then governor of puerto rico made the e arliest known exploration of what the spanish called la florida the land of flowers in 1513.
meanwhile other spanish explorers skirted the coast of the gulf of mexico scouted the atlantic coast all the way north to canada and established a short lived colony on the carolina coast.
sixteenth century knowledge of the north american interior came mostly from would be conquistadores who plundered the region.
the first pnfilo de narvez landed in 1528 at tampa bay marched northward to alabama and then returned to the gulf coast where he and his crew built crude boats out of animal hides and headed for mexico.
high winds and heavy seas however wrecked the vessels on the texas coast.
some of the survivors worked their way overland.
after eight years including periods of captivity among the indians they wandered into a spanish outpost in mexico.
in 1539 hernando de soto a conquistador who had helped conquer the incas in peru set out to explore florida.
with 600 soldiers a pair of women and a few priests as well as horses mules pigs and fighting dogs he landed on floridas west coast.
de soto and his party traveled north as far as western north carolina and then moved westward becoming the first europeans to see the mississippi river.
along the way they looted and destroyed native american villages and took enslaved indians with them in chains and iron collars.
de soto tried to impress the indians by claiming to be a son of the sun in the spring of 1542 having wandered america for three years de soto died near natchez mississippi.
the next year the survivors among his party floated down the mississippi river and 311 of the original adventurers found their way to spanish mexico.
they left behind them a trail of infectious diseases which continued to ravage the indians for years thereafter.
in 1540 francisco vzquez de coronado led an expedition of 1 500 spaniards and indian allies 1 000 horses 500 cattle and 5 000 sheep northward into new mexico and northeast as far as present day kansas.
new spain the spanish established provinces in north america not so much as commercial enterprises but as protective buffers to defend their empire in mexico and south america.
they were concerned about french traders infiltrating from louisiana english settlers crossing into florida and russian seal hunters wandering down the california coast.
as the sixteenth century unfolded the spanish shifted from looting the native peoples to enslaving them.
to reward the crusading conquistadores the spanish empire 35 spain transferred to america a medieval socioeconomic system known as the encomienda whereby favored army officers were given huge parcels of land.
they were to provide the indians with protection in exchange for tribute goods and labor tending farms or mining for gold and silver.
new spain therefore developed a society of extremes wealthy encomenderos and powerful priests at one end of the spectrum and indians held in poverty at the other.
the spaniards used brute force to ensure that indians accepted their new role as serfs.
nuo de guzman a conquistador who became the governor of a mexican province loved to watch his massive fighting dog tear apart rebellious indians.
after a spaniard talked back to him he had the man nailed to a post by his tongue.
a catholic empire the spanish and later the french launched a massive effort to convert the indians deeming them heathens into catholic servants.
during the sixteenth century hundreds of priests fanned out across new spain and later new france.
many of the catholic missionaries decided that the indians of mexico could be converted only by force.
though they seem to be a simple people a spanish priest declared in 1562 they are up to all sorts of mischief and missionaries in the new world a spanish mission in new mexico established to spread the catholic faith among the indigenous peoples.
36 chapter 1 the collision of cultures are obstinately attached to the rituals and ceremonies of their forefathers.
the whole land is certainly damned and without compulsion they will never speak the religious truth by the end of the sixteenth century there were more than 300 monasteries or missions in new spain and catholicism had become a major instrument of spanish imperialism.
some spanish officials criticized the forced conversion of indians and the encomienda system.
in 1514 the catholic priest bartolom de las casas resolved to spend the rest of his life aiding the indians.
he gave away his land in hispaniola freed his slaves and began urging the spanish to change their approach everything done to the indians thus far he claimed was unjust and tyrannical las casas spent the next fifty years advocating better treatment for indigenous people.
he was officially named protector of the indians las casas insisted that the indians be converted to catholicism only through peaceful and reasonable means.
his courageous efforts aroused furious opposition however.
most colonizers believed as a spanish bishop in mexico declared in 1585 that the indians must be ruled governed and guided to christianity by fear more than by love a leading spanish scholar juan gins de seplveda directly challenged las casass cry for justice.
indians he claimed are as inferior as children are to adults as women are to men as different from spaniards as cruel people are from mild people over time however las casas convinced the monarchy and the catholic church to issue new rules calling for better treatment of the indians in new spain.
at las casass urging pope paul iii declared that indians were human beings deserving of respect and christian salvation.
still the use of fire and the sword continued and angry colonists on hispaniola banished las casas.
on returning to spain las casas said i left christ in the indies not once but a thousand times beaten afflicted insulted and crucified by those spaniards who destroy and ravage the indians in 1564 two years before his death he bleakly predicted that god will wreak his fury and anger against spain some day for the unjust wars waged against the indians the columbian exchange the first european contacts with the western hemisphere began the columbian exchange also called the great biological exchange a worldwide transfer of plants animals and diseases that ultimately worked in favor of the europeans at the expense of the indigenous peoples.
the columbian exchange 37 the plants and animals of the two worlds differed more than the peoples and their ways of life.
europeans had never encountered iguanas bison cougars armadillos opossums sloths tapirs anacondas condors or hummingbirds.
nor had the native americans seen horses cattle pigs sheep goats chickens and rats which soon flooded the americas.
the exchange of plants and foods the exchange of plant life between the western hemisphere and europe africa transformed the diets of both regions.
before columbuss voyage three foods were unknown in europe maize corn potatoes sweet and white and many kinds of beans snap kidney lima and others.
the white potato although commonly called irish is actually native to south america.
explorers brought it back to europe where it thrived.
other western hemisphere food plants included peanuts squash peppers tomatoes pumpkins pineapples sassafras papayas guavas avocados cacao the source of chocolate and chicle for chewing gum.
europeans in turn introduced rice wheat barley oats wine grapes melons coffee olives bananas kentucky bluegrass daisies and dandelions to the americas.
in this biological exchange the food plants were more complementary than competitive.
corn flourished almost anywhere.
the new food crops transferred from the americas helped spur a dramatic increase in the european population that in turn helped provide the restless adventurous young people who would colonize the new world.
an exchange of diseases the most significant aspect of the biological exchange however was not food crops but the transmission of infectious diseases.
during the three centuries after columbuss first voyage europeans and enslaved africans brought with them deadly diseases that native americans had never encountered smallpox typhus diphtheria bubonic plague malaria yellow fever and cholera.
the results were catastrophic.
far more i ndians tens of m illions died from infections than from combat.
smallpox was an especially ghastly killer.
in central mexico alone some 8 million people perhaps a third of the entire indian population died of smallpox within a decade of the arrival of the spanish.
a spanish explorer noted that half the indians died from smallpox and blamed us often there were not enough survivors to bury the dead europeans arrived at villages to discover only rotting corpses strewn everywhere.
unable to explain or cure the diseases native american chieftains and religious leaders often lost their stature and their lives as they were 38 chapter 1 the collision of cultures smallpox aztec victims of the 1538 smallpox epidemic are covered in shrouds center as two others lie dying at right.
usually the first to meet the spanish and thus were the first infected.
as a consequence of losing their leaders the indigenous peoples were less capable of resisting the european invaders.
many europeans however interpreted such epidemics as diseases sent by god to punish those who resisted conversion to christianity.
the spanish in north america throughout the sixteenth century no european power other than spain held more than a brief foothold in what would become the united states.
by the time the english established jamestown in virginia in 1607 the spanish had the spanish in north america 39 already explored the smoky mountains and the great plains and established colonies in the southwest and florida.
spain had the advantage not only of having arrived first but also of having stumbled onto those regions that would produce the quickest profits.
while france and england were preoccupied with political disputes and religious conflicts spain had forged an intense national unity that enabled it to dominate europe as well as the new world.
st augustine the first spanish outpost in the continental united states emerged in response to the french.
in the 1560s spirited french protestants called huguenots established frances first american colonies one on the coast of what became south carolina and the other in florida.
they did not last long.
in 1565 the spanish founded st augustine on the atlantic coast of florida.
it became the first european town in the present day united states.
it included a fort church hospital fish market and more than 100 shops and houses all built decades before the first english settlements in america.
in september 1565 spanish soldiers from st augustine assaulted fort caroline the french huguenot colony in northeastern florida and hanged all the men over age fifteen.
the spanish commander notified his catholic king that he had killed all the french he had found in fort caroline because.
they were scattering the odious lutheran doctrine in these provinces later when survivors from a shipwrecked french fleet washed ashore on florida beaches after a hurricane the spanish commander told them they must abandon protestantism and swear their allegiance to catholicism.
when they refused he killed 245 of them.
the spanish southwest the spanish eventually established other permanent settlements in what are now new mexico texas and california.
from the outset in sharp contrast to the later english experience the spanish settlements were sparsely populated inadequately supplied and dreadfully poor.
these northernmost regions of new spain were so far from the capital in mexico city that they were regularly neglected.
the spanish colonies in america were extensions of the monarchys absolute power.
democratic ideals and notions of equal treatment were nonexistent people were expected to follow orders.
there was no freedom of speech 40 chapter 1 the collision of cultures or religion or movement no local elections no real self government.
the military officers bureaucrats wealthy landowners and priests appointed by the king to govern new spain regulated every detail of colonial life.
settlers could not travel within the colonies without official permission.
new mexico the land that would later be called new mexico was the first center of catholic missionary activity in the american southwest.
in 1595 juan de oate the rich son of a spanish mining family in mexico whose wife was a descendant of both corts and montezuma ii received a land grant for rande el norte the mostly desert territory north of mexico above the rio g texas new mexico arizona california and parts of colorado.
over the next three years he recruited an army of colonists willing to move north with him soldier settlers and hundreds of mexican indians and mestizos the offspring of spanish and indigenous parents.
in 1598 the caravan of colonists including women children and 7 000 cattle horses goats and sheep began moving north from the mountains above mexico city across the harsh desert landscape of parched mesas plateaus and canyons enlivened by lush river valleys.
what a lonely land one of the footsore travelers wrote to relatives in mexico city.
upon crossing the rio grande at what became el paso texas oate claimed the entire region for the spanish monarchy.
indians who resisted were killed.
a priest recorded that oate had butchered many indians human blood has been shed and he has committed thefts sackings and other atrocities after walking more than 800 miles in seven months along ancient indian footpaths that the spanish settlers called the camino real royal road they established the colony of new mexico the farthest outpost of new spain.
the spanish called the local indians pueblos a spanish word meaning village for the city like aspect of their terraced multistoried buildings sometimes chiseled into the walls of cliffs.
they also dug out underground chambers called kivas where they held religious ceremonies and stored sacred objects such as prayer sticks and feathered masks.
the pueblos mostly hopis and zunis were farmers who used irrigation to water their crops.
they were also skilled at making clay pottery and woven baskets.
some of the native americans wore buffalo skins most wore decorative cotton blankets.
their corn and vegetables oate reported are the best and largest to be found anywhere in the world most of their customs resembled those practiced by the mexicans.
their government he noted is one of complete freedom for although they have chieftains they obey them badly and in few matters the spanish in north america 41 unlike the later english colonists in america the spanish officials did not view native americans as racially inferior.
instead they believed that the indians were burdened by culturally inferior ways of life.
the spanish government never intended to establish large colonies of spanish immigrants in america.
the goal of spanish colonialism was to force the native americans to adopt the spanish way of life from catholicism to modes of dress speech work and conduct.
oate new mexicos first governor told the pueblos that if they embraced catholicism and followed his orders they would receive an eternal life of great bliss instead of cruel and everlasting torment oate soon discovered that there cultural conflict this peruvian was no gold or silver in new mexico.

traveling for months from mexico city.
so eventually oate established a system that forced the indians to pay annual tributes taxes to the spanish authorities in the form of a yard of cloth and a bushel of corn each year.
catholic missions once it became evident that new mexico had little gold the spanish focused their attention on religious conversion.
priests established catholic missions where indians were forced to work the fields they had once owned and perform personal tasks for the priests and soldiers cooking cleaning and even providing sexual favors.
soldiers and priests used whips to herd the indians to church services and to punish them for not working hard enough.
a french visitor to a mission reported that it reminded us of a.
west indian slave colony after about ten years a mission would be secularized stripped of its religious role.
its lands would be divided among the converted indians the 42 chapter 1 the collision of cultures mission chapel would become a parish church and the inhabitants would be given full spanish citizenship including the privilege of paying taxes.
the soldiers who were sent to protect the missions were housed in presidios or forts their families and the merchants accompanying them lived in adjacent villages.
some indian peoples welcomed the spanish missionaries as powerful witches capable of easing their burdens.
others tried to use the european invaders as allies against rival indian groups.
still others rebelled.
before the end of new mexicos first year in december 1598 the acoma pueblos revolted killing eleven soldiers.
oates response to the rebellion was brutal.
over three days spanish soldiers destroyed the entire pueblo killing 500 pueblo men and 300 women and children.
survivors were enslaved.
twenty four pueblo men had one foot cut off to frighten others and keep them from escaping or resisting.
children were taken from their parents into a catholic mission where oate remarked they may attain the knowledge of god and the salvation of their souls the mestizo factor spanish women were prohibited from traveling to the new world unless they were married and accompanied by a husband.
this policy had unexpected c onsequences.
there were so few spanish women in north america that soldiers and settlers often married native americans or otherwise fathered mestizos.
by the eighteenth century mestizos were a majority in mexico and new mexico.
such widespread intermarriage and interbreeding led the spanish to adopt a more inclusive social outlook toward the indians than the english later did in their colonies along the atlantic coast.
once most colonial officials were mestizo themselves they were less likely to belittle the indians.
at the same time many native americans falsely claimed to be mestizo as a means of improving their status and avoiding having to pay annual tribute.
the pueblo revolt the spanish presence in new mexico expanded slowly.
in 1608 the government decided to turn new mexico into a royal province and moved its capital to santa fe holy faith in spanish the first permanent seat of government in the present day united states.
by 1630 there were fifty catholic churches and monasteries in new mexico as well as some 3 000 spaniards.
roman catholic missionaries in new mexico claimed that 86 000 pueblos had been converted to christianity during the seventeenth century.
in fact however resentment among the indians had increased as the spanish stripped them of their ancestral ways of life.
in 1680 a charismatic indian the spanish in north america 43 spiritual leader named pop meaning ripe plantings organized a massive rebellion.
the spanish claimed that he had cast a magical spell over his people making them crazy the indians painted for war burned catholic churches tortured mutilated and executed priests destroyed all relics of christianity and forced the 2 400 survivors to flee the region in humiliation eventually making their way to el paso.
the entire province of new mexico was again in indian hands.
the spanish governor reported that the pueblos are very happy without religion or spaniards the pueblo revolt of 1680 was the greatest defeat that indians ever inflicted on european efforts to conquer the new world.
it took twelve years and four military assaults for the spanish to reestablish control over new mexico.
horses and the great plains another major consequence of the pueblo revolt was the opportunity it gave indian rebels to gain possession of thousands of spanish horses spanish authorities had made it illegal for indians to ride or own horses.
stealing horses became one of the most honored ways for warriors to prove their courage.
horses and indian culture the pueblos established a thriving horse trade with the navajos apaches and others.
by 1690 horses were in texas.
they soon spread across the great plains the vast rolling grasslands extending from the missouri valley in the east to the base of the rocky mountains in the west.
prior to the arrival of european horses indians hunted on foot and used dogs as their beasts of burden.
dogs are carnivores however and it was always difficult to find enough meat to feed them.
the introduction of the horse changed everything.
horses provided the plains indians with a new source of mobility and power.
the vast grasslands of the great plains were the perfect environment for horses since the prairies offered plenty of forage for grazing animals.
horses could also haul up to seven times as much weight as dogs and their speed and endurance made the indigenous people much more effective hunters and warriors.
on the great plains an indian familys status reflected the number of horses it owned.
by the late seventeenth century native american horsemen were fighting the spaniards on more equal terms.
this helps explain why the indians of the southwest and texas unlike the indians in mexico were able to sustain their 44 chapter 1 the collision of cultures plains indians the horse stealing raid depicted in this hide painting demonstrates the essential role horses played in plains life.
cultures for the next 300 years on horseback they were among the most fearsome fighters in the world.
bison hunting horses transformed the economy and ecology of the great plains.
the arapaho cheyenne comanche kiowa and sioux reinvented themselves as horse centered cultures.
they left their traditional woodland villages on the fringes of the plains and became nomadic bison buffalo hunters.
a male bison could weigh over a ton and stand five feet tall at the shoulder.
indians used virtually every part of the bison they killed meat for food hides for clothing shoes bedding and shelter muscles and tendons for thread and bowstrings intestines for containers bones for tools horns for eating utensils hair for headdresses and dung for fuel.
they used tongues for hair brushes and tails for fly swatters.
one scholar has referred to the bison as the tribal department store the spanish in north america 45 the night after a successful hunt the indians would stage a festival feast with singing and dancing throughout the night.
to preserve meat for later it would be cut into long strips and hung over wooden racks to dry in the sun or over a fire.
the dried meat was called jerky.
tougher cuts of buffalo meat would be pounded with a mallet and mixed with fat and berries to make pemmican.
horses eased some of the physical burdens on women but also imposed new demands.
women and girls tended to the horses butchered and dried the bison meat and tanned the hides.
as the value of the bison hides grew indian hunters began practicing polygamy primarily for economic reasons more wives could process more bison carcasses.
the rising value of wives eventually led plains indians to raid other tribes in search of captive brides.
the introduction of horses into the great plains was a mixed blessing.
the horse brought prosperity and mobility to the plains indians but also triggered more conflict among them.
over time the indians on horseback eventually killed more bison than the herds could replace.
further horses competed with the bison for food often depleting the prairie grass.
and as indians on horses traveled greater distances and encountered more people infectious diseases spread more widely.
still by 1800 a white trader in texas would observe that this is a delightful country and were it not for perpetual wars the natives might be the happiest people on earth hispanic america spanish culture etched a lasting imprint upon american ways of life.
spains colonial presence in the americas lasted more than three centuries much longer than either englands or frances.
new spain was centered in mexico but its borders extended from florida to alaska.
hispanic place names san francisco los angeles tucson santa fe san antonio and st augustine survive to this day as do hispanic influences in art architecture literature music law and cuisine.
the spanish encounters with indians and their diverse cultures produced a two way exchange by which the contrasting societies blended coexisted and interacted.
even when locked in mortal conflict and driven by hostility and mutual suspicion the two cultures necessarily affected each other.
in other words new spain while savaged by violence coercion and intolerance eventually produced a mutual accommodation with native americans that enabled two living traditions to persist side by side.
the spanish introduced cattle horses sheep and goats to texas new mexico and california as well as such words as rodeo bronco and ranch rancho and the names of four states california colorado florida and nevada.
46 chapter 1 the collision of cultures challenges to the spanish empire catholic spains successful conquests in the western hemisphere spurred portugal france england and the netherlands holland to begin their own exploration and exploitation of the new world.
the french were the first to pose a serious threat.
spanish treasure ships sailing home from mexico peru and the caribbean offered tempting targets for french pirates.
in 1524 the french king sent italian giovanni da verrazano westward across the atlantic.
upon sighting land probably at cape fear north carolina verrazano ranged along the coast as far north as maine.
on a second voyage in 1528 he was killed by carib indians.
new france unlike the verrazano voyages those of jacques cartier beginning in the next decade led to the first french effort at colonization in north america.
during three voyages cartier explored the gulf of st lawrence and ventured up the st lawrence river now the boundary between canada and new york.
twice he got as far as present day montreal and twice he wintered at the site of quebec near which a short lived french colony appeared in 1541 1542.
france after midcentury however plunged into religious civil wars and the colonization of canada had to await the coming of samuel de champlain the father of new france after 1600.
champlain would lead twenty seven expeditions from france to canada during a thirty seven year period.
the dutch revolt from the m id 1500s greater threats to spanish power in the new world arose from the dutch and the english.
in 1566 the netherlands included seventeen provinces.
the fragmented nation had passed by inheritance to the spanish king in 1555 but the dutch spurned catholicism and had become largely protestant mostly calvinists making up what was called the dutch reformed church.
during the second half of the sixteenth century the dutch began a series of sporadic rebellions against spanish catholic rule.
a long bloody struggle for political independence and religious freedom ensued in which protestant england aided the dutch.
the dutch revolt as much a civil war as a war for national independence was not a single cohesive event but rather a series of different uprisings in different provinces at different times.
each province had its own institutions laws and rights.
although seven provinces joined together to form the dutch republic the spanish did not officially recognize the independence of the entire netherlands until 1648.

26593 01map 06 first proof why was the defeat of the spanish armada important to the history of english exploration.
what was the significance of the voyages of gilbert and raleigh.
the defeat of the armada almost from the beginning of the protestant revolt in the netherlands the dutch captured spanish treasure ships in the atlantic and carried on illegal trade with spains colonies.
while englands strong skillful queen elizabeth steered a tortuous course to avoid open war with spain she encouraged both dutch and english privateers to attack spanish ships and their colonies in america.
48 chapter 1 the collision of cultures the english raids on spanish ships continued for some twenty years before open war erupted between the two nations.
determined to conquer england philip ii the king of spain who was queen elizabeths brother in law and fiercest opponent assembled the massive spanish armada 132 warships 8 000 sailors and 18 000 soldiers.
it was the greatest invasion fleet in history.
on may 28 1588 the armada began sailing for england.
the english navy was waiting for them.
as the two fleets positioned themselves for the battle queen elizabeth donned a silver breastplate and told the english forces i know i have the body of a weak and feeble woman but i have the heart and stomach of a king and a king of england too as the battle unfolded the heavy spanish galleons could not compete with the speed and agility of the english warships.
the english fleet chased the spanish ships through the english channel.
caught up in a powerful protestant wind from the south the spanish fleet was swept into the north sea.
the decimated armada limped home finally scattering wreckage on the shores of scotland and ireland.
the stunning defeat of spains fearsome armada greatly strengthened the protestant cause across europe.
the ferocious storm that smashed the spanish ships seemed to be a sign that god favored the english.
queen elizabeth commissioned a special medallion to commemorate the successful defense of england.
the citation read god blew and they were dispersed spains king philip seemed to agree.
upon learning of the catastrophic defeat he sighed i sent the armada against men not gods winds and waves the defeat of the spanish armada confirmed englands naval supremacy cleared the way for its colonization of america and established queen elizabeths stature as a great ruler.
although she had many suitors eager to marry her she refused to divide her power.
she would have but one mistress england and no master eager to live and die a virgin she married herself to the fate of england.
by the end of the sixteenth century elizabethan england had begun an epic transformation from a poor humiliated and isolated nation into a mighty global empire.
english exploration of america english efforts to colonize america began a few years before the great battle with the spanish armada.
they were driven by a desire to weaken spains control over the americas.
in 1578 queen elizabeth had given sir humphrey gilbert permission to establish a colony in the remote heathen and barbarous lands of america.
english exploration of america 49 gilberts group set out in 1583 intending to settle near narragansett bay in present day rhode island.
they instead landed in fogbound newfoundland canada.
with winter approaching and his largest vessels lost gilbert and the colonists returned home.
while in transit however his ship vanished and he was never seen again.
the next year queen elizabeth asked sir walter raleigh gilberts much younger half brother to organize a colonizing mission.
raleighs expedition discovered the outer banks of north carolina and landed at roanoke island.
one of the colonists reported that the soile is the most plentifull sweete fruitfull and wholesome of all the worlde in fact however the sandy soil of the outer banks was not good for farming.
raleigh named the area virginia in honor of childless queen elizabeth the presumably virgin queen as she once described herself.
after several false starts raleigh in 1587 sponsored another expedition of about 100 colonists including 26 women and children led by governor john white.
white spent a month on roanoke island and then returned to england for supplies leaving behind his daughter elinor and his granddaughter virginia dare the first english child born in the new world.
the english in virginia the arrival of english explorers on the outer banks with roanoke island at left.
50 chapter 1 the collision of cultures whites journey back to virginia was delayed because of the naval war with spain.
when he finally returned in 1590 the roanoke outpost had been abandoned and pillaged much of it having been burned by a lightning ignited fire.
the rude cabins had been dismantled and removed suggesting that the colonists had left intentionally.
on a post at the entrance to the village someone had carved the word croatoan leading white to conclude that the settlers had set out for the island of that name some 50 miles south where friendly indians lived.
the lost colonists were never found.
they may have been killed by indians or spaniards.
the most recent evidence indicates that the lost colony suffered from a horrible drought that prevented the colonists from growing enough food to survive.
while some may have gone south the main body of colonists appears to have gone north to the southern shores of chesapeake bay as they had talked of doing and lived there for some years until they were killed by local indians.
there were no english colonists in north america when queen elizabeth died in 1603.
the spanish controlled the only colonial outposts on the continent.
but that was about to change.
inspired by the success of the spanish in exploiting the new world and emboldened by their defeat of the spanish armada in 1588 the english as well as the french and the dutch would soon develop american colonial empires of their own.
new spain in decline during the one and a half centuries after 1492 the spanish developed the most extensive rich and envied empire the world had ever known.
it spanned southern europe and the netherlands much of the western hemisphere and parts of asia.
the monarchy financed its imperial ambitions with riches looted from the americas.
between 1545 and 1660 the spanish forced native americans and africans to mine 7 million pounds of silver in the new world twice as much silver as existed in all of europe in 1492.
the massive amounts of silver and gold from the new world led spanish kings to mobilize huge armies and the naval armada in an effort to conquer all of protestant europe.
yet the spanish rulers overreached themselves.
the widespread religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries killed millions created intense anti spanish feelings among the english and the dutch and eventually helped bankrupt the spanish government.
at the same time the spanish empire grew so vast that its sprawling size and complexity eventually led to its disintegration.
during the sixteenth century new spain gradually developed into a settled society with the same rigid class structure of the home country.
from the english exploration of america 51 outset the spanish in the americas behaved more like occupying rulers than permanent settlers carefully regulating every detail of colonial administration and life.
new spain was an extractive empire less interested in creating self sustaining colonial communities than in taking gold silver and copper while enslaving the indigenous peoples and converting them to christianity.
spain never encouraged vast numbers of settlers to populate new spain and with few exceptions those who did travel to the new world rarely wanted to make a living off the land they instead wanted to live off the labor of the native population.
for three centuries after columbus arrived in the new world the spanish explorers conquistadores and priests imposed catholicism on the native peoples as well as a cruel system of economic exploitation and dependence.
that system created terrible disparities in wealth education and opportunity that would trigger repeated revolts and political instability.
as bartolom de las casas concluded the spaniards have shown not the slightest consideration for these people treating them and i speak from first hand experience having been there from the outset.
as piles of dung in the middle of the road.
they have had as little concern for their souls as for their bodies chapter review summary native american societies hunter gatherers came across the bering strait by foot and settled the length and breadth of the americas forming groups with diverse cultures languages and lifestyles.
global warming enabled an agricultural revolution particularly of maize that allowed former hunter gather peoples to settle and build empires such as that of the mexica whose aztec empire included subjugated peoples and a vast system of trade and tribute.
some north american peoples developed an elaborate continental trading network and impressive cities like cahokia their burial mounds reveal a complex and stratified social organization.
the eastern woodlands peoples that the europeans would first encounter included both patriarchal and matriarchal societies as well as extensive l anguage based alliances.
the algonquian iroquoian and muskogean were among the major indian nations.
warfare was an important cultural component leading to shifting rivalries and alliances among tribes and with european settlers.
age of exploration by the 1490s europeans were experiencing a renewed curiosity about the world.
warfare plagues and famine undermined the old agricultural feudal system in europe and in its place arose a middle class that monarchs could tax.
powerful new nations replaced the land estates and cities ruled by princes.
scientific and technological advances led to the creation of better maps and navigation techniques as well as new weapons and ships.
navies became the critical component of global trade and world power.
when the spanish began to colonize the new world the conversion of indians to roman catholicism was important but the search for gold and silver was primary.
the rivalries of the protestant reformation in europe shaped the course of conquest in the americas.
conquering and colonizing the americas spanish conquistadores such as hernn corts were able to exploit their advantages in military technology including steel gunpowder and domesticated animals such as the horse in order to conquer the powerful aztec and inca empires.
european diseases first introduced by columbus did even more to ensure spanish victories.
the spanish encomienda system demanded goods and labor from their new subjects.
as the indian population declined the spanish began to import enslaved africans.
columbian exchange contact between the old world and the new resulted in the columbian exchange sometimes called the great biological exchange.
crops such as maize beans and potatoes became staples in the old world.
native peoples incorporated into their culture such eurasian animals as the horse and pig.
but the invaders also carried infectious diseases that set off pandemics of smallpox plague and other illnesses to which indians had no immunity.
the americas were depopulated and cultures destroyed.
spanish legacy spain left a lasting legacy in the borderlands from california to florida.
catholic missionaries contributed to the destruction of the old ways of life by exterminating heathen beliefs in the southwest a practice that led to open rebellion in new mexico in 1598 and 1680.
spains rival european nation states began competing for gold and glory in the new world.

englands colonies ould virginia as one of the earliest explorers and settlers of the jamestown colony john smith put his intimate knowledge of the region to use by creating this seventeenth century map of virginia.
in the upper right hand corner is a warrior of the susquehannock whom smith called a g i ant like people o ver the centuries the island nation of england had developed political practices and governing principles quite different from those on the continent of europe.
englands parliamentary monarchy was unique among european governments.
it began with the magna carta great charter of 1215 a statement of fundamental rights and liberties that nobles forced the king to approve.
the magna carta established the basic principle that everyone was equal before the law and no person not even a king or queen was above the law.
much more than the absolute monarchs of france and spain english rulers shared power with the nobility and a lesser aristocracy known as the gentry whose representatives formed the legislature known as parliament made up of the house of lords and the house of commons.
the most important power allocated to parliament was the authority to impose taxes.
by controlling government tax revenue parliament exercised great leverage over the monarchy.
