scientists continue to debate when the first people arrived in the americas from asia but estimates range from between 40 000 and 14 000 years ago.
in the millennia that followed the peoples of the americas fanned out and established a range of societies.
yet to the europeans who arrived in the americas toward the end of the fifteenth century america was indeed a brave new world as william shakespeare wrote inhabited by exotic plants animals and peoples.
in images and words europeans portrayed this extraordinary land in the most fantastic terms.
some accounts spoke of america as an eden like earthly paradise inhabited by good natured but primitive peoples.
others emphasized themes like those featured in this engraving amerigo vespucci awakens a sleeping america.
vespucci an italian spanish navigator from whose first name the new world came to be called the americas gazes upon a naked native woman rising from her hammock.
her nudity symbolizes the wild sexuality europeans believed characterized the native inhabitants of the americas.
the cannibals behind her devouring human flesh represent savagery a second prominent element of the european vision of the new world.
neither vision of the americas was accurate but both would greatly complicate europeans understanding of the american civilizations they encountered leading to a legacy of violence exploitation and conquest.
the european arrival in the americas was part of a process of exploration and colonization pursued primarily by portugal spain france and england.
this impulse was driven both by a hunger for riches as well as by profound changes in european society religion economics and politics brought on by the renaissance and reformation.
africa was eventually drawn into this vast trading network encompassing the entire atlantic world.
colonization almost always involved the severe exploitation of native peoples including dispossession of land and coerced labor.
eventually europeans turned to the international slave trade and the labor of enslaved africans to draw the wealth from the mines and fields of the new world.
your magnificence must know that herein they are so inhuman that they outdo every custom even of beasts for they eat all their enemies whom they kill or capture.
and are libidinous beyond measure amerigo vespucci 1497 chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 the first americans in one sense america was the new world or at least a newer one in terms of human habitation.
the oldest traces of human life have been found in africa where the earliest human fossil remains unearthed date to somewhere between 190 000 and 160 000 years ago.
in contrast the oldest human fossils found in north america are roughly 14 000 years old far more recent than those found in europe asia or australia.
the ancient inhabitants of america paleo indians were an ice age people who survived largely by hunting big game and to a lesser extent by fishing and collecting edible plants.
within a few thousand years of their arrival in america from asia they had fanned out across the americas.
1 1 migration from asia to america most scholars believe the first inhabitants of america migrated from asia across the bering strait by way of the land bridge that once connected asia and north america.
be r in gia b eri ng s trai t n orth a me r ica pacific ocean head smashed in alberta kennewick wa meadowcroft pa present day shore lines land migration theory ancient shore lines pacific coast route theory glacial ice sheets key archeological sites migration settlement and the rise of agriculture most scholars agree that humans first migrated to north america from asia across a land bridge that formed during the ice age 1 1 about 20 000 years ago.
this land bridge lasted from about 28 000 to 10 000 bce before melting glacial waters submerged it below rising sea levels.
an alternative theory holds that humans may have traveled to the new world by boat even earlier this has attracted some support but most scholars favor the land bridge theory.
with much of the worlds oceans frozen in massive glaciers ocean levels during the ice age were almost 360 feet lower than present day levels resulting in dry land where the bering strait is now.
nomadic hunters simply crossed what to them appeared an endless 600 mile wide tundra in pursuit of migratory big game animals like the woolly mammoths huge long tusked members of the elephant family that provided furs for warm clothing and ample stocks of meat.

over time this migration reached the very tip of south monte verde america.
chile armed with spears tipped with flint a hard dark stone paleo indians roamed in search of big game.
these spear heads called clovis points named after the new mexico town in which scientists first discovered them were one of the stone age tools used by the ancient the first americans inhabitants of america.
clovis point arrowheads like those shown in 1 2 were lashed to poles to make simple spears.
paleo indians also used other simple stone tools such as stone axes and scrapers for hunting and preparing meat a variety of bone tools such as antler harpoons for fishing and bone needles for sewing hides.
these ancient peoples generally hunted in small bands of perhaps 20 to 30 people in cooperative kin groups.
hunting parties pursued a wide range of prey including primitive horses and the oversized ancestors of many modern species such as beaver bison caribou and forerunners of the camel.
hunting gathering and other activities among stone age peoples were probably divided along gender lines.
men hunted and fished while women reared children gathered nuts and berries and made clothing.
many of the mammals that paleo indians hunted including horses and camels eventually became extinct the spanish reintroduced modern horses from europe thousands of years later.
three competing scientific theories attempt to explain the mass extinctions of large mammals in the americas.
some scientists believe overhunting led to the demise of the large mammals.
others argue that dramatic climate change the rising temperatures that accompanied the passing of the ice age killed off animals that were unable to adapt to the new warmer environments.
the most recent explanation focuses on diseases that may have been brought to the new world by humans and the animals that accompanied them most notably dogs and possibly rats.
whatever the cause of the mass extinctions the decline in large game eventually led paleoindians to search for new food sources and develop new modes of providing food and other necessities.
approximately 9 000 years ago a period known as the archaic era began.
lasting approximately 6 000 years it ushered in significant social changes that began with increased efforts by native peoples to shape the environment to enhance food production.
at first these efforts were primitive.
archaic era indians for example burned forest underbrush to provide better habitats for smaller mammals such as deer which they hunted.
they also relied increasingly on gathering nuts and berries and in some cases on harvesting shellfish from lakes streams or coastal waters.
the gendered division of labor found in stone age societies persisted into the archaic era women cared for children and did much of the gathering and preparing of food while men hunted and fished.
some archaic era indians even took the first steps toward agriculture.
at first they encouraged the growth of edible plants such as sunflowers and wild onions by simply weeding out inedible plants around them.
over time archaic era indians learned how to collect and plant seeds and developed basic ideas about irrigation.
these primitive cultivation techniques led to increased food supplies and diminished reliance on hunting.
by about 5000 bce fixed agricultural settlements appeared in what is now mexico.
there native people learned how to grow maize corn squash and beans leading to the development of food surpluses and consequently large increases in population.
planting tending and defending crops necessitated the creation of larger permanent settlements leading to urbanization the creation of towns and cities.
increased food surpluses allowed the ancient peoples of the americas to devote more resources to a variety of cultural artistic and engineering projects.
the combination of agriculture urbanism and increasing social complexity set the foundation for the emergence of the first great civilizations of the southern region of north america an area stretching from modern mexico to nicaragua known as mesoamerica.
the most advanced societies in mesoamerica included the olmecs 1150 bce to about 800 bce maya peaked in 300 bce 900 ce and toltecs 900 ce 1200 ce.
these complex societies developed written languages systems of mathematics sophisticated irrigation techniques and 1 2 clovis point the range of tools available to paleo indians was limited but included stone tools such as arrowheads axes scrapers bone needles and harpoons.
clovis point arrowheads were attached to spears for hunting.

chapter 1 1 4 john whites painting of secoton john whites painting of the eastern woodlands indian village of secoton includes images of wigwams the algonquian word for dwelling place europeans sometimes described these dwellings as longhouses.
people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 eastern woodlands indian societies a different type of society developed in a region encompassing what is now the eastern united states and canada.
in contrast to the native societies of the southwest and mesoamerica eastern woodlands societies were neither highly urban nor stratified.
organized into tribes these eastern how did eastern woodlands indian and mesoamerican societies differ.
woodlands indian peoples lived as hunters and gatherers as well as agriculturalists.
most spoke a dialect of one of two major indian languages iroquois and algonquian.
instead of living in urban settlements eastern woodland indians moved with the seasons to take advantage of different food sources tracking animals in forest regions or fishing in lakes streams and rivers.
consequently as this painting one of the earliest european views of an actual indian village 1 4 shows their villages were composed of wood and bark structures that were easily disassembled and reassembled to make seasonal movement possible.
dwelling in small villages rather than settled urban areas eastern woodlands indians avoided many of the sanitation problems and diseases that periodically afflicted ancient cities such as tenochtitln and cahokia.
the complex religious life of eastern woodlands indians embraced the concept of a supreme being the great manitou but also included animism or the belief that everything in nature possessed a spirit that had to be respected.
rather than seeking to own land and subdue the world around them in the manner of european societies eastern woodlands indians sought to inhabit the land and to live in dynamic relationship with it.
these beliefs however did not keep them from actively altering or managing their environments to their advantage.
indians adopted strategies such as controlled burning of brush a technique that encouraged the growth of habitats for the deer they hunted.
this type of strategy contrasted with european agriculture which used clear cutting to make land available for farming.
the tribal societies of the eastern seaboard had a relatively egalitarian political and social structure.
apart from the chief and a religious figure known as a shaman most members of a tribe enjoyed a rough equality.
while many indigenous societies in the americas particularly the more hierarchical ones of mesoamerica were patrilineal with inheritance and decision making residing in the male view the map native american peoples to 1450 the first americans line some eastern woodlands societies were matrilineal tracing descent and determining inheritance from ancestors on the female side.
in some tribes women enjoyed significant roles in tribal governance.
when captives were taken in war for example women often decided whether to adopt or execute them.
nonetheless woodland indians divided labor along gender lines with women consigned to the fields planting beans corn and squash while men tracked and hunted animals for food hides and pelts.
they are not delighted in baubles but in useful things i have observed that they will not be troubled with superfluous commodities thomas morton english lawyer 1637 eastern woodland indians were more communal than individualistic in outlook.
although trade was important and individuals might own some goods accumulating material wealth was not an important goal as it was in the more stratified mesoamerican societies.
individual tribes controlled territory but the notion of owning land as private property was alien to most of these tribal societies.
warfare among many eastern woodlands tribes was intermittent but common.
they often fought over control of tribal territory or hunting rights.
warfare typically consisted of skirmishes between rival war parties a style of combat that usually kept causalities low.
causalities suffered in war however might trigger further military actions or mourning wars intended to replenish the population reduced by fighting.
in such a war some prisoners taken captive might be tortured and killed while others deemed suitable were adopted by the tribe.
the persistent warfare among tribes led to the creation of the powerful iroquois league of five nations an organization that sought to reduce conflict among its members the seneca mohawk onondaga cayuga and oneida nations.
women played a significant role in the governance of the league.
female elders from each of the individual read the document iroquois creation story nations selected the men who formed the leagues great council a body that met to discuss matters of common concern especially war and peace.
american societies on the eve of european contact american indian societies were socially and culturally diverse ranging from the highly stratified and urban aztec in mesoamerica to the relatively egalitarian hunter farmer iroquois in the northeast.
the peoples of the americas spoke a host of different languages developed distinctive religious traditions and created different political models to govern themselves.
these societies shared many characteristics among themselves and with peoples in other parts of the world.
like their asian and european contemporaries the societies of the americas were pre modern with limited scientific knowledge and widespread belief in magic.
most people worked the land struggling to provide the basics needed to support life.
except for the privileged few life was hard sometimes brutal and short.
in the andes mountains of south america alpaca and llamas were domesticated providing wool or food and in the case of the llama serving as a pack animal.
but in contrast to africa asia or europe in north america and mesoamerica there were no large domesticated animals such as horses extinct after the paleo indian period cattle or camels.
without such animals the people of these regions lacked the mobility and power that horses afforded europeans africans and asians and that camels provided for north africans and asians.
american societies on the eve of contact with europeans were distinctive in another way.
while african and asian societies had developed considerable trade with europe the peoples of the americas had remained largely cut off from contact with other parts of the world for thousands of years.
this isolation had prevented their exposure to a host of diseases.
by the time of the first contact between europe and america in the late 1400s many of the inhabitants of asia africa and europe long exposed to a common pool of diseases because of their extensive trade contacts had developed immunity to many virulent pathogens.
in their relative isolation however the indigenous societies of the americas were highly susceptible to the microbial invaders introduced by europeans.
what were some of the distinctive characteristics shared by all of the societies of the americas.
chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 european civilization in turmoil as the aztec empire was reaching the height of its power at the close of the fifteenth century european society was in the midst of a profound transformation.
this period of cultural intellectual scientific and commercial flourishing is known as the renaissance.
the revival of interest in ancient greek and latin not only led to renewed interest in the civilizations of greece and rome but also caused renaissance thinkers to re examine the early history of the church and its teachings.
reformers drawing on these traditions and reacting to the corruption of the roman catholic church challenged the authority of the church.
the rise of a new strain of christian thought protestantism led to creation of a host of new christian sects.
amid this tumult powerful monarchs across europe forged new nation states out of the relatively weak decentralized governments of europe.
modern nations such as england france and spain were born in this era.
state building required money and the monarchs of these nations were eager to increase their wealth and power a desire that ultimately led to the colonization and exploration of africa and the americas.
the allure of the east and the challenge of islam the leading european powers decision to explore conquer and exploit lands in the atlantic world was facilitated by a host of economic technological and cultural changes.
contact with asia led to major changes in taste and patterns of consumption during the early modern period from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries.
europeans looked beyond their borders particularly to china and the far east for spices to enrich their bland foods and for luxury goods especially exotic textiles such as silk and cotton to enliven their fashions.
these commodities not native to europe had to be obtained from asia.
the overland trade routes to the east were controlled by muslims adherents of islam a monotheistic faith shaped by the teachings of the prophet muhammad.
since its emergence in the seventh century middle east muslim influence spread stretching from europe to parts of africa and asia.
europeans resented the economic power of muslim rulers who controlled the lucrative trade routes to the east.
european antagonism toward the muslim world also sprang from an intense religious animosity.
for almost 300 years christian europe had waged a holy war against islam launching crusades to regain control of jerusalem a city sacred to jews christians and muslims.
islams influence in europe was what trade goods from asia were most sought after by europeans.
most pronounced in the ottoman empire whose power eventually spread across the eastern mediterranean and balkans.
trade commerce and urbanization among the important changes in europe during this period was the dramatic growth of the economy.
the black death 1347 1352 ce a pandemic that spread to europe between 1347 and 1352 wiped out about half of europes population.
in the centuries following the black death europes population began to expand again eventually becoming larger than it had been before the epidemic.
the economies of europe also recovered.
by 1400 the italian city states especially venice dominated trade and finance particularly trade with the east.
in part venices dominance resulted from its proximity to the lucrative eastern trade routes.
italy also dominated textile production and florence became europes leading producer of woolen cloth.
slowly the economic center of europe shifted west and north.
by about 1500 the city of antwerp in what is today belgium had become the leading commercial center of europe but was eventually surpassed by the dutch port of amsterdam.
as trade and commerce expanded innovative financial practices and services facilitated continued economic growth.
new accounting methods helped european civilization in turmoil merchants keep track of inventories and profits and losses.
marine insurance reduced the risks of maritime trade.
a more elaborate banking system also helped finance trade.
the growth of deposit banking a system in which merchants could deposit funds with bankers and then draw on written checks instead of presenting gold or silver coins for payment of goods greatly bolstered trade and commerce.
all these developments made economic ventures more secure and encouraged investment some of which was directed toward overseas trade and exploration.
together the new commercial and financial practices were key elements in the growth of capitalism.
simply put capitalism is an economic system in which a market economy geared toward the maximization of profit determines the prices of goods and services.
this new profit driven capitalist ethos slowly transformed european life beginning in the fifteenth century.
capitalism also transformed rural europe.
european culture had always viewed nature as something to be tamed and exploited see competing visions european and huron views of nature page 12.
rather than simply produce food for themselves the new capitalist ethos led some farmers to seek the maximum yield from their land and plant crops that would fetch a higher price at market.
in other cases landowners evicted farmers from their lands so that they could graze sheep on the land and produce wool that would be turned into cloth.
this latter change in agriculture forced many to leave the countryside and seek employment in towns and cities.
migration from the countryside and commercial development led to greater urbanization in europe.
in the two centuries after the black death the population of london increased from 50 000 to more than 200 000.
outside of london englands changes were less dramatic but no less significant.
populations mushroomed in ports such as bristol regional market towns such as cambridge and the new textile centers such as norwich.
view the map spread of printing technological improvements and new inventions also spurred economic growth.
the printing press transformed the way knowledge was produced and disseminated.
while a scribe hand copying a book onto parchment might turn out two or three books a year the typical print run of a book produced on paper by a printing press was between 100 and 1 000.
printed books not only made it easier to preserve knowledge but also encouraged advances in science and in geographic exploration by making it easier to collect organize and analyze information.
printed texts and engraved images also whet the appetites of europeans for exploration by making accounts of exotic places such as india and china more accessible.
marco polos 1254 1324 influential text about his adventures in china the travels of marco polo circulated widely in manuscript form for more than a century before a printed edition appeared in 1477.
printing created an entire new industry for the production dissemination and sale of books.
the new technology also transformed visual culture making it possible to create cheap images.
the new technique of engraving 1 5 was a multistep process.

how did printing affect european society.
chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 competing visions european and huron views of nature european capitalism was built on deeply rooted beliefs including the notion of private property and the belief that nature existed as a resource for humans to tame and exploit.
european and eastern woodlands indian cultures had starkly different attitudes toward the natural world.
following a mandate laid down in the biblical book of genesis europeans believed that they had a god given right to rule over nature.
the huron an eastern woodlands indian tribe from canada approached nature in a radically different way that reflected their animist belief that all living things had spiritual power.
what ecological consequences flowed from the huron view of nature.
how might this view have shaped the european impression of indians.
what ecological consequences follow from the western view.
in genesis god gave humans complete control over nature.
according to this view humanity was not simply enjoined to subdue nature but to make sure that the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
king james bible genesis 1 28 1611 lucas cranach adam and eve how does this painting of adam and eve reflect european views of nature.
one of the best sources for understanding indian views of nature can be found in the writings of jesuit missionaries a catholic order active in the french colonization of canada.
in this selection a jesuit recounts his exchange with a huron indian about the proper treatment of animal bones which hurons believed had to be treated with respect to avoid angering the animal spirits that might take offense and make hunting more difficult.
it is remarkable how they gather and collect these bones and preserve them with so much care that you would say their game would be lost if they violated their superstitions.
as i was laughing at them and telling them that beavers do not know what is done with their bones they answered me thou dost not know how to take beavers and thou wishest to talk about it before the beaver was entirely dead they told me its soul comes to make the round of the cabin of him who has killed it and looks very carefully to see what is done with its bones if they are given to the dogs the other beavers would be apprised of it and therefore they would make themselves hard to capture.

11 john white indians fishing view the closer look competing visions european and huron views of nature european civilization in turmoil renaissance and reformation a revival of interest in the cultures of greek and roman antiquity arising first in italy spread across europe at the end of the fifteenth century.
this rebirth of classical learning the renaissance transformed the way europeans thought about art architecture science and political philosophy.
the most significant change was the shift from theology the primary scholarly subject in the middle ages to the study of the liberal arts including poetry history and philosophy.
much like the ancient greeks renaissance scholars emphasized the human capacity for self improvement and exalted the beauty of the human body in painting and sculpture.
for these scholars known as humanists humans were the masters of their world and obligated to study it.
these renaissance values in particular the spirit of exploration would soon inspire explorers to seek out new lands and trade routes.
in contrast to medieval europe with its cloistered monasteries where monks prayed and copied texts for their own libraries the renaissance placed a high value on public art architecture and philosophical thought aimed at civilizing humanity.
civic humanism the new philosophy of the renaissance encouraged artists and philosophers to participate in public life especially in cities which replaced monasteries as the ideal place to encourage learning and glorify god.
the study of ancient languages fostered a new interest in the early church and inspired some religious figures to call for reforms in the roman catholic church.
one church practice that drew intense criticism was the sale of indulgences.
in essence money donated to the church could buy forgiveness for sin in this life and after death.
in 1517 a young german monk named martin luther attacked the sale of indulgences and other key elements of catholic doctrine and practice.
luther eventually developed a new theological alternative to catholicism.
rejecting the catholic churchs focus on good works as the key to achieving salvation luther argued that only faith could bring salvation.
luther also argued that ordinary people did not need to depend on the clergy to gain access to gods word they could and should read the bible themselves.
luther translated the bible from greek and latin to german and the newly invented printing press made it widely accessible.
anyone who could read could now receive the word of god in his or her own home.
luther championed the idea of the priesthood of all true believers the notion that everyone could experience salvation directly.
priests would continue to preach the word of god and perform rituals such baptizing infants and marriage ceremonies but luther would dispense with the catholic ritual of going to a priest for confession penance and absolution for sins.
luther also rejected monasticism.
the place for the committed christian was in this world not cloistered away in a monastery.
luther also urged christian monarchs to take up the cause of religious reform and reject the authority of the pope.
his attack on the political power of the roman catholic church appealed to some european rulers eager to strengthen their power.
luther was summarily excommunicated by the church but his calls for reform had wide appeal especially in what is now germany and scandinavia.
his supporters known as protestants began a movement for religious reform known as the reformation.
protestantism found an especially receptive home in geneva a french speaking city in switzerland.
here the french reformer john calvin 1509 1564 articulated a new variant of protestantism with a different theological emphasis from luthers version.
calvins theology stressed the doctrine of pre destination the notion that god had destined people to salvation or damnation prior to their birth no matter how righteously or wickedly they lived.
he also maintained that the true church was not embodied in any official organization including the roman catholic church but rather in a group of the elect or those chosen by god for salvation.
according to this ideal the elect could continue to act as a reformed church even if they had no physical place of worship or formal ministry to serve their spiritual needs.
with the bible and personal faith argued calvin protestants could constitute a true church wherever they lived including eventually a wilderness like america.
calvinists in switzerland and elsewhere took their critique of catholic worship a step further than lutherans becoming iconoclasts or image breakers.
they took the biblical injunction in exodus to avoid graven or carved images literally decrying them as sacrilegious and a form of idolatry calvinists smashed the stained glass windows and religious carvings that adorned churches.
one catholic nun described a protestant rampage in geneva in these terms like enraged wolves they destroyed those fine images with great axes and hammers especially going after the blessed crucifix and the image of our lady mary this contemporary image of one such rampage shows protestants pulling down sculptures and smashing stained glass what were the essential teachings of calvinism.

once purged of all such catholic images religious worship calvinists believed could focus on the words of the bible alone.
in 1560 english calvinists published the geneva bible a text that would become the most important text for englishspeaking protestants.
new monarchs and the rise of the nation state by 1500 the kingdoms of france england portugal and spain had evolved into sovereign nation states.
powerful monarchs consolidated their power eliminated rivals to their thrones created administrative bureaucracies to rule and built larger more effective armies.
paying for these required huge sums of money and if they could not raise what they needed at home some monarchs began to look why did calvinists wish to remove all icons from their churches.
territorial expansion and exploration of new regions they reasoned would increase both trade and revenues.
in england henry vii r 1485 1509 established the house of tudor as the ruling family of england.
his son henry viii r 1509 1547 expanded the power of the monarchy.
his most important act as king of england was his break with rome when the pope refused to dissolve his marriage to the spanish princess catherine of aragon.
after failing to obtain a divorce henry declared himself head of his own independent english church.
he rejected the authority of the roman catholic church confiscated the monastic lands and sold them for a handsome profit or gave them to favored supporters.
the intensity of henrys anti catholic feeling and his particular hostility to the pope is evident in this portrait painted by an unknown artist in 1570 1 7.

perhaps the most ambitious of the new monarchies was spains created by the marriage of ferdinand of aragon and isabella of castile in 1469.
when they became joint rulers of spain ferdinand and isabella followed a strategy common to all the new monarchs they reduced the power of the nobility and strengthened their own control over the military.
they also boosted crown revenue by raising taxes and making tax collection more efficient.
as part of their effort to transform spain into a world power ferdinand and isabella sought to strengthen the power of the roman catholic church and ally its interests with the state.
in 1478 the spanish monarchy sought the popes approval to create the spanish inquisition a religious tribunal charged with finding and punishing heresy or unorthodox beliefs among christians and for eliminating nonchristians most notably muslims and jews from spain.
thousands of suspected heretics were arrested tortured and imprisoned.
hundreds were executed.
eventually in 1492 the government ordered all jews except those who converted to christianity expelled from spain.
that same year ferdinand and isabella achieved another goal in their effort to strengthen church and state by conquering granada the last remaining islamic state in spain.
the conquest of the last muslim kingdom in spain in 1492 was the final phase of this reconquista re conquest.
spains holy war united state and church in a single purpose.
this partnership between a militant clergy and an equally aggressive military would serve spain well when its attention moved beyond europe to the wider atlantic world.

chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 columbus and the columbian exchange in 1492 queen isabella agreed to outfit a small expedition to find a quicker route to asia.
the expeditions leader an italian sailor named christopher columbus was an experienced mariner who had worked in the portuguese seagoing trade to africa and the atlantic islands.
familiar with marco polos written accounts of china columbus believed he could find a faster and more direct route to asia than traveling around the tip of africa by simply crossing the atlantic.
he first asked the king of portugal to fund the voyage but the kings advisors warned columbus that he had greatly underestimated the circumference of the earth and would certainly perish long before he reached asia.
undeterred columbus turned to queen isabella who consented to fund his expedition.
columbus encounters the indians after sailing for 33 days columbus reached the caribbean islands most likely the bahamas.
mistakenly convinced that he had arrived in india he called the native peoples indians columbus claimed all the lands he visited for spain.
concluding that the native people were savages he believed that they were fit to be ordered about and made to work plant and do everything else that may be needed and build towns and be taught our customs returning to spain with captive indians exotic plants and gold columbus was greeted as a hero and secured funding for additional voyages of exploration.
columbus was not the first european to cross the atlantic nor was he the first to create a small european outpost in america.
the vikings had sailed from iceland almost 400 years earlier establishing small fishing outposts in what is now newfoundland canada.
nevertheless columbuss voyage to the americas brought the two worlds together in ways that viking ventures had not.
europes printing presses would make accounts of his voyage widely available providing a model for later explorers conquerors and settlers.
columbuss voyage also began one of the most complex ecological changes in modern history.
the worlds on both sides of the atlantic were suddenly reconnected a development that would have far reaching biological consequences for europe africa and america.
modern scholars have described the biological encounter between the two sides of the atlantic as the columbian exchange 1 8 a name that acknowledges the crucial role that columbus played in instigating this transformation.
this exchange involved a range of foods plants animals and diseases.
moving from the americas to europe by way of columbus and the europeans who followed him were a host of foods now closely identified with european cuisine.
before columbus italian cuisine had no tomatoes irish and german food no potatoes and switzerland no chocolate.
moving in the other direction were animals including the horse long extinct in the americas but reintroduced by the spanish sheep cattle and swine.
as soon as i arrived in the indies in the first island which i found i took by force some of them in order that they might learn and give me information christopher columbus 1493 what was the columbian exchange.

a host of pathogens mostly of old world origin were also part of the columbian exchange.
diseases also crossed the atlantic.
europeans may have brought back a plague in the form of a more deadly strain of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis that sailors picked up on the caribbean islands.
far more devastating were the diseases like smallpox brought to the new world.
these diseases killed huge numbers of indian men women and children.
european technology in the era of the columbian exchange columbus and the europeans who led the exploration of the atlantic world benefited from technological changes developed in europe in the fifteenth century.
improvements in map making and the introduction of navigational devices that allowed mariners to calculate latitude more accurately aided exploration.
europeans borrowed technology from the islamic world and asia to improve their ships.
the portuguese also made important strides in ship building with the caravel a vessel whose lateen triangular sails were better suited to catching wind than were those of traditional european ships.
watch the video what is columbuss legacy.
europeans enjoyed a clear technological and military advantage over the peoples of america a disparity that would profoundly affect european interactions with the aztec and later with eastern woodlands indian peoples.
foremost among these advantages were the metallurgical techniques that allowed europeans to forge iron weapons that were stronger than those of the aztec and other indians.
domesticated horses allowed europeans to support their armies with swiftmoving cavalry.
through trade with china europeans had learned about gunpowder and developed powerful cannons and firearms such as the arquebus a forerunner of the musket and rifle.
among the inventions depicted in this engraving nova reperta new discoveries 1584 by artist johannes stradanus are the compass the mechanical clock cannons and gunpowder and a saddle with stirrups 1 9.

regime and the deadly diseases the spanish brought nearly wiped out these indigenous populations.
on the island of hispaniola present day haiti and the dominican republic 95 percent of the native peoples died within 25 years.
faced with the loss of this indigenous labor force the spanish turned to the african slave trade to supply the labor they demanded for the production of lucrative cash crops such as sugar.
spanish conquistadores lured by rumors of a fabulous empire possessing great wealth eventually turned their attention to the mainland of what is now mexico.

he forced his men to push forward to conquer or die in the attempt.
although vastly outnumbered by the aztecs corts and his men had military advantages.
first they possessed horses firearms and steel weapons.
second they quickly gained allies among the peoples conquered by the aztecs.
after years of subjugation in which they were forced to provide the aztecs with victims for human sacrifice these exploited peoples now willingly sided with the spanish.
finally the spanish unknowingly carried with them a host of diseases in particular the deadly smallpox virus that infected and killed vast numbers of aztecs.

european firearms left an indelible impression on south american cultures.

the spanish took advantage of the existing systems of tribute and taxation created by the aztec to extract the maximum amount of wealth from the region.
spanish america yielded a glittering array of valuable items from gold to pearls.
the spanish also began exporting prized dyes such as the brilliant red cochineal and indigo.
the latter blue dye became closely associated with a type of cloth associated with the italian city of genoa.
the french name for this cloth bleu de gnes is the origin of the modern word blue jeans.
among the agricultural products exported cacao the key ingredient in chocolate helped spur a spanish obsession with drinking chocolate.
in contrast to the aztecs the spanish preferred to drink their chocolate with an added sweetener such as honey and eventually sugar.
in the 1540s the discovery of silver in what is now peru generated what became the most profitable american commodity for export.
silver would become the cornerstone of spains new found wealth.
silver was a mixed blessing for the spanish economy.
the influx of large amounts of silver into the spanish economy helped some become rich but others suffered as prices were inflated as more and more of the precious metal was introduced into the economy.

chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 west african worlds africa the worlds second largest continent in terms of land mass is home to some of the most ancient civilizations in the world.
the range of societies in africa in the sixteenth century rivaled those of the americas in social complexity and cultural and religious diversity.
africa featured class stratified urban civilizations alongside more simple egalitarian societies.
monotheistic faiths including christianity and islam flourished in parts of africa as did religions closer in principle to the animist beliefs of eastern woodlands indians.
the north african states on the mediterranean had been trading with europe since the founding of the great ancient port of carthage 814 bce near modern tunis.
africans possessed many commodities sought by europeans including salt gold ivory and exotic woods.
but the development of a direct sea route from europe to west africa in the fifteenth century greatly increased trade and contact between europeans and africans.
the most profound consequence of the sea routes to west africa was the development of the international slave trade a process that changed virtually every society in the atlantic world.
west african societies islam and trade the civilizations of africa south of the sahara desert including those with atlantic ports were socially and culturally diverse.
the powerful songhai empire 1370 1591 extended from the atlantic inward to the sudan.
primarily agricultural the empire included urban centers and a highly organized military and administrative bureaucracy.
in the great city of timbuktu an islamic university rivaled many european centers of learning.
other peoples such as the igbos of west africa lived in smaller autonomous villages.
these simpler more egalitarian societies were organized mainly around kinship more like americas eastern woodlands indians than the empires of mesoamerica or the rising nation states of europe.
local rulers consulted with a council of elders before making decisions affecting the community.
societies such as the igbos were matrilineal whereas other african societies traced descent and organized inheritance through the paternal line.
before the seventh century most societies of west africa practiced animist religions.
these polytheistic faiths considered aspects of nature such as the sun wind and animals to be gods and spirits.
ancestor worship also played a prominent role in many west african religious traditions.
but beginning in the mid seventh century the faith of islam what were the major religious traditions of africa.
first established in arabia by muhammad in 622 ce began spreading via trade routes through northern western and eastern africa.
islam eventually became the dominant religion in these areas especially in trading centers.
trade played a key role in the economic life of both north and west africa.
trade goods included salt ivory and precious metals.
while salt was an essential ingredient for cooking and preserving food the other items were sought by artists and artisans who fashioned them into luxury goods such as jewelry.
an extensive network of caravan routes linked west africa to the north african ports of tangier tunis tripoli and alexandria.
but portuguese exploration of the african coast in the late 1400s soon led to the development of direct trade between europeans and africans 1 11.
the portuguese african connection portugal took the lead in exploring an atlantic route to asia which provided europe with spices and exotic fabrics such as silk and cotton.
prince henry the navigator 1394 1460 a member of the portuguese royal family used his wealth and power to encourage exploration of the west african coast.
even after his death portugal continued to explore the west african coast leading to vasco da gamas voyage 1497 1499 around the horn of africa and arrival on the southwest west african worlds portugal azores spain s pa n i s h p o rt u g u e s e lisbon tunis tangier persia madeiras canary is.

the portuguese traded with the atlantic islands and the west coast of africa.
coast of india 1 11.
portuguese traders then established a lucrative trade with india and began to explore trading possibilities with africa seeking such prized goods as ivory and gold.
after 1470 portuguese trade with west africa increased and within a decade the portuguese had established forts along the african coasts to facilitate further trading opportunities.
at approximately the same time that the portuguese were exploring the african coast they were embarking on an ambitious but ruthless plan of conquest and colonization in the atlantic island groups of the madeiras azores and cape verde 1 11.
these atlantic outposts were converted into sugarproducing plantation economies.
the portuguese also vied with the spanish for pre eminence in the canary islands.
the pope eventually brokered a treaty between these two iberian powers giving control to the spanish.
the biggest losers were the indigenous populations of the canary islands the guanche a north african people who had settled the islands thousands of years earlier.
the semitropical climate of the canaries was ideal for sugar cultivation.
the pope blessed the guanche enslavement which was entirely justified because the guanche were in his words infidels and savages the model developed in the canaries foreshadowed european interactions with the peoples of the americas.
with no previous exposure to the diseases carried by europeans thousands of guanche people became ill and died.
unable to rely on an indigenous source of labor europeans eventually turned to africa for slaves to provide the back breaking labor they demanded for cultivating harvesting and processing sugar.
african slavery slavery was widely practiced in africa long before the arrival of the portuguese.
rival tribes usually took slaves as spoils of war but some prisoners attained privileged positions as petty officials military leaders and in rare cases political advisors to rulers.
in africa slavery was not always a permanent or hereditary condition and slaves were sometimes absorbed into the societies that held them.
what arguments were used to justify the enslavement of the guanche.
chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 plantations prompted rival european powers to compete with one another for a share of this lucrative trade.
as the value of slaves increased africans began raiding neighboring territories with the express purpose of obtaining slaves.
european involvement in the african slave trade transformed this centuries old institution into one of the most exploitative labor systems in world history.
europeans developed a racist conception of slavery that declared people of dark skin to be inferior beings for whom slavery was a natural and proper condition.
as a consequence europeans treated slaves as property with few legal rights or protections.
masters were free to extract the maximum amount of labor from them with minimal regard for their humanity.
slaves taken by europeans to the americas were often worked literally to death in the sugar fields.
those who survived found that slavery in the new world was a permanent and hereditary condition.
they and their descendants faced a lifetime of slavery with no hope of ever obtaining freedom.
some west african nations managed to fend off the ravages of the slave trade.
benin a well organized nation state ruled by a powerful monarch traded slaves captured during war to the portuguese in the fifteenth century but gradually withdrew from the slave trade see choices and consequences benin portugal and the international slave trade page 23.
benin continued to trade with the portuguese on its own terms.
among the goods sought by the portuguese were a type of pepper and ivory the benin sought bronze from the portuguese.
among the most visually impressive uses of this bronze were the finely crafted panels created for the walls of the royal palace.
in the panel pictured here 1 12 a portuguese soldier with a pike is surrounded by five manilas the bronze bars that were among the most important trade goods brought by the portuguese.

what roles did slaves play in african societies.
view the map benin empire west african worlds choices and consequences benin portugal and the international slave trade the portuguese took advantage of ethnic and tribal rivalries and the traditional african practice of taking captured opponents as slaves.
africans were eager to trade with the portuguese who offered highly prized goods such as bronze cloth horses and in limited cases firearms.
the kingdom of benin one of the more powerful west african kingdoms initially participated in this trade but by 1516 the oba king faced a momentous decision about whether to continue the slave trade.
choices cut off all trade with the portuguese continuing controversies what does the kingdom of benins experiences with the slave trade reveal about the nature of african slavery.
few scholars believe benins actions were motivated by humanitarian concerns about the evils of slavery which the african kingdom continued to tolerate.
scholars disagree over benins motivation for ending its involvement in the slave trade.
some argue that benins economy required a large supply of labor which meant it could ill afford to export slaves.
others argue that benins rulers wisely calculated that continued expansion and warfare would only weaken their power and lead to political instability.
continue to trade with the portuguese and participate fully in the expanding international slave trade continue to trade with the portuguese but end their involvement in the international slave trade decision benins king continued to trade with the portuguese but restricted the trade in male slaves the most sought after slaves for heavy agricultural labor.
benin allowed women to be traded eventually prohibiting this trade too and continued to tolerate slavery within its own kingdom.
consequences benins decision allowed it to prosper and preserve its political autonomy far longer than many neighboring states.
benin obtained the benefits of trade by selling cloth instead of slaves.
by refusing to become a major supplier of slaves benin avoided the costly and potentially destabilizing warfare needed to obtain large numbers of slaves.
city of benin what theories account for benins ability to resist involvement in the international slave trade.
chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 european colonization of the atlantic world by the early sixteenth century portugal spain and france had established permanent outposts in the atlantic world with england soon to follow.
each of these nations concentrated on a particular region of the atlantic world 1 13.
portugal focused primarily on west africa and brazil where trade in slaves and production of sugar generated enormous profits.
spains massive empire in the atlantic extended from the tip of south america to southwestern north america.
the spanish empires chief export was silver.
meanwhile france directed its attention northward toward canada where the fur trade produced a lucrative commodity for export and south to the caribbean islands where plantations could produce sugar and tobacco.
finally england a relative latecomer to colonization established its first outposts on the east coast of north america in present day north carolina and virginia.

the portuguese turned toward africa the spanish explored central and south america and the english and french focused on the north atlantic.
what was the black legend.
the spanish had used images of aztec human sacrifice to justify their conquest and spains rivals particularly protestant nations such as england used the power of images for their own political advantage.
tales of spanish brutality during the conquest of the americas gave rise to the black legend this indictment of spanish cruelty toward the native peoples of the americas first appeared in the writings of the spanish bishop bartolom de las casas in the 1550s.
the new medium of print allowed copies of his scathing critique of spanish colonialism to be distributed throughout europe it was soon translated into french dutch and english.
some of these translations contained gruesome wood cut images such as those that appeared in the english edition the tears of the indians 1656.
the four scenes depicted on the front cover of the book the massacre and slaughter of the indian inhabitants of the view the image torturing native amerindians european colonization of the atlantic world americas are described in las casass narrative.
the title page shows scenes of torture and punishment including being hacked to death and burnt alive 1 14.
within two decades the spanish had conquered much of central and south america.
inspired by tales of fabulously wealthy civilizations to the north they launched expeditions to explore the vast continent of north america.
hernando de sotos expedition to florida explored much of the southeastern united states in 1539.
another expedition in 1540 under the command of francisco vasquez de coronado traversed a huge swath of western america from what is now kansas to colorado.
subsequent settlements in florida and the southwest greatly extended the spanish empire.
within 60 years of conquering the aztecs and incas spains north american colonial empire extended from santa fe present day new mexico in the west to st augustine present day florida in the east and then all the way south to what are now chile and argentina an area larger than ancient romes vast empire.
the spanish crown had taken an active role in colonizing these regions and the government it created to rule its american empire reflected the investment of time money and resources.
the empire was divided into a series of administrative units and was staffed by a large number of bureaucrats and administrative officials.
of crucial importance was spains board of trade headquartered in the spanish port of seville.
it granted licenses for trade with spains colonies enforced commercial laws and collected customs taxes and any revenues due the crown.
along with the colonial government the roman catholic church exercised enormous power and influence in spanish america.
spain granted the church sizeable amounts of land and money and priests and church officials enjoyed a privileged status.
they also bore responsibilities such as establishing churches schools and hospitals converting native people to the faith and enforcing religious conformity through the inquisition.
the spanish established a network of interconnected urban centers to aid them in the administration of the peoples and territories they conquered.
in part this policy reflected the relatively high degree of urbanization the spanish found among the civilizations of mesoamerica and south america.
however this model of organization also reflected spanish values and interests allowing them to project the power of the church and state in highly visible ways.
by 1600 there were 225 towns in spanish america all laid out according to renaissance models of urban 1 14 illustration from bartolom de las casas the tears of the indians this illustration from the tears of the indians the english translation of las casass work portrays spanish cruelty toward indians.
the spread of these images gave credence to the black legend of spanish conquest and violence.
planning in a grid like pattern.
the grand central plazas in the larger towns and cities afforded both a place for commerce and a symbolic space for monumental civic and church architecture.
this painting of the central plaza in mexico city 1 15 captures the use of urban planning and monumental architecture to reinforce the power of the state and the church.
the cathedral and the viceroys local governor and archbishops palaces tower over the central square vivid reminders of the dominance of church and state.
what does the architecture of the central plaza of mexico city tell us about spains approach to colonization.
chapter 1 1 15 central square of mexico city spanish urban planners sought to project imperial power onto the colonial landscape.
in this painting of the town square in mexico city the buildings most closely identified with church and state the cathedral and the headquarters of the government tower over the central plaza.
people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 much of the economy of new spain was based on a highly exploitive system of labor.
ensuring an adequate labor supply for the arduous mining and agricultural work became a top economic priority of spanish colonial officials.
rather than enslave the inhabitants of central and south america as they had done to the native peoples in the caribbean islands the spanish developed a system of forced labor the encomienda that was only marginally less exploitive than slavery itself.
the crown declared indians vassals who owed their labor to noblemen who in turn were required to provide for the indians spiritual welfare.
the system provided labor and in theory demonstrated the spanish commitment to saving the souls of the indians by converting them.
in reality it led to what types of labor systems were employed in the spanish colonies.
the brutal exploitation of indians.
criticism of the system by religious reformers such as las casas combined with high mortality among the indigenous population which easily succumbed to diseases brought by the spanish eventually led to the use of other types of labor including conscript enrolled by compulsion labor wage labor and slavery.
fishing and furs frances north atlantic empire in 1493 the pope had settled a colonial dispute between spain and portugal by dividing the atlantic world between them a decision later ratified by a treaty between both countries in 1494.
france view the map spanish america to 1610 european colonization of the atlantic world rejected the authority of the treaty and sent fleets to take advantage of the abundant cod fisheries in the waters off what is now newfoundland.
in 1524 france dispatched giovanni da verrazano an italian mariner working for the king of france to find the so called northwest passage that would allow ships to sail through the waterways of the americas to asia.
although verrazano failed to find such a route it did not exist his mapping of the north american coast aroused the interest of the french monarch who decided to commit additional resources for further exploration of north america.
in the 1530s french explorer jacques cartier made a more extensive and detailed investigation of the north atlantic eventually traveling up the st lawrence river where he encountered a group of micmac indians an algonquian speaking eastern woodlands indian nation.
their offer of furs in exchange for european goods such as 1 16 two europeans show a religious painting to a group of native americans this image from an early french traveler account of new france underscores the way in which images were used to help indians understand christianity.
knives kettles and beads led the french to recognize the potential of furs as a lucrative commodity.
furs could be sold to europeans who valued their warmth and treated them as a high status luxury item.
in 1604 the french established port royal in nova scotia and four years later founded the city of quebec now the capital of the province of quebec on the banks of the st lawrence river.
located on a high ridge at a strategic bend in the river quebec was well placed to allow the french to trade with the local indians who were skilled fur trappers.
the beaver pelts traded to the french fetched a good price in the european markets.
the french encounter with native americans differed from that of the spanish and portuguese in three significant ways.
first the relatively small size of the settlement in new france and the dependence of the french on indians to provide furs necessitated maintaining good relations with local tribes.
second the predominantly male french population intermarried with local indians.
eventually the french government even encouraged intermarriage believing it would lead to the gradual assimilation of the indian population into the french culture of new france.
third the french like the spanish were committed to converting the indians to their catholic faith but rather than trying to impose catholicism by force french jesuit missionaries lived among indians and learned their languages and customs.
the french jesuits were just as eager as the spanish to convert the indians but they recognized the need to understand the culture of those they wished to convert.
the french also took advantage of religious art and images to help convert the indians.
this early account of life in new france includes an image that shows how religious painting was used to introduce indians to christian ideas 1 16.
what were the most important differences between new france and new spain.
chapter 1 people in motion the atlantic world to 1590 english expansion ireland and virginia although england took advantage of the rich opportunities for fishing provided by the atlantic ocean its exploration of the americas was a relatively low priority for most of the sixteenth century.
three factors explain this lack of interest.
first england faced less economic pressure to find export markets because its primary export wool was in high demand on the european continent.
second england faced a crisis of leadership after the death of henry viii in 1547.
he was succeeded by his sickly ten year old son edward vi who died in 1553 only six years into his reign.
next came henrys daughter mary i who tried to reestablish catholicism a campaign that included the intense persecution of protestants.
her reign was also short she died in 1558.
finally england was bogged down in a colonial venture closer to home the subjugation of ireland.
spain easily conquered the last moors in spain before moving on to atlantic exploration in 1492.
irish resistance to english colonization by contrast tied up english resources for decades.
yet even as the english struggled to colonize ireland these experiences provided a distinctive model for future colonial policy in the new world.
while the spanish set out to conquer and convert the inhabitants of the americas absorbing them into spanish society as a subordinate class at the bottom of the social order the english took a different approach.
rather than attempt to incorporate the irish the english expelled them from their land.
they then repopulated the land with colonists from england and scotland creating plantations or fortified outposts dedicated to producing agricultural products for export.
originally the term plantation simply meant any english settlement in a foreign land but it later became synonymous with a distinctive slave based labor system used in much of the atlantic world.
one source of this policy of exclusion can be traced to the intense religious animosity between protestants and catholics.
the english not only detested the catholic faith of the irish but they also feared the irish would support efforts to reimpose catholicism on england and would assist catholic nations like france and spain if they went to war with england.
expelling the irish and transplanting loyal protestant farmers from england and scotland therefore promised to boost the english economy what lessons did the english learn from their experiences in ireland.
and secure control of a potentially troublesome neighboring island.
this colonial model developed in parts of ireland expulsion and plantation would shape subsequent english experiments in colonization.
economic pressures eventually impelled england to follow its european rivals and engage in the exploration and colonization of the atlantic.
the profitable wool trade with the continent began to decline in the 1550s prompting english merchants to seek new commercial opportunities.
these merchants founded scores of new companies devoted to overseas trade with europe africa and the mediterranean.
in 1558 englands entry into exploration and colonization was also helped when another of henry viiis daughters elizabeth i succeeded bloody mary as protestants called her and quickly established herself as a strong leader determined to project english power overseas.
she eagerly pursued an aggressive policy of expansion challenging spains dominance in the atlantic.
a committed protestant elizabeth viewed spanish power as a threat to her realm.
her religious convictions and foreign policy objectives eventually brought england into direct conflict with spain.
englands support for spains enemies on the continent including the protestant dutch the raids of english pirates and english anticatholicism finally drove king philip ii of spain to take decisive action.
in 1588 spain launched a mighty armada or fleet of warships to invade england and destroy europes most powerful protestant monarchy.
the spanish considered their ships invincible but the armada was routed by the smaller faster ships of the english navy.
weather conditions at sea favored the english and hampered the spanish fleet.
the defeat of the armada shifted the balance of power in the atlantic as england eventually emerged as the major force in the atlantic world.
to commemorate the stunning victory queen elizabeth commissioned a portrait that symbolized englands rise to power in the atlantic world.
in the painting elizabeths hand rests prominently on a globe and the crown a symbol of the monarchy sits perched above the globe 1 17.
in the background the artist includes two scenes depicting the defeat of the armada a further reminder of englands power and naval supremacy.
among the most ardent supporters of expanding englands role in the atlantic world were former privateers.
these were englishmen who engaged in read the document thomas hariot a briefe and true report of the new found land of virginia 1590 european colonization of the atlantic world state sanctioned piracy in the atlantic against spanish treasure fleets returning from south america.
a number of them had grown rich and influential from their successes.
john hawkins for example earned himself a fortune and a knighthood for his daring seizures of spanish ships.
one of the most dashing of these buccaneers sir walter raleigh had participated in the english conquest of ireland and became a favorite of queen elizabeth.
raleigh sought support for a more ambitious plan of colonization in the lands north of spanish america and south of french canada.
queen elizabeth bestowed her blessing on the enterprise but not money.
as a result raleigh and the colonial ventures that followed had to turn to private capital to finance his plan.
in contrast to france and spains state financed model of exploration and colonization england adopted a more capitalist model with private investors forming companies and issuing stock to finance exploration and settlement.
having raised the funds to outfit two ships raleighs expedition arrived in the outer banks regions of what is now north carolina in july 1585.
naming the new settlement virginia in honor of elizabeth known widely as the virgin queen because she never married england had finally established its first colony in the new world.
unfortunately for raleigh and the original colonists the first colony at roanoke an algonquian indian name for shell money ended in disaster.
to begin with although the location near the treacherous region of cape hatteras protected the settlement from possible spanish raids it also deterred passing ships from stopping which made reprovisioning the colony difficult.
then conflict with local indians erupted when the colonists accused them of stealing a silver cup.
all the while relief for the colonists was delayed by the outbreak of war with spain.
the english required every available ship to repulse the spanish armada.
when a ship finally arrived three years later the new settlers found the colony deserted.

the residents had disappeared leaving behind only one clue the word croatoan carved into a door post.
the fate of roanoke remains a mystery but scholars suspect that the term croatoan was a vague reference to an indian village some 50 miles south of the settlement that may have been the colonists destination before they disappeared.
although the first english attempt to create a fixed settlement was a dismal failure the information gained by the colonists about the algonquian tribes who inhabited north carolina proved invaluable.
the governor of the colony john white was an accomplished artist who captured scenes from indian life in vivid paintings 1 18.
in his visual representation of the village of secoton john white included a scene of indians engaged in a religious ritual.
white includes a brief description in the painting noting that it was a ceremony in their prayers with strange iesturs and songs dansing about post carved on the topps lyke mens faces a number of his images were popularized by the flemish engraver theodore de bry who in some cases made subtle but important alterations to make them more appealing to european tastes.
in the case of the village of secoton these changes were fairly minor.
in other cases de bry altered the images in significant ways.

view the closer look an early european image of native americans european colonization of the atlantic world images as history marketing the new world theodore de brys engravings of the americas theodore de bry an engraver and printer from the city of antwerp in what is today belgium published a multi volume series entitled america 1590 1634 that provided many europeans with their first glimpse of the exotic new world.
the first volume of this series was published in english french german and latin.
subsequent volumes were published only in german and latin.
although a calvinist de bry cut out material that he believed would offend catholics to make the latin edition truly universal and appealing to both catholics and protestants.
in particular he eliminated portrayals of catholic explorers as brutally exploitive of the indigenous populations of the a monstrous pagan sculpture dominates the image a visible reminder that the inhabitants of the new world were un christian savages.
given the expense of producing copper plate engravings de bry concluded it was simply too costly to create separate images for the latin and german editions of his later volumes in the series.
instead he tried to make the images appealing to catholics and protestants by exaggerating the otherness of the indigenous populations.
the most striking example of this strategy occurred in an engraving in which de bry conjured up an exotic pagan ritual in which halfnaked indians parade before a grotesque five headed two tailed deer god an image that would have struck his audience as the epitome of an unholy and demonic religious practice.
the natives lack of clothing demonstrates that they are primitive peoples who lack the most basic attributes of a civilized society.
the latin text underscores the barbarism of the new world.
the author describes the pagan idol as a horrible effigy made in the form of a misshapen evil demon how did de bry represent the religious beliefs of the americas.
