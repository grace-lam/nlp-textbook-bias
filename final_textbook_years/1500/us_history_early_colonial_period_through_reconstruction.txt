viking sailors reach north america the vikings were the first europeans to make contact with north america.
they came from scandinavia a peninsula that includes the present day countries of denmark norway and sweden.
the vikings were skilled sailors who developed a new style of ship called the longship that curved up at both ends.
viking vessels traveled the rough north atlantic seas better than earlier ships because their designs were more stable.
the vikings raided countries throughout europe but they also developed large trading networks.
viking ships sailed to the british isles and the mediterranean and black seas.
eventually the vikings sailed west into the north atlantic.
there they founded a settlement on the island of iceland in about 874.
more than 100 years later viking erik the red left iceland to settle greenland.
leif eriksson the son of erik the red shared his father s love of adventure.
in the year 1000 he was sailing from west norway to greenland when strong winds blew his ship off course and carried his ship all the way to the north american coast.
eriksson and his crew landed on the labrador peninsula in present day canada.
the vikings then sailed farther south to the island of newfoundland and perhaps to what is now new england.
according to their myths vikings saw forests meadows and rivers that held larger salmon than they had ever seen.
38 chapter 2 eriksson settled in a coastal area he called vinland but the vikings left after only a few years.
attacks by native americans posed a constant threat and the area may have been too far from other viking settlements to be supported.
after the vikings left north america europeans did not return to the continent for centuries.
in the 1400s however a growing interest in discovery and exploration spread across europe.
reading check sequencing list the stages of exploration that led to the vikings landing in north america.
prince henry the navigator in the early 1400s portugal became a leader in world exploration.
one man in particular prince henry the navigator was responsible for advances that would make exploration more successful.
although he never set out on a voyage himself henry greatly advanced portugal s exploration efforts.
in the early 1400s prince henry built an observatory and founded a school of navigation to teach better methods of sailing.
he also financed research by mapmakers and shipbuilders.
finally he paid for expeditions to explore the west coast of africa.
riches in asia during the 1400s europeans had several reasons to explore the world.
first they wanted asian spices.
they hoped to bypass the merchants who had a monopoly on or economic control of the asian products that reached the mediterranean.
if a sea route to asia could be found countries could buy spices and other items directly.
second religion played a role in exploration.
christians in europe wanted to convert more people to their faith.
third many europeans had become interested in asian cultures.
explorer marco polo s book about his travels throughout asia remained popular in europe long after his death in 1324.
many europeans wanted to learn more about asia and its cultures.

technological advances new technology played a major role in advancing world exploration.
sailors began to use tools such as the magnetic compass and the astrolabe a device that enabled navigators to learn their ship s location by charting the position of the stars.
better instruments made it possible for sailors to travel the open seas without landmarks to guide them.
the portuguese also made advances in shipbuilding.
they began designing ships that were smaller lighter and easier to steer than the heavy galleons they had used before.
these new ships called caravels ker uh velz used triangular sails that unlike traditional square sails allowed ships to sail against the wind.
by placing rudders at the back of the ship the portuguese also improved the steering of ships.

analyzing how did henry the navigator promote exploration.
a sea route to asia by the 1400s portugal had several motives financial support and the technology necessary for exploration.
portuguese explorers set out to find new lands.
rounding africa even with new technology travel on the open seas was dangerous and difficult.
one person described the effect on sailors of a voyage south from portugal.
those which survived could hardly be recognized as human.
they had lost flesh and hair the nails had gone from hands and feet.
they spoke of heat so incredible that it was a marvel that ships and crews were not burnt sailor quoted in world civilizations edited by edward mcnall burns et al.
in spite of the dangers portuguese explorers continued sailing south setting up trading posts along the way.
in 1488 portuguese navigator bartolomeu dias led an expedition from portugal southward along the african coast.
a storm blew his ships around the southern tip of africa.
this point became known as the cape of good hope.
dias wanted to continue his voyage but his men did not.
since supplies were very low dias decided to call off the voyage and return to portugal.
later king manuel of portugal sent another explorer vasco da gama on an expedition around the cape of good hope.
da gama left lisbon portugal in july 1497 and arrived in southwestern india the next year.
portugal had won the european race for a sea route to asia.
when da gama reached the indian port of calicut muslim traders met him and his men.
the muslims surprised the sailors by speaking to them in portuguese.
soon da gama and his crew learned that the people of india had been trading with muslim and italian merchants who knew portuguese.
da gama made two more trips back to india.
he even governed a small colony there.
40 chapter 2 results of exploration portugal s explorations would have major results including the start of the atlantic slave trade.
as portuguese sailors explored the west coast of africa they negotiated for gold ivory and slaves.
the slave trade devastated african communities.
it led to increased warfare among kingdoms and broke up many families.
the portuguese sent many enslaved africans to europe and to islands in the atlantic where they lived and worked under brutal conditions.
the other nations of europe watched as new trade routes brought increased wealth and power to portugal.
they soon launched voyages of exploration to find their own water routes to asia.

the protestant reformation spain and england go to war in 1517 a german priest named martin luther publicly criticized the roman catholic church.
luther charged that the church was too wealthy and that it abused its power.
criticisms like luther s started the protestant reformation.
this religious movement began in small german towns but quickly spread to most of europe.
it became a part of many political disputes as well.
the protestants were reformers who protested some of the catholic church s practices.
many protestants believed god meant for religion to be simple.
the printing press a machine that produces printed copies using movable type helped spread the ideas of the reformation.
protestants printed large numbers of bibles as well as short essays explaining their ideas.
this let more people read and think about the bible on their own rather than relying solely on the teachings of a priest.
conflicts between catholics and protestants took place throughout europe often leading to civil war.

italian sailor john cabot knew that the king of england wanted to find such a route.
cabot offered to pay for his own expedition asking only that the king of england grant him a royal charter to any lands he found.
the king agreed and cabot made voyages to north america for england in 1497 and 1498.
cabot sailed to north america but he left very few records of his journeys.
it is believed that he traveled along the coast of present day newfoundland in canada.
although cabot did not find a passage to the pacific ocean his voyages were successful.
they became the basis of england s claim to land in north america.

they hired english captain henry hudson to find a northwest passage.
hudson first sailed to present day new york in 1609.
the following year hudson returned to north america sailing under the english flag.
he traveled far to the north.
eventually he reached a strait that he hoped would lead to the pacific ocean.

in 1584 he sent an expedition that landed in present day virginia and north carolina.
raleigh named the entire area virginia.
the following year raleigh sent another group to found a colony on roanoke island off the coast of north carolina.
the english colonists at roanoke found life hard.
they fought with native americans and had trouble finding and growing food.
they did not have the wilderness survival skills needed to combat the new environment they faced.
after only a year the remaining colonists returned to england.
john white and 150 colonists resettled roanoke in 1587.
white s granddaughter virginia dare was the first english colonist born in north america.
after a few months white went back to england to get more supplies.
war with spain prevented white from returning for three years.
when he came back white found the colony deserted.
the only clue he found to the fate of the colonists was the word croatoan the name of a nearby island carved into a post.
did the colonists try to escape a native american attack by fleeing to the island.
white never found out.

over the years he made many journeys along the saint lawrence river.
he also visited the great lakes led by native american guides.
in 1608 champlain founded a small colony named quebec on the saint lawrence river.
this trading post opened fur trading routes for the french throughout the region.
champlain s explorations became the basis of france s claim to much of canada.
in the late 1600s the french began spreading out from the saint lawrence river.
calling their north american territory new france french fur traders explorers and missionaries were all on the move.
in the 1650s french missionaries told stories about a beautiful river large broad and deep.

the french focused on trapping the wild animals they found instead of establishing agriculture.
beaver pelts used in hatmaking became especially profitable.
new france s small population and the value of the fur trade led french settlers to ally and trade with local native american groups.
because of their close trading relationships the french treated the native americans with more respect than some other european settlers had done.
many french settlers learned native american languages and they even adopted their ways of life.
dutch colonies in the new world the english and the french were not the only european powers to seek colonial empires in north america.

social studies skills analysis critical thinking civic participation study framing historical questions define the skill j one of the most valuable ways that people gain knowledge is by asking effective questions.
an effective question is one that obtains the kind of information the person asking the question desires.
the ability to frame or construct effective questions is an important life skill as well as a key to gaining a better understanding of history.
asking effective historical questions will aid you in studying history and in conducting historical research.
learn the skill effective questions are specific straightforward and directly related to the topic.
when we do not obtain the information we want or need often it is because we have asked the wrong questions.
asking effective questions is not as easy as it seems.
it requires thought and preparation.
the following guidelines will help you in framing effective questions about history and other topics as well.
determine exactly what you want to know.
decide what questions to ask and write them down.
having written questions is very important.
they will help guide your study or research and keep you focused on your topic and goal.
you want to know.
for example if you wanted to know more about trade and the voyages of exploration that are discussed in chapter 2 what were the voyages of exploration.
may not be a good question to ask.
this question is too broad.
its answer would not give you the information you want.
asking why was trade the most important cause of the voyages of exploration.
would not be an effective question either.
this question is biased because it assumes trade was the main reason for the voyages when that might not have been true.
good historical investigation assumes nothing that is not known to be fact.
a more effective question which would get the information you want is were trade and the voyages of exploration connected and if so in what ways.
do you see now why wording is so important in asking effective questions and why you should write out and review your questions beforehand.
practice the skill reread the information about cortes and the aztec on pages 46 47 then complete the activities below.
suppose you wanted to learn more about cortes s defeat of the aztec.
decide whether each of the following would be an effective question to ask about this topic.
explain why or why not.
3 review each of your questions to make sure it is specific straightforward and directly related to your topic.
rewrite any questions that are vague too broad or biased.
questions that are vague or too broad are likely to produce information not directly related to what a.
