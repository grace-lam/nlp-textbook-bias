the vision of the united states as a great and powerful nation suddenly seemed less assured in the 1970s.
in 1973 a dispute between the u s and arab nations led to an embargo that severely restricted oil imports.
gas stations across the nation posted signs like this one as they ran out of gas dotting the american landscape with humiliating reminders that foreign nations could wreak havoc on the u s economy.
gas shortages also threatened the vision of america as a prosperous car culture where it was the birthright of every citizen to work live and shop wherever they liked thanks to the freedom of movement that automobiles provided.
to many americans closed gas stations which reappeared in 1979 were just one sign of a nation adrift.
domestic political scandals a troubled economy and lost international prestige made the future look dim.
americans lost confidence in the federal government in the 1970s as the watergate scandal and cover up brought down president richard nixon and the post world war ii boom times finally ended leaving high inflation and unemployment.
economic woes and troubles abroad hampered the efforts of presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter to restore respect for the presidency.
americans did not agree over how to move the nation back onto the path of glory.
feminists and gays fought to extend the social justice campaigns of the 1960s while the environmental movement focused americas attention on conserving its natural heritage.
a new and powerful conservative coalition however formed around a competing vision that focused on protecting traditional values limiting the role of the government in the economy and flexing the nations power overseas.
in the 1980s after two decades of grassroots activism the conservative ascendancy was complete.
when ronald reagan a committed conservative became president in 1981 he refused to accept that america had entered an age of limits.
reagan rejected the liberal vision and diagnosed government as part of the problem not the solution to the nations economic woes.
he also moved aggressively to restore americas image as a world power.
an immensely popular president reagan restored the nations confidence in the economy and the presidency despite suffering political scandals of his own.
government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem president ronald reagan 1981 chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s downturn and scandal americans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s and few expected the bubble to burst.
by the 1970s however periodic recessions returned a shocking development for a nation that had grown accustomed to a steadily improving standard of living.
the political repercussions were significant.
still reeling from the cultural and civil rights upheavals of the 1960s the nations new economic problems exacerbated the feeling that the country was adrift.
the economic downturn partly caused by turmoil overseas coincided with a decade long crisis of presidential leadership that began when political scandal enveloped the nixon white house.
an ailing economy an ailing economy created the sense of a nation adrift by the 1970s.
in the 1960s lyndon johnson had tried to pay for both the vietnam war see chapter 26 and the great society programs see chapter 27 without raising taxes.
heavy governmental spending created both a ballooning federal deficit and by pumping so much cash into the economy inflation.
the end of the vietnam war added rising unemployment to the list of economic woes.
returning veterans entered a job market hit hard by the cancellation of government defense contracts that triggered massive layoffs in the industrial sector.
energy costs were also rising.
americans were six percent of the worlds population but consumed nearly 40 percent of global energy resources.
due to increased u s reliance on middle eastern oil the unending strife in the region affected the daily lives of americans.
the united states had offered israel strong financial and moral support ever since the united nations created a homeland for the jewish people in 1947 by partitioning palestine into jewish and palestinian areas.
israel claimed territory in palestine as its ancestral land a view supported by the united states which also believed that the world owed the jewish people reparation for the horrors of the holocaust.
to arab nations however the arrival of jewish immigrants perpetuated the history of hated western colonization in the middle east.
wars between neighboring arab nations and israel ensued detailed on 28 1 and disputes over the fate of palestinian refugees and israeli land seizures continue to roil the region to this day.
how did domestic energy needs affect u s foreign policy.
richard nixon and subsequent presidents faced a thorny foreign policy dilemma in the middle east.
the u s government steadfastly supported israels right to exist but given americas growing dependence on middle eastern oil it could not afford to alienate oil producing arab nations.
the soviet push to form strong alliances in the middle east also threatened to turn the oil rich region into the new cold war battlefield.
in 1973 egypt and syria both armed with soviet provided weapons attacked israel on yom kippur judaisms holiest day to regain territory lost to israel in 1967.
nixons decision to send military aid to israel enraged the arab world.
in retaliation the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec an international consortium of oil producing nations that regulates the price and quantity of oil sold on the world market announced an oil embargo of the united states.
by this point the united states depended on the middle east for 12 percent of the oil it consumed.
the embargo lasted five months enough time to ravage the american economy.
opec finally lifted the embargo after nixon persuaded israel to withdraw from parts of egyptian and syrian territory seized during the yom kippur war.
in 1974 the nation entered its worst recession since the great depression.
in typical periods of recession and depression high unemployment went hand in hand with declining prices and wages.
in the 1930s pumping more federal money into the economy through the new deal did not end the depression but it eased unemployment and stabilized prices so farmers and businessmen could make a profit.

chapter 28 28 2 inflation and unemployment 1960 1990 the combination of high unemployment and inflation created a phenomenon dubbed stagflation in the 1970s.
righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s the decline in the steel industry was even more dramatic.
in 1950 the 12 united states produced nearly half of the worlds steel.
by 1980 it manu10 factured only 14 percent a fall hastened by aggressive foreign competitors 8 that reaped the rewards of investing heavily in research and innovation.

in 1976 steven jobs and stephen wozniak 21 and 26 years old respectively followed in fords footsteps by constructing their first personal computer in a family garage.
the pair founded apple computers a year later envisioning a machine that would transform daily life.
the first apple logo showed the seventeenthcentury mathematician sir isaac newton sitting under the apple that supposedly fell off a tree and hit him on the head inspiring him to develop his theory of universal gravitational pull that revolutionized modern scientific thought.
the subsequent permanent logo just retained the apple.
in 1976 the claim that computers could transform the world as much as newtons theories seemed ludicrous.
yet within a year the computer age got underway when apple released the first home computer designed for the general public.
the computer revolution received another boost in 1980 when 29 year old bill gates the cofounder of an obscure start up company called microsoft signed an agreement with international business machines ibm to provide operating software for its home computers.
the deal made gates a billionaire within two years.
frustration at home nixon initially embraced the same moderate course as eisenhower with whom he had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961.
like eisenhower nixon billed himself as a fiscal conservative who was willing to accept popular social welfare programs like social security and medicare.
as the economic outlook worsened however nixon instituted wage and price controls in 1971 to curb inflation the most drastic government intervention in the economy since world war ii.
conservative outrage over his fiscal policies had little effect on nixon who intended to stay in the political center.
he hoped to bolster the moderate wing of the republican party by turning disgruntled southerners northern blue collar workers and white suburbanites democrats who had voted for him in 1968 see chapter 27 into lifelong republicans.
called the silent majority these voters rejected some but not all of the liberal vision.
the silent majority disliked great society programs that primarily aided minorities but they still subscribed to the new deal orthodoxy that made the government responsible for ensuring prosperity.
nixons budget cutting therefore watch the video richard nixon presidential campaign ad 1968 targeted social welfare programs for minorities and the poor measures that partially appeased fiscal conservatives without touching new deal programs like social security that former democrats and many moderate republicans viewed as sacrosanct.
nixon also tried unsuccessfully to reduce the jumble of laws and programs that made welfare assistance to the poor expensive to administer.
the poor viewed his proposal to guarantee all americans a minimum income of 1 600 8 500 in todays dollars as too low while conservatives opposed it for redistributing income.
nixon gained the loyalty of the silent majority by trying to tame the supreme court which under the leadership of chief justice earl warren see chapter 27 had issued controversial rulings on school prayer and desegregation.
when warren retired in 1969 nixon appointed warren burger to replace him believing that burger would influence his colleagues to offer a more restrained interpretation of the constitution than warren.
burger however had no intention of reducing the courts commitment to school integration.
the court insisted that the north develop school busing programs to catch up with the south where by 1971 77 percent of black children attended school with white children.
the 1954 brown v board of education decision outlawing segregated schools had set off massive resistance throughout the south see chapter 25.
in the 1970s opposition to court mandated integration moved northward as the silent majority found its collective voice and took to the streets.
busing sent black and white children to schools outside their neighborhoods generating opposition in northern ethnic white enclaves where angry white parents objected to big government turning their children into guinea pigs boston became a hotbed of anti busing fervor.
on april 5 1976 200 white working class irish american teenagers began an adult supervised anti busing march in downtown boston.
joseph rakes one of the teenage protesters who brought along his familys american flag later recalled feeling blind anger at busing policies that were destroying his close knit south boston community.
they took half the guys and girls i grew up with and said youre going to school on the other side of town nobody understood it at 15 rakes explained.
when ted landsmark an african american lawyer on his way to a meeting crossed the protesters path the students pounced on him.
how did the silent majority shape politics in the 1970s.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s 28 3 the soiling of old glory 1976 the image of an anti busing protester in boston preparing to ram an african american lawyer with a flagpole underscored that deeply ingrained racial prejudices were more than just a southern problem.
boston herald photographer stanley formans pulitzer prize winning photo the soiling of old glory 28 3 showed rakes poised to attack landsmark with his flagstaff.
in the photo landsmark apparently struggles to free himself from the grip of another white man grabbing him from the rear.
contrary to the impression given by the photo however the man holding landsmark was actually helping him to his feet after white youths had thrown him to the ground and beaten him.
rakes never hit landsmark with the flagstaff.
yet when landsmark a seasoned civil rights activist who had marched from selma to montgomery in 1965 see chapter 27 went to the hospital he had doctors put a large bandage on his broken nose.
landsmark knew that the appearance of severe injuries would draw more press attention.
the portrait of raw racial hatred captured in the photograph and landsmarks heavily bandaged face at how does this photograph compare to the images of racial violence in the south seen in earlier chapters.
a press conference the following day shocked white boston and encouraged the citys leaders to initiate a sustained campaign to deescalate racial tensions.
when the new school year began in september time magazine trumpeted the truce in boston by this time however the supreme courts stance had shifted thanks to nixons more conservative appointments.
after the court ruled that independent suburban school districts did not have to participate in inner city busing programs accelerated white flight to the suburbs created a core of all black urban schools ringed by suburban white schools in boston and in other cities.
the watergate scandal by reshaping the political landscape nixon won a landslide victory against antiwar democrat george mcgovern in 1972 see chapter 27.
yet rather read the document boston busing 1975 downturn and scandal than ushering in an era of unchallenged republican control nixon became embroiled in the watergate scandal an episode of presidential criminality that created a constitutional crisis ended nixons political career and helped the democrats retake the white house in 1976.
on june 17 1972 a night watchman caught five burglars breaking into the offices of the democratic national committee in a washington d c building complex called watergate.
the plan financed by nixons reelection campaign and approved by white house staffers called for the burglars to fix a broken telephone wiretap installed during a previous break in so the nixon campaign could listen to democratic phone calls.
after nixon disavowed any previous knowledge of the plot the story slid off the front pages and he easily won re election.
when the burglars went on trial in early 1973 however one confessed to accepting a bribe to keep quiet about the white houses involvement in planning the break in.
in response the justice department and senate launched two separate investigations.
washington post reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward detailed the growing scandal in articles based on information from a secret informant whom they identified only by the nickname deep throat revealed in 2005 as william mark felt the fbis deputy director.
during one senate committee hearing senator howard baker asked the key question what did the president know and when did he know it secret tapes that nixon had made of all white house conversations promised to provide the answer.
the showdown over gaining access to these tapes and what they revealed transformed the watergate burglary into a constitutional crisis over whether the president was above the law.
two competing visions of presidential power emerged.
nixon refused to turn over the tapes to the justice department or congress claiming that the constitutionally protected right of executive privilege meant he could keep advice from counselors private.
investigators argued that the president had no constitutional right to withhold evidence of corruption or abuse of power.
nixon next tried to use his authority to control the investigation.
when archibald cox who headed the justice department investigation secured a court order for the tapes on saturday october 20 1973 nixon ordered attorney general elliot richardson to fire cox.
richardson and the deputy attorney general refused and resigned.
the third ranking official in the justice department finally fired cox.
outrage greeted news of the saturday night massacre and nixon endured a cacophony of car horns sounding outside the white house day and night where protesters urged passing motorists to honk for impeachment after much delay and controversy nixon finally turned over highly edited versions of his taped white house conversations enraging his critics even further.
liberal political cartoonists lampooned nixon as a tyrant and a crook see images as history watergate through political cartoons page 850.
in july 1974 the house judiciary committee issued articles of impeachment against nixon charging him with obstruction of justice abusing his presidential powers by ordering the cia fbi and internal revenue service irs to harass his political enemies and violating the constitution by refusing to honor congressional subpoenas.
the supreme court also unanimously ruled that nixon could not withhold information pertaining to his own potential criminal wrongdoing.
on august 5 1974 nixon finally released the remaining tapes and the nation heard the president authorize a cover up plan.
on june 23 1972 nixon had instructed the cia to tell the fbi to end its watergate investigation to protect national security two days later on august 8 1974 to avoid impeachment proceedings almost certain to remove him from office nixon became the first president in u s history to resign and vice president gerald ford became president.
our long national nightmare is over the new president assured the nation.
when the president does it that means that it is not illegal richard nixon in 1977 defending his actions as necessary for national security a government of laws was on the verge of becoming a government of one man attorney general elliot richardson read the document house judiciary committees conclusions on impeachment 1974 what competing views of presidential power emerged during the watergate crisis.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s images as history watergate through political cartoons political cartoons have been a mainstay of political debate in america since the colonial era.
if the prime role of a free press is to serve as critic of government cartooning is often the cutting edge of that criticism stated herb block who drew under the pseudonym herblock.
political cartoonists like herblock and paul conrad followed the long career of richard nixon from his early days as a communist hunting congressman through his resignation as president.
their illustrations caricatured his face and shoulders depicting a long beak like nose dark circles under his eyes five oclock shadow and slumping shoulders.
some conservative cartoonists defended nixon even as the watergate scandal deepened.
one caricature depicted the media as piranhas nipping at nixons heels as he tried to reach calmer waters suggesting that he was the victim of a media feeding frenzy.
when nixon resigned a bert whitman cartoon in the phoenix gazette showed the president exiting center stage leaving behind spotlights that illuminated his foreign policy successes such as ending the vietnam war and improving relations with china and the soviet union.
to these conservative commentators nixons record as a strong leader in the world mattered more than his transgressions at home.
the cartoon herblock later noted comments not only on his situation at the time but on his veracity and honesty without using any words other than his own nixon struggles to pull the two ends of a severed tape together a reference to the severely edited tapes of white house conversations that nixon had released to watergate investigators.
by depicting nixon with the word not in his mouth herblock transformed nixons 1973 statement im not a crook into i am a crook in this 1974 cartoon.
herblock nixon hanging between the tapes washington post 1974 conrad satirized the presidents paranoia by depicting nixon as a despot sitting in the dark creating enemies lists which eventually included 30 000 people.
by 1973 the public knew that nixon had instructed the fbi and irs to harass people he considered political enemies the list included paul conrad who drew political cartoons for the los angeles times.
to prevent future presidents from using the fbi to spy on their domestic critics the foreign intelligence surveillance act 1978 required secret judicial approval for any internal surveillance of u s citizens.
after the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 congress loosened these restrictions on monitoring americans at home.
the cartoon title suggested that nixon rather than his opponents destroyed his presidency.

congress moved to limit the powers of the president and americans disagreed over the direction to take in foreign policy post vietnam.
the challenges were significant dealing with renewed soviet aggression ensuring that support for israel did not alienate oil producing arab nations and improving relations with central america.
a weakened presidency when gerald r ford became president for the first time a man unelected as either president or vice president led the nation.
nixon had appointed ford then republican house minority leader as his vice president in 1973 invoking the twentyfifth amendment to fill the office after disgraced vice president spiro agnew resigned for having accepted bribes while governor of maryland.
during his 24 years in congress ford built a reputation as an honest fiscally conservative republican and won the respect of legislators in both parties.
im a ford not a lincoln he said when he became vice president distancing himself from both the elite who bought luxurious lincoln cars and the political genius of the nations sixteenth president.
fords modesty compared favorably with nixons obsessive quest for power.
believing that the nation wanted to turn the page quickly on the watergate scandal ford announced that he was giving nixon a full free and absolute pardon for any illegal acts that he might have committed as president.
a long trial and possibly imprisoning the former president would only prolong the nations agony he believed.
ford however had misread the publics mood.
his approval rating sank to 42 percent amid accusations that he was fulfilling the terms of a backroom deal made while nixon was still president a pardon in return for the presidency.
nixon went free but over 70 others were eventually convicted of watergaterelated crimes.
ford never recovered from this loss of confidence in his leadership.
an emboldened congress reined in presidential power.
nixon had accepted large donations from businessmen in return for favors and influence.
in response congress created a federal election commission fec in 1974 to monitor federal elections.
congress also limited campaign contributions by individuals and official political organizations and established a system of public funding for presidential elections.
opponents immediately challenged the constitutionality of these restrictions.
in 1976 the supreme court struck down a provision that limited how much an individual could spend of his or her own money to win elected office claiming that such restrictions except for candidates who accepted matching federal funds violated the first amendment right to free speech.
these efforts to curb influence peddling through campaign donations had unintended consequences.
political action committees pacs which represented private interest groups such as labor business and retirees were allowed to donate more money than individuals increasing their sway over the politicians they supported.
to repair public faith in the presidency president ford tried to shape a post vietnam foreign policy that restored americas image as an invincible superpower without reigniting fears that the nation was overextending its reach or behaving unethically.
exposs about how the united states was conducting the cold war acquainted americans with their governments willingness to support dictators around the world who pledged friendship to the united states over the soviet union.
in 1974 the new york times exposed the cias covert involvement in the overthrow of salvador allende the democratically elected marxist president of chile.
with aid from cia operatives anti soviet and pro american general augusto pinochet seized power and established a brutal 16 year dictatorship that tortured imprisoned and killed dissenters.
congressional investigations also exposed cia plots to assassinate leftist leaders in the congo cuba and the dominican republic.
to regain public confidence in how the government was waging the cold war ford prohibited any government employee from engaging or conspiring in assassination plots.
complaints over how did congress and ford respond to nixons wrongdoing.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s human rights violations influenced him less.
ford rumsfeld and poured money into the american refused to cut off u s aid to pinochet and supmissile program.
ported the military junta that seized power in argentina in 1976.
ford also tried to build on nixons foreign policy successes by retaining henry kissinger as secretary of state and national security advisor.
ford initially accepted kissingers view that dtente the policy of using diplomatic economic and cultural contacts as the 1976 presidential contest approached ford to improve u s relations with china and the soviet faced a strong challenge in the republican primaunion would promote global stability by lowering ries from 65 year old ronald reagan a former the risk of nuclear war.
consequently ford abided film actor who had just finished his second term by the terms of the 1972 strategic arms limitation as governor of california.

watch the video gerald ford presidential campaign ad 1976 a crisis of presidential leadership coalition of white southerners urban blacks and union members to carry the election by 297 to 240 electoral votes.
less than 55 percent of the electorate even bothered to vote however a historic low and disappointing follow up to the 1960s when countless civil rights activists had put their lives on the line to secure this right.
on his inauguration day carter chose to walk from his swearing in on the capitol steps to the white house with his wife and family rather than ride in a limousine the type of populist gesture that he frequently made as president.
ford had pardoned nixon in an attempt to heal wounds quickly.
carter tried to remove another source of festering discord by pardoning 10 000 vietnam war draft resisters many of whom had fled to canada a move that enraged conservatives but earned him the gratitude of liberal democrats.
seeking to solidify liberal democratic support carter moved quickly to build on the liberal vision of democrats john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson by creating the department of education and working with congress to establish a superfund to clean up the nations most polluted areas.
he also appointed the most women and minorities to federal office of any previous president.
carters outsider status and his tendency toward self righteousness however hampered his presidency.
a hard worker who rose early and went to bed late he pored over every memorandum even personally handling requests to use the white house tennis court during his first six months in office.
the fiscally conservative carter had strong philosophical differences with liberal democrats who emphasized the advantages of deficit spending over balancing the federal budget.
carter believed that too much government regulation was hampering the business recovery while liberal democrats felt that regulation was necessary to protect the public.
the president eventually prevailed convincing congress to deregulate the trucking communication and airline industries.
identifying rising oil costs as the main cause of the nations economic woes carter urged americans to consume less oil in a 1977 television address that recalled franklin d roosevelts famous fireside chats.
as a fire crackled behind him carter dressed in a cardigan sweater called the energy crisis the moral equivalent of war which was the title of a famous essay by nineteenth century philosopher william james.
to discourage consumption carter proposed ending the price controls that kept oil and gas prices low and imposing higher federal taxes on gasoline.
to prevent price gouging he also wanted oil and gas companies to pay higher taxes on their profits.
carter tried to craft a vision that would appeal to both laissez faire adherents who liked the idea of lifting price controls so the market determined the price of oil and liberals who believed in government regulation to rein in corporate profits and protect the environment.
the resulting energy law in 1978 compromised between these conflicting visions.
it lifted price controls raised the sales taxes on gas guzzling cars and offered tax incentives for using alternative energy sources such as coal and solar heating.
the law did not however include a windfall profits tax on oil and gas company profits.
the country soon felt the effects of lifting price controls without also raising taxes on oil 28 4 do you get the feeling this campaign lacks a little something.
like carter ford failed to generate much enthusiasm among the electorate in the 1976 presidential election.
why did the 1976 presidential election fail to engage the country.

liberal democrats rejoiced when carter resolved to make human rights and the spreading of democracy the centerpieces of his foreign policy.
the presidents first major achievement was consistent with his desire to forge a new path in american diplomatic relations.
making amends for past american wrongdoing see chapter 19 carter negotiated a treaty that returned the panama canal to panama in 2000.
the united states had controlled the canal zone since 1903 but by the 1970s americas bigger submarines and ships did not fit through the canal reducing its importance to national security and the economy.
three previous presidents had recognized these facts and opened negotiations but carter sealed the deal and won senate ratification for the agreement in 1978.
giving up control of the panama canal failed to dramatically improve relations between the united states and latin america.
overtures to normalize relations with the communist cuban dictator fidel castro went nowhere.
carter also faced a severe test in nicaragua where civil war pitted the anti communist dictator anastasio somoza against the cuban supported sandinista rebels.
when the sandinistas prevailed carter offered them economic aid in the vain hope that he could dissuade them from creating a cubanlike authoritarian communist state.
turning to asia carter continued along the path forged by nixon and established diplomatic relations with the peoples republic of china in 1979.
this decision angered conservatives who viewed taiwan where the nationalist government had fled after the communist takeover of the mainland in 1949 as the rightful government of china.
to the communists and those others who are hostile to our country reagan fumed president carter and his supporters in the congress seem like santa claus.
they have given the panama canal away abandoned taiwan to the red chinese and theyre negotiating a salt ii treaty with the soviets that could very well make this nation number two ignoring these criticisms carter signed the salt ii pact in june 1979 which capped missiles and bombers on each side.
but as reagans comments revealed american disaffection with dtente ran deep.
in the 1970s soviet backed regimes took control of angola somalia ethiopia an inordinate fear of communism has led us to embrace any dictator who joined in our fear president jimmy carter making human rights a guiding principle in u s foreign policy and afghanistan confirming skeptics fears that dtente had strengthened the enemy.
additional signs of moscows aggressive intentions came in 1977 when the soviets began aiming new highly accurate intermediate range missiles ss 20s at western europe.
carter responded by securing natos authorization to install pershing ii missiles in western europe which could reach moscow in ten minutes.
strained soviet american relations took another hit when the soviet union invaded afghanistan in december 1979 to prop up its faltering marxist government.
the soviets were eager to keep a friendly regime in power along their border but the united states feared their ambitions might stretch into the oil rich middle east.
calling the invasion the most serious threat to peace since the second world war carter announced the carter doctrine a declaration that the united states would use armed forces to stop any outside power from making inroads into the persian gulf region.
he withdrew the salt ii treaty from the senate increased defense spending cut off shipments of grain and technology to the soviet union and announced that the united states would boycott the summer olympics in moscow.
the carter administration also sent aid to muslim fundamentalist rebels battling the soviets in afghanistan whose ranks included the saudi born islamic militant osama bin laden.
a wealthy recent college graduate dedicated to establishing an islamic state in afghanistan bin laden would later found al qaeda an islamic fundamentalist terrorist organization.
the cold war had long held the attention of american presidents.
the united states was just learning however to take conflicts in the middle east as seriously.
carter hoped to lessen tension by negotiating an end to hostilities between israel and egypt.
in 1978 he invited egyptian president anwar el sadat and israeli prime minister menachem begin to camp david a presidential mountain retreat in maryland.

israel agreed to give the sinai peninsula back to egypt in 1982 see 28 1.
in return egypt became the first arab state to recognize israels right to exist.
the united states rewarded each side with pledges of substantial military aid support that continues to this day.
befriending egypt neutralized the only credible military threat to israeli security and brought a previous soviet ally into the american fold strengthening the american position in the middle east.
if the middle east gave carter his greatest diplomatic victory it also provided the low point of his presidency.
in 1953 the united states had helped overthrow the left leaning iranian government and reinstated the reliably anti communist shah of iran to ensure american access to iranian oil.
in 1979 radical islamists overthrew the shah who fled the country.
an islamic cleric and revolutionary the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini became the head of the worlds first radical islamist government.
khomeinis intense dark eyes long snowy beard and flowing robes made him appear dark and dangerous to americans who recoiled at his ferocious denunciations of the united states as the great satan in october 1979 carter made a fateful decision when he reluctantly agreed to let the ailing shah of iran who was living in mexico into the united states for medical treatment.
if the united states turned our backs on the fallen shah it would be a signal to the world that the u s is a fair weather friend national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski told carter.
at 3 00 a m on november 4 1979 the state department received a telephone call from panicked officials in the american embassy in teheran the capital of iran reporting that a mob of iranian university students had broken into the compound.
the students proceeded to take embassy employees hostage.
khomeini had not ordered the hostage taking but he supported the students demands that the united states return the shah and his fortune to iran to secure the hostages release.
his government worried that the united states might try to return the shah to power wanted him in hand.
the iranian hostage crisis became the defining event in carters presidency as iranian revolutionaries held 52 americans captive for 444 days.
the media coverage was unprecedented and most reporters viewed the crisis as a humiliating blow to americas honor.
abc news how did carter respond to old and new problems in the middle east.
created a late night show nightline that gave constant updates on america held hostage and repeatedly showed film footage of iranian crowds chanting death to america and the blindfolded captives.
frustration with carters inability to resolve the crisis caused his approval ratings to sink to 28 percent.
how to proceed was not clear however and carters key advisors offered him conflicting recommendations.
secretary of state cyrus vance focused on saving the hostages lives and argued that the united states needed to negotiate patiently no matter how long it took.
national security advisor brzezinski worried more about protecting americas image as a global superpower.
he felt that the longer the crisis lasted the weaker america appeared to the rest of the world emboldening americas enemies.

choices and consequences ending the iranian hostage crisis explores carters options and the repercussions of his decision to try to rescue the hostages.
five months later iraqi ruler saddam hussein launched an invasion of iran to acquire its oil fields and khomeini finally decided to negotiate in earnest.
iran could no longer afford its diplomatic isolation needing to reestablish its global trading networks to fend off the attack.
after months of negotiations the united states agreed to give iran 7 9 billion the estimated value of the shahs holdings in the united states and pledged not to interfere in iranian domestic affairs.
carter hoped to deliver the good news to the american people that the hostages were coming home before he left office on january 20 1981.
instead khomeini waited until a few minutes after the new president ronald reagan was sworn into office to release the hostages denying carter a final triumph.

for five months carter brokered a compromise between these two positions by freezing iranian financial assets in the united states engaging in secret negotiations and beefing up the american naval presence in the arabian sea.
as carter began his 1980 reelection bid mounting public frustration along with concern that american inaction had encouraged the soviet union to invade afghanistan increased the pressure on carter for decisive action.

some say it was very important.
the hostages prolonged captivity branded carter as inept and contributed to his reelection loss.
to contain iran the united states supported saddam hussein during his eight year war with iran again using a repressive middle eastern dictator to advance american interests.
the hostage crisis also created a negative image of islam in the united states that future islamic terrorist attacks reinforced.
the crisis was not so important others counter rejecting it as a major reason for reagans victory.
in the 1980s the failed soviet invasion of afghanistan the camp david accords and using a secular iraq to contain iranian influence protected u s economic interests in the region diminishing the long term significance of the hostage crisis.
what larger significance did carters advisors attach to the iranian hostage crisis.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s the rights revolution social turbulence did not cease with the end of the vietnam war.
feminists and gay activists carried the 1960s rights revolution into the 1970s and 1980s striking at the heart of gender identity in american society.
meanwhile the environmental movement sought to reverse the toll of industrial pollution on the nations natural habitats.
the equal rights amendment and abortion controversies 28 7 women and work 1900 2000 as more women entered the workforce combating discrimination in the workplace became a major issue for the womens movement.
feminist political demands received unprecedented attention in the 1970s.
to eradicate gender discrimination and sexual inequality at the workplace feminist organizations lobbied for equal pay for equal work an end to sexual harassment and paid maternity leave.
these bread and butter issues became even more pressing as the economic downturn of the 1970s forced more women into the workplace.
the chart women and work 1900 2000 28 7 shows the steady increase in the percentage of single and married women who worked outside the home over the second half of the twentieth century.
changing attitudes toward married women working and declining birthrates percentage year percentage of single women working percentage of married women working percentage of widowed separated and divorced women working contributed to the increased female presence in the job market.
thanks to vacuum cleaners gas and electric stoves washing machines and dryers women in the 1970s spent less time doing housework than their counterparts earlier in the century.
supermarkets fast food and prepackaged foods also simplified the tasks of shopping and cooking for a family.
nonetheless working women faced challenges including the lack of affordable day care and the difficulty of convincing men to pitch in at home.
on average women worked 15 hours outside and inside the home more a week than men.
youre on duty at work.
you come home and youre on duty complained one wife.
with one in two marriages ending in divorce single parenting often put more strains on working women with children.
the most common reason couples gave for divorcing in the 1970s and 1980s arguments over domestic responsibilities.
the feminist movement however faced challenges convincing working women that feminism provided the answer to the problems they faced balancing work and home life or advancing in the workplace.
the press one activist noted portrayed the feminist as a total weirdo bra burner man hater lesbian sickie exaggerated stereotypes that threatened the movements growth.
many women proved reluctant to publicly identify themselves as feminists even if they privately supported the womens movement goals fearing social stigmatization as unfeminine.
divisions within the womens movement created another major obstacle.
poor minority women often saw racial and ethnic prejudice as bigger obstacles to their economic advancement than gender discrimination and regarded white upper middle class feminists with suspicion.
feminism in the words of one black woman was basically a family quarrel between white women and white men divisions between radicals and what were the consequences of shifting trends in the female workforce.
the rights revolution moderate feminists see chapter 27 also prevented women from speaking with one voice.
the feminist movement occasionally benefited from positive media coverage as during made fortelevision moments like the heavily hyped battle of the sexes in 1973 between tennis stars billie jean king and bobby riggs.
millions of americans tuned in to watch king defeat riggs a self proclaimed male chauvinist pig who argued that even a 55 year old former tennis champion like himself could defeat the best female player in the world.
riggs announced his conversion to the feminist cause by shouting equality for women as he hit the final volley into the net.
kings triumph advanced opportunities for womens professional sports.
feminist campaigning also led to the passage of title ix of the 1972 education act prohibiting gender discrimination in education.
this law revolutionized high school and college sports by forcing administrators to create more teams and scholarships for female students.
despite negative media portrayals and problems attracting working class women the feminist movement enjoyed other successes in the early 1970s.
cities established shelters for battered women and rape crisis centers.
congress also passed the equal rights amendment era in 1972 a proposal that congressional supporters had introduced regularly since 1923 that stated equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex within three years 34 of the 38 states needed for ratification of the era had approved the measure.
this avalanche of change outraged cultural conservatives who charged that the era would destroy the american family.
phyllis schlafly a conservative illinois lawyer with six children led the anti era crusade.
catapulting into the national spotlight schlafly helped forge the coalition among catholics southerners antifeminists religious fundamentalists and fiscal conservatives that pushed the republican party to the right throughout the 1970s.
feminists branded schlafly a hypocrite pointing out that she was a well educated woman who had enjoyed a satisfying career in republican politics before spearheading the anti era campaign.
shes an extremely liberated woman asserted karen decrow the president of the feminist national organization for women.
competing visions defining the ideal woman page 860 explores the debate over female gender identity in the 1970s.
schlaflys anti feminist message resonated in the southern and mountain states areas without strong local feminist organizations to offer a competing view of how gender discrimination adversely affected women in the workplace.
in the end the anti era forces prevailed.
the era remained three states short when the deadline for approving the measure came in 1982 the first of many conservative political victories to come in the 1980s.
the rancor over legalized abortion however far surpassed the barbs exchanged over the era.
between 700 000 and 800 000 women a year sought illegal abortions and botched procedures by incompetent practitioners working in unsanitary conditions killed 2 000 3 000 patients annually.
the signs 28 8 in this 1970 st louis missouri protest march held on the anniversary of the ratification of the nineteenth amendment listed the right of legalized abortion as a key feminist demand.
it remained the right of individual states sttattess to to determine dete de term te rmin rm inee the in t legality th l 28 8 women marching for equal rights these protesting feminists carried signs demanding legalized abortions childrens day care centers passage of the equal rights amendment and more female candidates for political office.
how did the women participating in this protest march define female liberation.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s competing visions defining the ideal woman what did it mean to be a woman.
cultural conservatives answered wife and mother feminists disagreed.
in 1972 gloria steinem founder of ms a popular feminist magazine argued that both women and men would be happier once freed from the straitjacket of culturally constructed gender roles.
conservative activist phyllis schlafly countered that gender identity was rooted in biology.
gloria steinem argued that womens liberation would benefit men as well as women.
phyllis schlafly claimed that the positive woman embraced her distinctly female role.
i dont think most women want to pick up briefcases and march off to meaningless depersonalized jobs.
we want to liberate men from those inhuman roles as well.
we want to share the work and responsibility and to have men share equal responsibility for the children.
probably the ultimate myth is that children must have fulltime mothers and that liberated women make bad ones.
the truth is that most american children seem to be suffering from too much mother and too little father.
women now spend more time with their homes and families than in any other past or present society we know about.
to get back to the sanity of the agrarian or joint family system we need free universal day care.
with that aid as in scandinavian countries and with laws that permit women equal work and equal pay man will be relieved of his role as sole breadwinner and stranger to his own children.
no more alimony.
fewer boring wives.
fewer childlike wives.
no more wives who fall apart with the first wrinkle because theyve been taught that their total identity depends on their outsides.
no more responsibility for another adult human being who has never been told she is responsible for her own life and who sooner or later says some version of if i hadnt married you i could have been a star womens liberation really is mens liberation too colleague marriages such as young people have now with both partners going to law school or the peace corps together.
communes marriages that are valid for the child rearing years only there are many possibilities.
the point is that womens liberation is not destroying the american family.
it is trying to build a human compassionate alternative out of its ruins.
the first requirement for the acquisition of power by the positive woman is to understand the differences between men and women.
she rejoices in the creative capability within her body and the power potential of her mind and spirit.
she understands that men and women are different and that those very differences provide the key to her success as a person and fulfillment as a woman.
the womens liberationist on the other hand is imprisoned by her own negative view of herself and of her place in the world around her.
women must be made equal to men in their ability not to become pregnant and not to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world.
this is why womens liberationists are compulsively involved in the drive to make abortion and childcare centers for all women regardless of religion or income both socially acceptable and government financed.
the positive woman looks upon her femaleness and her fertility as part of her purpose her potential and her power.
she rejoices that she has a capability for creativity that men can never have a positive woman cannot defeat a man in a wrestling match or boxing match but she can motivate him inspire him encourage him teach him restrain him reward him and have power over him that he can never achieve over her with all his muscle.
the overriding psychological need of a woman is to love something alive.
a baby fulfills this need in the lives of most women.
if a baby is not available to fill that need women search for a baby substitute.
this is the reason why women have traditionally gone into teaching and nursing careers.
they are doing what comes naturally to the female psyche.
gloria steinem do steinem and schlafly offer realistic or clichd depictions of womens lives or a combination of both.
phyllis schlafly view the closer look competing visions defining the ideal woman the rights revolution of abortion throughout the sixties and early seventies.
california took the lead in changing what the los angeles times called our archaic abortion law that only allowed a woman to end a pregnancy if her life was in danger.
bending to the popular will then california governor ronald reagan reluctantly signed a bipartisan bill in 1967 that let women terminate pregnancies in cases of rape and incest and fetuses with severe physical and mental defects a decision he later called a mistake.
texas however still only allowed abortions if a pregnancy jeopardized a womans life.
feminists felt that women not male doctors should have the right to make medical decisions about their own bodies.
in 1970 norma mccorvey an unmarried poor pregnant 25 year old sued texas under the pseudonym jane roe claiming that she had the right to a legal and safe abortion based on her constitutional right to privacy the supreme court dealt the feminist movement a stunning victory when it legalized abortion in its 1973 roe v wade decision.
the ruling came too late for mccorvey who gave birth to a baby girl and gave her up for adoption as the case moved through the courts.
in rendering the roe v wade decision the supreme court ruled that the right to privacy.
is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy the court decision prohibited states from criminalizing abortion in the first trimester but allowed them to regulate abortion in the second trimester and prohibit it during the third trimester when a fetus became viable.
the court however sidestepped a key question that would provoke much future controversy.
we need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins the court asserted.
critics argued that the court had invented a right to privacy that did not exist in the constitution.
supporters countered that court decisions over the last century had established this right.
the debate soon seeped into national politics when the democrats assumed the mantle of the party dedicated to maintaining a womans right to choose an abortion and the republicans became predominantly against the right to abortion a position that came to be known as pro life read the document roe v wade 1973 the vocabulary embraced by each side in the abortion debate revealed competing visions of what abortion meant.
supporters of legalized abortion called themselves pro choice a label encapsulating their view that abortion was a question of personal liberty.
in contrast pro life forces believed that human life began at conception not when a fetus was viable outside the womb they therefore viewed abortion as tantamount to murder.
both sides employed the language of rights the rights of women pro choice usage squaring off against those of unborn children pro life term.
the activist women facing off in this debate had different life experiences and conceptions of motherhood.
pro life activists had often built their lives around children and the home and were outraged by their suspicion that pro choice women had abortions as a matter of convenience prochoice activists tended to marry later had more education and were less religious.
they usually wanted careers as well as children and refused to allow biology to dictate their life choices.
twenty years after roe v wade mccorvey changed her mind about abortion and became a born again christian who joined the anti abortion crusade.
her reversal illustrated the growing momentum of the pro life movement which used images of children like the one affixed to the sign of this 1979 pro life demonstrator protesting in washington d c 28 9 to emphasize the rights of children.
28 9 pro life protest 1979 pro life demonstrators who opposed legalized abortion put the focus on the right of unborn children to have a life rather than the right of women to control their own bodies.
what different visions separated the pro life and pro choice camps.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s in the twenty first century the pro life movement took advantage of new ultrasound portraits of fetuses in the womb that showed beating hearts to underscore their argument that life began at conception.
unable to overturn the roe decision directly pro life activists secured a ban on federal funding for abortions.
some states also required parental notification when minors sought abortions.
gay rights aids memorial quilt the panels of the aids memorial quilt portrayed the diseases victims as sons brothers and lovers with strong ties to their families and communities to challenge stereotypes of homosexuals as diseased pariahs.
the rights revolution also encompassed the gay and lesbian subcultures that existed in the shadows of mainstream society until the 1960s.
except for a few men and women who joined fledgling gay rights groups after world war ii most gay men and lesbians before the 1960s chose to live in the closet hiding their same sex preferences from the world.
unlike blacks women and other minority groups gay americans did not have a long history of organizing to defend their rights.
heterosexual americans uniformly disparaged gays as deviant and morally reprehensible.
the american psychiatric association categorized homosexuality as a mental disorder a position it did not jettison until 1973.
taking the psychological stereotyping a step further time magazine viewed homosexuality as a pernicious sickness if you were gay and you how similar were the gay rights and civil rights movements.
accepted those societal norms then you were at war with yourself stated one college student as he recalled his own struggle to come to terms with his homosexuality.
exposure as a homosexual or lesbian could mean losing everything job spouse friends and social position.
in the 1960s the civil rights movement and the hippie counterculture assault on sexual taboos inspired some gay people to come out of the closet and challenge the ways that american society ostracized them.
the true awakening of the gay rights movement came during the stonewall riot on june 28 1969 when patrons frequenting the stonewall inn a greenwich village male gay bar fought back during a new york city police raid.
this open defiance electrified the gay community and the next morning a huge crowd gathered outside the stonewall inn chanting gay power a modification of the black power slogan that black militants embraced see chapter 27.
energized gay men and lesbians founded the radical gay liberation front in response to stonewall while hundreds of smaller gay rights groups sprouted up throughout the country.
these organizations formed gay support groups on campuses lobbied for antidiscrimination laws marched in gay pride parades and followed the sit in model of the civil rights movement by staging kiss ins in restaurants.
we should have the same right to read the document the gay liberation front come out 1970 the rights revolution express our affection publicly as heterosexuals have asserted lesbian activist barbara gittings.
the increased visibility of the gay rights movement provoked a conservative response.
in 1977 the deeply religious pop singer anita bryant known to most americans for her appearances in florida orange juice television commercials spearheaded a campaign to overturn a gay rights law in dade county florida.
her victory galvanized forces on both sides of the gay rights debate.
fundamentalist churches opposed legislation granting gays legitimacy lobbying strongly for laws that prevented homosexuals from teaching in public schools.
gay rights groups ridiculed the notion that gay men because they preferred men as sexual partners were pedophiles.
a more insidious challenge loomed ahead however.
in 1981 the mainstream press began printing stories of a mysterious ailment sweeping through homosexual communities in new york and san francisco.
acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids a virus transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids ravaged the immune system of its victims.
acquiring aids was a virtual death sentence in the 1980s the disease killed over 100 000 americans by 1990.
because in the u s aids disproportionately struck homosexuals the nation viewed the epidemic as more than a public health crisis.
the raging political debate over the status of homosexuals in america colored the competing visions about aids.
religious conservatives viewed aids as gods retribution against the morally degenerate ignoring evidence that aids could also strike the heterosexual population.
thousands of hemophiliacs and other straight americans for example died after contracting aids from tainted blood transfusions.
having just recently repudiated the notion that gay people were mentally ill homosexuals now confronted fears that they were all diseased.
aids patients told heartbreaking stories of losing their jobs being turned away from hospital emergency rooms and facing eviction from apartments by landlords who feared contamination.
the gay community lobbied vigorously for increased federal funds to find a medical cure for the disease.
still having fought so long to escape police harassment and end legal penalties for consensual homosexual acts many gay activists were leery about urging homosexual men to modify their sexual behaviors.
larry kramer chastised gay activists who took the position that sexual promiscuity was the one freedom we had and that we had to fight to maintain it even if it killed us.
and it did kill us a lot of us view the image sign at a gay pride march kramer instead worked to popularize the safe sex message no exchange of bodily fluids that eventually gained currency in the gay community.
the two images shown here illustrate the competing visions within the gay community over how to best draw media attention to the mounting aids death toll.
in 1987 the aids memorial quilt the brainchild of san francisco activist cleve jones began touring the country after an inaugural unfurling on the national mall in washington d c.
the nations largest ever public art endeavor the quilt 28 10 made the individual stories of aids visible by allowing family and friends to create a square for a loved one homosexual or heterosexual lost to the disease.
squares were the size of a human grave and they portrayed a mixture of embroidered personal remembrances and treasured possessions like jewelry.
radical activists adopted a less poignant and more militant tone.
embracing the slogan silence death the aids coalition to unleash power act up staged its first funeral demonstration in 1987 to demand better medical treatment.
protesters lay down on a busy wall street intersection until police carried them away 28 11 employing the same civil disobedience tactics used by the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
act up also conducted phone zaps that barraged officials with calls on aids related issues and barricaded the doors to the food and drug administration to protest delays 28 11 act up protestors stage a funeral demonstration in wall street militant gay activists used civil disobedience to protest high prices and slow federal approval of life saving anti aids drugs.

four days later as a result of negative publicity burroughs wellcome dropped the price of azt 20 percent.
by 1996 a drug cocktail dramatically reduced aids related deaths.
a relentless safe sex campaign and screening of donated blood also lowered the infection rate.
environmentalism on april 22 1970 communities throughout the nation celebrated their first earth day.
new york city crowds walked through a block long plastic bubble to breathe pure air demonstrators in boston protested noise pollution and population control advocates in bloomington indiana handed out free birth control pills.
earth day made environmentalism visible but the variety of causes that activists championed revealed the competing visions within the environmental movement.
for new left and counterculture environmentalists eating organically produced food grown without pesticides became a symbolic way of purging the poison of mainstream american values out of their lives.
politicians interested in securing environmentally friendly legislation framed pollution as a straightforward health issue.
to win widespread support for laws mandating lead free gas and paint they focused for example on how lead poisoning damaged childrens brains.
traditional conservationist societies like the sierra club and audubon society concentrated on preserving pristine wild habitats from development.
they supported expanding the national park service to safeguard wildness areas and provide recreational sanctuaries for over taxed citizens living in the industrial world.

two well publicized environmental scandals however one at love canal a waterway near niagara falls new york and the other at three mile island in pennsylvania convinced most americans that their well being depended on strict federal environmental regulation 28 12.
after years of ignoring residents complaints about rising levels of miscarriages and birth defects new york state finally admitted in 1978 that the foul smelling industrial waste dumped into the love canal contained deadly toxins that had polluted the areas ground and air.
congress responded by creating a superfund to clean up dangerously polluted areas spending 400 million over 20 years to restore the love canal region.
in 1979 the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor at the three mile island nuclear power plant in pennsylvania caused nearly 100 000 panicked residents to flee when radioactive steam poured into the air.
no one was hurt but the government sponsored clean up took 14 years.
despite new more stringent federal regulations for nuclear reactors americans equated the image of nuclear reactor towers with danger 28 13 and refused to accept new nuclear power plants in their neighborhoods despite a strong industrywide safety record.
not all americans applauded new environmental regulation.
a sagebrush rebellion arose in the west among conservatives demanding that the federal government return federally controlled lands to the states.
western miners ranchers and loggers chafed under new federal restrictions that limited their access to water their ability to hunt predators and their grazing rights on federal lands.
western votes helped ronald reagan win the presidency in 1980 and as president he listened sympathetically to their complaints about federal environmental policies.
an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed riding horses at his california ranch reagan did not believe that the environment was in jeopardy.
emphasizing economic growth he loosened recently enacted pollution controls on industry and reduced the size and budget of the environmental protection agency epa an agency founded under nixons watch to enforce federal environmental regulations.
which environmental visions prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s the rise of the right successful attacks on environmental regulation were just one component of a resurgent conservative coalition that emerged as the dominant force in american politics in the 1980s.
through right leaning policy institutes magazines lobbying groups and direct mail campaigns conservatives spearheaded a powerful political movement whose vision ronald reagan championed when he entered the white house.
a charismatic leader reagans unrelenting optimism changed the national mood.
the vision of a nation adrift evaporated as confidence in the economy and government rebounded.
the new conservative coalition the emerging conservative coalition known as the new right created alliances among groups with different concerns and views of what america and american government should be reshaping the republican party in the process.
conservatives differed on whether a balanced budget or cutting taxes would guarantee prosperity.
they disputed whether the government should actively promote conservative values or adopt a more libertarian approach that reduced governmental activity in all spheres.
in the 1970s the mix of ideas grew even more complicated when neoconservatives defectors from the liberal ranks joined the conservative coalition.
seeking to explain his own political journey from the left to the right irving kristol defined neoconservatives as liberals whove been mugged by reality neoconservatives focused mostly on foreign affairs urging the nation to cast off its vietnam hangover and stand proud in the world again.
their insistence that america had the right to act unilaterally in world affairs soon prevailed over lingering noninterventionism in conservative thinking.
former working class and southern democrats also joined the emerging conservative coalition.
angry over court ordered integration and busing affirmative action programs that reserved jobs or school slots for minorities and rising crime these newcomers accepted the conservative orthodoxy of smaller government when it came to programs that primarily benefited minorities.
ethnic northern whites in the rust belt resented their declining economic clout as industrial jobs evaporated and they responded to republican claims that limousine liberal elites were out of touch with workingclass america.
finally the popularity of grassroots who made up the new right.
conservative movements among burgeoning sun belt populations from florida to arizona completed the political realignment in the 1980s.
in the late 1970s simmering resentment against increasing taxes exploded into open revolt.
big business and the well to do had long championed lower income and corporate taxes.
now the working class and middle class joined the tax revolt by demanding lower property taxes.
voters in california spearheaded the tax rebellion in 1978 when they approved proposition 13.
this ballot referendum which reduced property taxes by 57 percent caused drastic cuts in funding for public schools and universities.
voters in other states soon followed suit and increasingly found the republican anti tax message appealing.
the republican party also benefited from the rise of the religious right conservative christian groups that defended traditional values and supported right wing political causes the most sustained grassroots movement of the late twentieth century.
reagan saw the benefits of reaching out to the religious right hoping to create a strong conservative coalition that would attract those interested in the so called social issues and those interested in economic issues protestant fundamentalists had mobilized their ranks in the 1920s to end the teaching of evolution in southern public schools.
after the scopes trial see chapter 21 the mainstream media paid little attention to religious conservatives but fundamentalist radio stations publishing houses and revival meetings thrived in the south.
fundamentalists ended their self imposed exile from mainstream politics in the 1950s when religious conservatives supported the nations cold war crusade against godless communism.
the supreme courts 1962 ruling against school prayer see chapter 27 incensed fundamentalists as did carters attempts to revoke watch the video video lecture evangelical religion and politics then and now the rise of the right the tax exempt status of religious schools that failed conservative catholics who shared their concerns to integrate racially.

liberal democrats however suspected that reagan had a more sinister reason for slashing taxes.
reagan they charged planned to starve the budget to force congress to undertake even more draconian cuts in new deal and great society social welfare programs that conservatives longed to abolish.
liberal democrats derided his budget proposal as trickledown economics an approach discredited during the hoover administration see chapter 22 when aid to the wealthy failed to create more jobs for the poor.
28 15 president reagan shot 1981 the last photo shows secret service agent jerry parr shoving reagan into his presidential limousine as a bullet hits him but no one realized that reagan had been shot until he reached the hospital.
why was reagan so popular.
democrats in congress were determined to fight reagans proposals.
then a nearly tragic turn of events gave reagan an unexpected advantage.
on march 30 1981 a deranged 25 year old named john hinckley seeking to impress teenage film actress jodie foster shot reagan his press secretary james brady and two others outside a washington hotel.
after hearing a firecracker like pop news photographer ron edmonds took three quick photos 28 15 the first shows the president flinching as he hears shots the second shows him turning to locate the source of the shooting in the third secret service agent jerry parr pushes reagan into the presidential limousine as a bullet ricocheted off the car door and hit reagan under his left armpit.
parrs quick thinking is credited with saving reagans life if parr had not pushed the president down then the bullet would have likely hit him in the head.
in the hospital with a bullet lodged near his heart reagan maintained his trademark cheerfulness telling his distraught wife honey i forgot to duck americans rallied to his side and when reagan returned to work a month later he presented his 70 percent approval ratings as evidence that the nation supported his budget proposal.
it passed easily with bipartisan support from conservative democrats.
the top tax rate dropped from 70 percent to 50 percent lowered again to 28 percent in 1986.
reagans image as a resolute leader got another boost when he fired 11 000 striking air traffic controllers in august 1981 enforcing a ban on strikes by federal employees working in critical industries.
liberal critics lamented that the presidents act sent a chilling message to organized labor whose membership rolls and willingness to strike declined throughout the decade.
in 1984 reagan easily won his reelection bid against democrat walter mondale.
mondale energized the democratic party when he selected new york congresswoman geraldine ferraro as his running mate the nations first female vice presidential candidate but he made a key error by stating that he would raise taxes to close the deficit.
mondale expected americans to reward him for his candor about the worrisome federal debt but the nation was in no mood to fret.
reagan scored well with television campaign ads that centered on the theme morning again in america they featured scenes of small town america where contented citizens celebrated marriages schoolchildren pledged allegiance to the flag and friends laughed together.
america is prouder stronger better.
why would we want to return to where we were less than four short years ago the voiceover asked.
many americans agreed and reagan won every vote in the electoral college except those watch the video ronald reagan on the wisdom of tax cuts the rise of the right from mondales home state of minnesota and the district of columbia with a landslide total of 525 to 13.
reagan remained relentlessly pro business throughout his presidency.
driven to free private industry from government regulations that in his view restricted its growth reagan convinced congress to deregulate the savings and loan industry.
once freed from strict government oversight these banks lost huge amounts of depositors money in speculative investments.
in 1989 president george h w bush reagans successor convinced congress to bail them out at great cost to taxpayers rather than accept wide scale bank failures that would certainly have sent the economy into a deep recession.
as the budget battles and savings and loan debacle revealed reagans fiscal policies remained controversial.
during his time in office the federal debt nearly tripled from 994 billion in 1981 to 2 6 trillion in 1988 as the hoped for tax revenue failed to materialize and the military build up continued unabated.
after a serious recession in 1981 1983 the economy began to improve as inflation lessened and business activity picked up.
the return of prosperity muted the impact of liberal criticism and helped republicans argue that people at all class levels were doing better financially under reagans stewardship.
democrats and republicans offered competing visions on the economy throughout the 1980s.
democrats lamented the increased concentration of income in the hands of the top fifth of the population.
what i want to see above all is that this remains a country where someone can always get rich reagan stated in 1983.
chief executive officers ceos of leading corporations had no reason for complaint.
their average salaries adjusted for inflation rose from 3 million to 12 million a year during reagans eight years in office while outlays for subsidized housing dropped from 30 billion to 7 billion.
in 1980 the average ceo made 40 times more than the average factory worker.
by 1989 ceos earned 93 times more.
to democrats reagans economic policies helped the rich get richer while the poor got poorer.
republicans countered that consumption was a better measurement of americans overall financial health than income distribution.
in the 1980s americans went on a buying spree that rivaled the postwar boom of the 1950s purchasing nearly 88 million cars 63 million vcrs and 62 million microwave ovens.
items previously available only to the wealthy such as refrigerators and telephones were found in nearly every american household by 1990.
while the poorest americans were not living as well as the richest their read the document ronald reagan speech at the brandenberg gate 1987 material circumstances were much improved when compared with those of previous generations.
reagan spoke eloquently about cutting taxes and slashing welfare.
he was decidedly less passionate about education housing health care and the environment often letting subordinates make key decisions in these areas.
his hands off management style differed vastly from carters micromanagement.
reagan rarely worked more than eight hours a day enjoyed many vacations to his california ranch and usually took an afternoon nap.
its true that hard work never killed anyone but i figure why take the chance he joked.
reagans detractors viewed his detachment as senility and charged that he was just a figurehead.
supporters sometimes agreed that reagan put his trust in the wrong hands.
over 100 members of his administration were indicted or forced to resign amid corruption charges stemming in part from reagans lax oversight of his subordinates who often acted without consulting him.
foreign policy triumphs and scandals reagan did more than reject the liberal economic vision he also overturned the foreign policy initiatives set in place by his republican predecessors.
he changed the rules of the cold war by abandoning mad the doctrine embraced by american and soviet policymakers since the 1950s as the basis for u s defense against the soviet union.
remaining defenseless against enemy nuclear weapons was an essential component of mad.
the ability to shoot down incoming missiles the doctrine asserted might encourage the enemy who no longer feared its own destruction to attack.
reagan offered a competing view.
let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope he declared in 1983 announcing the strategic defense initiative sdi.
challenging the view that vulnerability made america more secure reagan proposed building a missile shield that used lasers from space satellites to destroy incoming missiles.
publicly he argued that his plan was compatible with the 1972 abm treaty which critics disputed since he intended to share the technology with the soviets.
privately he expected the soviet union to go bankrupt trying to match the united states in building its own missile defenses.
despite the billions spent on research the sdi project failed.
sdi nonetheless hurt the soviet union.
a rapidly changing slate of elderly soviet leaders responded to reagans challenge much as he expected.
the new leaders increased military how did democrats and republicans differ on the state of the economy in the 1980s.
chapter 28 righting a nation adrift america in the 1970s and 1980s spending ignoring the devastating consequences for soviet citizens.
in the 1980s the soviet union spent between 15 and 17 percent of its gnp on defense compared to 6 5 percent by the united states.
pervasive shortages meant that soviet citizens spent hours in long lines outside poorly stocked stores stoking discontent with communist rule.
closer to home reagan looked for ways to destabilize communist and leftist regimes in the caribbean and central america activities portrayed on the map american intervention in latin america 1980 2000 28 16.
in nicaragua he hoped to unseat the leftist sandinistas.
sandinista aid to marxist rebels battling the pro american government in el salvador confirmed reagans fears that communism was on the march in central america and he approved covert cia assistance to the contras counterrevolutionary forces in nicaragua that opposed the sandinistas.
congress had a different view of central america.
to continue the move away from direct interference in other nations domestic affairs a process begun by ford and carter congress prohibited the cia and department of defense from funding any effort to overthrow the sandinistas.
national security council nsc director robert mcfarlane and his assistant marine lt col oliver north convinced reagan that these restrictions did not prevent the nsc from soliciting millions from saudi arabia and private donors to aid the contras.
when congress heard about these donations in 1984 it prohibited the government from using non american funds to unseat the sandinistas.
to thwart the regional expansion of communism in october 1983 reagan ordered u s troops to invade the tiny caribbean island of grenada.
the president ostensibly dispatched u s forces to rescue american medical students trapped in grenada when a leftist government seized control.
the troops real mission was to remove a government seeking cuban and soviet military aid.
by ordering troops into battle without consulting congress reagan also used his powers as commander in chief some argued unconstitutionally to restore the strength of the presidency badly diminished since watergate.
reagan supporters celebrated americas swift victory in grenada but critics viewed the event differently.
they accused reagan of using the grenada invasion to distract americans from more dismal news coming out the middle east.
two days before the grenada invasion an islamist suicide bomber had plowed a vehicle loaded with explosives into an unsecured barracks housing u s peacekeeping troops in beirut lebanon killing 241 servicemen.
iranian backed islamist terrorist groups angry over u s support for israel and iraq irans enemy then increased their assaults against the united states by taking americans hostage in lebanon.

puerto rico grenada jamaica br.
mexico city mexico guantanamo bay dominican republic haiti santo bogot the rise of the right reagans desires to end the middle eastern hostage crisis and halt the spread of communism in central america led to the biggest political scandal of his administration.
in the iran contra scandal reagan administration officials sold arms to iran to secure the hostages release and then illegally used the proceeds to support the anti communist contras in nicaragua.
the problems began in 1985 when reagan asked his new nsc director john poindexter and oliver north to devise a covert plan to sell arms to iran which needed the weapons for its war with iraq.
as part of the secret agreement the united states demanded that iran secure the release of hostages held in lebanon.
after the deal went through a few hostages were freed but the arms for hostages deal backfired.
reagans willingness to pay bribes to free american hostages encouraged militant islamist groups to seize more over the next two years.
even more troubling poindexter and north secretly decided to divert profits from the arms sales to the contras in nicaragua directly violating the congressional ban on aid to the anti communist rebels.
when an american cargo plane carrying arms to the contras crashed in 1986 their illegal action was exposed.
convicted of breaking the law the pair won appeals based on legal technicalities and went free.
poindexter and north claimed that reagan knew nothing about their illegal diversion of funds to the contras.
i made a very deliberate decision not to ask the president so i could insulate him poindexter testified before congress.
the public accepted this explanation viewing reagan as a hands off administrator who could not always control his subordinates.
with his approval rating dipping to below 50 percent reagan hoped to restore confidence in his leadership by improving relations with the soviet union.
the night before he became the soviet leader in 1985 54 year old mikhail gorbachev admitted to his wife we cant go on living like this gorbachev was referring to both the ironclad soviet control over the domestic economy and the governments long obsession with a possible american nuclear attack.
gorbachev embraced reform to save the soviet union not destroy it.
eager to reduce soviet outlays for defense so he could pump funds into the long ignored economy gorbachev also moved to reduce tensions with the united states.
when reagan and gorbachev met in washington d c in december 1987 the pair took a historic step by signing the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty that approved the destruction of all u s and soviet intermediate range missiles in europe.
past arms treaties had curtailed the growth of nuclear stockpiles.
for the first time a u s soviet pact actually reduced nuclear arms.
the thaw in relations continued when gorbachev withdrew soviet forces from afghanistan in 1988 and reduced support for communist regimes throughout the world.
like carter reagan enjoyed his greatest successes and failures in the foreign policy arena.
he rewrote the rules of the cold war and achieved a new accommodation in u s soviet relations.
the iran contra scandal however brought back fears in some circles that the imperial presidency of the nixon years had returned.
the reagan revolution reagan was a popular president but supporters claims of a reagan revolution appear exaggerated.
reagan lowered taxes for the wealthy and permanently curtailed the growth of the welfare state.
he appointed right leaning judges to the federal judiciary including sandra day oconnor as the first female supreme court justice.
cultural conservatives remained loyal to reagan even though he offered little more than lip service to their goals of outlawing abortion returning prayer to public schools or ending affirmative action.
as president reagan always won applause when he proclaimed government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem yet when he left office the new deal and great society were as vibrant and relevant as the day he entered the white house.
americans still expected the federal government to pay pensions guarantee unemployment benefits curb pollution and help educate poor children.
rather than leaving an enduring institutional legacy reagan presided over a profound shift in political vision.
his pro business policies reinvigorated faith that an unfettered free market could make americans prosperous and his open alliance with the religious right brought discussion of issues that concerned cultural conservatives into the center of american political discourse.
in foreign policy neoconservatives interventionist ideas became influential in republican circles.
finally reagan succeeded in reviving national confidence at a time when there was a great need for inspiration.
this was his great contribution as president reporter lou cannon concluded.
in a testament to reagans popularity george h w bush became the first vice president since martin van buren who followed the well liked andrew jackson in 1837 to win election immediately after the president under whom he served completed his term.
how does reagans legacy compare to that left by franklin d roosevelt.

five years later bryan tracked down eckford in little rock to apologize.
eckford went on to graduate from college served in the army and then became a probation officer.
this photograph challenges the traditional image of the 1950s as a tranquil period of material contentment and ideological consensus.
americans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity during the decade but also experienced domestic discord along racial generational and political lines.
new energy surged into the civil rights movement in the 1950s.
acts of extraordinary bravery by elizabeth eckford and others like her took on new significance in an era when supreme court rulings pushed the federal government to take an active role in protecting the civil rights of african americans.
leadership from black churches and black students infused the movement with an ethos of nonviolent direct action that forced white america to see the injustice of jim crow the southern legal structure that relegated african americans to second class citizenship.

lured to fast growing suburbs by lowcost loans and affordable housing an exploding middle class filled their homes with possessions previously out of reach for most americans.
the baby boom generation those 76 4 million americans born between 1946 and 1964 who were now coming into adolescence embraced new standards in dress music and movies that distinguished the teen generation from their parents.
some teenagers rebelled against authority in more overtly political ways.
high school and college students for instance were the ground troops in many civil rights demonstrations.
others joined the counterculture beat movement to express their rebellion against social norms through poetry novels and art.
from 1945 to 1960 americans debated the divergent political paths that the country could take domestically during the cold war era.
they pondered the effects of new deal programs unions suburbs civil rights and consumption on american society.
the changing american way of life created a sense of both contentment and crisis for the nation.
it was the longest block i ever walked in my whole life elizabeth eckford confronting a mob as she walked from the bus stop to school in little rock arkansas chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 securing the new deal legacy once prosperity returned after world war ii republicans tried to undo the new deal arguing that these depression era programs hampered the free market and deprived industrialists of the freedom to run their companies as they saw fit.
moderate democrats like president harry truman focused on preserving past reforms.
when labor unions launched unpopular postwar strikes republicans joined with conservative southern democrats to roll back new deal legislation that had benefited the labor movement.
the victory over labor however did not provide enough momentum for conservatives to achieve their ultimate goal dismantling the entire new deal.
25 1 striking steel workers 1946 picketing steel workers carried signs with slogans meant to win sympathy from ordinary americans but widespread strikes caused a public backlash against labor unions.
the labor movement curtailed in 1945 the labor movement enjoyed unparalleled strength.
government support for union organizing during the new deal and world war ii combined with a wave of successful sit down what arguments do these signs make for labors demands.
strikes in the 1930s had made labor a powerful force in american society.
this was the high point of the labor movement in american history.
over 14 million workers belonged to unions nearly 35 percent of the industrial workforce.
labor flexed its muscle in 1946 when the lifting of wartime price controls sent prices skyrocketing.
securing the new deal legacy nearly 4 6 million workers participated in 5 000 strikes nationwide in 1945 1946 demanding not just higher wages and benefits but also the right to participate in management decisions regarding investments product lines production methods and plant locations.
the signs held by striking steelworkers in this photo 25 1 outside a bethlehem steel plant were intended to mobilize public support.
the slogans demanded fairness to returning veterans gave assurances that higher wages would not lead to higher prices and proposed a living wage for workers who made such a valuable commodity.
black and white steelworkers manned this picket line together reflecting the success of the congress of industrial organizations cio in mending racial divisions that had previously weakened the labor movement see chapter 22.
as the labor unrest widened popular support for strikes diminished.
the public had little sympathy for threats to shut down the steel and car industries which formed the core of the national economy.
strikes in the coal and meatpacking industries also made it more expensive for americans to heat their homes and eat meat.
when railroad workers went on strike truman intervened.
the railroad strike threatens to paralyze all our industrial agricultural commercial and social life leading to potential starvation at home and abroad the president proclaimed.
although supportive of new deal labor legislation truman announced he would use the army to run the railroads and draft striking workers into the military if they did not return to work.
moments before he was scheduled to ask congress to authorize this legislation the strikers returned to work.
workers in other industries fared a bit better.
negotiated settlements in the steel and auto industries set the benchmark for wages benefits and shop floor practices that other companies even nonunionized ones like the general merchandiser sears roebuck adopted to maintain peaceful labor relations.
industrialists also gained in these agreements.
longer contracts ensured an extended period of tranquility with no strikes and in all settlements company owners maintained control over management decisions.
the republicans successful mid term campaign slogan had enough.
vote republican capitalized on voters dismay over labor conflicts and higher prices.
in 1946 for the first time since 1933 the republican party won majorities in both the house and the senate.
republicans hoped to use this victory as a springboard for unseating truman in 1948.
the eightieth congress immediately passed strong anti labor legislation over trumans veto.
although dismayed with the strikes of 1946 truman knew that he would need labors vote in the upcoming presidential contest.
the taft hartley act 1947 abolished the closed shop a practice that required all workers who benefited from a union negotiated contract to join the union.
the law also banned so called sympathy boycotts strikes by workers who wanted to support another unions protest.
finally the requirement that all union officers sign affidavits certifying that they were not members of the communist party encouraged unions to purge their most radical members often those who had pioneered new tactics like the sit down strike in the 1930s.
the taft hartley act was a serious blow to the labor movement.
the merger in 1955 between the cio and the more conservative american federation of labor afl ushered in a more cautious era of labor organizing that mostly ignored unskilled and southern workers.
presidential agendas truman and eisenhower conservative republicans hoped that the tafthartley act would spearhead a drive to dismantle the new deal.
instead the curtailment of labor removed the most visible symbol of what was supposedly wrong with the new deal just as the 1948 presidential campaign got underway.
to win truman decided that the votes of labor and northern african americans were more important than retaining the solid south.
the democratic party adopted the slogan dont let them take it away referring to the minimum wage unemployment insurance and social security that the new deal had granted to industrial workers.
liberal democrats successfully pushed truman to take a stronger stand on civil rights.
in july 1948 for both principled and pragmatic reasons truman ordered the desegregation of the armed forces an important civil rights milestone.
trumans embrace of civil rights caused southern conservatives to bolt from the democratic party his earlier confrontations with labor also convinced social progressives to leave the party.
vowing to preserve segregation conservative southern democrats formed the states rights party and nominated south carolina governor strom thurmond to run against truman and the republican candidate what differing responses did postwar labor conflicts provoke.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 thomas dewey.
on the political left former vice president henry wallace ran on the progressive citizens of america ticket representing a coalition of liberals and radicals upset about the assault on civil liberties at home and the nations aggressive foreign policy as the cold war took shape.
trumans campaign assault on big business as gluttons of privilege strong support from labor and blacks and the success of the berlin airlift propelled him to a clear victory in the electoral college 303 to 189 but he led dewey by just two million in the popular vote see chapter 24.
the time has come to walk out of the shadow of states rights and into the sunlight of human rights minneapolis mayor hubert humphrey urging democrats to adopt a strong civil rights stance in the 1948 presidential election for much of his second term truman focused on managing foreign affairs and fending off assaults on his administration from senator joseph mccarthy see chapter 24.
abandoning his earlier stance of merely sustaining the new deal truman put forth the fair deal proposals for national health care public housing education and public works projects.
the democratic majority that controlled the eighty first congress funded state school systems and urban public housing increased the minimum wage and continued bringing electricity and telephones into rural areas.
proposals for national health insurance stalled but congress did vote to build more hospitals and expanded public health facilities for the poor.
in june 1950 north korea invaded south korea and political debate shifted to the korean war see chapter 24.
truman wary of undermining bipartisan support for his cold war policies and the korean war did not push hard for controversial fair deal initiatives such as repealing the taft hartley act price and wage controls or universal health care.
only a fraction of trumans how did foreign affairs influence domestic politics in the postwar era.
fair deal proposals became law but his program foreshadowed the more successful and extensive liberal agendas of presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson both democrats.
by the end of the truman administration most americans could not imagine a society without social security or a minimum wage expectations that shaped the political vision of the nations next president.
in 1952 and again in 1956 the republican candidate dwight eisenhower won in landslide elections both times defeating democrat adlai e stevenson of illinois.
the virtually unknown stevenson faced the daunting challenge of overcoming southern anger at trumans civil rights reforms which stevenson supported and americas affection for eisenhower a world war ii hero.
a gifted orator stevenson stuck to traditional stump speeches while eisenhower became the first presidential candidate to use televised political ads.
he honed his folksy image in short ads that aired during the commercial breaks of popular nighttime tv programs.
america voted overwhelmingly for the man they knew and liked with eisenhower defeating stevenson by 422 to 89 electoral votes.
in 1956 running on a slogan of peace and prosperity that noted his success in ending the korean war eisenhower polled even higher numbers receiving 457 electoral votes to stevensons 73.
republican critics like senator robert taft of ohio attacked the fair deal as creeping socialism because these expensive programs required high taxes and in republicans view gave the government too much power.
the 1953 editorial cartoon who said creeping socialism 25 2 reflected the conservatives fear that eisenhower would have trouble taming new deal and fair deal programs.
the congressman in the cartoon a symbol of runaway big government holds a briefcase labeled govt.
in business housing power transport and his running head start makes it impossible for eisenhower to catch up.
the cartoon actually misrepresented eisenhowers intentions.
the president liked to say that he was conservative when it comes to money and liberal when it comes to human beings to appeal to the moderates in each party eisenhower announced that he had no intention of dismantling popular new deal programs.
should any political party attempt to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs securing the new deal legacy 25 2 who said creeping socialism 1953 during the 1952 presidential election conservative republicans criticized the new deal and fair deal as creeping socialism this caricature portrays the newly elected republican president dwight eisenhower struggling to catch a sprinting congressman who clutches programs enacted during previous democratic administrations.
you would not hear of that party again in our political history eisenhower concluded to the dismay of republican conservatives.
his victory of the moderates as commentators termed it underscored that new deal reforms were here to stay.
eisenhower did curb the fair deal by vetoing new public housing and public works projects and never offered any new social welfare measures.
fiscally conservative eisenhower believed that balancing the budget and limiting government expenditures created a favorable business environment that promoted jobs and prosperity.
he also fostered strong ties between government and the defense industry as the pentagon amassed a huge nuclear arsenal.
in the presidents view a nuclear shield protected the nation more cheaply and effectively than conventional arms or troops.
but eisenhower expressed misgivings about the domestic costs of a large defense budget as early as 1953 every gun made every warship that is launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed nine years later as he prepared to vacate the white house eisenhower suggested that he had gone too far in promoting the convergence of military and industrial interests.
in a well remembered speech he urged americans to keep an eye on the military industrial complex his term for the close ties between the defense industry and the pentagon that might unduly influence government policy.
we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes eisenhower warned.
i have always assumed that what was good for the united states was good for general motors and vice versa secretary of defense charles e wilson when asked about a possible conflict of interest between his government position and his former job as the head of general motors 1953 read the document dwight d eisenhower farewell address 1961 why was eisenhowers victory of the moderates significant.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 a middle class america by any measure the 1950s were a prosperous decade.
from 1945 to 1960 per capita consumption rose 50 percent wages grew by one third and unemployment averaged 4 6 percent.
american productivity also boomed.
with only six percent of the world population the united states produced half of the worlds manufactured goods in the 1950s.
the 1950s gave the generation raised in the austerity of the great depression something they had never known affluence.
for the first time many americans enjoyed the trappings of middle class life a suburban home filled with modern appliances and a car in the garage previously available only to a small segment of the population.
by 1960 the nation crossed a significant historic threshold when 60 percent of americans were classified as middle class.
the united states was no longer a primarily working class society.
postwar prosperity in 1948 vernon presley brought his family to memphis tennessee to escape the grinding poverty of mississippi.
gladys presley later recalled that her son elvis would hear us worrying about our debts being out of work and sickness and hed say dont you worry none baby.
when i grow up im going to buy you a fine house.
and get two cadillacs one for you and daddy and one for me elvis presley fulfilled this promise to his parents when he 25 3 and 25 4 buying on credit what they have vs what they own the before and after photos of this life magazine spread demonstrated americans reliance on credit to accumulate the trappings of middle class life in the fifties.
why did standards of living improve for many americans in the 1950s.
became the most famous rock and roll star of the era.
for the rest of his life elvis an extreme example of the eras conspicuous consumption gave away cars to friends and family.
few americans enjoyed this level of financial success but the kind of deprivation that elvis experienced as a child became a relic of the past for millions in the 1950s.
the typical american has access to amenities foods entertainment personal transportation and plumbing in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago economist john a middle class america kenneth galbraith noted.
having discretionary income for a television vacations or sending a child to college transformed the lives of american workers.
if what we lived through in the 1950s was not liberation jack metzgar the son of pennsylvania steelworkers noted then liberation never happens in real human lives an aggressive union movement seeking higher wages and benefits and the new deal safety net of guaranteed pensions and unemployment insurance helped fuel this leap into the middle class for many industrial workers.
other government initiatives also helped transform the way americans lived.
in 1944 just 44 percent of americans owned their homes.
by 1960 this figure had risen to 60 percent thanks to the 1944 gi bill of rights that offered returning veterans low interest loans and to a tax code that provided incentives for homeowners.
in addition state and federal governments constructed the roads schools bridges and sewers that new suburban developments required.
during world war ii production of consumer goods was scant and many americans had accumulated savings that they were now eager to spend.
in 1950 alone americans snatched up 6 2 million refrigerators 14 6 million radios and 6 2 million automobiles.
this represented three quarters of the appliances purchased worldwide.
installment plans helped millions of americans purchase these key consumer items.
consumer debt rose from 8 3 billion in 1946 to 56 1 billion in 1960 a trend that caught lifes attention in 1955.
to illustrate the newly affluent lifestyle of middle class americans life photographer loomis dean put a couple with their two children in front of their los angeles suburban home alongside all their furnishings and car.
the first picture 25 3 showed what they have an oven refrigerator two television sets car and furniture.
the second photograph 25 4 what they own put the family in front of the foundations of a house and automobile tires to reflect how far along they were in their mortgage and car payments.
the refrigerator couch stove and one television set all bought on credit were missing.
by purchasing so heavily with credit this family risked losing nearly everything if a recession hit and the father lost his job.
american leaders felt that their nations material abundance demonstrated the superiority of capitalist societies over communist ones where basic consumer items were often in short supply.
others condemned american materialism.
in his biting social commentary the status seekers vance packard criticized americans for jettisoning the frugality of the past in favor of status seeking conspicuous consumption.
manufacturers helped create this compare this familys possessions and home life to those of previous generations.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 new consumerist orientation.
one executive conceded that it was the advertisers job to see to it that americans are never satisfied a middle class family now considered their car or refrigerator obsolete after two or three years even though it works well financial columnist sylvia porter noted.
the move to the suburbs suburbs built in the 1920s ringed major cities and remained connected to the metropolitan core by streetcars or rail lines.
in the 1950s suburbs moved farther away from cities becoming insular communities that depended increasingly on cars to transport people.
the roads eisenhower built to help evacuate urban areas if the nation came under nuclear attack see chapter 24 were now filled with suburbanites running errands and commuting to work.
of the 13 million new houses constructed between 1948 and 1958 85 percent were built in suburban neighborhoods.
by 1960 37 million americans lived in suburbs out of a total population of 189 million.
when developer william levitt erected thousands of mass produced houses on the former potato fields of long island in new york state he pioneered building techniques that transformed the housing market.
applying henry fords automobile assembly line style innovations to the housing industry levitt built levittowns planned suburban communities where developers standardized every part of the construction process.
levitt claimed that his crews could assemble a house in 15 minutes while it took only three minutes to complete the paperwork to purchase one.
levitt passed these savings onto home buyers dropping the prices of new houses from 14 000 to 8 000.
when other developers copied his techniques nationwide the low price of suburban houses coupled with readily available government backed financing brought home ownership within reach of millions of americans.
these new suburban houses typically contained living room picture windows that developers installed to make their 1 000 square feet houses feel more spacious.
when the curtains were open these large windows also displayed a familys possessions and prosperity to the neighborhood.
suburban houses had living kitchens where families both prepared and ate their meals and family rooms to accommodate the television toys and games that brought the family together at the end of the day.
a garage sheltered the automobile that every suburban family needed.
why did suburbs boom in the 1950s.
americans offered competing visions on whether suburban living improved daily life or encouraged mindless conformity.
conflicting interpretations greeted images of idealized suburban life.
for literally nothing down americans could purchase a box in a suburban development inhabited by people whose age income number of children problems habits conversation dress possessions and perhaps even blood type are also precisely like theirs wrote john keats in the crack in the picture window 1957.
abraham levitt the son of developer william levitt fought back against these charges houses are for people not critics.
and the people for whom we do it think its pretty good this debate is explored in competing visions suburbs american dream or nightmare.
the move to the suburbs converged with an explosion of childbearing among couples who had put off having children during the depression and world war ii and younger couples encouraged by boom times to start their families immediately.
between 1935 and 1955 the birth rate jumped nearly 40 percent.
levittowns nickname fertility valley underscored this link between the suburbs and the baby boom generation.
the baby boom generation shaped american society for decades.
as babies and children they helped stimulate a huge industry devoted to diapers baby formulas and toys.
teenagers a new term to describe adolescents formed the backbone of 1950s popular culture and the antiwar movement and cultural upheavals of the 1960s.
in the twenty first century as the baby boomers begin to retire the imperative to care for a large aging population poses significant challenges for american society.
the 1950s ushered in other key lifestyle changes besides suburban living and an emphasis on family life.
as more americans entered the middle class they increasingly worked at white collar jobs ranging from clerks to professionals to corporate executives.
the effect of corporate culture on american society was as hotly debated as the impact of suburban life.
in an era when mccarthyism eliminated radical discourse as a legitimate form of political expression social critics worried that suburbs and corporations were bleaching individuality and innovation out of the national character.
when white collar people get jobs they sell not only their time and energy but their personalities as well sociologist c wright mills contended.
others including fortune magazine regularly defended corporations for extending job security and prosperity to millions.
hear the audio little boxes a middle class america competing visions suburbs american dream or nightmare.
as the suburbs grew social critics debated whether suburban life represented the epitome of the american dream or a nightmarish existence that isolated americans from one another.
to challenge historian lewis mumfords assertion that the suburbs were cultural wastelands sociologist herbert j gans moved his family into a levittown to study its residents.
as you read the following excerpts from mumford and gans consider how each links the suburbs to changing lifestyles.
what positive and negative changes do these writers attribute to suburban life.
what different futures do they envision for a suburban based american culture.
lewis mumford in the city in history 1961 contended that suburban life bred conformity loneliness and alienation.
herbert j gans defended suburbanites in the levittowners ways of life and politics in a new suburban community 1967.
in the mass movement into suburban areas a new kind of community was produced a multitude of uniform unidentifiable houses lined up inflexibly at uniform distances on uniform roads in a treeless communal waste inhabited by people of the same class the same income the same age group witnessing the same television performances eating the same tasteless pre fabricated foods from the same freezers conforming in every outward and inward respect to a common mold the town housewife who half a century ago knew her butcher her grocer her dairyman her various other local tradesmen as individual persons with histories and biographies that impinged on her own in a daily exchange now has the benefit of a single weekly expedition to an impersonal supermarket where only by accident is she likely to encounter a neighbor the cost of this detachment in space from other men is out of all proportion to its supposed benefits.
the end product is an encapsulated life spent more and more either in a motor car or within the cabin of darkness before a television set.
levittowners are not apathetic conformists ripe for takeover by a totalitarian elite or corporate merchandiser they are not conspicuous consumers and slaves to sudden whims of cultural and political fashion even though levittowners and other lower middle class americans continue to be home centered they are much more in the world than their parents and grandparents were.
those coming out of ethnic working class backgrounds have rejected the ethnocentrism which made other cultures and even other neighborhoods bitter enemies.
this generation trusts its neighbors participates with them in social and civic activities and no longer sees government as inevitably corrupt.
even working class levittowners have begun to give up the suspicion that isolated their ancestors from all but family and childhood friends.
similarly the descendants of rural protestant america have given up the xenophobia that turned previous generations against the catholic and jewish immigrant they have almost forgotten the intolerant puritanism which triggered attacks against pleasure and enjoyment and they no longer fully accept the doctrine of laissez faire that justifies the defense of all individual rights and privileges against others needs.
these and other changes have come about not because people are now better or more tolerant human beings but because they are affluent.
for the levittowners life is not a fight for survival any more they have been able to move into a community in which income and status are equitably enough distributed so that neighbors are no longer treated as enemies even if they are still criticized for social and cultural defiance.
by any yardstick one chooses levittowners treat their fellow residents more ethically and more democratically than did their parents and grandparents.
they also live a fuller and richer life superior to what prevailed among the working and lower middle classes of past generations levittown street scene view the closer look competing visions suburbs american dream or nightmare.
what competing visions emerged over suburban living and corporate jobs.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 popular culture in the fifties television transformed the home life of millions of americans.
so did the emergence of an autonomous youth culture with its own slang rock and roll music and dress.
were these harmless expressions of adolescent rebellion or signs of the disintegration of american culture.
these stirrings of generational conflict in the 1950s exploded a decade later into full fledged revolt.
the television age arrives the first commercial television transmission in the united states occurred in 1939 when president franklin d roosevelt visited the new york worlds fair.
the war slowed the introduction of televisions into the consumer market but by the 1950s the television age had arrived.
in 1948 just 178 000 homes had televisions.
seven years later three quarters of american households owned one.
eisenhower set the tone for the decade with the widely publicized image of the president and his wife mamie eating dinner each night off traytables in front of a television in their private white house parlor.
whereas in the forties americans had flocked to movie theaters for entertainment now they stayed home.
dont be a living room captive step out and see a great movie film studios urged.
many americans however appeared to agree with eisenhower who wrote in his diary if a citizen has to be bored to death it is cheaper and more comfortable to sit at home and look at television than it is to go outside and pay a dollar for a ticket many movie theaters closed and the studios made fewer films.
only drive in theaters in suburban towns where customers sat in their cars next to individual speakers to watch a movie on a giant outdoor screen thrived.
drive in theaters appealed to young parents who could pile their children into the car for a night out and teenagers who could escape the watchful eyes of adults for a few hours.
what were americans watching at home.
many early television shows dealt with the social conditions and cultural values of the day paying particular attention to family and consumerism.
in the honeymooners the working class kramdens lived in a sparsely furnished apartment and often clashed particularly when one of the getrich quick schemes devised by bus driver ralph played by comedian jackie gleason started to unravel.
his wife alice always stood her ground even when ralph threatened her with one of what insights do 1950s television shows offer into american culture.
the shows trademark lines one of these days alice one of these days pow right in the kisser by the end of each episode the couple had reconciled with ralph often telling his wife baby youre the greatest i love lucy began in a small manhattan apartment but eventually lucy ricardo played by lucille ball and her cuban husband ricky balls real life husband desi arnaz relocated to suburban connecticut to raise their son.
lucys farcical adventures trying to enter show business or best her husband always ended with her realizing that being a caring wife and mother was fulfilling enough.
situation comedies like father knows best and leave it to beaver focused on the roles that each member of an ideal white suburban family played father worked hard and came home in time to resolve the minor crises of the day mother kept a spotless home volunteered and supported her husbands career and children learned to tell the truth work hard and obey their parents.
sitcoms in the 1950s provided plenty of escapist fare.
nightly news broadcasts however brought glimpses of the wider world into american homes and played an increasing role in politics.
politicians quickly learned to use the new medium to their advantage.
republican vice presidential candidate richard m nixon was the first politician to give a televised speech to defuse a political scandal.
during the 1952 presidential election the press revealed that nixon had a secret fund financed by california businessmen.
hoping to stem the damage nixon appeared on television to refute charges that the money was for his personal use or that these businessmen were buying secret favors from him with their donations.
laying out the details of his personal finances nixon defiantly told viewers that without campaign donations only the rich could run for office.
in the speechs most famous passage nixon mentioned one personal gift that he would not return a man down in texas heard pat his wife on the radio mention the fact view the closer look choices and consequences does father know best.
popular culture in the fifties that our two youngsters would like to have a dog and surprised the family with the gift of a blackand white cocker spaniel.
and our little girl tricia the six year old named it checkers and you know the kids like all kids love the dog and i just want to say this right now that regardless of what they say about it were gonna keep it after the speech nixon posed with his family and checkers 25 5.
the checkers speech saved nixons place on the republican ticket alongside eisenhower.
like nixon john f kennedy also astutely used posed photographs like this one with his attractive young family 25 6.
by creating such images kennedy hoped to distract attention from his inherited wealth and catholicism long considered an undesirable religious affiliation for a national politician.
on september 26 1960 kennedy and nixon faced off in the first televised presidential election debate.
nearly 77 million americans or 60 percent of the adult population watched this historic event.
nixon still pale and underweight from a two week stint in the hospital squared off against a tan and fit kennedy who impressed viewers with his comfortable presence before the cameras.
by contrast nixon refused to wear make up looked as if he needed a shave wore a poorly fitted shirt and was visibly sweating throughout the exchange.
most americans watch the video kennedy nixon debate who watched the debate felt that kennedy had won while the majority who listened on the radio gave the edge to nixon.
kennedy went on to narrowly win the election revealing the power of images to sway political judgments.
teen culture and rock and roll teenagers came into their own in the 1950s.
their parents remained haunted by memories of depression era deprivation and the life and death struggle of world war ii.
by contrast in the 1950s many middle class teenagers grew up with an abundance of material possessions.
most teenagers agreed with their parents when it came to politics sharing their concern about communist expansion and the growing soviet nuclear threat.
many however adopted an ethos of pleasure seeking that often put them at odds with their parents who emphasized thrift and self discipline.
unlike their parents generation teenagers were no longer expected to earn money to help support their families.
millions of young people experienced unprecedented leisure time and longer schooling and were free to spend money earned from after school jobs as they liked.
25 5 and 25 6 two candidates one family portrait throughout their political careers richard m nixon and john f kennedy used portraits of their family life to connect with voters.
these images fit with the eras idealized image of the perfect american family which included a supportive wife two children and at least one dog.
how did politicians use television and photographs to shape their public image.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 teenagers flocked to buy record players and radios to play music marketed specifically to them.
in 1958 the coasters scored a number one record with their song yakety yak which depicts a teenager rebelling against household chores.
in one refrain the parent orders the teenager to take out the papers and the trash or you dont get no spendin cash to which the teenager replies yakety yak with the parent then retorting dont talk back teenagers are my life and triumph.
id be nowhere without them elvis presley whose stardom demonstrated the strength of teen culture in the 1950s teens freedom to create their own social world filled with slang and fads that adults did not understand disturbed critics.
by the end of the decade sociologist edgar friedenberg noted that the teenager seems to have replaced the communist as the appropriate target for public controversy and foreboding in this cultural clash traditionalists lambasted horror comic books and teen films for encouraging teenagers to revolt against their parents and social norms.
but rock and roll music and musicians provoked the most outrage.
rock and roll burst onto the national scene when bill haley and his comets recorded rock around the clock in 1955 the first rock and roll tune.
the following year chuck berry thundered roll over beethoven and tell tchaikovsky the news proclaiming rock and roll the music of choice for this teenage generation.
it took elvis presley however to make rock and roll which got its name from a rhythm and blues slang term for sexual intercourse a phenomenon.
exposed to the raw sexuality and powerful rhythms of african american rhythm and blues music as a boy in mississippi presley also sang gospel and country music in church.
melding the sounds and explosive delivery of these musical traditions with catchy pop lyrics he developed his own eroticized dancing style.
if i could find a white man who had the black sound and the black feel i could make a billion dollars predicted record producer sam phillips the owner of sun records a small recording company in memphis tennessee.
philips found his man when presley walked into sun records to record a song as a gift for his mother.
how did larger economic and technological changes make a mass teen culture possible.
americans embraced competing visions over whether the growing popularity of rock and roll meant the triumph of consumer tastes or the downfall of american civilization.
nicknamed elvis the pelvis for his suggestive hip thrusts while dancing partially captured in this photograph 25 7 presley became a lightening rod for critics who denounced rock and roll from the pulpit in the press and even in congressional hearings.
when teenager ron kovics family watched presley on tvs ed sullivan show his sister went crazy in the living room jumping up and down his mother sat on the couch with her hands folded in her lap like she was praying and his dad shouted from the other room that watching elvis presley could lead to sin in introducing presley the affable sullivan assured parents that the 22 year old presley was a real decent fine boy to avoid controversy however sullivan ordered camera crews to frame out presleys legendary pelvic thrusts and gyrations showing only his head and chest.
it took the draft to tame elvis.
presley wiggled off to military service one newspaper columnist wrote but comes marching home shorn of his sideburns and behaving the way a sedate seriousminded youngster should the new clean cut presley kept his original fan base but had limited appeal to the teenage generation coming of age in 1960.
ed sullivan showcased a range of music skits and comedy acts to keep the whole family watching together during the hour long show.
dick clark however helped pioneer television programming exclusively for teenagers with his daily afternoon show american bandstand which featured philadelphia high school students dancing to the latest hits.
the advent of pocketsize transistor radios meant that teenagers could listen to radio stations broadcasting the top 40 best selling records or independent rhythm and blues stations in the privacy of their bedrooms away from critical adult ears.
hollywood also catered to teenage tastes with films like the wild one 1953 which featured marlon brando as part of a rebellious motorcycle gang and rebel without a cause 1955.
in the latter film james dean and natalie wood played teenagers from uppermiddle class suburban homes unsure how to handle their racing hormones the two become defiant.
deans character tries to prove his masculinity by drag racing while woods character uses promiscuity to rebel against an overprotective father.
this view of the suburbs as hotbeds of intergenerational conflict and alienated youth frightened adults but thrilled teenagers.

this televised depiction of beat culture helped interject new expressions such as dig it cool and man that the beats took from african american culture into the vocabulary of white teenagers.
beat poets and novelists were not the only artists rebelling against received traditions in the 1950s.
american modern artists formulated a new mode of visual art called abstract expressionism that broke with the predominant painting styles of the previous generation.
before world war ii leading artists included the cubist painter pablo picasso who reordered the physical world in his paintings and american social realist painters who captured the lives of ordinary people during the depression.
politics informed much artistic work in the 1930s and 1940s.

the supreme court ruled in brown v board of education 1954 that segregated schools indeed violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the brown case concerned sevenyear old linda brown whose parents wanted to send her to an all white school closer to their home.
in mounting the case naacp lawyer thurgood marshall who later became the first african american appointed to the supreme court and his team based their argument on more than the law.
to convince the public and the court that segregation was wrong they needed to dramatize its effects.
to show damage and a violation of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment you had to show that being segregated actually damaged children psychologist kenneth clark asserted.
to demonstrate the irreversible effects of segregation on african american children the naacp cited clarks controversial research.
in a series of studies clark asked white and black children whether they liked a white or black doll best.
most children picked a white doll because it was nice and rejected the black doll as bad clark next asked the children to identify the doll that was the most like them.
the black children now had to pick the doll that many of them had just rejected as bad in the north black children often burst into tears rather than respond.
in the south however reactions like the one from a young boy in arkansas who laughed pointed to the brown doll and said thats a nigger.
im a nigger convinced clark that segregation taught african american children to accept their inferiority to whites.
not everyone agreed with clarks methodology so the naacp relied heavily on his findings in preliminary court challenges and then mentioned them only briefly in their supreme court filing.
the wording of the brown decision however revealed that the naacp had guessed right in emphasizing the impact of segregation on the self esteem of black children.
in reaching its unanimous decision the court noted that to separate black children from others of why did the supreme court rule that segregated schools were unconstitutional.

to prepare her northern raised son for the racial customs of southern society she warned him to think of his safety when encountering southern whites.
one morning at a country store in money mississippi emmett forgot his mothers warning.
while playing with black teens on the porch of the store till bragged that he had a white girlfriend in chicago.
hey theres a white girl in that store there one of the boys retorted i bet you wont go in there and talk to her responding to the dare till walked into the store bought candy then grabbed the arm of carol byrant who ran the store with her husband and allegedly asked how about a date baby tills aghast cousin ran in and pulled him out of the store.
three days later a car pulled up to his granduncles house in the middle of the night.
two white men burst into the house and dragged till out of bed.
the husband of the young woman in the store roy bryant and her brother j w milam threw a terrified till into their truck and drove away.
this was the last time his relatives saw him alive.
the white men drove to an abandoned shed on a nearby plantation where they beat till then drove to the tallahatchie river and forced him to strip before they shot him in the head and tossed his body into the river.

it also provided a snapshot of the killers and the vigilante justice dealt out in many small towns across the deep south.

some southern officials and citizens denounced the murder.
but when the northern press castigated the entire south for the crime southerners fought back claiming that till was alive and in hiding or that the naacp had set up the murder to embarrass the south.
why are these images important for understanding the history of race relations and the civil rights movement.

the sheriff found tills body and three days later arrested roy bryant and j w milam.

now moses wright decided to testify against the pair when they went on trial for murder.
the 64 year old wright later recalled that as he entered the courtroom he could feel the blood boil in hundreds of white people as they sat glaring when the prosecutor asked him to identify milam as one of the men who took emmett wright stood up pointed his finger and said thar he his testimony emboldened other black sharecroppers to step forward and testify about hearing till crying for his mother as he was beaten.
fearing for their lives all of these sharecroppers left town after appearing in court.
at first it seemed they had risked everything for naught.
the all white male jury took less than an hour to find the men not guilty.
they would have returned the verdict sooner the jury foreman bragged if we hadnt stopped to drink pop a second jury acquitted the men on the charge of kidnapping.
two months after their murder trial bryant and milam sold their story to an alabama journalist for 4 000 and admitted killing till.
double jeopardy a legal concept that prevents authorities from retrying someone for the same crime protected the pair from prosecution after their confession.
nonetheless the sight of ordinary black citizens standing up in court to accuse their white oppressors electrified a generation ready to strike back.
four months later partly because of the emmett till case the montgomery bus boycott began.
montgomery bus boycott 1955 the brown decision was a milestone in the fight for racial equality but by the mid 1950s civil rights activists were no longer content simply to fight for which individual choices mattered in the till case.
justice through the courts.
many resolved to use economic boycotts picketing and mass demonstrations to force white america to take note of the injustice and violence experienced daily by african americans.
courageous men and women ordinary people who took extraordinary risks set this new direction in civil rights protest.
on december 1 1955 rosa parks a 43 yearold black seamstress boarded a bus in downtown montgomery alabama and selected a seat.
she was one of 40 000 blacks who paid a dime twice a day to the white driver then stepped down and entered the bus through the rear door.
when a white man demanded her seat parks had to decide whether to comply.
choices and consequences rosa parks makes history explores her decision to stay seated.
as soon as english professor jo anne robinson heard of the arrest she mimeographed 35 000 handbills urging black citizens to stage a one day bus boycott on the day of parks trial.
robinson was president of the montgomery womens political council which had been planning a one day bus boycott for months.
parkss arrest offered a perfect moment to act.
two of her students helped robinson distribute the handbills to black schools businesses and churches.
negroes have rights too for if negroes did not ride the buses they could not operate the handbill read.
when the day long boycott succeeded community leaders decided to continue it indefinitely.
the montgomery bus boycott 1955 1956 was a year long boycott that brought a new leader martin luther king jr and a new strategy of nonviolent protest to the forefront of the civil rights movement.
the boycotters initial demands were moderate courteous treatment from bus drivers first come first served seating so no one would have to give up a seat and hiring black bus drivers.
the city administrators and bus company executives refused.
the montgomery improvement association mia now prepared for a lengthy boycott.
mass meetings twice a week kept boycotters spirits high and helped disseminate accurate information within a black community that had no radio station or newspaper.
the mia also set up an elaborate carpool system to transport black workers to their jobs and back home.
volunteers picked up passengers from one of 42 collection points throughout the city which became the target of terrorist bombings.

instead as more white passengers boarded a bus black passengers had to vacate their seats for them.
when three other black passengers heeded the white drivers request to move on the afternoon of december 1 1955 rosa parks faced a set of choices over how to respond.
choices move to the back of the bus.
refuse to give up her seat.
vacate her seat but express her outrage by participating in a planned one day bus boycott.
decision rosa parks refused to give up her seat.
when the driver threatened to call the police parks quietly replied you may do that she was arrested.
consequences on the day of parkss trial she was found guilty and fined the montgomery womens political council organized a one day boycott that it had been planning for months and nearly all montgomerys black citizens stayed off the buses.
that evening the citys black male clergy met and formed the montgomery improvement association mia which voted to continue the boycott.
the group chose 26 year old martin luther king jr the minister who headed the baptist church that rosa parks attended as their president.
when the supreme court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional in 1956 the year long boycott ended.
continuing controversies who was the real rosa parks.
the folklore is that parks was simply a tired seamstress who impulsively decided to stay seated.
this narrative leaves out key details.
parks was also secretary of the montgomery chapter of the naacp and had attended the left leaning highlander folk school in tennessee where civil rights and labor leaders trained.
she knew that the naacp wanted to test the bus segregation law in the courts and had recently participated in a mass meeting protesting emmett tills murder.
boycott leaders played down parkss activist past worried that it would diminish her everywoman appeal and that moderates might view her as a radical agitator.
some activists later suggested that this simplified tale sent the wrong message about how to initiate social change.
rosa parkss bravery mattered they agreed but so did careful preparation organization building and ideological dedication.
what is the enduring legacy of rosa parkss decision.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 footage for the national television networks that covered the boycott extensively.
television interviews with king a 26 year old baptist minister who headed the mia turned him into a celebrity overnight and allowed him to appeal directly to moderates throughout the nation.
to raise money and garner publicity for the boycott king also toured the country giving speeches.
if martin luther king had never been born this movement would have taken place.
i just happened to be there martin luther king jr commenting on his role in the montgomery bus boycott.
instead of discouraging the protesters white resistance convinced the mia to broaden its demands to include the complete desegregation of the buses.
the violence now threatened to spiral out of control.
when kings house was bombed a crowd of supporters arrived carrying knives and guns.
if you have weapons take them home king told them as news cameras rolled.
publicizing the new civil rights ethos of nonviolence king declared he who lives by the sword will perish by the sword we must meet hate with love over time white opposition fractured.
some whites had been openly sympathetic to the boycott from the beginning even though their businesses and social life suffered as a result.
others had more pragmatic reasons for helping black workers reach their jobs.
when the mayor chastised white women for chauffeuring their black maids to and from work one defiant white woman wrote to the newspaper if the mayor wants to do my wash and wants to cook for me and clean up after my children let him come and do it after nearly a year the boycott was victorious.
in november 1956 the supreme court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional.
on december 21 1956 martin luther king jr boarded the first integrated bus in montgomery with the african american minister ralph abernathy and the white reverend glenn smiley both key leaders in the boycott.
in their carefully choreographed ride pictured here 25 11 all three followed the guidelines that the mia had established for integrating why was the montgomery bus boycott a turning point in the civil rights movement.
an mia pamphlet advised for the first few days try to get on the bus with a friend in whose non violence you have confidence.
you can uphold one another by a glance or a prayer the mia cautioned black riders not to respond to curses or shoves.
when king entered the bus the presence of newspaper reporters and cameramen protected him from violence.
we are glad to have you here this morning the bus driver cordially greeted king as he climbed aboard.
the ride was not so smooth for other montgomery citizens.
over the next few weeks snipers fired into buses and abernathys house was bombed.
two months later king met with ministers from 11 other southern states to form the southern christian leadership conference sclc.
black churches they decided could help the civil rights movement devise a new nonviolent strategy of direct action that challenged segregation and discrimination throughout the south.
at first king saw nonviolence mainly as a way to gain sympathy and prevent authorities from using violence against demonstrators.
he employed a bodyguard throughout the boycott and had applied for a permit to carry a gun which the police refused.
king sees the inconsistency but not enough.
he believes and yet he does not believe if he can really be won over to a faith in non violence there is no end to what he can do smiley noted privately.
over the next few years king would develop that faith.
his social justice fundamentalism evolved from his reading of jesuss biblical sermon on the mount that urged christians to create a beloved community by winning over enemies with love and humility rather than seeking to punish or defeat them.
king was also influenced by activists like reverend james lawson who had traveled to india to study the hinduism version of nonviolence pioneered by the indian activist mahatma gandhi in the 1930s to win independence from britain.
lawson was in india during the montgomery bus boycott but returned to instruct members of the sclc and university students as they broadened their attack on jim crow in the early 1960s.

throughout the south diehard segregationists dug in.
the negro race as a race plainly is not equal to the white race as a race asserted james jackson kilpatrick the editor of a richmond newspaper.
segregationists also advanced a states right argument arguing that the federal government had no right to dictate racial policies to the south.
sympathetic to claims that it would be difficult to change ingrained habits overnight the supreme court issued only a vague directive for school systems to desegregate with all deliberate speed in 1955.
this ruling encouraged entrenched segregationists to try to delay integration indefinitely.
in a few southern cities moderate whites accepted the piecemeal dismantlement of jim crow.
little rock arkansas for instance had desegregated its parks buses and libraries with little controversy.
after the brown decision the school board made plans to integrate slowly by inviting nine black teenagers to attend high school alongside 2 000 white students.
nicknamed the little rock nine the nine teenagers who integrated central high school in little rock arkansas in 1957 became the focus of a national crisis that required the intervention of federal troops to resolve.
segregationists quickly organized statewide opposition to the planned integration of central high school.
concern about states rights and segregationists claims that integration would lead to white and black students dancing together at school social functions won over some moderates.
two weeks before the school year started the threats began.
one night a rock shattered the living room window of daisy bates secretary of the local naacp chapter.

what messages did this planned scene send to whites and blacks.
chapter 25 in a land of plenty contentment and discord 1945 1960 reelection campaign declared he would not force acceptance of change to which the people are so overwhelmingly opposed in september 1957 he decided to ring central high with state troops on the first day of school to stop the black students from entering the high school.
using state troops to defy a federal mandate fit well with the desire of moderate whites and die hard segregationists to protect the sanctity of states rights.
to protect the black teenagers daisy bates asked parents to drop the students off at her house so they could go to school together.
elizabeth eckford whose family did not have a telephone never received the message.
instead she took a bus to the school by herself and confronted the angry mob alone.
at first she felt reassured when she saw the troops whom she assumed were there to protect her.
she quickly realized her error.
when she tried to squeeze past a guard he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in as she stood there confused the crowd started to chant lynch her.
lynch her television cameras tempering the crowds enthusiasm for a lynching likely saved elizabeths life.
also a godsend grace lorch a white woman came out of the crowd to help elizabeth flag down a city bus and escape.
over the next few days as the crowds in front of the high school grew attacks against news photographers and cameramen became more common.
the television footage coming out of little rock reporter david halberstam noted made it hard for people watching at home not to take sides as they saw orderly black children behaving with great dignity being assaulted by a vicious mob of poor whites outrage outside of the south over such images put pressure on president eisenhower to act as did the negative worldwide attention that the little rock incident garnered.
our communist enemies are gloating over this incident and using it everywhere to misrepresent our whole nation eisenhower warned the country.
resistance to supreme court mandated integration created more than a racial crisis.
it also led to a showdown between the federal government and the state of arkansas.
under pressure from the white house faubus withdrew state troops.
it was the presidents responsibility to enforce federal law eisenhower told the american people announcing his decision to send federal troops to little rock to ensure that arkansas obeyed the supreme courts ruling.
with paratroopers from the 101st airborne division ringing the school the little rock nine walked up the front steps surrounded by armed guards.
why did eisenhower send troops to integrate central high school in little rock.
this was the first time that the federal government had used troops to protect the civil rights of african americans since reconstruction.
the troops melba pattillo beals recalled meant a declaration of war in the hallways of central high where white teenagers insulted kicked shoved and ostracized the little rock nine who were each sent to different classrooms.
eight of the nine finished the year.
minnijean brown was expelled for dumping chili on a white students head after he insulted her in the cafeteria.
the following year faubus defied the order to integrate by keeping the schools closed all year.
in 1959 central high reopened with one black student in attendance in 1960 there were five then eight in 1961.
the small numbers of black students in central high signified the long slow road to complete the process of school integration.

by the end of the 1950s with the nonviolent civil rights movement in full bloom the movements attention shifted from schools to segregated lunch counters.
in 1958 james lawson began conducting sclc workshops to prepare college students in nashville for a sit in campaign to desegregate the citys lunch counters.
at these meetings students studied christian pacifist principles gandhis theories of nonviolence and the nineteenth century american philosopher henry david thoreaus ideas on civil disobedience.
during sit ins protesters occupied seats at whites only lunch counters and remained there even after they were refused service sometimes for hours.
the sit ins employed the tactic of civil disobedience breaking the law in a peaceful way to call attention to an unjust law and replicated a tactic used successfully by the cio in the 1930s when workers had occupied factories during strikes see chapter 22.
sit ins like sit down strikes disrupted business making it impossible for white businessmen to ignore the protesters demands.
highly visible sit ins in downtown nashville department stores were also guaranteed to attract press attention.
lawson warned the students that their anger over jim crow was not enough to sustain them through the challenges ahead.
instead they needed to embrace nonviolence as the governing principle of their lives.
they were fighting back he assured them but in a way that broke the cycle of violence.

students learned how to ignore the taunts and blows that whites would heap on them during a sit in to go limp when pulled from the seats and to curl into a protective fetal position if attacked with blows.
lawsons nashville workshops identified and trained students who would become major leaders in the civil rights movement including john lewis diane nash and jim bevel.
black civil rights protesters had intermittently organized sit ins since 1942 but it was the spontaneous decision in 1960 of four freshmen from the all black north carolina agricultural and technical college to request service at a woolworths lunch counter in greensboro north carolina that ignited the national sit in movement.
by acting on impulse these four teenagers ignored sclc rules which emphasized careful planning before any civil rights protest.
the evening television news broadcast images of their defiance throughout the nation demonstrating that ordinary people could make a difference.
over the following weeks churches and students worked together to unleash waves of sit ins throughout the south.
in nashville lawsons group unfurled the longest and most sustained series of sit ins.
after a month of letting roving gangs of thugs punch and kick the students the nashville police tried to end the sit ins by arresting the demonstrators for disorderly conduct the students responded with a jailno bail strategy.

the contrast between the colored students in coats white shirts ties quietly requesting service at a lunch counter and the ragtag gangs of white boys come to heckle was hard to ignore noted the richmond news leader when sit ins hit the capital of virginia.
resistance to sit ins in the deep south proved more formidable and vicious.
in 1963 tougaloo college student anne moody sat at a woolworths lunch counter with two white activists in jackson mississippi.
as this photo shows 25 12 a lunchtime crowd of high school students assaulted the three and poured condiments on their heads.
the older man in the picture urged the mob to get the demonstrators off the stools and pour salt on their wounds.
the crowds heated anger convinced moody that many more will die before it is over with by spring 1960 jim lawson and sclc organizer ella baker saw that students had emerged as a powerful force within the civil rights movement.
the two leaders urged university students to form their own civil rights organization.
students they realized were willing to take more risks than were many adult activists.
employing the lyrics of a freedom now the civil rights movement movement song that urged protesters to keep your eyes on the prize baker told the students that their goal needed to be bigger than a hamburger the students responded by forming their own civil rights organization the student nonviolent coordinating committee or sncc pronounced snick in 1960.
sncc founder diane nash noted that the media and history seem to record it as martin luther kings movement but young people should realize that it was people just like them their age that formulated goals and strategies and actually developed the movement in the struggles ahead sncc and sclc often forged a crucial partnership between black churches and university students.
idealistic and enthusiastic college students white and black eagerly put themselves in the frontlines during civil rights demonstrations.
black churches provided the experienced organizers meeting spaces and funds to organize successful protests.

while print media remained important film footage shown on evening television news broadcasts of confrontations between racist whites and nonviolent protesters forced the rest of the nation to confront the realities of jim crow and racial violence in the south.
thanks to television what happened in the south no longer remained news only in the south.
the rise of a distinctly teenage culture within the baby boom generation also helped to create a strong generational bond among those young adults who joined the movement.
finally the ideological overtones of the cold war that pitted democratic capitalism against communism helped civil rights protesters focus attention on the inherent contradictions between americas self proclaimed goal of spreading democracy throughout the world and visible racial discrimination at home.

i guess we didnt know what to expect from the russians an american soldier said after the meeting.
if you put an american uniform on them they could have been american within two years the lost promise of this friendly encounter was obvious to all.

here two worlds actually met the narrator thundered but this coalition was to be torn asunder by soviet postwar incursions in eastern europe that the united states viewed as part of a soviet plan for global conquest.
in the decade after the allies victory against hitler relations between the united states and the soviet union soured dramatically.
as the contours of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union took shape two competing ideological visions an escalating nuclear arms race and confrontations in europe and asia including a war in korea heightened fears that another world war was in the making.
from 1946 to 1965 most americans viewed the world as sharply divided into free and totalitarian societies.
american leaders proclaimed that the united states was engaged in an epic struggle with the soviet union over the future of humankind.
protecting the world from the menace of sovietled communism became a key american foreign policy goal.
americans also fought the cold war at home where citizens expressed differing views on whether government tactics in rooting out soviet spies undermined american democracy or saved it.
on the other side of the ideological divide soviet leaders developed an abiding distrust of western motives as they sought to counter the american nuclear advantage with territorial and technological gains.
as each nation struggled to extend its world influence americans again confronted the crucial question of defining their nations role in the world.
communism is on the march on a worldwide scale which only america can stop senator arthur vandenberg april 26 1946 chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 origins of the cold war the united states and the soviet union worked effectively together in world war ii to defeat adolf hitler but each nation had dramatically different visions of the postwar world.
the united states remained dedicated to free markets and democracy while the soviet union embraced a marxist vision that eschewed private property and celebrated concentrated state authority.
each nation also drew different lessons from the war.
for the soviet leader josef stalin hitlers invasion of the soviet union underscored the need to secure its borders by controlling vast territories in eastern europe.
the united states feared that stalin was a hitler like dictator intent on controlling all of europe.
american political leaders believed that peace in europe hinged on spreading capitalism and democracy.
these differing often conflicting visions triggered an immediate postwar clash between the former allies.
differing goals in the postwar world the origins of the cold war hark back to world war ii.
the victory against hitler came at a huge cost for the soviet union.
an estimated 25 million soviet soldiers and civilians died almost 90 times the 291 551 americans who perished in combat.
germany had attacked russia twice in the 30 years a fact that contributed to stalins obsession with protecting his nation from future attack.
stalin also suspected that the americans and british had delayed opening up a second front in europe see chapter 23 to further weaken the soviet union causing him to distrust the united states.
this photo 24 1 of a soldier waving the soviet flag from the 24 1 soviet soldier raises flag over reichstag 1945 the soviet triumph over germany in world war ii came at a high cost for both nations.
stalin sought future security for his nation by keeping war destroyed germany weak and installing puppet regimes throughout eastern europe.
how does this photograph symbolize the soviet victory over germany.
origins of the cold war i have never been talked to like that in my life soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov to truman carry out your agreements and you wont get talked to like that trumans retort angered over the soviets refusal to hold democratic elections in postwar poland roof of the reichstag the german parliament building above the ruins of berlin illustrated germanys complete defeat at the end of world war ii.
it also represented a past that the soviet union had no intention of repeating.
to protect his borders stalin installed puppet communist governments throughout eastern europe to create a buffer zone between germany and the soviet union.
he also tried to keep germany as weak as possible by carting off german heavy machinery to the soviet union disarming the germany military and requiring large reparation payments.
in the postwar era stalin fully expected to retain his firm grip on power within the soviet union.
standing only five feet four inches tall with a bushy mustache yellowed teeth from smoking and a pockmarked face stalin was not physically imposing.
in this case however images were deceiving.
an unforewarned visitor would never have guessed what depths of calculation ambition love of power jealously cruelty and sly vindictiveness lurked behind this unpretentious faade an american diplomat noted.
stalin had been responsible for the deaths of nearly ten million soviet citizens before world war ii a result of failed agricultural policies that created widespread famine and relentless executions of all suspected opponents.
the soviet dictator was willing to sacrifice countless more lives to achieve his new territorial objectives.
the postwar goals on the american side reflected lingering dismay over the nations failure to prevent the rise of expansionist regimes in japan and germany during the 1930s.
before his death in april 1945 president franklin d roosevelt had argued that american leadership in the new united nations un could promote a peaceful future by deterring and punishing aggression before it spun out of control.
roosevelt also stressed the importance of preventing another global depression like the one that had helped bring hitler to power and had fueled non interventionist sentiment in the united states.
by themselves these differing ideas on how to maintain peace in europe did not necessarily guarantee a future clash between the united states and the soviet union.
during the war the united states and britain had accepted that the soviet union would exert considerable postwar political influence over eastern europe.
fdr and british prime minister winston churchill however had exacted a promise from stalin to hold free elections in the region.
stalin had offered some backing for western postwar schemes agreeing to support the un and a joint occupation of a defeated germany.
when harry truman became president after roosevelts death even the first signs of soviet intransigence on fulfilling its wartime agreements failed to produce a permanent rift.
to put pressure on stalin to hold free elections in soviet occupied poland truman abruptly canceled lend lease payments thereby denying much needed aid to the war torn soviet union.
when the soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov called on the new president in the white house truman went even further berating molotov for stalins failure to schedule the promised elections.
the long term impact of this heated exchange was minimal however.
truman quickly sent an emissary to moscow to patch things up with stalin.
as a gesture of goodwill he also reversed his decision to suspend lend lease shipments to the soviet union.
the american vision takes shape kennans long telegram over time however these initial skirmishes developed into the cold war.
this intense ideological conflict between the united states and the soviet union and their allies led to hot wars around the globe although the americans and soviets never fought each other directly.
in the opening phases of the cold war each side focused on defining how did differing memories of the recent past shape u s and soviet goals in postwar europe.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 the exact threat that the other posed.
at the heart of this clash lay both conflicting visions of the future and a mutual distrust that only deepened whenever the balance of power threatened to shift dramatically in favor of one nation or the other.
to stalin the american monopoly on nuclear weapons placed the soviet union at a strategic disadvantage that he intended to remedy as quickly as possible.
for the united states stalins attempt in 1946 to use military force to extend his reach into the middle east and mediterranean raised concerns that the soviet leader sought world domination.
tensions mounted in 1946 when stalin gave a belligerent speech predicting the inevitable triumph of communism over capitalism.
concerned state department officials asked the american embassy in moscow for more information about stalins intentions.
the response was the long telegram an influential 5 000 word missive in which diplomat george f kennan outlined why america needed to develop an aggressive foreign policy aimed at containing soviet expansionist impulses.
kennan concluded that stalin needed an outside enemy to keep himself in power because an external threat kept the soviet public from focusing on his ruthless dictatorship.
stalin kennan also explained believed that conflicts between capitalist societies would lead to their demise allowing communism to triumph when capitalist societies collapsed.
given this soviet mind set negotiations to resolve differences between the two nations would be fruitless kennan advised.
he suggested strengthening western style capitalist and democratic structures to foil communist efforts to woo impoverished peoples.
he predicted that stalin would moderate his ambitions only if he encountered strong and steady resistance from the west each time he tried to expand beyond the western accepted soviet sphere of influence in eastern europe.
it is clear that the main element of any u s policy toward the soviet union must be that of a long term patient but firm and vigilant containment of russian expansive tendencies kennan wrote in a version of the telegram that he published in 1947 under the pseudonym mr x in foreign affairs magazine.
with this one statement kennan articulated the philosophical foundation for containment the label affixed to multiple american foreign policy initiatives meant to prevent the soviet union from increasing its influence around the globe.
kennan had what analysis did kennans long telegram offer of stalins beliefs and behavior.
economic and political policies in mind when he penned these words but hard liners in the truman administration seized on his analysis to craft a new vision of u s military engagement in the world.
a month after kennan sent his long telegram the former british prime minister winston churchill visited westminster college in fulton missouri where he used kennans words to underscore that a military not just ideological standoff lay ahead.
in his speech churchill declared that there was nothing the soviets admire so much as strength and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for military weakness stalin accused churchill of trying to provoke a war with his comment that an iron curtain churchills characterization of the military and ideological barrier erected by the soviet union separated western and eastern europe into free and dominated halves.
many american newspapers agreed denouncing churchills speech as too belligerent.
the truman doctrine and the marshall plan turning the principles of containment into concrete action that had public approval took another year.
by the end of 1947 the truman doctrine and the marshall plan established containment as the new course of american foreign policy a direction strengthened even further in 1949 with the creation of a post world war ii military alliance between the u s and western european powers through the north atlantic treaty organization nato.
these initiatives evolved in response to a series of crises in europe portrayed in 24 2.

read the document winston churchill iron curtain speech march 5 1946 what new role did the united states play in western europe after world war ii.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 in 1947 truman briefly returned to fdrs notion of working through the un to resolve international disputes.
that year the un successfully pressured stalin into removing soviet troops from northern iran.
truman also stationed the american sixth fleet in the mediterranean to prevent the soviets from seizing turkish controlled shipping lanes through the dardanelles.
stalin accepted the setback in oilrich iran without fanfare but he continued to demand unrestricted naval access through the dardanelles passage the only way for soviet military and commercial vessels to travel from the black sea to the mediterranean.
in 1947 stalin sent troops to the turkish soviet border to force turkey to keep the passage open.
the sense of crisis in the eastern mediterranean soon deepened encompassing both turkey and greece.
throughout 1946 the british had supported the greek monarchy in its efforts to subdue greek communist rebels and had sent aid to turkey to help it stand firm against the soviet union.
in 1947 as part of a general decision to renounce its worldwide imperial role a financially strapped britain informed the united states that it could no longer give economic or military aid to greece and turkey.
fearing that the british withdrawal meant certain communist success in greece and turkey truman asked congress to grant american assistance to these countries.
under secretary of state dean acheson outlined the threat to america in a meeting with congressional leaders.
like apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one acheson explained the corruption of greece would carry the infection of communism to western europe africa and the middle east.
in preparing his speech before congress in 1947 truman pondered how to convince the public that events in far off greece and turkey necessitated an unprecedented peacetime interference in european affairs.
scare the hell out of the american people republican senator arthur vandenberg suggested.
truman followed this advice.
dividing the world into us and them he told americans that at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life.
the choice is too often not a free one the western side of the divide championed democracy and freedom.
on the other were communist states where terror and oppression a controlled press and radio fixed elections and the suppression of personal freedom were parts of daily life.
drawing a line in the sand to stop the spread of communism was the nations responsibility to the how did the truman administration convince the public to accept a new direction in u s foreign policy.
world and the only way to protect the american way of life at home.
while asking specifically to help greece and turkey in this speech truman set forth a more expansive view of americas global responsibilities asking the country to abandon its traditional non interventionist stance.
instead the president proposed the truman doctrine a foreign policy initiative that gave the united states an active role in stopping the global spread of communism by supporting free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures the administration almost immediately used these principles to justify helping western europe as well.
in the eastern mediterranean the united states wanted to prevent communist armies from taking over.
in war torn western europe the american government feared that hungry exhausted citizens might voluntarily turn to communism which promised bread for all.
free elections in western europe offered the grim possibility that communists might be voted into power.
embracing kennans vision secretary of state george c marshall the former army chief of staff who had designed the victorious american strategy in world war ii suggested offering massive financial aid to help european capitalistic economies recover.
the marshall plan 1948 1952 aimed to restore europeans faith in capitalism by sending 13 billion 119 billion in todays dollars overseas to rebuild europes ruined roads bridges factories and farms.
our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and chaos marshall claimed avoiding the dualistic us against them rhetoric of the truman doctrine.
based on the certainty that widespread economic suffering in the 1930s had caused desperate people to embrace fascism which then led to world war ii the marshall plan explicitly linked peace with prosperity.
all european nations including the soviet union were invited to submit proposals for aid.
stalin briefly entertained the idea of applying for american funds to rebuild his devastated nation but as marshall and truman expected he quickly abandoned this idea.
instead the soviets publicly denounced the plan as an american plot to colonize europe and refused to allow eastern european nations to participate.
besides cash the marshall plan offered european nations technical and management advice that helped spread american farming techniques labor policies and manufacturing practices.
the economic recovery of western europe under the marshall plan furthered the ideological watch the video president truman and the threat of communism origins of the cold war 24 3 american view of the marshall plan the marshall plan is portrayed as a lifeline offered by the united states to help a desperate western europe pull itself out of war inflicted misery and away from the influence of the soviet union seen in the distance.
divide between the united states and the soviet union.
these political cartoons 24 3 and 24 4 show the conflicting views of the united states and the soviet union.
the american cartoonist daniel r fitzpatrick 24 3 portrays the marshall plan as a lifeline to western europe pulling people out of war inflicted misery and away from the looming soviet menace represented by the distant towers of the kemlin in moscow a recognizable symbol of the soviet union to americans.
americans took pride in the wave of western european prosperity that resulted from the marshall plan making it one of the great economic success stories of the cold war.
the contrasting soviet view critiques capitalism as an exploitive class based system that enriched a few at the expense of many.
published in the soviet magazine krokodil the soviet cartoon 24 4 shows european leaders groveling at the feet of their american lord depicted as a paunchy uncle sam relaxing with his feet on their backs.
this cartoon implied that the marshall plan rather than fostering recovery enslaved western europe to the united states which grew richer by the day.
there was some truth to the soviet claim that the marshall plan which ran from 1948 to 1952 strengthened the american economy.
western european nations spent most of their funds in the united states on raw materials food machines and fuel creating a taste for american goods that continued even after the plan ended.
the berlin airlift and nato containment quickly evolved into more than a vision of american financial assistance for struggling governments and economies overseas.
by 1949 it also meant a firm military commitment to defend western european nations that allied themselves with america.
almost overnight the united states shed its traditional reluctance to intervene militarily in european affairs as americans became convinced that only they could stop stalin from controlling europe.
in 1948 stalin supported a coup by czech communists that overthrew the only democratic government in eastern europe.
the quick demise of democracy in czechoslovakia caused the west to fear that germany with its wrecked economy and nonexistent military might be the next target for a soviet inspired communist revolution.
with the country still divided into four occupied zones american british french and soviet the german economy was in shambles.
keeping germany weak to punish it for world war ii initially a shared american and soviet objective made little strategic sense as the soviet menace grew.
by 1948 the united states saw strengthening germany as a way to halt the soviet expansionist drive across europe.

the united states faced difficult choices.
one option was to try to breach the blockade by sending an armed convoy down the autobahn the german name for freeway with permission to fire back if attacked by soviet forces.
in the midst of a difficult election campaign truman doubted americans willingness to fight the soviet union to help a recent enemy.
the other option was to try to circumvent the blockade by supplying the westernoccupied sectors of berlin from the air.
the chances of an airlift working appeared slim since each plane could carry only three tons of supplies and the west normally sent an average of 12 000 tons of supplies a day to sustain a combined population of 2 3 million in their three zones.
faced with two unappealing choices truman gambled on the airlift and won.
in mind the united states britain and france began discussing consolidating their separate occupation zones of germany to form a new democratic german government and offering it marshall plan funds to bolster its economy.
the soviet union firmly opposed any plan for rebuilding germany and protested that its former allies were violating the 1945 yalta agreement which had stated that all four nations had to agree before any restructuring of germany could occur.
as the west and the soviet union argued the stakes rose precipitously.
to pressure the united states britain and france to abandon either their plan to reunify germany or their stake in berlin stalin ordered his army to stop all overland traffic between the western and soviet zones of germany.
berlin lay in the heart of the sovietoccupied sector but at the end of world war ii the allies had agreed to divide the german capital into four zones of occupation as portrayed on the map 24 5.
to supply and reach their respective zones in berlin the americans british and french needed to travel on roads rail lines and waterways that ran through the soviet sector of germany.
stalin now barred them from using these facilities setting in motion the first direct the situation was dark and full of danger state department official george f kennan on the soviet blockade of berlin in 1948 in the berlin airlift 1948 1949 american and british planes resupplied west berlin for nearly a year to stymie the soviet blockade of the city.
it was a brilliant success both a spectacular logistical feat and a propaganda coup for the united states worldwide.
in sharp contrast to dour soviet soldiers turning away convoys carrying needed food and medicine the world saw photographs of german children cheering the arrival of american and british planes.
this photo 24 6 underscored how much the world had changed in just three years.
the children stood on the rubble of a building destroyed by allied bombers during the war.
instead of fleeing for their lives as american planes approached they now welcomed the americans as saviors for a city where strict rationing meant most children received only gruel hot milk and flour for their noontime meal.
lieutenant gail halvorsen was so touched by the sight of children scanning the skies for food planes that he attached candy bars and gum to which international disputes led to the 1948 1949 soviet blockade of berlin.

the pilot eventually just mailed him a package of candy after landing in west berlin.
the two later met and became lifelong friends.
images and stories like these convinced americans of the stark contrast between western humanitarian impulses and soviet oppression.
they also boosted truman in the 1948 presidential campaign as he squared off against the republican challenger thomas dewey who led in the polls and two other third party candidates.
faced with public dissatisfaction over rampant inflation at home and a badly divided democratic party the berlin airlift bolstered trumans image as a resolute leader.
truman could not correct all his political problems with photographs however.
the 1948 presidential campaign presented voters with sharply competing visions of what direction the country should take.
angry over trumans proposal that the federal government investigate racial discrimination in voting and employment many conservative southern democrats supported governor strom thurmond of south carolina in his presidential bid as a segregationist candidate for the states rights party.
meanwhile liberal democrats upset with trumans tepid reform agenda see chapter 25 formed the progressive party and nominated henry a wallace who championed national health insurance.
the former vice presidents downplaying of the soviet threat brought charges that wallace had communist sympathies.
dewey who had run against fdr in 1944 was a moderate republican and like truman supported civil rights and containing communism.
many believed that the presidents unpopularity and the three way split within the democratic party assured deweys election.
determined to give them hell truman traveled nearly 22 000 miles during the campaign appealing to the new deal coalition of farmers northern blacks catholics unions and liberals who had secured fdrs victory in 1936.
deweys unwillingness to attack the presidents foreign policies during this time of international crisis also helped truman.

thanks to votes from african americans and labor truman won a second term with 303 electoral votes and 49 5 percent of the popular vote defeating dewey who received 189 electoral votes and 45 1 percent of the popular vote thurmond 39 electoral votes 2 4 percent of the popular vote and wallace no electoral votes 2 4 percent of the popular vote.
this victory surprised many including the chicago daily tribune which tried to get a jump on the competition by declaring dewey the victor on election night before all the votes were counted.
in a photo 24 7 that became an instant classic a jubilant truman held the paper and its erroneous headline dewey defeats truman above his head the next morning when his victory was confirmed.
besides helping truman win the election the sight of wave after wave of planes arriving 24 hours a day in berlin also demonstrated americas strength and resolve to the soviet union.
stalin finally admitted defeat and revoked the why was nato an important development in the cold war.
blockade on may 12 1949.
the capitalist enclave in the heart of the soviet sector of germany had survived.
by that time the americans british and french had created the federal republic of germany or west germany out of their three occupied zones.
in response the soviets organized a communist led german government in their sector the german democratic republic or east germany.
germany was now formally divided into two separate states.
after the soviet backed coup in czechoslovakia and the blockade of berlin the united states refined its policy of containment.
these events had shattered any chance of creating consensus within the truman administration around kennans vision that economic aid through the marshall plan could safeguard democracy and prosperity in western europe.
if peace were to prevail it would be an armed peace.
western european nations took the first step by allying themselves in the brussels pact in 1948.
this alliance blossomed into the american led nato alliance in april 1949.
the soviet union responded with their own alliance the warsaw pact among eastern european nations.
the map of the cold war in europe portrays the two alliance systems that divided europe into capitalist and communist camps see 24 2.
by joining nato the united states created its first formal military alliance since the revolutionary war.
there would be no repeat of world war i or world war ii when the united states had waited over two years each time before declaring war.
as a member of nato it was obligated to come immediately to western europes defense in the event of a soviet attack.
besides putting american bases and soldiers permanently in europe nato extended the protection of americas atomic shield to its nato partners.
like the marshall plan nato was designed to do many things at once.
besides creating a permanent role for the united states overseas and containing communism nato also helped keep peace among european nations that had clashed repeatedly in the last hundred years.
a popular saying claimed that nato kept the soviets out the americans in and the germans down by ensuring that west germany remained friends with western democracies even after the nation regained its economic vigor.
fighting communism cold and hot war fighting communism cold and hot war as the cold war took shape the united states did not gain any noticeable advantage from its atomic monopoly in dealing with stalin.
losing it nonetheless caused angst in the united states.
in 1949 the soviet union successfully tested its own atomic bomb challenging americans view of their own nation as the worlds dominant military power.
suddenly the chances of an international crisis escalating into nuclear war appeared greater.
as americans digested this news the epicenter of the cold war shifted to asia.
by 1950 a communist government controlled china and the korean war had begun.
in the korean war 1950 1953 the united states and its allies fought communist north koreans and chinese to a stalemate frustrating americans.
communism rising 1949 the united states did not have long to celebrate its achievements during the berlin airlift.
three months after stalin admitted defeat in berlin an american spy plane detected radioactive fallout in the desert of kazakhstan a soviet republic.
this could mean only one thing the soviet union had successfully tested its own atomic bomb.
the news shattered the american certainty that it would retain a nuclear monopoly for at least ten years.
waiting impatiently for a formal announcement from the kremlin truman finally broke the news to the world in september 1949.
the soviet union confirmed the american report but gave no other information about stalins plans for his nuclear program.
fearful that stalin might use nuclear weapons to expand beyond the iron curtain the truman administration broadened the scope of americas containment strategy beyond nato and the marshall plan.
truman decided to station american troops in western europe permanently to both deter and if necessary respond to a nuclear attack.
the united states also began stockpiling atomic bombs to gain a numerical advantage over the soviet union.
finally truman authorized the development of a superbomb a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb that was 1 000 times more powerful than the uranium enriched atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima and the plutonium bomb that destroyed nagasaki.
americans were still recovering from the shock of the soviet bomb when they received more bad news.
the 25 year old chinese civil war had finally ended with the communist mao zedong victorious over the nationalist leader jiang jieshi chiang view the image u s hydrogen bomb test over uninhabited pacific island 1952 kaishek who fled with his government to taiwan an island off the southeast coast of mainland china.
mao was an avid swimmer who refused even as an old man to be deterred by the human waste floating in chinas polluted rivers.
a master of staying afloat in water and politics mao adopted stalin and soviet style policies as his model inflicting similarly painful waves of famine and political oppression on the chinese people that killed more than 20 million.
fearful that the united states intended to attack china and restore jiang to power mao immediately reached out to stalin.
there should be some division of labor between us stalin suggested with the there is only one thing worse than one nation having the atomic bomb thats two nations having it american physical chemist harold ulrey september 1949 soviet union furthering the communist cause in europe and mao doing the same in asia.
accepting stalins offer mao spent two months in moscow devising a joint strategy that resulted in the 1950 sino soviet treaty which pledged mutual assistance in the event of an enemy attack.
this alliance created a second front in the cold war that forced the united states to divide its attention between europe and asia.
in light of these new threats truman ordered a full review of american foreign policy.
the state department responded with a document known as how did the ussr acquiring nuclear weapons and the rise of communist china change the contours of the cold war.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 national security council report 68 or nsc 68.
not mincing words nsc 68 declared that the issues that face us are momentous involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this republic but of civilization itself secretary of state acheson later admitted that nsc 68s cataclysmic vision of a soviet enemy animated by a new fanatic faith and bent on worldwide domination was meant to convince the president to use all means short of war to halt the apparent soviet drive for world conquest.
nsc 68 crystallized the piecemeal developments of the last four years into one clear vision the united states must build up the political economic and military strength of the free world to frustrate the kremlin design of a world dominated by its will this message was transmitted to the public through political speeches films and novels.
perhaps no writer better encapsulated the publics fears of worldwide communist domination than george orwell in his classic novel 1984 which hit bookstores in 1949.
orwell envisioned a future where totalitarianism has triumphed and the peoples loyalty to a stalin like dictator big brother who watches over everyone and censors their behavior is ensured by a cycle of endless wars and torture.
as the main character winston smith undergoes another round of torture his tormentor tells him imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever this image neatly expressed the american publics view of communism in the cold war.
the korean war at the end of world war ii the united states and the soviet union had agreed to divide the former japanese colony of korea a peninsula along the north asian pacific coast into two zones of occupation.
the country was split along the 38th parallel with the ussr occupying the north and the united states the south.
in 1945 partitioning the country seemed like a good way to deprive japan of korean resources and prevent the soviet union from completely taking over the peninsula.
when the soviet union organized a communist government under kim il sung in north korea and the united states selected syngman rhee to head a capitalist government in the south the previously unified nation appeared permanently divided.
by 1949 however the united states had begun to reevaluate its military commitment in south korea.
the occupation was expensive and why did the united states decide to fight in korea.
pentagon officials doubted the strategic importance of the peninsula.
the state department agreed believing that economic aid and political reforms could strengthen south korea enough to discourage a north korean attack.
in january 1950 secretary of state acheson openly questioned the importance of south korea to the overall defense of american interests in east asia.
in a speech before the national press club acheson outlined a defensive perimeter in the pacific that the united states would defend against communist incursions.
it included japan okinawa taiwan and the philippines but not south korea.
accordingly truman began withdrawing american soldiers from south korea.
to deter north korea from attacking the united states left a stockpile of conventional weapons and promised continued financial aid.
yet when north korea launched a surprise invasion of south korea in june 1950 truman immediately reversed course.
the speed and success of the north korean attack alarmed him.
within two days north korean troops had entered seoul the capital of south korea 24 8 and by the end of one week north korea had pushed the bulk of the south korean army and its american advisors into the toe of the korean peninsula around pusan.
viewing this overpowering offensive as confirmation of nsc 68 truman believed the ussr was behind the attack.
he was partly right.
kim il sung had secured reluctant support from stalin and mao zedong for the invasion by promising an easy victory.
if the united states intervened in korea stalin saw advantages to diverting american attention away from europe.
by june 1950 many americans felt that the west was losing the cold war.
china had fallen to communism and the soviets had exploded an atomic bomb.
at home sensational spy trials fueled continued doubts about trumans leadership.
in this political climate doing nothing was hardly an option for him.
trumans intimate understanding of world war i he had served as an artillery captain in france and world war ii encouraged him to break with the precedent set by these recent conflicts.
in each of these wars americans had debated the merits of fighting for more than two years before declaring war.
i remembered how each time the democracies failed to act it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead truman noted.
determined to respond quickly this time he committed american troops to combat within days.
although truman fighting communism cold and hot war soviet unio n ussr north korea south korea 24 8 the korean war the advantage on the battlefield seesawed during the wars first year before becoming a stalemate.

sixteen nations sent troops to korea to serve in the un police force but the united states provided the bulk of troops and commanded military operations.
when polled three quarters of americans approved of trumans decision to send military aid to south korea.
americans for the time being anyway subscribed to his vision that the future of civilization depends on what we do the situation on the battlefield however was grim with south korean soldiers holding on precariously around pusan.
to reverse the situation general douglas macarthur commander in chief of the united nations forces devised a dramatic and risky strategy.
rather than simply confronting the view the map interactive map the korean war 1950 1953 north koreans head on he staged an amphibious landing at inchon a port near seoul.
this attack on the north koreans rear would cut their supply lines and force them to fight on two fronts.
the tides at inchon however were the second highest in the world varying 29 feet between high and low tides.
within minutes the receding tide could mire a boat in mud.
inchon macarthur reasoned was the right place to attack precisely because it was so uninviting and would take the enemy by surprise.
as he predicted the north koreans had stationed only 6 500 troops there and the un force of 40 000 encountered little resistance in taking the city.
this operation turned macarthur already famous for his feats in world war ii into a national hero.
following the inchon invasion un forces quickly drove north korean troops out of south korea.
after this victory truman pondered giving the war a new purpose.
instead of simply restoring the what accounted for americas initial successes on the battlefield.

rolling back communism rather than containing it became the new goal sanctioned by the un in october 1950.
at that same moment however china was preparing to aid north korea.
when american troops crossed the 38th parallel into north korea they did not know that mao was massing chinese troops and guns along the north korean chinese border.
still unaware of maos intentions american troops moved swiftly up the peninsula to celebrate thanksgiving by the yalu river.
victory seemed assured macarthur promised truman that the troops would be home by christmas.
then in late november waves of chinese troops began pouring across the border shrieking and blowing bugles.
terrified un forces suffered heavy casualties as they withdrew in the harsh winter.
life photographer david how did the entry of the chinese into the korean war affect political and military debates within the united states.
douglas duncan warming his camera in his coat pocket to keep the film from breaking chronicled the bitter retreat of 10 000 marines who fought their way to safety.
nearly every soldier suffered frostbite half the men were wounded or killed.
if i were god and could give you anything you wanted what would you ask for duncan asked one marine.
after several minutes the marine replied give me tomorrow military leaders disagreed over how to respond as the chinese continued their advance which un forces eventually contained around the 38th parallel.
the joint chiefs of staff urged truman to seek a negotiated peace advice he followed.
macarthur however publicly endorsed all out war utilizing nuclear weapons.
the president and theater commander now began to pursue two competing visions.
as truman made diplomatic overtures to the chinese for a ceasefire along the 38th parallel macarthur warned the chinese to surrender or face destruction.
there is no substitute for victory macarthur wrote to republican congressman joseph martin of massachusetts echoing the feelings of countless americans.
this was not however trumans vision of how to end the war when martin read these words on the house floor he sealed macarthurs fate.
truman fired macarthur the next week triggering as secretary of state acheson had predicted the biggest fight of your administration macarthur came home not in disgrace but to great acclaim.
many americans shared his frustrations with the stalemate on the battlefield.
six years after defeating two great military powers in world war ii the united states found itself unable to reunify korea under an anti communist government.
responding to macarthurs vision of total victory huge crowds greeted the general when his ship docked in san francisco and he reveled in a ticker tape parade held in his honor in new york city.
congress debated impeaching truman but then opted instead to hold hearings into macarthurs removal.
during the hearings macarthurs critics interrogated the fighting communism cold and hot war general about the possibility that using nuclear weapons in korea might lead to a global nuclear war.
macarthurs response that doesnt happen to be my responsibility caused the generals popularity to plummet.
the cooling enthusiasm for macarthurs vision of all out war did little to bolster public confidence in truman.
in public opinion polls only 24 percent of americans approved of how he was handling the presidency reflecting public disappointment over korea anger at losing china and well publicized soviet spy scandals that together revived the image of truman as an ineffectual leader.
his aggressive support for civil rights and his domestic reform agenda see chapter 25 too much for conservatives and too little for liberals also contributed to his poor rating.
korea was the last american war that the public viewed primarily through photographs.
only 34 percent of american homes had television sets in 1952 rising to 86 percent by 1960.
in 1950 newsweek published the photograph the price of victory a soldier grieves for his lost buddy 24 9.
one readers suggestion that this image should serve as the iconic photo of the korean war just as old glory goes up on mt.

the world war ii image of five marines and one navy corpsman raising the flag suggested teamwork victory and the triumph of democracy.
in sharp contrast the price of victory looked at the personal cost of war the sorrow and compassion that drew men together on the battlefield even as the photograph reaffirmed the willingness of soldiers to die for their country.
photographers and the public were beginning to probe the impact of fighting on soldiers stoking the ambivalence that the country increasingly felt about the war.
with macarthur gone general matthew ridgway took over command of un operations in 1951 and armistice negotiations began.
talks were still underway two years later when a new president dwight d eisenhower took office.
his sunny demeanor offered a sharp contrast to trumans more combative and coarse personality.
whereas truman cussed told off color jokes and picked fights with reporters eisenhower was gregarious and friendly to watch the video ike for president eisenhower campaign ad 1952 all.
some democrats had tried to draft eisenhower as a presidential candidate in 1948.
four years later the republican we like ike campaign finally convinced eisenhower to seek office.
the young women adorned here 24 10 with ike dresses and umbrellas illustrate republicans gusto for eisenhower on the eve of the nominating convention where delegates enthusiastically selected him as their candidate.
admired by americans for his command of the d day invasion in world war ii eisenhowers military experience convinced americans that he would be a capable leader in wartime.
the negotiations remained deadlocked however until eisenhower threatened to reconsider employing nuclear weapons.
finally the two sides agreed to a permanent ceasefire in july 1953.
the war was costly on all sides.
more than 400 000 chinese soldiers and nearly two million north and south koreans soldiers and civilians perished.
for the first time since the war of 1812 the united states could not claim outright victory over its opponent despite nearly 33 000 men killed in combat and 103 000 men wounded.
what the hell is there to celebrate remarked one soldier when news of the armistice reached the front.
the silence at home offered a marked contrast to the jubilant demonstrations that had filled the streets eight years earlier when japan surrendered.
china embraced a competing vision of the stalemate 24 10 we like ike the enthusiasm displayed by republicans in 1952 convinced eisenhower to run for president.
how did the korean war compare to world war ii.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 reveling in the ability to hold its own against the united states.
the korean war had major geopolitical consequences by turning the cold war into a global conflict.
the war tied south korea and japan economically resurgent thanks to american aid even more closely to the united states and both became staunch allies in creating a defensive perimeter against communism in east asia.
holding the line against communism in korea increased americas interest in other regional civil wars including one underway in vietnam.
the war poisoned relations with china and the two nations did not reestablish diplomatic relations until 1979.
pledged to defend south korea the united states still maintains a large military presence along what continues to be the worlds most heavily armed border.
nuclear fallout and fear while soldiers fought and died on the battlefield americans at home waged their own defensive war against nuclear weapons.
the government sponsored atmospheric and underwater tests of nuclear bombs in the 1940s and 1950s both in the united states and on the bikini atoll in the marshall islands in the pacific.
even when the united states had a secure monopoly on nuclear weapons many americans expressed concern about nuclear fallout the deadly pollution that descends through the air after a nuclear explosion.
in the 1950s popular science fiction writers and filmmakers tapped into this preoccupation.
in the japanese film classic godzilla for example a nuclear explosion awakens a fire breathing monster who as the films promotional poster 24 11 illustrated terrorizes tokyo.
like the atomic bombs that ravaged hiroshima and nagasaki godzilla is an unstoppable nuclear force that obliterates everything in his path.
americans however saw only an edited version of the film with all critical commentary on americas ongoing nuclear testing program in the pacific excised.
two popular marvel comic book characters the incredible hulk and spider man were also spawned by contact with radioactive material.
in the incredible hulk a scientist exposed to gamma rays is transformed into a green 300 pound giant while a bite from an irradiated spider turns nerdish lab assistant peter parker into spider man.
teaching americans how to live with the constant threat of nuclear war meant convincing citizens to remain vigilant and calm.
to combat both indifference and panic governmental propaganda underscored the seriousness of the threat while also reassuring the public that they could survive an atomic blast if they took precautionary measures such as building fortified fallout shelters or remembering to duck and cover images as history surviving an atomic bomb blast explores how government generated images presented competing visions that both reassured and frightened americans about the likely effect of a nuclear attack.
24 11 godzilla a 1954 japanese horror film used the ravages of a nuclearspawned dinosaur named godzilla to criticize american use and testing of its nuclear arsenal.
this political message was edited out of the version shown in the united states.
how did popular culture reflect americans concerns about nuclear weapons.
watch the video duck and cover fighting communism cold and hot war images as history surviving an atomic bomb blast how people will react to advice or propaganda can be difficult to predict.
why did the government disseminate images of a possible nuclear attack.
what unintended effects could these images have on the americans viewing them.
by 1950 schoolchildren throughout the nation had learned to jump out of their seats and under their desks with their hands clasped firmly over their heads when their teachers shouted drop during civil defense drills.
in government produced civil defense films and comic books distributed to schools bert the the stick of dynamite dangling from a string symbolized a nuclear attack exactly the kind of danger children needed to learn to recognize.
a catchy jingle accompanied this lesson in civil defense there was a turtle by the name of bert and bert the turtle was very alert when danger threatened him he never got hurt he knew just what to do hed duck and cover duck and cover the intact shell implies that one could safely survive a nuclear attack by hiding under something.
the before blast images portrayed a normal middle class suburban home and yard.
view the closer look images as history surviving an atomic bomb blast turtle instructed children to duck and cover during a nuclear attack.
advocates of this approach argued that flying debris and shattered windows had killed many victims in hiroshima and nagasaki therefore teaching children to duck and cover was practical advice.
to ensure that americans remained vigilant in preparing for a nuclear attack the government also released before and after photographs from a test explosion in the nevada desert on march 17 1953.
time magazine estimated that nearly three quarters of the nation saw these pictures.
authorities advised children who did not carry their shelters on their backs like bert to seek protection beside walls and trees or under tables if an atomic bomb hit.
the after blast photographs showed this suburban house engulfed in flames and blown to bits within two seconds of being hit with a nuclear bomb.
this image directly contradicted the vision that one could survive a nuclear attack by seeking shelter under a bed as bert the turtle advised.
what conflicting messages did these images send about surviving a nuclear blast.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 fallout shelters with the successful test explosion of the hydrogen bomb in 1954 the eisenhower administration embraced mass evacuation from city centers as the best civil defense against nuclear attack.
the presidents decision to construct an interstate highway system changed official policy from duck and cover to run like hell the bulletin of the atomic scientists concluded.
multilane highways served peacetime needs by linking cities to suburbs and military needs by making the evacuation of civilians and the mobilization of the military easier if the united states was attacked.
practice evacuation runs were not encouraging however.
operation kids for example an effort to move 37 300 schoolchildren in mobile alabama out of the city without warning resulted in heavy traffic jams.
eisenhower also urged americans to build family shelters at their own expense.
the government distributed pamphlets with suggested floor plans and advised women to store enough food and medical supplies to sustain their families if a nuclear attack contaminated water supplies or destroyed grocery stores.
grandmas pantry was ready whenever guests unexpectedly arrived is your pantry ready in event of emergency one government pamphlet asked.
given their high cost even a barebones shelter cost 1 000 about one fifth an average familys annual income few americans could afford to construct their own fallout shelters.
during another moment of crisis in 1961 when the united states and the soviet union clashed again over the fate of berlin eisenhowers successor john f kennedy dedicated public funds to preparing mass underground shelters in schools and public buildings.
signs with three yellow triangles superimposed on a black circle 24 12 that pointed toward underground public fallout shelters became ubiquitous in schools and government buildings.
in 1956 the government began constructing secret centers throughout the nation to house officials in the event of a nuclear attack.
the government did not make these preparations public avoiding uncomfortable questions about what would happen to the rest of the country.
these secret plans sought to ensure the continued functioning of congress by transporting legislators and some staff members without their families to an underground shelter in white sulphur springs west virginia.
as part of its preparations the treasury department put an eight month supply of 1 bills and a two year supply of 5 10 and 20 bills in bombproof shelters.
the military scattered mini pentagons throughout the country including underground facilities for the president and his cabinet near gettysburg pennsylvania.
plans to whisk the government to safety during a nuclear attack remained in place until 1995.
24 12 fallout shelter sign in the early 1960s fallout shelter signs posted in neighborhoods schools and public buildings were daily reminders of the nuclear threat that hung over the nation.
what defensive measures did americans take against a possible nuclear attack.
view the closer look images as history fallout shelters spies in our midst spies in our midst recently released documents from the former soviet union suggest that as many as 300 americans spied for the ussr during the 1930s and 1940s.
does this justify the attack on civil liberties that occurred during the anticommunist crusade that swept across the country during the 1940s and 1950s.
during the cold war many americans believed that this anticommunist campaign made the country safer and freer a minority voiced the competing vision that the government was using spy investigations to limit legitimate political discourse by eliminating the radical left.
the governments crusade against communism in the first red scare 1919 after world war i lasted only a few months.
the effort to root out communist spies after world war ii lasted for nearly a decade.
the second red scare to a country reeling from the loss of china to communism and the detonation of a soviet bomb the suggestion that the government was rife with communist spies offered a simple explanation for these complex events.
the house un american activities committee huac which had investigated fascist activities in the united states during world war ii now probed the communist threat.
other measures from world war ii also took on new life during the second red scare including the smith act 1940 which outlawed advocating the forceful destruction of the government.
acting on a precedent set by franklin d roosevelt in world war ii truman created a federal employee loyalty program in 1947 that gave the federal bureau of investigation fbi the police arm of the justice department the right to investigate the backgrounds of federal workers.
congress tightened restrictions on radical political activity even further with the mccarran acts in 1950 and 1952 which stopped communists from entering the country and required communist or communist front organizations to register with the attorney general.
most of the people investigated by huac and the fbi had once belonged to the communist party which had attracted many new members during the labor unrest of the 1930s see chapter 22.
whether past or even present membership in the communist party made one a traitor was another question.
when david wellman was a young boy his family was under constant police surveillance.
two unmarked cars sat outside their detroit home and followed him and his sister to school ball games and the store.
trying to turn fear into fun we made shaking them a game he later recalled.
wellman maintained that his father a wounded world war ii veteran and leader in the michigan communist party and his mother a communist active in trade unions were not traitors but people who believed that revolution was an american ideal.
the constant surveillance took a toll on the family.
it felt as if the government penetrated the deepest recesses of our lives every minute of the day wellman recalled.
paranoia caused the family to censor speech within the home and on the telephone certain that the police were always listening.
as an adult wellman got access to his familys police file and was stunned to learn that the reports contained almost no information about his parents political activism.
the police had discovered little through this constant surveillance succeeding mostly in terrorizing the family which wellman suspected was their true intent.
they were trying to put the fear of police power in the minds of the people they spied on.
to a large degree it worked david wellman whose family was under police surveillance during the second red scare the two biggest spy cases of the era involved alger hiss and ethel and julius rosenberg.
in 1948 whittaker chambers a time magazine editor and former member of the communist party accused alger hiss a high ranking official during the what insights does wellmans story offer into the second red scare.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 roosevelt administration of being a communist.
hiss denied the charge before huac announcing under oath that i am not and never have been a member of any communist front organization chambers responded by charging that hiss spied for the soviet union in the 1930s and as proof produced rolls of microfilm that chambers had hidden in a hollow pumpkin in his garden.
the microfilm contained copies of secret state department papers from 1938 regarding the soviet union nazi germany and the spanish civil war that had been typed on hisss typewriter.
the pumpkin patch papers corroborated chamberss account and recently declassified intelligence documents have confirmed that hiss worked as a soviet spy through at least 1945.
because the statute of limitations on espionage had expired a federal court convicted hiss of perjury for lying to huac about his communist ties.
hiss served four years in jail.
congressman richard nixon a member of huac believed that the hiss case for the first time forcibly demonstrated to the american people that domestic communism was a real and present danger to the security of the nation nixons leading role in the hiss investigation catapulted him into the national spotlight.
his prominence increased when he was elected vice president on the republican ticket with eisenhower in 1952.
24 13 the rosenbergs spy case 1953 protesters urge the government to execute convicted spies julius and ethel rosenberg reflecting the fury many americans felt toward anyone believed to have betrayed the united states.
in 1953 another spy case involving ethel and julius rosenberg the jewish parents of two young boys captivated the nation.
the federal government charged julius with passing atomic secrets to the soviet union during world war ii information he had supposedly gathered from his brother in law a soviet spy working for the manhattan project who later testified against the couple.
although juliuss wife ethel was never personally implicated in the spy ring the government charged her with knowing of her husbands involvement.
arrested to spur her husband into confessing ethel went on trial for espionage along with her husband.
they each maintained their innocence even when convicted and sentenced to death by electric chair.
as the execution date neared demonstrators from the right and the left took to the streets offering the public two competing visions of the rosenbergs and the governments anti communist investigations.
men carrying signs that read burn all reds and no mercy for spies picketed before the white house 24 13.
supporters who believed that the rosenbergs were being persecuted for their radical beliefs organized marches for clemency.
radio and television reporters witnessing the execution shared intimate details with a nation riveted on the couples final moments including ethels botched electrocution on june 19 1953 when it took three tries to kill her.
their two young sons aged ten and six also endured intense media scrutiny.
relatives put them in an orphanage and new jersey revoked their right to attend public school.
rosenberg supporters abe meeropol the author of the anti lynching ballad strange fruit see chapter 21 and his wife eventually adopted the boys and changed their names.
as adults they were active in leftist causes and until recently steadfastly maintained their parents innocence.
for decades the right and the left embraced two competing visions of the rosenbergs case.
the right viewed the couple as traitors whose cooperation with the soviet union demonstrated the internal threat that the nation faced from soviet spies.
the left believing the rosenbergs innocent felt that mainstream politicians exaggerated the communist menace to gain public support for eradicating all leftleaning political groups from american society.
in some respects both portraits were accurate.
newly released soviet documents reveal that julius did indeed pass valuable atomic data to the soviet union but it appears that ethel knew nothing of her husbands espionage activities making her along with countless others in the 1950s a victim of overzealous investigators who equated leftist politics with treason.
what competing visions arose over the hiss and rosenbergs spy cases.
spies in our midst huac against hollywood the effort to expose the evildoings of communists went far beyond punishing government officials who spied for the soviet union.
in 1947 huac began an investigation into alleged communist activities in hollywood.
hundreds of screenwriters producers directors and actors were called to testify.
initial hearings focused on the supposedly subversive plotlines and imagery of selected motion pictures such as mission to moscow a world war ii era film that presented the soviet union as paradise on earth.
jack warner the head of warner studies had produced mission to moscow after the roosevelt administration requested a film that would improve the publics impression of the nations wartime ally.
this episode in producing leftwing political propaganda was the exception rather than the rule in hollywood.
most studio heads subscribed to sam goldwyns view that if you want to send a message use western union the iron grip of the hollywood studio system allowed directors little independence to include political content in their films that was not approved by the studio bosses.
as a result huac could find little evidence of subversive content in hollywood films.
rather than abandoning its investigation of hollywood however huac shifted focus to the political affiliations and beliefs of the people involved in making movies.
after ten screenwriters dubbed the hollywood ten were convicted of contempt of congress for refusing to cooperate with huac investigations and sentenced to a year in prison studio executives created a hollywood blacklist of individuals with suspected past or present communist ties whom film studios refused to hire.
the fbi had already infiltrated the communist party and provided huac with the names of all those in hollywood with present or past communist affiliations.
huac nonetheless pressured subpoenaed witnesses to publicly name names not to gain information but to test witnesses loyalty.
many cooperated with huac to salvage their careers.
most of those who refused to testify or to name names never worked in films again.
others like future president ronald reagan then the president of the screen actors guild joined the anti communist crusade by privately providing the fbi with the names of individuals in hollywood with potential communist connections.
reagan testified before huac as a liberal democrat his shift to the right came later where he denied that communists have ever at any time been able to use the read the document joseph mccarthy wheeling west virginia speech 1950 motion picture screen as a sounding board for their philosophy director elia kazan and playwright arthur miller used their artistic work to explain the different choices they made when asked to testify by huac.
kazans film on the waterfront 1954 starred marlon brando as an ex prizefighter turned longshoreman who overcomes his aversion to ratting on your friends and testifies against his corrupt union bosses.
kazan who had been a member of the communist party in the 1930s made the film to justify his own decision in 1952 to provide huac with the names of eight former communist party colleagues see competing visions naming names in hollywood page 740.
on the waterfront won academy awards for best picture best director and best actor.
conversely miller refused to testify when called before huac in 1956 and criticized the hysteria created by the second red scare in his play the crucible which likened the huac investigations to the salem witch trials in colonial massachusetts.
we will not knowingly employ a communist nor a member of any party or groups which advocates the overthrow of the government of the united states by force or by illegal or unconstitutional methods studio executives statement announcing the creation of a hollywood blacklist 1947 mccarthyism the governments anti communist crusade during the second red scare also became known as mccarthyism named for the media savvy republican senator joseph mccarthy from wisconsin who along with huac spearheaded numerous investigations into communist activities many of them spurious.
anti communist spy investigations predated mccarthy but his flair for the dramatic made the senator an instant media sensation.
mccarthy burst onto the scene after waving around a piece of paper during a speech before the womens republican club in wheeling west virginia on february 9 1950 thundering that he what was the purpose and impact of huacs hollywood investigations.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 competing visions naming names in hollywood the following opinions one from former first lady eleanor roosevelt who wrote a syndicated magazine column my day and the other from film director elia kazan offer opposing views on aiding the huac investigations.
consider how roosevelt and kazan defined the threat to american democracy in this period.
what risks were involved in following the different suggestions each made.
could their two views be reconciled.
in a 1947 my day column eleanor roosevelt expressed concerns that huac was creating a police state atmosphere that would squash artistic creativity and freedom of expression.
i have waited a while before saying anything about the unamerican activities committees current investigation of the hollywood film industry.
i would not be very much surprised if some writers or actors or stagehands or what not were found to have communist leanings but i was surprised to find that at the start of the inquiry some of the big producers were so chicken hearted about speaking up for the freedom of their industry.
one thing is sure none of the arts flourishes on censorship and repression.
and by this time it should be evident that the american public is capable of doing its own censoring.
the film industry is a great industry with infinite possibilities for good and bad.
its primary purpose is to entertain people.
on the side it can do many other things.
it can popularize certain ideals it can make education palatable.
however in the long run the judge who decides whether what it does is good or bad is the man or woman who attends the movies.
in a democratic country i do not think the public will tolerate a removal of its right to decide what it thinks of the ideas and performances of those who make the movie industry work.
what is going on in the un american activities committee worries me primarily because little people have become frightened and we find ourselves living in the atmosphere of a police state where people close doors before they state what they think or look over their shoulders apprehensively before they express an opinion.
if you curtail what the other fellow says and does you curtail what you yourself may say and do.
in our country we must trust the people to hear and see both the good and the bad and to choose the good.
the unamerican activities committee seems to me to be better for a police state than for the usa.
many people in hollywood never forgave elia kazan for cooperating with huac.
in his 1988 autobiography kazan refused to apologize.
instead he asserted his right to protect his career and the need to defend the country.
i believed it was the duty of the government to investigate the communist movement in our country.
i couldnt behave as if my old comrades didnt exist and didnt have an active political program.
there was no way i could go along with their crap that the cp communist party was nothing but another political party like the republicans and the democrats.
i knew very well what it was a thoroughly organized worldwide conspiracy.
this conviction separated me from many of my old friends did i really want to change the social system i was living under.
apparently that was what id stood for at one time.
but what s t everything i had of value id gained under that system why had i taken so long to even consider telling the country thats what it amounted to everything i knew.
was it because of the moral injunction against informing which was respected only depending on which side you were on.
if the situation were reversed wouldnt the comrades protect themselves without hesitation and by any means.
including naming me.
i began to measure the weight and the worth of what i was giving up my career in films which i was surrendering for a cause i didnt believe in.
it seemed insane.
what was i if not a filmmaker.
if you expect an apology now because i would later name names to the house committee youve misjudged my character.
the people who owe you an explanation no apology expected are those who year after year held the soviets blameless for all their crimes.
hearings before the house committee on un american activities during the second red scare how do roosevelt and kazan differ on the best way to protect the right to freedom of expression.
view the closer look competing visions naming names in hollywood spies in our midst had a list of 205 known communists who worked in the state department.
the paper turned out to be just a prop.
when pressed for the names of the people on his list mccarthy stalled and announced that he would only show their names to truman which he never did.
in each subsequent speech the number cited by mccarthy dropped until he finally settled on 57.
when a great democracy is destroyed it will not be from enemies from without but rather because of enemies from within senator joseph r mccarthy wheeling west virginia 1950.
as a republican attacking a democratic administration mccarthys accusations had a partisan ring.
taking advantage of the media spotlight he issued new charges against state department officials ruining the careers of many who could not mount an effective defense against his bullying.
reveling in the press attention that every new allegation brought mccarthy sought bigger targets even attacking secretary of defense george c marshall who had authored the marshall plan while secretary of state for having joined a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man in 1954 a year after the rosenbergs were executed the career of joseph mccarthy as an anti communist crusader ended when the senator began investigating the army for subversion.
national television broadcast the hearings and americans watched aghast for 36 days as mccarthy intimidated witnesses ignored facts and made ludicrous charges.
the climactic moment in the hearing came when the armys attorney joseph welch rebuked mccarthy telling him you have done enough.
have you no sense of decency sir at long last approval ratings for mccarthy plummeted from 50 percent to 35 percent in gallup polls.
the public unraveling of support for mccarthy mirrored growing concerns among his fellow watch the video on video lecture mccarthyism and the politics of fear republicans in congress.
eisenhower and former huac member richard nixon were now in the white house.
attacking a republican controlled administration yielded fewer political benefits and fellow republicans privately urged eisenhower to rein in mccarthy.
leery of having his own anticommunist credentials challenged eisenhower refused to confront mccarthy directly.
instead the president tried to take the high road.
i will not get down in the gutter with that guy eisenhower vowed reasoning that if he gave mccarthy enough rope he would eventually hang himself.
this hands off approach allowed mccarthy to run wild until 1954 when as eisenhower predicted he went too far.
eventually it was the mainstream press not the president who denounced mccarthy.
after the army mccarthy hearings the esteemed journalist edward r murrow exposed mccarthys slander and lies in a television documentary.
mccarthy murrow pointedly told his audience didnt create this situation of fear he merely exploited it however when the senate censured mccarthy on december 2 1954 for violating senate rules the legislators chose to depict mccarthy as solely responsible for the excesses of anti communism.
a disgraced mccarthy died from liver failure caused by alcoholism three years later at age 49.
no one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices journalist edward r murrow during a 1954 television expos on mccarthy as murrow suggested the end of mccarthys career as a red baiter did not stop the governments anti communist crusade.
republicans and democrats alike took their cue from mccarthy and freely attacked any suspected radical working in local or state governments public schools or universities.
the smith act remained in place as did loyalty oaths hollywood blacklists and police surveillance of suspected radicals.
by the 1950s using the charge of communism to discredit political opponents or liberal activists such as martin luther king jr was commonplace in american politics.
is the term mccarthyism a useful or misleading way to characterize the second red scare.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 averting nuclear war the worldwide ideological political and military struggle between the united states and the soviet union fueled americans fear of communism both at home and throughout the world.
the vision of fighting a nuclear war continued to haunt americans even after the ceasefire in korea.
technological advances in long range ballistic missiles and satellites provoked a new threat in the cold war standoff between the united states and the soviet union.
a missile fitted with a nuclear warhead could now reach the united states within half an hour from the soviet union.
armed uprisings in eastern europe renewed soviet demands that the west abandon berlin and the cuban missile crisis created a climactic moment when the world teetered on the edge of all out nuclear war.
sputnik 24 14 sputnik for americans this small satellite symbolized soviet technological superiority over the united states fueling the arms race between the two nations.
on october 4 1957 the soviet union sent the worlds first satellite nicknamed sputnik fellow traveler into outer space.
the size of a basketball and weighing just 183 pounds sputnik 24 14 nonetheless became a symbol of soviet technological superiority a satellite that could orbit the earth in 98 minutes.
today satellites serve a host of peaceful functions transmitting television images and telephone calls around the globe.
in 1957 however americans focused primarily on the new strategic advantage that satellite technology gave the soviets.
the soviets could easily fit a missile that sent sputnik into orbit with a nuclear warhead and launch it at the united states.
to help americans picture another danger life magazine traced the hypothetical path of sputnik over a 24 hour period 24 15 warning the orbit weaves a web as whole world watches several orbits each day marked in red as a reminder of the communist control of sputnik passed directly over the united states bringing the soviets ever closer to americas doorstep as they gradually ensnared the world.
fearing that the united states was losing the space race the government created the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to launch americas own investigation of space and the defense department scrambled to develop american satellite technology.
predicting how the soviet unions volatile new leader might use this why did the nuclear arms race escalate in the late 1950s.
technological breakthrough kept americans on edge.
in the power struggle that followed stalins death from a brain hemorrhage in march 1953 nikita khrushchev emerged as the new soviet premier.
a poorly educated peasant who rose through the ranks to become a stalin protg khrushchev reveled in rhetorical excess.
he proclaimed that the ussr was producing missiles like sausages and enjoyed keeping his american visitors offbalance.
during a visit by minnesota senator hubert 24 15 life magazine illustrated the sputnik threat by showing how its orbits gave the soviets control of space including areas over the united states.
view the image sputnik i averting nuclear war humphrey to moscow khrushchev stopped his threatening tirade long enough to ask humphrey where he was from.
thats so i dont forget to order them to spare the city when the rockets fly he said good naturedly.
eager to catch up with the soviet union in missile technology and cut the defense budget conventional military forces cost more than building nuclear weapons eisenhower oversaw a tremendous increase in american nuclear weaponry which grew from 800 to nearly 8 000 warheads between 1953 and 1960.
this build up was part of a strategic vision called the new look in 1954 eisenhowers tough talking secretary of state john foster dulles announced that the united states would focus on developing massive retaliatory power to deter soviet aggression.
the national security council agreed with dulles that the country would go bankrupt trying to develop adequate defenses against soviet nuclear weapons and policing the world with ground troops.
dulles maintained that a strong arsenal of intercontinental missiles icbms armed with nuclear warheads would allow the united states to retaliate instantly by means and at places of our choosing when the soviets stepped out of line.
eisenhower liked the new look because it offered a way to counter the soviet manpower advantage while maintaining a small peacetime army.
the appeal of massive retaliation was simple it provided more bang for the buck some commentators noted.
getting accurate data on the soviet arsenal became critical once the united states embraced the doctrine of massive retaliation.
the year before the soviets launched sputnik the americans began using a new u 2 spy plane to photograph soviet military installations.
soviet radar could detect the u 2 but the plane flew at altitudes out of range for soviet fighter pilots or antiaircraft missiles.
for four years the united states used u 2 missions to collect intelligence about soviet long range missiles before turning to spy satellites.
the photographs were reassuring.
at the end of 1959 the united states learned the soviet union had only six icbm sites able to launch a missile carrying a nuclear warhead.
because it took 20 hours to fuel each missile which could travel through space to reach targets 5 000 to 6 000 miles away in half an hour the united states would have ample time to respond if the soviet union launched a first strike with six missiles.
despite khrushchevs claims that the soviets possessed a huge nuclear arsenal american had far more nuclear warheads and icbms.
innovation usa ussr nuclearpowered submarine launched first trial of icbm icbm operational submarinelaunched icbm operational 24 16 nuclear arms race 1950s the united states and soviet union tried to best each other by developing increasingly sophisticated nuclear weapons.
having made much of the claim that the soviet union possessed more icbms than the united states in his successful 1960 presidential campaign against richard nixon president john f kennedy waited a few months before revealing the truth in 1961.
calling khrushchevs bluff kennedy announced that the united states had a second strike capability which is at least as extensive as what the soviets can deliver by striking first.
therefore we are confident that the soviets will not provoke a major nuclear conflict the gap only kept growing in americas favor.
continuing the policy of massive retaliation kennedy oversaw an increase in the american icbm stockpile from 63 to 424 from 1961 to 1963.
the attention given to the missile gap during the 1960 presidential campaign revealed the constant pressure that americans felt to retain the upper hand in the ever evolving nuclear arms race.
the chart 24 16 lists the key developments in early cold war nuclear weaponry illustrating the intense competition between the united states and soviet union to develop nuclear weapons including nuclear powered submarines that could stay submerged for two months and fire nuclear fitted missiles.
the berlin wall americans weighed kennedys reassuring words about the missile gap against recent events that again demonstrated the heavy hand of soviet authority in eastern europe.
in 1956 khrushchev denounced stalins crimes against the soviet people how did the new soviet premier khrushchev compare to stalin.
chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 at a communist party congress.
his speech taken as a cue that the new soviet regime would be more open and tolerant set off rebellions in poland and hungary.
the polish communists reasserted control themselves but soviet troops crushed the rebellion in hungary revealing that khrushchev intended to retain soviet control over eastern europe.
khrushchev also moved to consolidate soviet power over berlin twice issuing ultimatums to the west to vacate the divided city.
the stark differences between life in east and west berlin had become a public embarrassment to the soviet union.
lavishly rebuilt by west germany and the marshall plan west berlin teemed with new housing industry and commerce.
moving freely between the more prosperous western half and the areas under communist control hundreds of thousands of east germans voted with their feet.
after defecting they traveled easily from west berlin into west germany to start new lives.
khrushchev viewed the 44 year old kennedy as an inept inexperienced leader whom he could intimidate.
a botched u s sponsored invasion of cuba in 1961 discussed more fully below only reaffirmed khrushchevs low opinion of kennedy.
believing that kennedy would crumble under pressure khrushchev demanded that the west leave berlin when the two met in vienna.
to khrushchevs surprise the president stood firm.
kennedy left the summit shaken and angry one reporter claimed.
he never met with khrushchev again.
instead he returned home and requested funds for additional nuclear and conventional forces.
the public fully supported their president.
more than 82 percent favored maintaining american french and british forces in berlin even if it meant war with the soviet union.
with kennedy unwilling to abandon the city khrushchev resisted the temptation to erect another blockade.
instead of revoking permission for the west to use roads through east germany to supply the city as stalin had in 1948 he decided to build a wall between west berlin and east germany see 24 5 on page 726.
in the twilight hours of august 13 1961 construction of a barbed wire fence began.
east german tanks and troops rolled up to the monumental brandenburg gate the original entry point to berlin which lay in the soviet sector of the city to prevent a popular protest from breaking out in front of this symbol of german nationhood.
east german workers quickly laid a thin line of barbed wire in front of the brandenburg gate turning the popular square into a desolate no mans land.
what did the berlin wall mean to americans.
freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us president john f kennedy in a speech before the berlin wall 1963 west germans flocked to the construction site in shock.
some east germans made desperate lastminute escapes jumping from the windows of buildings that straddled the boundary into nets held by west german firefighters.
twelve foot high concrete barriers with rounded piping on top to make scaling the wall more difficult soon replaced the barbed wire.
envisioning evidence the berlin wall depicts the complex defensive system that stood until 1989.
the wall stopped the flow of people from east to west berlin without provoking a major confrontation with the united states.
as the wall went up in 1961 kennedy remarked to his aides that a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war when he finally visited the wall in june 1963 he expressed solidarity with the people on both sides of the divided city by announcing ich bin ein berliner which kennedy thought meant i am a berliner not realizing that ein berliner was the name for a popular doughnut.
bay of pigs and the cuban missile crisis americans viewed communist activities in germany with dismay but the prospect of a communist cuba alarmed the government more cuba lay just 90 miles south of florida.
in 1959 fidel castro had overthrown the dictator fulgencio bastista y zaldvar.
castro quickly consolidated his power.
he declared himself a communist confiscated a billion dollars in american property and accepted aid from the soviet union.
in response an alarmed eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations and imposed economic sanctions including an embargo that banned the export of american goods to the island.

fugitives footprints in the soft sand spread on the eastern side of the wall raked each day alerted guards to breaches in the walls defenses.
guards had strict orders to shoot anyone they saw attempting to escape.

chapter 24 a divided world the early cold war 1945 1963 were eyeball to eyeball and i think the other fellow just blinked secretary of state dean rusk upon receiving word that soviet ships had turned back during the cuban missile crisis in 1962 bay of pigs operation a failed amphibious invasion by cuban exiles in 1961 to overthrow castro.
eisenhower left office before the scheduled invasion but kennedy endorsed the plan.
problems arose immediately however.
two days before the ground attack american planes painted to look like stolen cuban aircraft bombed cuban air defenses.
on april 17 1961 1 400 exiles landed and were immediately killed or captured.
kennedys unconvincing public statement that the united states was not involved in this struggle of cuban patriots against a cuban dictator hurt his credibility at home and overseas.
the bay of pigs fiasco hardened the resolve of kennedy khrushchev and castro to gain the upper hand in this new cold war hotspot.
the cia devised schemes for overthrowing castro that involved sabotage and terrorism.
in november 1961 cia agents and cuban exiles covertly traveled in speedboats from florida to cuba where they burned sugar plantations and blew up factories and oil depots.
the cia also plotted to assassinate castro by trying to poison his ice cream and cigars and enlisting mafia crime bosses to kill him.
castro complained to khrushchev about americas murderous intentions and in return received soviet economic and military aid.
protecting communism in cuba now became a major goal for the soviet union.
on october 22 1962 president kennedy appeared on national television to deliver the stunning news that the soviet union was building missile launching pads in cuba for short and intermediate range nuclear missiles.
u s bases in italy britain and turkey housed nuclear missiles aimed at the soviet union.
putting soviet missiles in cuba a mere 90 miles from the american coast would teach americans just what it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you khrushchev told his advisors.
the cuban missile crisis a showdown in 1962 between the united states and the soviet union over khrushchevs decision to place soviet missiles in communist cuba aimed at america was underway.
what was the ultimate significance of the cuban missile crisis.
instead of accepting the soviet view that missiles in cuba simply leveled the playing field kennedy responded with a competing vision that the soviet actions represented a provocative change in the delicate status quo both countries have maintained short and intermediate range soviet missiles in cuba threatened to reduce the strategic advantage that america held with its larger long range nuclear arsenal.
this was unacceptable to kennedy.
intelligence officials estimated that the missile sites would become operational in two weeks giving kennedy only a small window of time before the soviets would double their ability to launch a devastating nuclear strike against the united states.
kennedy ultimately decided to use a naval blockade to prevent soviet ships from arming the launching sites with nuclear missiles.
only later would kennedy discover that missiles were already in cuba.
the president never learned that the estimate of 10 000 soviet troops in cuba was wrong there were actually 42 000.
choices and consequences the cuban missile crisis outlines the options facing kennedy during this tense fortnight the closest that the world ever came to fighting an all out nuclear war.
the world waited for 13 days as soviet ships steamed toward the american fleet guarding cuban ports.
american pilots sat in planes loaded with nuclear weapons waiting to take off for cuba at a moments notice.
finally khrushchev called the ships back and offered to negotiate.
the public breathed a collective sigh of relief that nuclear war had been averted but the crisis lingered on behind closed doors for another month.
as soviet engineers continued to work on the missile sites kennedy and khrushchev debated the exact terms of an agreement.
in the end the american navy won the right to inspect ships carrying dismantled missiles out of cuba.
in return the united states agreed to dismantle its missiles in turkey and pledged to respect cuban independence by not launching another bay of pigs type invasion.
over the next few years landbased missile sites lost significance as more american and soviet submarines equipped with nuclear missiles began patrolling the oceans.
having teetered on the brink of nuclear war both the united states and the soviet union opted to deescalate tensions.
kennedy and khrushchev agreed to establish a hotline connection between washington and moscow so they could speak directly in the event of another crisis.
in june 1963 britain the soviet union and the united states also signed the limited test ban treaty which banned atmospheric and underwater testing of nuclear weapons.

determined to get soviet missiles out of cuba kennedy and his advisors debated how to respond on october 16 1962.
choices use air and ground forces to attack cuba and destroy the missile sites.
follow up an attack on cuba with a fullscale invasion to depose castro.
negotiate with the soviet union and cuba.
use a naval quarantine to prevent soviet supplied missiles from reaching cuba.
decision kennedy opted for the quarantine.
he sent the american navy 500 miles from cuban shores to intercept soviet vessels carrying missiles and threatened a nuclear attack on the soviet union if missiles were launched from cuba.
consequences for two tense days soviet ships steamed toward american naval vessels.
at the last minute khrushchev called the ships back and offered to negotiate by removing the missiles if kennedy pledged not to attack cuba and the united states dismantled its missiles in turkey.
kennedy privately agreed to these terms.
by distance between cuba and major u s cities 1962 deciding against an air strike kennedy may have averted a nuclear war.
unbeknownst to the president nuclear warheads were already in cuba.
soviet commanders on the ground had permission to use them if the united states attacked and considered using them against the blockade.
continuing controversies did kennedy react correctly during the cuban missile crisis.
supporters argue that kennedy effectively used the threat of an american nuclear attack traditional naval tactics and old fashioned diplomacy to end the crisis without resorting to war.
by doing so he maintained americas strategic advantage against the soviet union and improved the nations image worldwide after the bay of pigs fiasco.
detractors claim that kennedy provoked a crisis where there was none.
short and mediumrange missiles in cuba did not alter the soviets ability to watch the video president john f kennedy and the cuban missile crisis attack with long range missiles or of the united states to launch a devastating second strike.
supporters counter that the improved accuracy of shorter range missiles fired from cuba posed a real threat.
critics also point out that because kennedy made concessions privately to khrushchev the crisis gave rise to the myth that brinkmanship or threatening nuclear war rather than diplomatic negotiations caused the soviets to back down.
overconfidence after the cuban missile crisis would lead to missteps in americas growing military involvement in the vietnam war and elsewhere.

hear the audio file on watch the video critical visions chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 vietnam was americas longest war to date a conflict that divided the nation to an extent not seen since the civil war.
for 30 years the united states invested money and then eventually soldiers in the struggle to prevent the establishment of communism in the small southeast asian country of vietnam.
from 1945 to 1964 the united states fought a proxy war by funneling supplies and aid to others willing to fight the vietnamese communists.
in 1965 the conflict became an american war when president lyndon johnson sent u s ground forces to fight in southeast asia.
by 1967 the antiwar movement had taken to the streets to protest americas involvement in vietnam.
on october 21 1967 antiwar protesters held a peace rally before the lincoln memorial in washington d c after which thirty thousand demonstrators linked arms and marched to the pentagon the headquarters of the department of defense.
when they arrived soldiers advanced toward the crowd with their guns drawn.
an 18 year old actor from new york with a flair for the dramatic stepped forward holding a bouquet of pink carnations and carefully placed one into each soldiers rifle.
washington star news photographer bernie boston captured this poetic gesture in flower power an iconic photo of the civil strife that the war triggered.
competing interpretations of this image revealed key divisions of the era.
for peace advocates the photograph illustrated the stark contrast between government sponsored violence in vietnam and american citizens demand for peace.
critics of the peace movement who accused activists of destroying respect for law and order viewed the gesture as a ploy to distract the soldiers moments before demonstrators stormed the steps of the pentagon and armed guards beat them back.
the vietnam war originated as an anticolonial struggle to win independence from france and then evolved into a civil war between north and south vietnam.
at first the crucial debates about vietnam took place behind closed doors in the white house.
over the course of the countrys 30 year engagement in vietnam despite being presented continuously with other viewpoints five american presidents from truman to nixon chose escalation when faced with the option of pulling back or pressing forward.
viewing the vietnamese conflict through the prism of the global cold war each president feared that losing all of vietnam to communism would set off a chain reaction of communist revolutions throughout southeast asia.
world war ii had united the nation.
vietnam fractured it.
the guerilla war under way in south vietnam in which communist soldiers intermingled with the civilian population to avoid detection made it particularly difficult for americans to separate enemy combatants from civilians.
when the american military tried using overwhelming force to flush communist guerillas out of south vietnamese villages the civilian death toll turned many americans against the war.
the conflict ultimately tore apart both vietnam and america before the united states finally withdrew in 1973.
the war ended with a communist victory in 1975.
we will not be defeated.
we will not grow tired.
we will not withdraw president lyndon b johnson in 1965 chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 the long road to war from 1945 to 1965 america gradually shifted its cold war focus from europe to asia.
the united states first supported french efforts to recover vietnam as a colony and then sustained an independent anti communist south vietnam with financial aid.
at home some american policymakers envisioned the war as part of the worldwide struggle between democracy and communism.
in vietnam however americans confronted a country torn apart by a civil war that reflected its long standing religious and political divisions.
no american president sought a war in vietnam and key advisors offered competing assessments of americas chances for victory.
yet at critical moments when the intractable political and military situation called for a response each president chose to bolster the american commitment rather than turn back.
the escalating importance of vietnam america first became involved in vietnam during world war ii when japan took over the french colony of indochina present day laos cambodia and vietnam.
in 1945 u s intelligence operatives worked with ho chi minh the leader of an underground vietnamese communist resistance movement that launched guerilla attacks against the japanese occupiers.
when the war ended ho chi minh and his rebel force formed a provisional government in hanoi and declared independence from france.
eager to reestablish its position as a world power after the humiliating occupation by germany in world war ii france sent in troops to crush the vietnamese independence movement.
in search of international support for vietnamese independence the western educated ho chi minh turned to the united states.
ho chi minh had previously tried to interest the united states in vietnamese independence by submitting a petition to the american delegation at the paris peace conference in 1919 after world war i that called for democratic reforms in french indochina.
the american delegation ignored his request mindful that his proposal would anger the french whose support president woodrow wilson needed to create the league of nations see chapter 20.
after the rebuff in paris ho chi minh became a communist attracted by communisms revolutionary promise to free colonized peoples.
it was patriotism not communism that inspired me he later claimed.
in 1941 after nearly three decades abroad working as a soviet spy ho who was ho chi minh to his supporters and foes.
chi minh returned to vietnam to help organize communist resistance to the japanese occupation.
despite this revolutionary background he hoped that the united states would support vietnamese independence when japan withdrew in 1945.
his communist credentials however tainted him in the eyes of president harry s truman who remained unmoved by ho chi minhs truthful assurances that the soviet union did not control or finance him.
in the 1940s the americans saw ho chi minh as a communist puppet doing moscows bidding.
his vietnamese followers however viewed him as a charismatic leader ignited with a patriotic desire to free his nation from french colonial control.
as one disciple recalled the 55 year old uncle ho spoke with an ardent and idealistic nationalism that encouraged many vietnamese to join the vietminh the term used initially to describe all vietnamese communists and after 1954 solely for north vietnamese communists.
this photograph 26 1 of ho chi minh sitting with children reinforced his reputation in vietnam as a beloved wise elder.
the image tapped into prevailing confucian ideals including filial piety respect toward living and dead relatives loyalty and humane treatment of others.
ho chi minh broadened his appeal by eschewing personal luxuries and living simply in a small cottage.
by the time american troops arrived in the late 1960s an ailing ho chi minh played almost no official role in the conflict.
he nonetheless remained the face of vietnamese communism for supporters and opponents throughout the war.
cold war geopolitics consistently influenced how americans reacted to the vietnamese communist revolt.
as the emerging cold war with the read the document declaration of independence for vietnam 1945 the long road to war soviet union in the 1940s made containing communism in europe a national obsession vietnam took on new political significance.
the united states needed help from a vigorous and cooperative france to defend western europe from soviet incursion.
to rebuild the french economy and establish goodwill the united states gave france arms and funds beginning in 1947 see chapter 24.
the french government used some of this aid to finance the war in vietnam.
the united states also agreed to support french efforts to regain control of its vietnamese colony.
in 1950 the strategic importance of vietnam for the united states changed dramatically.
the fall of china to communism in 1949 and the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 when communist led north korea invaded the anti communist south korea created fears that all of asia might fall to communism.
the who lost china debate hurt truman politically and no subsequent president wanted to be the one blamed for vietnam falling to communism.
containing communism in both europe and asia became cornerstones of american foreign policy from this point on requiring the united states to maintain military bases throughout western europe and along a string of pacific islands from japan to the philippines.
as the cold war spread to asia key presidential advisors saw the hand of the soviet union behind every communist victory.
by the early 1950s national security council report 68 or nsc 68 a document that described a global communist monolith set the tone for u s foreign policy see chapter 24.
any more territory under the domination of the kremlin the national security council warned would make the soviet union invincible in a future military conflict.
the threat would deepen if the soviets gained control of resource rich southeast asia whose rubber rice tin and oil were important economically to the united states.
these resources were even more vital for japan now a key american ally in the struggle against communism and the united states wanted to ensure japanese access to these materials by preventing them from falling into unfriendly communist hands.
hardliners in the truman and eisenhower administrations embraced the domino theory the fear that a communist vietnam would open the door to a complete communist takeover of southeast asia with communists repeating japans conquest of the region in world war ii.
announcing the domino theory president dwight d eisenhower explained in a 1954 press conference you have a row of dominos set up you knock over the first one and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly.
so you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences events in the 1950s gave credence to these fears.
josef stalins success in pressuring china and north korea to accept an armistice to end the korean war strengthened the american conviction that the soviet union could start or stop 26 1 ho chi minh poses with children 1954 ho chi minhs followers revered him as a wise elder who loved his nation.
what political and strategic importance did vietnam assume in u s foreign policy by the mid 1950s.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 taking over from the french 26 2 how about the other buttons.
this 1953 illustration shows soviet leader josef stalin pressing his finger on a button labeled korea to end the korean war.
this cartoon suggested that stalin could stop other conflicts that he had initiated including the war in indochina.
communist insurgencies around the globe.
this political cartoon 26 2 by marcus edwin showed stalin pressing the stop button for korea and suggested that he could also stop the conflict in indochina vietnam if he wished.
indeed stalin had encouraged the chinese leader mao zedong to take charge of promoting communist revolution throughout asia.
the immediate influx of communist chinese advisors to train vietminh officers plus mountains of chinese manufactured vehicles arms and ammunition seemingly confirmed that the vietminh were part of an international communist conspiracy masterminded in moscow.
american policymakers failed to appreciate however that a shared belief in communism did not override the nationalistic ambitions of the soviet union china or vietnam.
ho chi minh accepted help from the chinese but remembering chinas ancient colonization of vietnam he remained suspicious of their ulterior motives and had no intention of turning vietnam over to them.
it is better to sniff french dung for a while than eat chinas all our life warned ho chi minh.
in an american worldview that saw every communist revolution as part of the soviet unions master plan the specific grievances or goals of the vietminh became irrelevant.
what key choices did eisenhower make in 1954 that increased u s involvement in vietnam.
to hold the line in vietnam the american government was willing to foot the bill but wanted the french to do the actual fighting.
the united states upheld its end of the bargain.
by 1954 the united states was paying for 80 percent of the wars costs money used to both purchase arms and fund humanitarian projects including free health clinics food for refugees and seeds for farmers.
increasingly however the united states doubted in the words of trumans outgoing secretary of state dean acheson the french will to carry on as acheson anticipated the incoming eisenhower administration soon faced a crisis in vietnam.
in 1954 the vietminh defeated the french at dien bien phu in the northwest corner of the country prompting the french to seek an international agreement with the vietminh.
the resulting geneva accords 1954 called for a temporary partition of vietnam along the seventeenth parallel with the vietminh in the north and the french in the south and a general election in two years to reunify the country under one government.
refusing to sign the geneva accords the eisenhower administration instead resolved to use the two year period to ease the french out of south vietnam and create a new government capable of raising and training a strong military to resist communist aggression.
to head the new south vietnamese government the united states selected ngo dinh diem a wealthy catholic who had served as minister of the interior in the french colonial administration before resigning when the french refused to enact reforms he proposed.
a staunch nationalist diem moved to the united states where he became well known to american policymakers.
neither diem nor the united states intended to let the scheduled election take place certain that ho chi minhs authoritarian government would use force and fraud to ensure victory in the north and perhaps in the south as well.
instead the united states tried to destabilize ho chi minhs fledgling communist government by creating political turmoil in north vietnam.
central intelligence agency cia operatives destroyed government printing presses contaminated the oil used in bus engines sabotaged railway tracks and planted rumors of chinese troops raping north vietnamese women.
eisenhower supported the creation of an anticommunist south vietnam to stem the tide of communism in southeast asia.
as an additional defense read the document dwight d eisenhower dien bien phu 1954 the long road to war against communism the united states formed the southeast asian treaty organization seato in 1954.
through seato the united states britain france australia new zealand thailand pakistan and the philippines granted independence by the united states in 1946 pledged to meet common danger in southeast asia together.
a separate agreement identified vietnam laos and cambodia as areas that would endanger the peace and security of seato members if any of these three nations came under attack.
unlike the north atlantic treaty organization nato which guaranteed the mutual defense of member nations in europe the seato treaty left each nations exact commitment vague.
secretary of state john foster dulles wanted it that way reluctant to overextend american military responsibilities around the world by guaranteeing the borders of seato members.
even if this loosely worded pact failed to deter communist aggression dulles reasoned it would provide a justification for direct american involvement in vietnam to protect seato members if the united states decided to escalate its involvement in the future.
an important development in americas ever increasing involvement in vietnam seato illustrated how completely the united states linked the civil war in vietnam to the global crusade against communism.
with the united states poised to embark on a major campaign to create an independent south vietnam dissenting voices within the government urged the president to pull back.
secretary of defense charles e wilson warned that he could see nothing but grief in store for us if we remained the joint chiefs of staff complained it would be impossible to build a capable south vietnamese army without a reasonably strong stable civil government in control this chicken and egg argument over which needed to come first a strong south vietnamese government or a strong military divided american policymakers for the next 15 years.
with diem the united states got neither.
a short stocky man who always dressed in white diems stiff and privileged appearance contrasted poorly with the plain dress and manners of ho chi minh.
the eisenhower administration recognized diems shortcomings but secretary of state dulles accepted the american ambassadors conclusion that there is no one to take his place who would serve u s interests better the united states quickly realized that diem intended to build a dictatorial regime in south vietnam.
diem modeled his rule on nineteenth century vietnamese emperors issuing decrees and refusing to abide criticism.
i know what is best for my people he declared in one interview.
the secret police headed by diems brother ngo dinh nhu arrested tortured and executed thousands of south vietnamese accused of opposing his rule.
most vietminh had relocated to north vietnam when the country split into two but remnants of the communist guerilla force still existed in the south.
they found ample discontent with diem among peasants students buddhists and even south vietnamese soldiers.
to destabilize the diem regime the communists unleashed a wave of assassinations targeting wealthy landlords and rural officials who worked for the regime.
diem tried to cut off guerilla fighters from their supply base.
he moved peasants off their ancestral lands and into strategic hamlets protected by moats and walls and imprisoned thousands of civilians suspected of aiding the rebels.
enraged over the forced removals the peasants were like a mound of straw ready to be ignited claimed one vietnamese communist.
the u s government and press revealed none of diems internal difficulties to the american people.
when diem visited the united states in 1957 the american press praised him as the tough little miracle man who had brought stability to south vietnam.
we can take pride in our support newsweek trumpeted.
in the mid 1950s ho chi minh offered southern communists little support.
he was instead preoccupied with subduing the widespread protests that greeted his forced land redistribution in north vietnam a campaign that sent armed posses into the countryside to confiscate land.
these land reforms left thousands of property owners dead destroyed communities and created famine.
by 1960 however the north vietnamese government was sending soldiers and supplies to southern communists unleashing a terror campaign to pave the way for a communist takeover of south vietnam.
in 1960 the southern communists formed the national liberation front nlf to unite the factions in south vietnamese society opposed to the diem regime into a fighting coalition.
diem derogatorily called south vietnamese communists vietcong slang meaning vietnamese commies the name stuck.
from this point on americans called all communists from south vietnam vietcong and communists from north vietnam vietminh why did the civil war in vietnam reignite in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 debates within the kennedy administration john f kennedy became president in 1961 having proclaimed vietnam the cornerstone of the free world in southeast asia kennedy understood the negative political consequences of losing a nation to communism.
as a congressman he had joined the chorus criticizing truman when china succumbed to communism.
in 1961 kennedy suffered two setbacks of his own in the global war against communism with the botched cuban bay of pigs invasion and his inability to stop the soviets from constructing the berlin wall see chapter 24.
his leadership during the cuban missile crisis in 1962 however redeemed his reputation as a cold war warrior.
kennedy did not intend to let the conflict in vietnam bring his administration down.
faced with a worsening political and military situation in vietnam kennedy received conflicting recommendations from his advisors.
one group envisioned escalating the american commitment by sending in combat troops.
another wanted to seek a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.
faced with these divided opinions kennedy chose a middle path.
instead of infantry troops he sent more financial aid and increased the number of american military advisors in south vietnam from one thousand to sixteen thousand.
officially these advisors helped train the south vietnamese army.
in actuality many advisors were green berets the armys special force troops who organized south vietnamese attacks on vietcong supply lines flew planes when south vietnamese pilots were unavailable and picked up casualties in helicopters after skirmishes.
when word of these activities leaked out kennedy publicly denied that americans were participating in active combat operations in vietnam.
supporting the diem regime while applying pressure for reform appears to be the only practicable alternative at this time the joint chiefs convinced kennedy cautioning that any reversal of u s policy could have disastrous effects throughout southeast asia.
as south vietnamese anger against his rule intensified diem privately voiced his own mounting frustration with the growing american presence in south vietnam.
all these soldiers he fumed referring to the green berets and military advisors.
i never asked them to come here to rid south vietnam of americans diem and his police chief brother nhu decided to seek a negotiated settlement with north vietnam in 1963.
upset with diems overture to north vietnam what conflicting recommendations did kennedy receive from his advisors about vietnam.
the turning point for the kennedy administration came in june when a buddhist monk set himself on fire in a busy street in saigon the capital of south vietnam.
the catholic diem had long discriminated against buddhists.
thousands of north vietnamese catholics fled to the south when the communists took over in 1954 and diem rewarded them with land and governmental positions.
in may 1963 nhu refused to let the buddhists fly a multicolored flag honoring buddha on his birthday.
widespread street protests ensued which nhu suppressed with soldiers who used water hoses tear gas and on one occasion bullets killing a woman and eight children.
on june 10 1963 a buddhist monk invited associated press photographer malcolm browne to witness something important the next morning.
browne arrived at the designated street crossing and watched monks take a canister of gasoline out of the white car shown in this picture 26 3 and place a brown mat in the middle of the street.
moments later a buddhist monk thich quang duc sat down on the mat in the lotus position.
after another monk poured gasoline over him duc struck a match.
flames instantaneously engulfed his body.
his eyes were closed but his features were twisted in apparent pain browne recalled.
as browne snapped this memorable photo a monk shouted into a microphone in vietnamese and english a buddhist priest burns himself to death.
a buddhist priest becomes a martyr monks seen in the background lined the streets to prevent anyone from trying to save duc.
immediately proclaimed a buddhist saint ducs ashes were distributed to pagodas towering buddhist temples throughout south vietnam.
duc carefully staged his suicide to gain maximum exposure for the buddhists political protest using the western press to help rally opposition to diem within south vietnam and the united states.
the burning monk image shocked but also bewildered americans.
the american government and press had continually praised diem as a valiant cold war ally but this photo suggested strong opposition to his rule at home.
students buddhist priests and soldiers in south vietnam responded to the suicide as a call to action.
street protests erupted the military began planning a coup and six other monks set themselves on fire in front of western journalists.
with a framed copy of brownes burning monk image on his desk kennedy secretly agreed to support a military coup to overthrow the diem regime.
the long road to war his presidential reelection bid kennedy was visiting dallas to shore up his fading popularity among texans angered by his support for the civil rights movement see chapter 27.
this was the first trip that jackie kennedy had taken with her husband since the death of their two day old son patrick three months photographer malcolm browne before.
kennedy decided to ride in an on photographing thich quang ducs open air convertible rejecting the sugself immolation in 1963 gestion from his secret service guards that he sit within a bulletproof clear glass bubble for the ride past the crowds.
an amateur movie by abraham zapruder a russian immigrant the military coup supported by president kennedy and kennedy supporter gave the nation its most enled to the murder of diem and nhu but americans during images of this killing film stills that provoked had little time to reflect on these events.
three weeks countless controversies over who killed the president.
later on november 22 1963 lee harvey oswald in its investigation of the assassination the warren shot and killed president kennedy in dallas texas commission cited the zapruder film as evidence that as kennedy waved to onlookers from an open oswald acted alone claiming that the film footage convertible with his wife by his side.
in the midst of showed bullets entering the presidents body from i must say that during the monk episode i had no impulse to try to go in and save him.
i knew for one thing that he intended it this way 26 3 burning monk thich quang duc wanted the western press to photograph his 1963 suicide to publicize the buddhist protest against the corrupt diem regime.
the kennedy assassination what insights does the story behind this 1963 photo offer into the vietnam war.
chapter 26 26 4 jackie kennedy on november 22 1963 the day president john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas the first ladys personal tragedy became enveloped in political symbolism.
here she stands by as the new president lyndon b johnson takes the oath of office to visibly assure the nation that she supported the smooth transition of power.
a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 only one direction.
counterclaims that the assassination was the result of a wider conspiracy involving other gunmen the mafia cuban dictator fidel castro and the cia continue to this day.
vice president lyndon baines johnson lbj was riding two cars behind kennedy in the dallas motorcade.
when kennedy died within hours of the shooting johnson who was next in line to assume the presidency insisted on taking the oath of office before judge sarah hughes with jackie kennedy on one side and his wife on the other before the presidential airplane air force one left dallas.
the presence of the slain presidents widow would johnson felt immediately legitimatize the transfer of power in the eyes of the american people.
already on board the plane which was carrying her husbands body back to washington d c jackie kennedy complied with johnsons request but had no chance to change her clothes.
in this portrait 26 4 of johnsons swearing in photographer cecil stoughton carefully framed out jackie kennedys skirt which was stained with her husbands blood.
her pale and drawn expression nonetheless reflected the days ordeal.
a wealthy massachusetts born catholic kennedy had selected johnson a powerful texan politician as his vice presidential running mate to help broaden his appeal in the south.
johnson grew how did images both provoke and quell controversy surrounding the kennedy assassination.
up poor and worked as a teacher before entering national politics as an avid supporter of the new deal in 1937.
johnson relied heavily on his superior political instincts and outgoing personality to rise to prominence.
in the senate he became the most powerful majority leader in history.
a larger thanlife figure his brashness contrasted sharply with the slain presidents debonair manner.
johnsons most legendary gaff came in 1965 when he lifted his shirt during a press conference to show reporters his 12 inch scar from recent gallbladder surgery.
johnson wanted to reassure the nation about his recovery but critics lampooned the act as crude and undignified.
the gulf of tonkin lyndon baines johnson inherited a rapidly deteriorating situation in vietnam after the diem assassination.
like his predecessors he faced the choice of pulling back or escalating the american commitment which at this point consisted of sixteen thousand military advisors and green berets and substantial financial aid to south vietnam.
after the diem assassination south vietnam slipped into perpetual political instability as a succession of rulers failed to gain the support of the people.
the shifting geopolitical situation also prompted a reappraisal of the american assumption that the soviet union was controlling the movements of communists throughout the world.
the previous american conception of a global communist conspiracy became harder to maintain in the face of the open split between the soviet union and china in 1964.
the sino soviet alliance fell apart when the soviets suggested that the two countries scale back their support of worldwide communist insurgencies to improve relations with the united states.
mao refused.
once again elected officials and policymakers differed behind closed doors on the best course of action.
national security advisor mcgeorge bundy told johnson that the right course is to continue to strengthen our struggle against the communist terror which is exactly what this is senator richard russell a close confidant of the president disagreed with those who claimed that well lose everything in southeast asia if we lose vietnam johnson himself feared that read the document george balls dissenting opinion on vietnam 1965 the long road to war.
withdrawal would mark him as a weak leader emboldening conservative challenges to the general earle wheeler civil rights laws and expanded supporting the troop buildup in vietnam social welfare programs for the poor that he wanted to enact.
i was determined to keep the war on march 8 1965 the first american marines from shattering that dream johnson later admitlanded at da nang along the northern coast of south ted by which time the war had indeed consumed vietnam where young women put leis around their the financial resources and political goodwill that necks during an official ceremony.
in the years that the president needed to fully realize this dream see followed troops received a distinctly less warm chapter 27.
as the american air force began a major events off the coast of north vietnam soon gave johnson an excuse to act boldly.

why was the 1964 gulf of tonkin incident a turning point in the vietnam war.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 choices and consequences making vietnam americas war in early 1965 johnson initiated a regular bombing campaign against north vietnam and sent 82 000 ground troops to south vietnam.
the theater commander general william westmoreland soon requested 150 000 more.
in deciding how to respond to westmorelands request the presidents advisors gave johnson the following choices in the summer of 1965.
choices avoid a protracted war with little chance for a military or political victory over the communists and seek a negotiated settlement in vietnam.
continue at the present level of military aid to south vietnam and push for political reforms there to create a more democratic anticommunist government.
send the requested troops expand the bombing campaign and work for political reforms in south vietnam.
decision johnson considered a negotiated settlement as tantamount to losing vietnam to communism an outcome he viewed as a threat to both southeast asia and his presidency.
certain that south vietnam would lose the war without additional u s aid he publicly agreed to send fifty thousand troops immediately.
he privately guaranteed westmoreland an additional fifty thousand and promised to send more as needed.
he also approved heavy bombing of vietcong strongholds in south vietnam and tried to institute political reforms in south vietnam to erode support for the vietcong.
consequences the united states was no longer simply aiding south vietnam in its struggle against communism but now took the lead in fighting the vietcong and the north vietnamese.
by 1967 there were nearly 500 000 american troops in vietnam.
during the war the united states dropped more bombs there than it had in world war ii.
johnsons dilemma.
he is shown here with defense secretary robert mcnamara.
continuing controversies should the united states have fought a major war in vietnam.
detractors claim that johnson committed the united states to an unwinnable war by trying to use the military to solve a political problem in south vietnam.
he underestimated the will of the vietcong and exaggerated the importance of south vietnam to containing communism in the rest of southeast asia.
he failed to build strong domestic support for a long war leading to unrest at home over the draft why was johnsons decision to escalate u s troop levels in 1965 important.
and rising casualties.
johnsons supporters argue that he honored a commitment to south vietnam made by his predecessors.
this reassured american allies worldwide that they could count on the united states.
retreat would only have invited further communist aggression in southeast asia and europe.
losing vietnam would have weakened johnson politically putting his controversial domestic reform and civil rights legislative agenda in jeopardy.
fighting in vietnam fighting in vietnam david halberstam reporting for the new york times in 1962 summed up the military dilemma in vietnam perfectly it is often impossible to separate the cruel and dedicated foe you want to kill from the simple and illiterate peasant you want to woo america and north vietnam embraced competing strategic visions in fighting the war.
while the american military preferred fighting against uniformed soldiers on a clearly defined battlefield the communists embraced guerilla warfare where troops blended into the civilian population or stayed hidden in underground tunnels.
the american military tried to defeat vietnamese guerillas by bombing enemy bases and destroying their village refuges.
these tactics created another set of competing visions about the war the soldiers view of an unending conflict versus the image of imminent victory that the government championed at home.
the bombing campaign the american military relied heavily on bombing to defeat the vietcong and north vietnamese.
the american bombing campaign was the largest air war in world history with american planes dropping nearly five million tons of bombs in eight years.
the americans hoped to pressure north vietnam into ending the war.
the north vietnamese instead learned to live with bombs.
the sighting of american planes over the north vietnamese capital city of hanoi sent inhabitants scurrying into bombproof underground shelters.
the government built thirty thousand miles of tunnels which moved the nations transportation and communication infrastructure underground.
the sustained bombing campaign bred anti american feelings among the civilian population that made it easier for the north vietnamese government to mobilize the country to foil the war of aggression of the u s imperialists navy captain james stockdale led the first american air strike against north vietnamese oil tanks in the wake of the gulf of tonkin incident.
a year later during another air raid he was shot down over a small coastal village in north vietnam where angry villagers beat him and broke his knee.
stockdale spent the next seven and a half years in a prisoner of war pow camp.
his jailers brutally tortured him when he taught fellow pows a walltapping code so they could communicate with one another during their years in solitary confinement.
american planes also targeted the ho chi minh trail a 600 mile north vietnamese supply route that ran along the western border of vietnam through the mountainous rain forest of neighboring laos and cambodia.
nearly five thousand communist soldiers and workers completed the arduous three month journey each month bringing troops munitions and food to the vietcong.
north vietnamese propaganda glorified the difficult journey with images that emphasized the toughness and determination of its people.

chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 americans also extensively bombed south vietnamese free fire zones villages that supposedly contained only enemy combatants.
the american air campaign included spraying defoliants usually agent orange that stripped trees of their leaves to expose vietcong hideouts and killed the crops that might feed enemy troops.

reworking of a popular environmental slogan only you can prevent forest fires defoliants ultimately destroyed half of vietnams forests and caused lasting health problems for both american pilots and the vietnamese that included cancers and birth defects.
responding to negative publicity the military stopped using defoliants in 1971.
american pilots also dropped napalm a jellylike gasoline that ignited on impact to destroy south vietnamese villages hiding enemy troops.
napalm severely burns the body contributing to the misery of civilians subject to bombing attacks.
reports of mounting civilian suffering energized the u s peace movement a loose coalition of antiwar activists that included pacifists students professors clergy hippies young people who rejected middle class values and adopted a bohemian lifestyle civil rights activists and middleclass liberals.
in making his decision to go to war johnson had focused on placating his hawkish critics without considering the political fallout of antagonizing the left.
by 1967 however belatedly realizing the price he was paying for waging the war the president noted the major threat we have politically is from the doves war ii phil caputo viewed joining the marines as a way to escape suburbia and serve his country.

combat however quickly shattered the idealism of men like caputo.
in 1965 life photojournalist larry burrows spent a month with helicopter crews documenting their heroism and the harrowing combat.
in this photo 26 7 gunner james farley fires on enemy troops below as the pilot lands to rescue a downed american helicopter crew.
subsequent photos captured the anguish on farleys face when he realized that the rescued pilot had died.
the drafted men sent to vietnam in later years had fewer illusions than the initial volunteers.
conscripts were often working class men who did not qualify for draft deferments which only collegebound and married men enjoyed.
volunteers and conscripts served one year tours in vietnam and as the time to return home neared they often became more averse to taking risks in combat.
some soldiers even used their helmets as calendars openly marking off the days left until their tour of duty ended.
in world war ii american soldiers had fought against a clearly distinguishable enemy in the pacific island jungles.

on january 30 1968 during the vietnamese new year holiday known as tet date as his official body count echoed an uncomfortable truth about the value of these officially circulated figures.
north vietnamese and vietcong forces launched the tet offensive a massive coordinated assault against more than 100 cities and towns in south vietnam.
the map of vietnam 26 10 depicts the wideranging attacks.
uncle ho was already quite old and the entire army and population were exerted to do their best to liberate the south before his passing a north vietnamese officer recalled.
by demonstrating their determination to fight forever the north vietnamese wanted to convince johnson that the cost of an american victory was too high.
the communists also expected their attack on previously calm cities to spark a revolution within south vietnam.
before the tet offensive the communists had lured nearly fifty thousand american troops away from the cities by laying siege to a remote marine garrison in khe sanh and attacking a few isolated towns.
the weakened american presence left the urban centers vulnerable to enemy attack.
a shocked american public watched on television as 19 vietcong commandos entered the courtyard of the american embassy complex in saigon and battled guards there for six hours.
it took heavy fighting and more than a month before american troops regained control of south the tet offensive in 1967 americans support for the war began to flounder.
nearly nineteen thousand american soldiers had died so far and each month draft boards inducted another thirty thousand into the military.
johnsons call for new taxes to meet rising war expenses further dismayed americans.
some leading policymakers also changed their minds.
secretary of defense robert mcnamara underwent the greatest shift in views.
he went from strenuously advocating war some critics called it mcnamaras war to conceding that ho chi minh is a tough old s o b.

chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 images as history the power of the press in vietnam photographers typically convey a point of view through their photos.
however the differing interpretations surrounding some of the most famous photographs from the vietnam war suggest that each photo took on a life of its own as americans disregarded the photographers original reason for taking the photo and imposed a different meaning on the image that reflected their own political views.
rather than creating new ideas or values these images became iconic visual statements about the war because they reinforced strongly held beliefs within the population.
in examining the text and photos in this box consider what kind of power the press had to mold public opinion about the war.
in the midst of the 1968 tet offensive associated press photographer eddie adams saw south vietnamese police apprehend a vietcong suspect in the streets of saigon.
adams snapped his prize winning photo just as south vietnamese general nguyen ngoc loan aimed his pistol at the mans head and pulled the trigger.
instead of justifiable retribution many americans saw an execution.
prisoners of war have the right to a trial under international law critics argued.
he killed many of my men and many of your people loan told adams.
the new york times caption echoed loans justification for his act.
guerilla dies brig.
gen nguyen ngoc loan national police chief executes man identified as a vietcong terrorist in saigon.
man wore civilian dress and had a pistol this striking image of one mans death became a symbol of the failed u s effort to establish the rule of law in south vietnam prompting fears that american soldiers were also killing prisoners of war.
adams regretted taking a photo that forever tarnished loans reputation whom he felt had simply acted impetuously in the heat of combat.
pictures do not always tell the full story and this is one case where that is true adams contended.
supporters of loan noted that the vietcong ruthlessly executed thousands of south vietnamese officials and police during the tet offensive.
why did this image become the defining one of the tet offensive.
view the closer look images as history the power of the press in vietnam fighting in vietnam in 1966 life photographer larry burrows went into the field with a group of marines trying to stop north vietnamese infiltration through the demilitarized zone along the seventeenth parallel a supposedly combat free strip of land that separated north and south vietnam.
he snapped this image of a wounded black soldier reaching out to a white buddy sprawled on the ground.
life published the photo twice once right after burrows took it and again in 1971 to eulogize burrows after he died a helicopter crash in laos.
in their letters to life many readers said that burrowss portrait illustrated how the shared burden of combat inspired men to transcend the great racial problems of american society.
burrowss photo gave some viewers hope that whether purple polka dotted or streaked americans could also learn to live together as brothers at home.
in his captioning burrows emphasized soldiers suffering in the midst of combat simply noting at a first aid center during operation prairie a wounded gi reaches out towards a stricken comrade the interracial compassion captured by burrowss photo told only one side of the story.
racial conflict permeated the armed forces in the rear and on ships suggesting that fighting together did not magically heal the racial divide.
the wounded soldier lies in a crucifix position establishing a symbolic link between christ who suffered on the cross to redeem humankind and a soldier sacrificing his life to save his nation.
how does this image compare to combat photographs from world war ii and the korean war see chapters 23 and 24.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 controversy on the home front advocates for peace have opposed every american war but their dissent rarely influenced the mainstream political debate.
during the vietnam war these rebellious voices offering an alternative vision of peace moved from the fringes to the center of american political life.
growing in strength as more americans began to oppose the war the peace movement made itself visible through mass demonstrations propaganda posters and press coverage of celebrities who joined it.
the very existence of a vocal peace movement in the midst of a war however also invited controversy because americans held differing views on the legitimacy of wartime dissent.
many peace activists believed they were preserving the american tradition of freedom of speech.
public opinion polls from 1965 to 1973 however consistently showed that most americans disliked both the war and the peace movement.
the antiwar movement in announcing his decision not to run for reelection in 1968 johnson noted that there is division in the american house right now in the 1960s the rise of a youth based counterculture and a powerful civil rights movement roiled the country see chapter 27.
the night of his announcement however johnson was referring to the domestic debate over the war in vietnam.
although many working and middle class people opposed the war overcoming existing cultural and class divisions in american society to create a unified antiwar movement proved difficult.
the organized antiwar movement tended to attract mostly white middle class college educated americans or individuals already engaged in crusades of social justice.
many working class women and african americans with grade school educations and lowpaying jobs opposed the war but had little interest in marching alongside middle class college students in street demonstrations.
hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today a popular chant during antiwar demonstrations uniting around one universal vision also posed difficulties for the antiwar movement.
all peace activists wanted to end the war in vietnam but they offered different arguments for doing so.
some made a primarily moral argument.
they claimed that a war involving napalm search and destroy what differing visions did peace activists offer on the war.
missions and forced relocation into strategic hamlets hurt the vietnamese more than living under communist rule did.
others focused on the futility of fighting an unwinnable civil war.
another group accepted that the nation needed to stop communist china from expanding its influence.
they argued that working with ho chi minh could accomplish this goal more effectively than fighting a war in vietnam.
these critics noted that while ho accepted chinese aid to fight the united states he was leery of chinese ambitions to control vietnam.
america had worked successfully in europe with the independently minded communist leader josip broz tito in yugoslavia to contain soviet ambitions in the balkans.
why could it not do the same in vietnam.
other activists saw a chance to open the nations eyes to injustice at home as well as overseas.
student leaders from the nations top universities founded the students for a democratic society sds at port huron michigan in 1962.
a leader in the new left movement sds combined staunch opposition to the war with a scathing critique of the inequities of capitalism see chapter 27.
although their reasons for opposing the war differed peace advocates agreed that the war was destroying american democracy.
they noted violations of american democratic values going to war without a formal declaration of war from congress presidential secrets and lies fbi surveillance of peace protesters and unjust draft deferments for middle and upper class men who could afford to go to college.
when civil rights leader martin luther king jr spoke out against the war in 1967 he denounced both the destruction of vietnamese culture and the wars negative impact on african americans.
the wars high cost diverted funds from antipoverty programs at home king rightly view the image vietnam i want out controversy on the home front contended.
the disproportionately high numbers of african american men fighting and dying in vietnam further illustrated ongoing racial injustice within the united states he continued.
kings criticism was valid in 1967 but over the entire war black soldiers did not incur higher casualty rates than the rest of the population.
one antiwar poster 26 11 captured this link between racial inequality and the war by picturing two african american soldiers as they advanced into the jungle under the headline the only time were in the front is when its time to die the rebuke against king for these statements was swift and severe including criticism from civil rights activists who worried that his antiwar views would discredit their cause.
king died a year later from an assassins bullet cutting short his career as a civil rights leader and antiwar activist.
the peace movement brought the debate over the war out of the halls of government and into the streets.
in 1965 university of michigan faculty and students organized the first teach in a series of public lectures and debates protesting the war.
over the next eight years scholars and students on hundreds of other college campuses held teach ins.
some teach ins invited counterprotests.
at the conclusion of a teach in at the university of wisconsin for example six thousand students signed a petition supporting president johnson.
like other americans college students held differing views about the war.
the draft made the war more than an abstract humanitarian or foreign policy question for millions of american men.
male college students would lose their draft deferments once they graduated giving many personal as well as political and moral reasons to oppose the war.
peace activists organized ceremonies where men burned the notices from their draft boards ordering them to report for induction.
when 1 500 peace activists gathered in new york city in 1965 to watch five men burn their draft cards an onlooker bolted from the crowd with a fire extinguisher and doused the protesters before the cards caught fire.
the activists nonetheless managed to ignite their soggy draft cards while hundreds of new yorkers stood on the other side of police barricades and chanted burn yourselves not your cards a macabre reminder perhaps unintentional of the buddhist suicides in vietnam in 1963.
johnson tried to discredit the peace movement by claiming it was communist run and gave solace to the enemy.
other defenders of the war charged the peace movement with treason.
however some war supporters believed that the general unpopularity of the peace movement helped bolster the resolve of americans in the political center to stay the course.
the presumption that senator robert kennedy brother of the slain president would seek the democratic nomination as a peace candidate had encouraged johnson to abandon a quest for a second term.
on june 4 1968 sirhan sirhan a jordanian immigrant upset with kennedys pro israel stance shot and killed the senator as he walked through the kitchen of a california hotel moments after finishing his victory speech for winning the state primary.
at the chicago nominating convention the democratic party selected vice president hubert humphrey as its presidential candidate a man much like johnson who supported liberal causes at home and the war in vietnam.
instead of uniting liberal and conservative democrats humphreys candidacy fractured the party.
outside the convention hall radical antiwar protesters denounced his nomination and clashed violently with police.
the war is destroying our read the document martin luther king jr conscience and the vietnam war 1967 26 11 stop the war.
its killing us this antiwar poster highlighted the disproportionate numbers of african americans fighting and dying on the frontlines in the late 1960s linking that imbalance to continued racial inequity in american society.
how did the peace movement publicize its cause.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 dueling bumper stickers join the army travel to exotic distant lands meet exciting unusual people and kill them peace through victory in vietnam country as we are destroying vietnam the writer i f stone lamented.
the outcome of the 1968 presidential election suggested that the peace movement had helped the conservative cause.
believing that the protesters rather than the police had gone too far in chicago many working and middle class americans responded positively to republican candidate richard nixons call for a return to law and order during the campaign nixon suggested that he had a secret plan to bring about a peace with honor that he could not reveal to the enemy.
the election became a three man race when alabama governor george wallace ran as an independent candidate attracting conservative southern whites and white northern blue collar workers with his attacks on integration elites in washington d c and antiwar protesters.
if any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car wallace proclaimed itll be the last car hell ever lay down in front of as election day neared humphrey picked up liberal support by pledging to end bombing over north vietnam immediately.
despite losing conservatives votes to wallace nixon won the electoral college vote handily but only received 44 percent of the popular vote 26 12.
opposition to the war never resulted in widespread support for the peace movement.
most americans remained staunchly anti communist even as their dissatisfaction with the war in vietnam grew.
gallup polls in 1969 revealed that by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent americans labeled themselves as doves not hawks and most described the war as indefen4 sible.
three fifths however also believed that the peace movement 8 4 helped the enemy and made it more difficult for the president to end the 10 3 war.
americans it seemed wanted an end to the fighting overseas and at home.

johnson had calmed the american public in march 1968 by announcing he would open negotiations with the north vietnamese.
keeping his promise he began fruitless negotiations with hanoi.
johnson continued trying however to win the war before he left office.
believing that a final push against a weakened enemy could finish the job american soldiers renewed their attacks on the vietcong.
the largest search and destroy missions of the war occurred in march watch the video protests against the vietnam war controversy on the home front and april involving more than 100 000 troops.
during one of these in the village of my lai american soldiers massacred hundreds of civilians an atrocity that fueled the strident domestic debate over the american mission in vietnam.
on march 16 1968 75 american soldiers in two platoons under the command of lieutenant william calley entered my lai.
before the mission these troops had spent long days wading through the rice paddies and even longer nights battling snipers and insects looking for vietcong who had killed a popular sergeant the week before.
by the time the men approached my lai they were in an ugly mood.
by attacking during the morning hours the companys officers anticipated that their troops would confront 250 enemy troops and few civilians whom the americans expected would follow the usual daily ritual of leaving the village to visit a local market.
none of these predictions came to pass.
in the village the men found only unarmed women children and the elderly.
the vietcong had retreated into the western mountains before the americans arrived.
rather than leaving however the americans engaged in an orgy of rape torture and slaughter that took four hours to complete and left more than 500 villagers dead.
army photographer ron haeberle snapped this image 26 13 of terrified women and children huddled together moments before american soldiers killed them.
guys were about to shoot these people i yelled hold it and i shot my pictures.
as i walked away i heard m 16s open up and from the corner of my eye i saw bodies falling but i did not turn to look haeberle recalled.
seeing the carnage from the air pilot hugh thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and 11 survivors whom he flew to safety.
thompson reported the atrocity to his superiors to no avail.
only the perseverance of ron ridenhour a sergeant who was not even at my lai finally brought the massacre to light.
after hearing stories from men who took part an outraged ridenhour wrote to president nixon the pentagon and members of congress.
when the story broke in 1969 haeberle sold his photos to life.
a military investigation headed by lieutenant general william peers resulted in calleys court martial for premeditated murder.
calleys conviction in 1971 exposed americans conflicting views over the meaning of my lai.
was the atrocity a unique episode or representative of american conduct in vietnam.
competing visions who was responsible for the my lai massacre.
page 800 explores this question in more detail.
watch the video video lecture atrocity and cover up my lai massacre responding to the public outcry over calleys conviction secretary of the army howard bo callaway reduced calleys life sentence to ten years and president nixon pardoned calley after he had served only five months in prison.
by this time calley had been transformed from villain to hero in the american imagination.
people on both the left and the right of the political spectrum defended calley.
the left saw him as a scapegoat for failed american policies while the right argued that civilians were fair targets in a guerilla war.
26 13 my lai villagers moments before their execution 1968 americans expressed more outrage over the publication of photographs from my lai than over the actual killings.
why did photos of the my lai massacre provoke conflicting responses from americans.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 competing visions who was responsible for the my lai massacre.
americans disagreed over who bore responsibility for the massacre at my lai.
some commentators focused on those directly involved in the killings others on the orders given by higher ranking officials to destroy the village.
as you read the following excerpts try to reconstruct the domestic dispute over my lai.
is one argument stronger than the other.
who was to blame calley the two platoons the commanding officers or the american people.
fellow soldier dennis conti told army investigators that he saw calley and private paul meadlo kill civilians in my lai.
the national review rejected suggestions that the nation bore the blame and should abandon the war in vietnam.
they were bringing people out of their huts and then we pushed them out into the rice paddy onto the dike there lieutenant calley came back and said take care of them so we said okay and we sat there and watched them like we usually do.
and he came back again and he said i thought i told you to take care of them i said were taking care of them and he said i mean kill them so i looked at meadlo and he looked at me and i didnt want to do it and he didnt want to do it then calley said come on well line them up here well kill them so i told him ill watch the tree line then they opened up and started firing.
meadlo fired a while.
i dont know how much he fired a clip i think.
it might have been more.
he started to cry and he gave me his weapon.
that america and americans must stand in the larger dock of guilt and human conscience for what happened at my lai seems inescapable so observed time magazine adding men in american uniforms slaughtered the civilians of my lai and in so doing humiliated the u s and called in question the u s mission in vietnam in a way that all the antiwar protesters could never have done ones mind staggers are america and americans generally guilty the same america and americans now preparing to bring the accused to trial.
and even if it turns out that atrocities were committed how does this call in question the u s mission in vietnam.
do the innumerable atrocities committed by both sides in world war ii add up to the proposition that resistance to the nazis ought to have been abandoned.
irrational and irresponsible comment on my lai has become collective madness.
this new york times editorial suggested that higherranking officials than calley bore some responsibility for ordering and observing the my lai massacre.
who gave the orders.
who knew what was going on.

who is responsible.
paul meadlo was one of 18 witnesses to describe a briefing the night before the assault at which captain ernest l medina told the men they were going into battle with a hardened vietcong battalion that their mission was search and destroy and they were to destroy everything in the hamlet houses crops and people helicopter pilots radio men and artillery observers said the higher officers had flown over the scene for several hours and had seen bodies on the ground had conference with the other officers and as one pilot said knew what was going on all through the day the geneva conventions the nuremburg doctrines and the armys own rules of land warfare make plain that obedience to orders is not a blanket defense that orders that to a prudent or reasonable man seem patently illegal need not be obeyed.
the question here then is whether the order if that is what it was to kill everything was one that a prudent man should obey when he found that everything included women children and infants.

the long road to peace the long road to peace when richard nixon entered the white house in 1969 he told his advisors im going to stop that war.
fast nixon was also intent however on preserving americas international reputation.
he had a different vision from his predecessor he assured the public pledging to seek peace with honor nixons promises proved empty however.
the war did not end quickly but continued for four more years.
at home nixon benefited politically by portraying the peace movement as out of step with the values of law abiding citizens.
when he extended the war into laos and cambodia and became embroiled in political scandal his actions fueled the political debate over whether americans could trust their government.
seeking peace with honor for nixon a peace with honor meant winning the war.
he and his national security advisor henry kissinger pursued four different tactics to achieve this goal.
first nixon implemented vietnamization which turned the bulk of the ground fighting over to the south vietnamese army.
by 1971 the american presence in vietnam had diminished dramatically.
in many respects this was a return to the pre 1965 approach when america propped up an independent south vietnam with financial and military aid.
announcing vietnamization in november 1969 nixon asked for support from the great silent majority of americans referring to the many americans who supported the war quietly in the privacy of their homes.
he also rebuked the peace movement.
let us be united for peace.
let us also be united against defeat.
because let us understand north vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the united states.
only americans can do that polls indicated that the silent majority overwhelmingly supported his plan.
vietnamization promised to give america exactly what it wanted victory with minimal loss of american lives.
the united states quickly transformed the south vietnamese army into one of the largest and best equipped military forces in the world.
at the ongoing peace talks a north vietnamese negotiator wondered aloud how the united states when it could not win with its own troops thought it could succeed when you let your puppet troops do the fighting that dilemma kissinger admitted also torments me in implementing vietnamization nixon hoped to disarm the peace movement by replacing images of civilian suffering on the evening news with pictures of troops withdrawing and returning home.
in march 1970 he announced the incremental withdrawal of another 150 000 soldiers to drop a bombshell on the gathering spring storm of antiwar protest he simultaneously reformed the draft replacing the controversial deferment system with a lottery that randomly drafted men by date of birth.
nixon hoped these changes would buy his administration enough time to win the war.
the controversial actions of peace activists inadvertently helped nixon solidify the support of middle america.
in 1972 the actress jane fonda accepted an invitation from the north vietnamese government to visit hanoi.
while in the enemy capital she made radio broadcasts urging american pilots to mutiny.
a photo of fonda joking with north vietnamese soldiers as she sat on an antiaircraft gun used to shoot down american planes created a backlash against the peace movement that nixon exploited.
vietnamization was more than a reaction to declining popular support for fighting in vietnam.
it was also part of nixons attempt to reshape the role that the united states played in global geopolitics.
nixon and kissinger viewed the longstanding vision of a bipolar world that pitted the united states against the soviet union as obsolete.
they embraced a competing strategic vision of multipolarity that focused on negotiating with europe china japan and the soviet union to construct a new balance of power system to keep the peace.
in this foreign policy reformulation the united states would refrain from direct involvement in regional conflicts such as vietnam.
the nixon doctrine formulated in 1969 and 1970 announced that the united states expected its friends to take the lead in defending themselves.
nixons second tactic linked vietnamization to the resumption of massive bombing in north read the document richard nixon vietnamization 1969 why did nixon implement vietnamization.
chapter 26 a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 vietnam which johnson had halted when he initiated peace talks in 1968.
as american troops left vietnam between 1969 and 1972 the number of bombs dropped increased spectacularly see this shift in envisioning evidence vietnam the war by the numbers.
america had not used enough military force to achieve victory the president and kissinger concluded.
they intended to correct this problem.
for a while the news of troop withdrawals diverted attention from the intensified bombing of north vietnam.
alongside vietnamization and renewed bombing of north vietnam nixon and kissingers third tactic used diplomacy to decrease soviet and chinese support for north vietnam.
exploiting the discord between china and the soviet union nixon pursued independent negotiations with each nation to strengthen their ties to the united states and deepen their distrust of each other.
he reshaped the cold war by pursuing his vision of multi polarity through dtente using diplomatic economic and cultural contacts to improve u s relations with china and the soviet union.
fearing that the united states might form an alliance with the other the soviet union and china each eagerly accepted these overtures.
in return for a more congenial relationship with the united states nixon expected china and the soviet union to end their support of north vietnam.
although both countries continued to send aid to north vietnam once they decided to normalize trade relations and enter into arms limitations agreements with the united states the soviet union and china began pressuring hanoi to seek a negotiated peace.
cambodia invasion and outrage the fourth tactical component of nixons vietnam policy involved the neutral country of cambodia which bordered vietnam to the west.
in 1969 nixon initiated a secret bombing campaign of cambodia.
he hoped to cut off supplies filtering through the ho chi minh trail and thus pressure north vietnam into accepting the american terms for peace that included an independent south vietnam.
in april 1970 nixon shattered the public consensus he had carefully created for vietnamization by ordering an american ground force invasion of cambodia.
before the invasion nixon sought inspiration from repeated showings of the movie how did nixon try to win the war.
patton in the white house a film that portrayed the hard nosed and belligerent world war ii tank commander general george s patton leading american forces to victory.
nixon announced in a televised speech that american troops needed to destroy communist bases in cambodia to help the south vietnamese army defeat the vietcong.
but the two month long incursion only pushed the north vietnamese further into the interior of cambodia where they began supporting the khmer rouge communist rebels who seized power in cambodia in 1975 and unleashed a wave of mass murder so brutal that the country became known as the killing fields nixons claim that he was expanding the war to end it sooner persuaded few.
protest erupted on college campuses nationwide and in congress where the senate symbolically terminated the gulf of tonkin resolution.
many university demonstrations turned violent as protesters clashed with police and set fire to college buildings.
a defiant nixon stood his ground assuming that the silent majority agreed with his assessment that the protesters were just bums blowing up the campuses in kent ohio student organized demonstrations protesting the invasion of cambodia took a nasty turn recalled phil caputo who had left the marines after two tours in vietnam and was now a reporter for the chicago tribune.
in a may weekend rampage store windows had been smashed in town and radicals had burned down the rotc building according to caputo.
calling the protesters the worst sort of people we harbor in america governor james allen rhodes promised to use every weapon possible to eradicate the problem as he sent national guardsmen to restore order.
on monday morning a few hundred students gathered on the campus of kent state university for a rally defying a ban on protests.
national guardsmen fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators who responded by throwing rocks and shouting obscenities at the troops.
suddenly as bystanders and students on their way to class watched the mini battle unfurl the troops sprayed bullets into the crowd killing four and wounding nine.
the national guardsmen claimed that they had fired in self defense when protesters began throwing concrete slabs.
two of the victims were passers by however and all four were too far away from the troops to have hit them with anything more than pebbles.
view the image kent state demonstrations the long road to peace envisioning evidence vietnam the war by the numbers americans opinions about the vietnam war varied over the course of the war eventually influencing the strategy pursued there.
even as the war became more unpopular however at least 40 percent of the nation continued to believe that the nation had done the right thing by sending troops to fight in vietnam.
the united states also tried to use its air superiority to win the war dropping more bombs in the vietnam war than in world war ii.
in 1968 the u s troop commitment reached its highest level and bombing of north vietnam remained intense but after the tet offensive for the first time the majority of americans 54 felt that it had been a mistake to send troops to vietnam.

this photo along with the others inside the magazine inspired musician neil young to write the song ohio to protest the shootings the war and the nixon administration.
tin soldiers and nixon coming were finally on our own.
this summer i hear the drumming four dead in ohio lyrics from neil youngs song ohio written in response to the kent state shootings a nation driven to use the weapons of war upon its youth is a nation on the edge of chaos concluded the presidential commission that investigated the kent state incident.
the kent state shootings unmasked the growing town and gown divide over the war and latent anger at the peace movement.
they should have shot more of them suggested one kent resident still angry over the weekend riot.
radio stations refused to play youngs anti nixon song.
while protests over the shooting engulfed more than half the nations college campuses workingclass unions staged counter protests to support the war.
in new york city hundreds of longshoremen wearing hard hats attacked students who were protesting the cambodian invasion.
during a subsequent meeting at the white house sympathetic labor leaders presented the president with a commander in chief hard hat.
the wave of protests after the kent state shootings nonetheless bothered nixon.
at the end of a sleepless night on may 9 1970 he made an impulsive decision to have his valet drive him without his secret service detail to the lincoln memorial at five oclock in the morning so he could talk to the antiwar demonstrators camped out there.
according to the protesters nixon talked disjointedly about college sports and surfing and assured them that he shared their wish for peace in vietnam.
despite his clumsy attempt to talk directly with peace activists nixon remained determined to see the war through to victory.
clinging to the belief that success would vindicate his methods nixon expanded the theater of war again in february 1971 by ordering an invasion of laos.
this time south vietnamese troops fought on the ground with american air support.
once again however the hopes of permanently disrupting the ho chi minh trail bore meager results.
administration officials claimed that the laos invasion illustrated the success of vietnamization.
skeptics pointed to the sight of south vietnamese soldiers clinging in panic to the skids of departing helicopters during their chaotic retreat back into south vietnam.
in 1971 antiwar demonstrators staged 62 demonstrations in washington d c bringing 26 14 kent state university 1970 the images of students wounded and killed at kent state university by national guardsmen prompted fears that a war undertaken to protect american democracy was instead destroying it.
what competing visions emerged in response to the kent state killings.
watch the video video lecture protest counterculture and the antiwar movement during the vietnam era the long road to peace over 100 000 demonstrators to the nations capital 26 15.
that summer the new york times published the pentagon papers a secret department of defense study that criticized the way kennedy and johnson had handled the war stoking the flames of antiwar sentiment in the wake of the calley conviction the failed cambodian and laos invasions and the kent state killings.
the pentagon papers leaked by pentagon official daniel ellsberg confirmed that presidents kennedy and johnson had intentionally lied to the public about the extent of previous american involvement in the war.
many americans assumed that nixon was also misleading the country.
by now only 34 percent of americans approved of his handling of the war.
controversy over the war also seeped into the military.
morale plummeted as soldiers became unwilling to risk their lives for a cause that the nation seemed poised to abandon.
in 1970 the military reported nearly 200 incidents of fragging which were deadly fraternal attacks by enlisted men on officers named for the hand grenade fragments that did most of the damage.
escalating use of marijuana opium and heroin all readily available in vietnam among servicemen was another sign of disintegrating discipline.
how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake vietnam veteran and antiwar activist john kerry withdrawal nixon envisioned dtente creating a new world order in which the united states used trade agreements and arms limitation treaties to curtail the expansionist ambitions of its enemies.
his administration made significant headway with this approach in 1972 beginning with a highly publicized trip to china in february and culminating with a may summit meeting in moscow.
the carefully orchestrated pictures of the staunch anti communist nixon toasting chinas communist leader mao during an official banquet and lauding the achievements of chinese civilization during a trek to the great wall signaled an important turning point in number of total number of annual demonstrations total annual numbers of demonstrators 100 000 or more 10 000 to 99 999 1 000 9 999 sino american relations.
improved relations with china also demolished one of the main arguments used to justify the war in vietnam.
american leaders had always linked the war to the larger american goal of containing communism in southeast asia.
they considered the region rather than vietnam itself vital to american strategic interests overseas.
nixon now demonstrated that diplomacy could perhaps contain communism in southeast asia more effectively than war.
why then many americans wondered was the nation still fighting in vietnam.
the improving relations between its communist benefactors and the united states alarmed north vietnam.
when the north vietnamese grumbled about mao shaking hands with nixon mao advised them to sign a peace treaty regroup while the americans withdrew and then resume the war.
north vietnam eventually followed maos advice.
they first tried however to replicate the political success of the tet offensive by launching a major invasion of the south.
the north vietnamese timed the so called easter offensive of march 1972 to coincide with the start of the american presidential campaign.
in response nixon ordered a massive retaliation against north vietnam that included bombing a blockade and mining a key harbor.
unlike tet the easter offensive did not greatly alter the political equation in the united states or worldwide.
at home nixons approval ratings rose for defending south vietnam from attack.
moving from his successful meeting in china to moscow the u s soviet summit proceeded as planned.
when nixon returned with the first disarmament agreement ever signed by the soviet union he bolstered his image as a tough negotiator who got results.
the strategic arms limitation treaty salt i limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles 26 15 antiwar demonstrations in washington d c 1965 1975.
the overall number of demonstrations and marchers protesting the war peaked in 1969 and 1971.
how did nixon reshape the cold war.
chapter 26 26 16 the final evacuation fleeing vietnamese scramble for a spot aboard an american helicopter as the north vietnamese army approaches saigon in 1975 a final portrait of the failed american mission in vietnam.
a nation divided the vietnam war 1945 1975 and submarine launched missiles each side could stockpile and the number of antimissile launching pads.
once again however nixons diplomatic success undercut his argument that the united states needed an anti communist south vietnam to win the cold war.
by summer 1972 both the united states and north vietnam concluded that the costs of continued fighting had become too great.
recognizing that democratic presidential candidate senator george mcgovern of south dakota a peace advocate who promised to withdraw u s troops from vietnam was trailing in the polls the north vietnamese decided to seek the best terms possible from nixon.
although nixon had discredited mcgovern by suggesting that he would abandon american pows in vietnam the president was also eager to negotiate.
with his reelection assured nixon wanted to fulfill his campaign promise to end the war so he could pursue his larger goal of refashioning cold war relations among the worlds superpowers.
despite this renewed willingness on both sides to negotiate it still took months to seal the deal.
the final 1973 peace treaty called for american withdrawal allowed north vietnamese troops to remain in south vietnam and left the existing south vietnamese government in place.
how did the vietnam war finally end for the united states and the vietnamese.
all left the paris negotiating table knowing that the cease fire existed only on paper.
the war would go on only now without american advisors soldiers or pilots.
despite the spiral downward in vietnam nixon retained a durable base of domestic support due to the success of dtente with china and the soviet union and his effective portrayal of the antiwar movement as out of step with mainstream america.
this political base however eroded quickly when he became embroiled in a major political scandal.
the watergate scandal 1972 a botched republican engineered break in of the democratic national committee headquarters in washington d c forced nixon to resign in 1974.
on june 17 1972 members of nixons campaign staff had broken into the watergate building office to fix broken wiretaps listening devices on telephones that they had installed during a previous burglary in may.
congressional challenges to his vietnam policies and investigations into potential criminal activity by nixon and members of his administration see chapter 28 weakened nixon politically as he began his second term.
the long road to peace in the midst of the watergate crisis congress passed the war powers resolution to curtail presidential war making powers.
the 1973 law required congressional approval for any deployment of american troops overseas that lasted for more than 60 days.
critics pressed for even greater restrictions arguing that the constitutional authority to declare war lay solely with congress whether a war lasted 60 days or 60 years.
nixon countered that the law interfered with the presidents constitutional role as commander in chief of the armed forces.
ignoring congresss desire to end american involvement in vietnam he tried to continue funneling money and arms to south vietnam.
in response congress sharply reduced funding for south vietnam in 1974.
when nixon resigned the presidency on august 9 1974 to avoid impeachment vicepresident gerald ford assumed office.
nixon had appointed ford as his vice president in 1973 when spiro agnew resigned following an unrelated corruption scandal.
the political controversy at home and americans widespread distrust of executive power in the wake of the failed war in vietnam and the watergate scandal weakened president fords ability to respond to the imminent collapse of south vietnam.
in march 1975 north vietnam renewed its offensive.
with no american help in the offing south vietnam collapsed.
within eight weeks north vietnamese troops neared saigon.
they walked along highways littered with boots and uniforms discarded by deserting south vietnamese soldiers who hoped total serving in the american military worldwide total serving in vietnam total killed in vietnam total wounded total draft evaders vietnamese casualties north and south total cost of war 8 7 million men 250 00 women 3 4 million men 6 421 women 47 415 battle deaths 10 785 other causes 153 303 600 000 tens of thousands fled to canada 2 million 173 billion to blend into the civilian population and avoid execution.
ho chi minh did not live to see the end of the war he died in 1969 but the communists renamed saigon ho chi minh city in his honor.
victory in the 30 year conflict did not end civilian suffering in vietnam however.
famine and prison camps caused thousands to flee in overcrowded boats to refugee camps in thailand and malaysia where they faced an uncertain future waiting for permanent asylum in the united states or europe.
for america the war concluded with the image of south vietnamese citizens climbing a ladder on the roof of the american embassy in saigon to board one of the american helicopters that flew american citizens and 150 000 south vietnamese to safety in the final days of the war 26 16.
the frantic evacuation was a disheartening end to americas longest war to date one that claimed the lives of 47 415 combatants and cost the nation 173 billion 26 17.
how to remember such a divisive and controversial war continued to provoke debate within the united states.
the 1982 vietnam veterans memorial in washington d c listed all the names of american war dead on two black marble slabs that descended into the ground.
hidden in a hole as if in shame complained one veteran.
it is exactly the right memorial for that war countered another.
festering rumors that vietnam was still holding american soldiers hostage deepened public bitterness against the nations former foe.
the united states finally normalized diplomatic relations with vietnam in 1995 20 years after the fall of saigon.
it was time one veteran wrote to recognize the truth.
the war is over 26 17 the human and financial cost of the vietnam war 1964 1973.

in this photo kings 13 year old daughter yolanda sits inside a car peering at mourners reflected in the car window while her mother coretta scott king sits solemnly behind her as they leave kings funeral in atlanta georgia.
this somber photograph as much as the images of rioters captured the crushing disappointment of dashed dreams.
it was a sentiment shared by many americans in the 1960s white and black who failed to fully realize their goals of either reforming america or ending the cultural turmoil.
america was rife with discord during the 1960s.
much debate centered on liberalism and its willingness to use the government to protect civil rights and expand economic opportunity.
throughout the decade social reformers working within the liberal tradition advanced competing visions of social justice and shared prosperity.
some visions were bold some truly radical.
king dreamed of using nonviolence to achieve racial equality more militant activists advocated armed self defense.
building on the reform legacies of the progressive era and the new deal democratic presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson launched their own wars against poverty.
their legislative agendas were too timid for young radical activists who wanted to revolutionize american capitalism.
feminists chicano activists and native american protesters also mobilized to demand equal rights.
these visions of reform especially the more radical revolutionary ones appeared like nightmares to conservative segments of the population that abhorred liberalism.
southern segregationists organized to prevent government mandated dismantling of jim crow and white northerners increasingly resented taxpayer supported programs for unruly minorities.
the rise of a hippie counterculture that emphasized love and pleasure convinced many working and middle class whites that liberalism meant the end of law and order and traditional values.
if there was one point of agreement throughout the 1960s it was that the political and cultural battles that defined the decade for good or ill transformed the nation.
by 1970 frustration over unfulfilled dreams left americans divided over whether the nation had changed too much or not enough.
we know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed martin luther king jr 1963 chapter 27 a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s the liberal moment the 1960s was the heyday of american liberalism thanks in part to presidential reform agendas and to pivotal supreme court rulings.
presidents kennedy and johnson viewed themselves as heirs to the new deal legacy and they intended to follow in harry trumans footsteps who as president had desegregated the american military and secured federal funds for urban public housing education and public works projects.
kennedy and johnson each believed in the power of the federal government to reform american society but each faced intense resistance from conservatives who were certain that the less the government interfered in the economy or society the better.
kennedy and the new frontier nearly 20 percent of americans 70 percent of them white lived in dire poverty during the most prosperous moment in american history.
many middle and upper class americans learned this startling statistic by reading michael harringtons the other america poverty in the united states 1962.
harrington documented the deteriorating schools substandard hospitals and dead end jobs that created a cycle of poverty that continued unabated for generations.
just like jacob riiss nineteenthcentury expos how the other half lives see chapter 17 harrington made the lives of the nations poor visible to the rest of the nation.
harrington claimed that a culture of poverty filled with extramarital sex illegitimate children and broken families created a different kind of people who did not share the values or outlook of middle class america.
like riis 70 years earlier harrington succeeded in awakening the social consciousness of affluent liberals including john f kennedy.
while campaigning in west virginia during his 1960 presidential bid kennedy came face to face with appalling poverty as he sat and talked with coal miners pictured here 27 1 about their lives.
this moment of intimate conversation one of his speechwriters noted was kennedy at his best as he gathered details about children who never drank 27 1 presidential candidate john f kennedy speaking with coal miners 1960 kennedys personal touch and charisma helped him connect with voters who educated him about the entrenched poverty endemic to many rural and industrial communities.
what social problems associated with poverty became visible in the early 1960s.
view the image new frontier legislation the liberal moment milk and their fathers dangerous work underground.
i was better off in the war than they are in the coal mines kennedy a world war ii veteran told his campaign staff after this photo was taken.
its not right let us begin anew john f kennedy told the nation in his 1961 inaugural address setting a tone ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country kennedys inaugural address 1961 of hope that inspired young people and liberals throughout the nation.
after eight years with the moderate republican dwight eisenhower in the white house kennedy wanted to reinvigorate the liberal agenda through a legislative program called the new frontier.
kennedys proposed reforms included raising the minimum wage reducing overcrowding in schools and providing health care for the elderly.
kennedy advocated cutting taxes and increasing government spending to stimulate the economy reasoning that as incomes rose more tax revenue would flow into federal coffers to pay for these programs.
kennedy also needed large sums for the ongoing space race with the soviet union begun when the soviets launched sputnik in 1957 see chapter 24.
the soviets sent the first astronauts into space in 1961 prompting kennedy to announce that the united states intended to recover its reputation as the worlds technological leader by putting a man on the moon.
the youngest elected president in american history kennedys charisma and idealism inspired many baby boomers who were just reaching adolescence or entering college.
thousands rushed to join the peace corps an agency established by kennedy that sent recent college graduates to work on humanitarian projects in developing nations.

warren believed that the constitution gave the government the power and the responsibility to protect the relatively powerless against oppression by the majority.
by rendering opinions on a wide range of social justice issues the warren court brought about a legal revolution in the united states that permanently altered american schools politics the criminal justice system and cultural norms.

in 1962 parents in new york state challenged the constitutionality of the short nondenominational prayer that the state board of regents had adopted in 1951 for use in the public schools.
the question was whether government directed prayer violated the first amendment clause that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof the fourteenth amendment made this clause applicable to state law.
choices the prayer was constitutional because students were not required to recite it.
an official prayer regardless of its content violated the first amendment.
school prayer simply recognized the importance of religion in american society without establishing an official religion.
decision in engel v vitale 1962 the supreme court ruled 6 to 1 that state directed school prayer was unconstitutional.
justice hugo black wrote the majority opinion stating that the first amendment prohibited official prayers for any group of american people to recite as part of a religious program carried on by government consequences the warren court received more mail opposing this case than any other.
in 1963 the court also banned reciting the lords prayer and bible reading in public school ruling that to remain neutral the government could not support the tenets of one or all religions outrage over school prayer rulings helped forge a new political coalition between southern fundamentalist protestants and northern catholics whose grassroots activism against liberalism contributed to the conservative rights resurgence in the late 1960s.

johnson aspired to do more than put food in peoples bellies he also wanted to nurture their spirits.
barry goldwater a conservative republican senator from arizona offered a radically different view of what responsibilities the government should assume.
instead of more government goldwater proposed dismantling most of the new deal including social security and opposed federal civil rights laws because he saw them as the first step toward creating a police state my aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them he declared.
goldwater spoke for the radical right staunch conservatives who felt that the governments interference in the economy and society did more harm than good.
his extreme conservative views however alarmed prominent moderate republicans who openly supported johnson.
in the campaign the democrats astutely used goldwaters most extreme pronouncements against him making the liberal johnson look almost moderate in comparison.

in creating the great society johnson wanted to restore americas identity as the land of opportunity for immigrants.
the immigration act of 1965 eliminated the quota system established in the 1920s that set stringent caps on immigration from southern and eastern europe and barred all asian immigration see chapter 21.
in the first great wave of immigration since the 1910s unprecedented numbers of koreans chinese filipinos and vietnamese migrated to the united states over the next 30 years.

johnson noted that americans had always been proud of america the beautiful but polluted air disappearing forests and filthy rivers had tarnished this image.
the air in some cities was so bad that motorists had to use their headlights after noon.
the pronouncement that lake erie was dead and the sight of oil slicks on the cuyahoga river in cleveland burning for eight days after a man tossed a lit cigar into the water underscored the environmental deterioration.
these ecological catastrophes helped spawn an exploding grassroots environmental movement that included greenpeace a radical direct action group and a resurgent sierra club a long standing conservation society.
responding to environmental activism and growing middle class concerns congress enacted bipartisan environmental measures that required pollution controls on cars and established national standards for acceptable air and water pollution.
johnson also created federally protected wilderness areas to safeguard endangered domestic species at risk of extinction such as the whooping crane.

these highly visible demonstrations imperiled many civil rights workers and their leaders hoped to win support from white liberals and moderates nationally by showing them the face of southern segregationists resistance.

the freedom rides began when 13 whites and a new generation of americans civil rights leadblacks including farmer and john lewis a veteran ers expected the new president to aggressively seek of the 1960 nashville sit ins boarded an interstate an end to jim crow.

a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s if they were killed.
after a smooth ride through the upper south in atlanta the freedom riders decided to take two separate buses into the heart of the rigidly segregated deep south.
as the first bus carrying freedom riders entered the depot in anniston alabama a mob pelted the bus with stones and slashed its tires.
the driver drove away without stopping pursued by 50 cars carrying vigilantes.
when a flat tire obliged him to stop along a deserted country road a firebomb forced the freedom riders off the bus and into the waiting gauntlet of sticks and crowbars.
state troopers arrived in time to save the lives of the traumatized freedom riders two of whom sit stunned on the ground in this photo 27 6 of the bus burning.
meanwhile the second bus arrived in birmingham where ku klux klansmen beat white freedom rider james peck a 47 year old labor and peace activist when he entered a white only waiting room with a black colleague.
when you go somewhere looking for trouble you usually find it the governor of alabama remarked unsympathetically.
a photo of klan members beating peck accompanied the front page story in the new york times that informed president kennedy about the organized attacks on the freedom riders.
still dealing with the fallout from the bay of pigs invasion that had ended in disaster four weeks earlier and preparing for a summit with soviet leader nikita khrushchev see chapter 25 kennedy urged the freedom riders to call off the rest of their scheduled journey.
instead members of the student who made key choices that affected the course and outcome of the freedom rides.
non violent coordinating committee sncc the student run civil rights group founded in 1960 during the sit ins see chapter 25 rushed to birmingham to ride alongside john lewis a founding member of sncc taking the place of riders unable or unwilling to continue.
we cant let them stop us with violence.
if we do the movement is dead sncc leader diane nash upon resuming the freedom rides 1961 avoiding a violent confrontation became the administrations priority.
attorney general robert kennedy the presidents brother secured a promise from the governor of alabama that state troops would protect the riders.
when the state reneged on this promise and another savage attack occurred at the montgomery alabama bus depot robert kennedy sent 600 federal marshals to protect the riders as they traveled to the mississippi border.
rather than allowing vigilantes to attack the riders mississippi authorities took a different tack.
as the riders filed off the bus in jackson police escorted them into waiting patrol cars.
most of the riders spent four months in jail for violating segregation laws.
the freedom rides continued through the summer of 1961 and eventually 300 white and black protesters took part.
in the fall the interstate commerce commission required the integration of all interstate travel facilities.
the freedom rides however did not achieve the organizers broader goals of securing president kennedys enthusiastic support for the civil rights movement.
despite his own integrationist views president kennedy remained preoccupied with protecting his white democratic southern base and feared that open discussion of americas racial problems provided fodder for soviet propaganda.
it would take a shocking visual demonstration of racial violence in birmingham alabama to make him a champion of civil rights.
nonviolence triumphant the civil rights movement 1960 1965 birmingham 1963 in 1963 the southern christian leadership conference sclc martin luther king jr s church based civil rights organization unfurled a carefully coordinated campaign to desegregate birmingham alabama perhaps the most segregated city in the nation.
we were trying to launch a systematic wholehearted battle against segregation that would set the pace for the nation explained the birmingham sclc leader fred shuttlesworth.
volatile police chief bull connor made the city an especially dangerous place to launch such a protest.
sclc accurately predicted that they would gain the attention of the president once the world saw connors police attacking nonviolent demonstrators with highpower water hoses and dogs.
television was vital to this campaign the images of violence pouring into living rooms would make it impossible for moderate white americans to ignore the nations racial problems.
in april 1963 king and the sclc initiated their birmingham campaign with economic boycotts and sit ins.
press coverage increased when king and shuttlesworth led a march in defiance of a state injunction that prohibited public demonstrations.
police immediately arrested and jailed the pair.
king timed his arrest to occur on good friday the day that jesus died on the cross using religious symbolism to underscore the immorality of racial persecution.
as king sat in solitary confinement the birmingham news published an open letter to him from white liberal southern clergymen who criticized the demonstrations as unwise and untimely for trying to provoke hardcore segregationists.
the opinion of liberal and moderate southern whites mattered to king.
the nonviolent strategy depended on swaying those who may have traditionally supported segregation but were not die hard racists.
visitors to king smuggled out his response written on the margins of newspapers and scraps of toilet paper during his eight day jail stay.
kings letter from a birmingham jail did not influence events in birmingham by the time it was published the protests had ended but the text was one of his most eloquent statements on the dehumanizing aspects of racial discrimination.
for years now i have heard the word wait it rings in the ear of every negro with piercing familiarity.
this wait has almost always meant never king wrote.
how would whites feel about sleeping in their cars when traveling because no motel will accept you telling their children that they could not go to the segregated amusement parks advertised on television and living constantly on tiptoe stance never quite knowing what to expect next.
these were the reasons king explained why we find it difficult to wait hoping to stop downtown demonstrations that were keeping shoppers away and worried that the federal government might intervene moderate white business owners initiated secret talks with sclc leaders without chief connors knowledge.
to increase pressure on the businessmen sclc went ahead with marches despite lukewarm support from birmingham churches and adults.
to fill the ranks jim bevel another veteran of the nashville sit ins proposed turning birmingham into a childrens crusade by recruiting from the citys high schools and if necessary middle and elementary schools.
a boy from high school has the same effect in terms of being in jail in terms of putting pressure on the city as his father and yet theres no economic threat to the family because the father is still on the job bevel argued.
on may 3 1963 the second day of the protests carolyn mckinstry like many others left her high school without telling her parents that she was joining the demonstrations.
when the teenagers arrived downtown connor was waiting with water hoses and police dogs.
a shocked nation viewed television and newspaper images of firefighters directing torrents of water at mckinstry and her friends and police dogs biting protesters.
see images as history birmingham 1963 page 822.
as the sclc had hoped northerners reacted with outrage to this blatant display of police brutality while southern moderates worried that connors heavy handed tactics would invite more federal scrutiny of southern politics and racial customs.
the civil rights movement scored a major victory in birmingham.
besides winning a commitment to desegregate lunch counters and schools and the promise of jobs the protests renewed president kennedys interest in civil rights.
concerned about losing momentum in the cold war he asked the nation are we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this is the land of the free except for the negroes read the document martin luther king jr letter from birmingham city jail 1963 why did the birmingham campaign succeed.
chapter 27 a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s images as history birmingham 1963 in birmingham civil rights activists developed a strategy that included using television and news photos to their advantage.
the civil rights movement got exactly the images the activists wanted in 1963 when the birmingham police chief bull connor unleashed extreme violence against protesters in the downtown area.
how important the water hoses hurt a lot recalled carolyn mckinstry the high school sophomore girl pictured here.
was the press to the success of the birmingham campaign.
why did the public react so strongly to these photos.
as a white child in rural alabama life photojournalist charles moore had accepted segregation as the way things were birmingham was a turning point in his own evolving social consciousness three teenage protesters clung to a doorway as water whipped their bodies an ordeal that moore immortalized in this iconic photograph of the birmingham protests.
fire hoses birmingham 1963 mckinstry remained proud of what i had done but afterwards questioned the tactics that they sclc were using because i think i felt that you could actually be hurt does knowing more about mckinstry and moore alter this photographs meaning.
moore avoided taking photos that might send a mixed message to the public.
he took no pictures of students only partly schooled in nonviolent techniques who threw pieces of concrete at the police even after a slab hit and injured him.
watch the video video lecture photographing the civil rights movement birmingham 1963 nonviolence triumphant the civil rights movement 1960 1965 my emotional involvement in the story grew as i saw what was happening on the afternoon of may 3 1963 moore arrived in downtown birmingham just as firefighters turned their high pressure hoses and police dogs on teenage demonstrators.
when moores photos appeared in life a magazine read by half of american adults in the 1960s his images movement leaders wanted liberal and moderate americans to blame the police for escalating the violence in birmingham and moores pictures left little room for an alternative explanation.
along with television coverage of the mayhem helped transform birmingham from a local crisis into an event that prompted national soulsearching about democracy in america.
inspired by these images civil rights activists initiated 1 000 demonstrations in nearly 100 cities throughout the south.
the police arrested moore when he refused to stop taking pictures.
it was scary to be a victim of abusive police moore recalled an experience that strengthened his solidarity with the protesters.
the sight of snarling dogs and the possibility of dogs ripping flesh was revolting to me moore recollected.
moore sided with the protesters but the story that accompanied his photos blamed extremists on both sides for the melee.
the pictures are frightening because of the brutal methods being used by white policemen in birmingham ala against negro demonstrators.
they are frightening because the negro strategy of nonviolent direct action invites that very brutality and welcomes it as a way to promote the negroes cause which under the law is right life told readers.

birmingham had given the civil rights cause national and international visibility and everss shocking assassination reinforced kennedys determination to enact a sweeping civil rights bill.
southern democratic senators were equally prepared to filibuster to prevent its passage.
intent on winning this legislative battle king and other civil rights leaders decided to organize the march on washington a massive demonstration in the nations capital that would demand passage of a federal civil rights act.
adopting the slogan jobs and freedom organizers underscored the link between greater economic opportunity and civic equality.
the organizing committee included african american labor leader a philip randolph founder of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters.

i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character declared king in the days most memorable speech.
the march received the national medias full attention.
it was also among the first events that television viewers throughout the world could watch live thanks to a new communications satellite.
from cairo to amsterdam people participated in sympathy marches before american embassies and sent petitions to kennedy.

freedom summer a multipronged attack on white supremacy in mississippi during the summer of 1964 was a turning point in the civil rights movement.
it forced the federal government to deepen its commitment to equal rights laid bare the rising tensions within the civil rights movement and trained a generation of student activists who would soon spearhead new leftist and feminist movements.
in the summer of 1964 the council of federated organizations cofo coordinated the efforts of civil rights groups to launch freedom summer including sncc and core.
with ambivalence sncc recruited many northern whites to work on the voter registration projects.
sncc had reluctantly concluded that the national media which had started to ignore blacks only protests would pay attention to freedom summer only if white students at night people should not sit in their rooms without drawn shades rule from core security handbook meant to protect freedom summer workers from sniper attacks were involved.
sncc core and cofo hoped that the media spotlight would protect freedom summer workers from racial violence protection that the federal government was unwilling to give.
this calculation proved incorrect.
on the first day of freedom summer three core workers went missing in mississippi.
twenty four year old michael schwerner was a white jewish social worker from manhattan who one coworker recalled had been deeply affected by the photographs of negroes sprawling under the dogs and fire hoses in birmingham.
on june 21 1964 schwerner went with james chaney a 21 year old mississippi black activist and 20 year old andrew goodman another white jewish volunteer from new york to inspect a church that the ku klux klan had burned to stop core from opening a school there.
on the return home they passed near philadelphia mississippi where local sheriff and klansman cecile price recognized schwerners car and license plate from a circular the governors office had issued concerning outside agitators price arrested them for speeding and then alerted fellow klansmen to join him for an ambush after he released the three men from jail in the middle of the night.
the trios disappearance created national headlines forcing the fbi to launch a manhunt across five states to find them.
the fbi posted this circular 27 8 seeking information about the mens whereabouts haunting images that conveyed more than the dangers of vigilante violence.
read the document letters from mississippi freedom summer fbi poster of three slain freedom summer civil rights workers 1964 the murder of these three core workers hardened the resolve of many freedom summer volunteers to continue registering blacks to vote but some blacks resented that the nation seemed to care only if white activists disappeared.
what interracial tensions within the civil rights movement did freedom summer expose.
chapter 27 a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s putting her own grief aside schwerners wife rita herself a core field worker publicly voiced her suspicion that if mr chaney who is a native mississippian had been alone at the time of the disappearance.
this case like so many others that have come before it.
would have gone completely unnoticed as if to prove her point sailors sent to comb through mississippi swamps for the bodies of the three men now assumed to be dead discovered the corpses of three lynched black men whose disappearances authorities had ignored.
as the fbi investigation unfolded freedom summer continued.
nearly 1 000 black and white activists fanned out throughout mississippi to register blacks in rural areas.
hoping to recruit and train a new generation of student leaders sncc and cofo founded summer freedom schools.
in these schools freedom summer volunteers taught high school students african american history to build pride in the long legacy of black accomplishment and gave remedial instruction in basic subjects to remedy their deficient public education.
in a state with no mandatory school laws black children often spent more time in the cotton fields than in the classroom.
in the midst of freedom summer congress passed the civil rights act of 1964 which banned segregation in businesses and places open to the public such as restaurants and public schools and prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race religion ethnicity or sex.
this landmark legislation the most sweeping civil rights law since reconstruction came about because thousands of individuals risked arrest murder or unemployment to participate in boycotts sit ins and street demonstrations in towns and cities throughout the south.
their activism went unnoticed in the national press which focused mostly on a few dramatic moments such as the disappearance of schwerner chaney and goodman.
a month after the civil rights acts passage after six weeks of searching the fbi paid 30 000 to an informant who helped officers locate the three mens bodies buried in an earthen dam.
all three had been shot in the head and chaneys shattered bones attested to the savage beating he had received.
no one was ever convicted of the murders although price and nine others were found guilty on federal conspiracy charges in 1967 and served a few years in jail.
like kennedy johnson knew that the world was watching events unfold in mississippi.
passage of the what pivotal role did college age students play in freedom summer.
civil rights act was front page news overseas and world leaders rushed to congratulate johnson.
winning the 1964 nobel peace prize king was now an international figure who inspired social justice activists worldwide.
passage of the 1964 civil rights act was a great victory for the civil rights movement but the combat like conditions during freedom summer took their toll.
fearful sncc volunteers began to arm themselves for self defense.
many blacks resented the media attention given to white activists.
meanwhile female civil rights workers black and white objected to males expectations that they would clean and cook for them.
the stage was set for a fracturing within the activist community.
selma and the voting rights act of 1965 the nonviolent civil rights movement registered one more significant victory before that fracturing occurred using a stand off in selma alabama to secure president johnsons open support for federal legislation guaranteeing blacks the right to vote.
on sunday march 7 1965 a day soon known as bloody sunday about 600 marchers left the small town of selma alabama and began walking across the edmund pettis bridge that spanned the alabama river.
they intended to march 50 miles to montgomery the state capitol to demand voting rights.
at the other end of the bridge county troopers armed with clubs and tear gas waited for them.
when the marchers knelt in prayer at the end of the bridge sheriff jim clark ordered the troopers to attack as white spectators cheered.
photographers and television crews witnessed the violent attack.
that evening abc interrupted the film judgment at nuremburg a dramatized account of trials that convicted nazi leaders of crimes against humanity to show news footage of the bloody sunday assault.
the juxtaposition between the films portrayal of the holocaust and events in selma haunted viewers.
late that evening the door opened to the chapel in selma that served as the marchers headquarters.
we have seen on the television screen the violence that took place today and were here to share it with you announced a group of blacks and whites from new jersey who had chartered a plane to arrive that night.
read the document voting literacy test 1965 nonviolence triumphant the civil rights movement 1960 1965 on monday march 15 1965 president johnson who had spoken privately with king before selma about how to win public support for voting rights legislation announced in a televised address that he was sending a federal voting rights act to congress.
its not just negroes but really its all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice johnson told the nation.
and we shall overcome he concluded quoting the anthem of the civil rights movement.
a triumphant march from selma began the following sunday march 21 1965.
along the way a group of men women whites blacks and veterans stopped to pray in front of a billboard claiming that king was a communist 27 9.
erected by the john birch society the sign showed a photo of king attending a workshop at the highlander folk school for social activists labeling it a communist training school like the i asked my mother and father for my birthday present to become registered voters eight year old sheyann webb youngest member of the first selma to montgomery march.
republicans 1964 presidential candidate barry goldwater the arch conservative birch society opposed federal civil rights legislation as a violation of state and individual rights.
the marchers took advantage of every opportunity to enlist the sympathies of mainstream journalists like haynes johnson the white reporter standing and taking notes who won a pulitzer prize for his coverage of the selma march.
when the marchers arrived in montgomery five days later king addressed the crowd on the steps of the state capitol looking down at the dexter avenue baptist church where he had helped initiate the montgomery bus boycott ten years earlier see chapter 25 i know you are asking today how long will it take how long.
not long because no lie can live forever five months later johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 which prohibited literacy tests and poll taxes and authorized the use of federal registrars to register voters if states failed to respect the fifteenth amendment.
within a year over 9 000 blacks had registered in dallas county alabama enough to block jim clarks reelection as sheriff.
27 9 prayer vigil during the march from selma to montgomery march 21 1965 this image of peaceful protesters praying was meant to counter charges from ultraconservative groups that the civil rights movement was intentionally provoking violence to pave the way for a communist revolution.
view the map interactive map impact of the voting rights act of 1965 how did the media public and government respond to events in selma.
chapter 27 a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s the fractured left conservative republicans and democrats never liked the antipoverty initiatives of kennedy and johnson while die hard segregationists adamantly opposed the integrationist goals of nonviolent civil rights leaders like king.
the most potent attacks on these progressive visions however came from the left where competing visions proliferated.
by the mid 1960s disaffected student activists increasingly dismissed the great society as too cautious and protested against johnsons war in vietnam while others renounced all ties to mainstream culture.
within the civil rights movement militancy replaced nonviolence as the dominant ethos.
meanwhile many white women left the civil rights movement to pursue womens liberation.
the new left and the counterculture the baby boom generation came of age in the 1960s.
by 1968 over half of the american population was under the age of 25.
by then a core of white middleclass college students had created the new left a small but highly visible coalition of student based organizations that attacked racial discrimination poverty and the war in vietnam.
al haber formed students for a democratic society sds in 1960 at the university of michigan believing that if any really radical liberal force is going to develop in america it is going to come from the colleges and the young in 1962 tom hayden a white activist in the civil rights movement penned the groups manifesto the port huron statement hayden urged his peers to act noting we are people of this generation bred in at least modest comfort housed now in universities looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit although most college age americans did not attend university their ranks were increasing.
by 1965 nearly 6 5 million students attended colleges or universities compared with 2 2 million in 1950.
strict rules governed student behavior.
students lived in single sex dormitories had to obey curfews each evening and abide by dress codes that prohibited female students from wearing pants.
the university of california berkeley even forbade political debate or discussion on campus a rule in place since the 1930s to prevent communist student groups from recruiting.
for years students had used a small strip just outside the berkeley campus main gate to hand out political pamphlets or give speeches.
in the fall of 1964 the university administration shut this down as well provoking the free speech movement a mass student protest that accused the university of california how did the new left affect university life.
of denying students the right to freedom of speech.
protest leader mario savio who had just returned from freedom summer pointed out that the two battlefields in mississippi and berkeley may seem quite different to some observers but this is not the case.
the same rights are at stake in both places the right to participate as citizens in a democratic society aided by sympathetic television coverage the free speech movement succeeded after four months of demonstrations and inspired left leaning students on other university campuses.
most college students never joined any organized protests but in response to those who did universities eliminated codes of conduct introduced more elective courses into curriculums and established black and womens studies.
after 1964 sds chapters organized antiwar demonstrations on university campuses that included teach ins and draft card burnings see chapter 26.
sds at first embraced the liberal vision of using representative government to implement incremental reforms but in the course of its antiwar protests the group became more radical.
by 1968 new left leaders expressed open admiration for marxist inspired communist revolutionaries like the vietnamese leader ho chi minh and ernesto che guevara a colleague of cuban dictator fidel castro trying to foster revolution in bolivia and the congo.
when student led protests roiled europe and south america in 1968 the american new left assumed they were part of a global youth rebellion that would reshape the world.
once the novelty of student demonstrations wore off getting television reporters to cover their protests required more outlandish theatrics images that increasingly radicalized student leaders eagerly provided.
press scrutiny sometimes backfired however.
nightly news reports of demonstrators hurling bricks and expletives frightened read the document the report of the presidents commission on campus unrest the fractured left moderates who viewed the new left as unpatriotic and dangerous.
the challenge to the liberal vision went beyond the new left.
an emerging counterculture the heir to the beat cultural ethos of the 1950s see chapter 25 emphasized rejecting middle class lifestyles more than agitating for political change.
hippies youthful social rebels who renounced material acquisition and used drugs to explore their inner spiritual selves refused to dedicate their lives to acquiring the same suburban home car and corporate job as their parents.
the hippie utopian vision embraced peace pleasure sexual liberation and sharing of material resources an ethos captured in this 1968 photograph 27 10 of a hippie gathering by robert altman who became a renowned filmmaker.
drugs especially marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide lsd formed an essential part of the countercultures challenge to the values of middleclass society.
rock music exposed many young people to these counterculture ideals.
bob dylan a folk troubadour whose songs had inspired civil rights protesters transformed himself into a rock musician with poetic lyrics steeped in drug references.
the beatles underwent a similar transformation after taking america by storm.
nearly 60 percent of the nation watched the four mop headed british musicians sing their masterful pop concoctions during the bands first televised performance on the ed sullivan show in 1964.
in just three years the group underwent a complete makeover with the release of an album sgt.
peppers lonely hearts club band that broadcasted the counterculture message id love to turn you on a reference to taking drugs and having sex.
the heyday of the marriage between rock music and the counterculture was woodstock a free three day drug infused music festival held on a farm in upstate new york in august 1969.
new left and young civil rights activists adopted a hippie style of dress and experimented with drugs but unlike hippies they remained dedicated to political activism.
most black civil rights activists rather than rejecting white middle class materialism were fighting for their fair share of the nations wealth and prosperity.
new left radicals shared the hippie belief that acquisitive capitalism bred inequality and injustice but they were committed to social action not tuning out out of the spotlight conservative college students were also active laying the foundation for the coming conservative resurgence within a republican party dominated by moderates.
college students formed the young americans for freedom yaf in 1960 under the guidance of national review founder william f buckley.
throughout the 1960s the radical right yaf attracted more members than the new left sds.
goldwater supporters in 1964 these conservative students championed limited economic regulation states rights respect for law and order and staunch anticommunism.
for the time being however the new left had center stage.
27 10 holding together in their quest to define an alternative lifestyle hippies emphasized love and harmony in their gatherings sometimes wearing clothes sometimes not.
how did the new left civil rights movement and counterculture diverge.
chapter 27 a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s malcolm x an alternative to nonviolence 27 11 malcolm x snaps a photo of muhammad ali 1964.
this meeting between two mid1960s icons of black manhood came just after ali won the heavyweight boxing title.
both black muslims malcolm x and muhammad ali enjoyed keeping whites on edge with militant rhetoric that emphasized black pride and physical prowess.
the new left and counterculture did not speak with one voice and by the mid 1960s fractures within the civil rights movement were also apparent.
the nation of islam an african american religious sect founded in the 1930s rejected integration as the path to salvation for the black community and instead wanted to establish a separate black nation within the united states.
followers of nation of islam leader elijah muhammad prayed to mecca five times a day dressed modestly and avoided pork and alcohol.
the nation of islam departed from mainstream islamic practices however by viewing whites as blue eyed devils whom allah would condemn to eternal damnation on a forthcoming day of judgment.
the celebrated african american writer james baldwin understood the appeal of elijah muhammads prophecies even though he rejected them.
the white god has not delivered them perhaps the black god will wrote baldwin in the fire next time 1963 to explain the nation of islams growing popularity within northern urban neighborhoods.
malcolm x moved armed self defense and black separatism from the fringes to the center of the civil rights debate.
a magnetic speaker he had converted to islam while serving a six year stint in prison.
after his release he changed his name from malcolm little to malcolm x the x signifying the lost name of his african ancestors.
why did northern blacks find malcolm xs vision appealing.
i dont see any american dream i see an american nightmare malcolm x ridiculing kings i have a dream speech during the 1963 march on washington even during the heyday of nonviolence in the 1950s and early 1960s more militant voices within the black community championed a competing vision of self defense and racial pride that extended back to marcus garvey see chapter 21.
malcolm x ridiculed the nonviolent strategy of the christianled sclc.
if someone puts his hand on you send him to the cemetery he proclaimed in 1963.
he received an increasingly sympathetic hearing among northern blacks who could already vote and sit alongside whites at lunch counters but encountered racial prejudice that relegated them to segregated ghettos limited their employment opportunities and subjected them to police harassment.
malcolm x linked the domestic black struggle for civil rights to the anti colonial movements underway in africa and asia underscoring that the american civil rights movement was one of many liberation movements being waged worldwide including a campaign to end apartheid rigid racial segregation in south africa.
malcolm xs rhetorical links with africa resonated among northern blacks who adopted african clothing hairstyles and music.
many jettisoned the old label negro in favor of black to reflect their growing color consciousness and racial pride.
this photo 27 11 of malcolm x smiling as he photographs boxer muhammad ali in a miami restaurant after ali won the heavyweight championship in 1964 conveys the charisma that each man radiated and the watch the video malcolm x the fractured left strong bonds they maintained to the black urban community.
ali who called himself the greatest gained fame not just for his athletic feats but like malcolm x also for his defiance of authority.
the day after this photo was taken he announced his conversion to the nation of islam changing his name from cassius clay to muhammad ali.
his mentor malcolm x applauded alis announcement knowing that the magnetic boxer would help attract other converts.
by the time malcolm xs ideas began to gain widespread currency among disaffected blacks however his own philosophies were starting to shift.
viewing the increasingly powerful malcolm x as a potential rival elijah muhammad had silenced malcolm x a few months before this photo was taken.
malcolm xs transgression was calling the assassination of president kennedy a case of the chickens coming home to roost because whites were finally experiencing the vigilante violence that had terrorized blacks for decades.
malcolm x left the nation of islam soon afterward and ali severed all ties with him.
in 1964 malcolm x made a pilgrimage to mecca islams holiest city in saudi arabia where he saw pilgrims of all colors coming together to worship.
this trip gave him new faith in the possibility of interracial cooperation.
his more moderate stance did little to mollify his nation of islam critics.
on february 21 1965 as he stood to address a gathering in harlem three nation of islam members shot him dead.
watts and chicago malcolm x did not live to help heal the fractures that divided the civil rights movement.
in the mid 1960s tensions among activists led to an overt split between those who continued to advocate non violence and integration and those who assumed a more militant nationalistic approach.
stalwart civil rights veterans like john lewis and martin luther king jr never stopped advocating their vision of nonviolent collective action.
but after 1965 the vision of armed self defense won many adherents.
when riots and demonstrations in northern cities moved the civil rights struggle to their own backyards the limits of northern whites support for the goal of racial equality became evident.
august 6 1965 the day that president johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 represented the high water mark of the nonviolent civil rights movement.
five days later with activists still basking in the afterglow of this achievement riots erupted in watts a los angeles black ghetto rife with high unemployment poor schools and drug use.
the routine arrest of a black man for drunk driving which residents viewed as yet another example of the police harassment that plagued them daily sparked the uprising.
watts burned for six days before 16 000 national guardsmen managed to stop the violence.
the watts riot left 34 dead and destroyed 35 million in property including many businesses and homes owned by blacks.
watts changed the image of african american protest in the white imagination from a portrait of nonviolent demonstrators kneeling in prayer before their attackers to one of lawless mobs shouting burn baby burn the same cameras that helped awaken the liberal and moderate white consciousness now stoked white fears about unchecked black violence.
the press ignored residents complaints about police harassment and instead portrayed los angeles police and firemen 27 12 as heroes who struggled to prevent black rioters from destroying their own community.
watts was the prelude to four long hot summers of racial rioting that rocked cities throughout the nation from 1965 1968.
27 12 watts riots 1965.
images of heroic policemen arresting looters and firemen putting out fires set by rebellious blacks reassured anxious whites that authorities were restoring law and order.
only two years earlier photographs of police and firemen attacking peaceful black demonstrators in birmingham had encouraged whites to support integration and voting rights.
its much easier to integrate lunch counters than it is to eradicate slums martin luther king jr 1968 why did many northern whites lose sympathy for the civil rights movement.
chapter 27 27 13 black panther leader huey newton 1967 this staged photo showed newton dressed in guerrillastyle clothing surrounded by symbols of african warrior culture to convey the black panthers militant nationalistic ideology.
a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s king rushed to watts intent on teaching residents to employ nonviolent means to express their grievances.
instead it was king who came away with a valuable lesson.
when he toured the smoldering ruins a crowd of black youths shouted we won how can you say you won when 34 negroes are dead your community is destroyed and whites are using the riot as an excuse for inaction king asked.
their reply taught him the extent of despair among northern blacks we won because we made them pay attention to us the watts riots convinced king to move aggressively to end economic inequality nationwide now that battles against legalized segregation and disenfranchisement were won.
but the sclcs 1966 chicago campaign dramatically demonstrated the limits of moderate northern whites support for racial equality.
when protesters marched through all white neighborhoods to protest racial discrimination in renting and selling houses white crowds pelted them with bottles and rocks which some marchers threw back.
i have never seen even in mississippi and alabama mobs as hostile and hate filled as ive seen in chicago king noted with dismay.
after kings death in 1968 president johnson successfully lobbied congress to pass the fair housing act that prohibited discrimination in selling renting or financing housing as a memorial to the slain leader.
black power and the black panthers the black power slogan emerged during james merediths 1966 march against fear in mississippi.
meredith had faced down hostile crowds in 1962 when he became the first black student to graduate from the university of mississippi.
four years later he decided to march 220 miles by himself from memphis tennessee to jackson mississippi hoping that his courage would inspire blacks to register to vote.
on the second day of his march a did the tactics used by the black panthers to publicize their militant vision help or hurt them.
sniper waiting in the bushes wounded meredith.
when activists flocked to continue his march sncc leader stokely carmichael told participants we been saying freedom for six years and we aint got nothing.
what we gonna start saying now is black power black power however soon became a slippery term that people employed in different ways.
competing visions defining black power explores how black leaders with different ideologies embraced competing definitions of black power.
in 1966 black power militants came to the forefront of traditionally nonviolent civil rights organizations like sncc which expelled whites to foster black community leadership.
that same year bobby seale and huey newton founded the black panther party for self defense in oakland california.
the black panthers were a militant civil rights group dedicated to armed self defense racial pride and inner city renewal.
to project an image of strength that would appeal to inner city youth the black panthers wore commando style attire including black leather jackets black pants black berets and dark sunglasses items already fashionable among young black men.
the 1967 photo 27 13 that became the emblem of the black panther movement depicted newton sitting in a throne like wicker chair surrounded by a zebra rug and warrior shields symbols of a racial identity rooted in african culture.
wearing western military style clothing and holding a rifle in his right hand and a spear in his left newton stared into the camera with the steely resolve of a revolutionary.
the paramilitary group initiated community projects including free breakfasts for school children and health clinics but the the fractured left competing visions defining black power the image of a raised clenched black fist became the most enduring symbol of black power but it only represented one view of the slogans meaning.
in the following excerpts civil rights leaders debate the meaning and implications of black power.
malcolm x never used the term directly but his separatist message laid the groundwork for black power nationalism later in the decade.
in contrast martin luther king jr advocated using nonviolent methods to empower the black community.
political scientist charles hamilton notes the various interpretations given to the black power slogan and embraces one that emphasizes pride in being black.
is there any agreement among these competing definitions.
how does this debate compare to the one between marcus garvey and w e b dubois in the 1920s see competing visions chapter 21.
the revolutionary nationalist rhetoric in malcolm xs fiery 1963 message to the grassroots greatly influenced later advocates of black power.
theres no such thing as a nonviolent revolution.
the only kind of revolution that is nonviolent is the negro revolution.
the only revolution in which the goal is loving your enemy is the negro revolution.
its the only revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter a desegregated theater a desegregated park and a desegregated public toilet you can sit down next to white folks on the toilet.
thats no revolution.
revolution is based on land.
land is the basis of all independence.
land is the basis of freedom justice and equality whoever heard of a revolution where they lock arms singing we shall overcome.
you dont do that in a revolution.
you dont do any singing youre too busy swinging.
in a conversation with martin luther king march 25 1968 king offered a definition of black power that supported his strategy of nonviolence.
we have always stood up against injustices.
we have done it militantly.
now so often the word militant is misunderstood because most people think of militancy in military terms.
but to be militant merely means to be demanding and to be persistent and in this sense i think the non violent movement has demonstrated great militancy.
it is possible to be militantly nonviolent.
i havent advocated violence because i do not see it as the answer to the problem.
i do not see it as the answer from a moral point of view and i do not see it as the answer from a practical point of view let me briefly outline the positives of black power.
first black power in the positive sense is a psychological call to manhood.
this is desperately needed in the black community because for all too many years black people view the closer look competing visions defining black power have been ashamed of themselves secondly black power is pooling black political resources in order to achieve our legitimate goals thirdly black power in its positive sense is a pooling of black economic resources in order to achieve legitimate power withdrawing economic support from those who will not be just and fair in their dealings is a very potent weapon.
writing to white america in the new york times magazine in 1968 charles hamilton outlined competing views of black power and stressed the importance of maintaining black racial identity.
black power has many definitions and connotations in the rhetoric of race relations today.
to some people it is synonymous with premeditated acts of violence to destroy the political and economic institutions of this country.
others equate black power with plans to rid the civil rights movements of whites who have been in it for years.
the concept is understood by many to mean hatred of and separation from whites it is associated with calling whites honkies and with shouts of burn baby burn some understand it to be the use of pressure group tactics in the accepted tradition of the american political process.
and still others say that black power must be seen first of all as an attempt to instill a sense of identity and pride in black people black power rejects the lessons of slavery and segregation that caused black people to look upon themselves with hatred and disdain.
to be integrated it was necessary to deny ones heritage ones own culture to be ashamed of ones black skin thick lips and kinky hair.
the black man must change his demeaning conception of himself he must develop a sense of pride and self respect.
then if integration comes it will deal with people who are psychologically and mentally healthy with people who have a sense of their history and of themselves as whole human beings why do all three writers emphasize racial pride and manhood.
chapter 27 a decade of discord the challenge of the 1960s press only saw their rifles.
the black panthers organized paramilitary patrols that openly carried weapons then legal under california law and newton explained stopped whenever we saw the police questioning a brother or a sister to ensure that no beatings or abuse occurred.
in may 1967 30 armed black panthers filed onto the floor of the california state assembly in sacramento to protest the imminent passage of a law banning the open display of weapons a bill meant to shut down the black panther street patrols.
as security forces disarmed them bobby seale called on black communities of america to rise up as one man by october 1967 newton was under arrest wounded by police during a shoot out and accused of killing a white policeman who died in the melee.
fbi chief j edgar hoover viewed the panthers as the greatest threat to the internal security of the country and used spies to plan raids on panther offices and create rifts within the group to weaken the panthers internally.
when the courts overturned newtons conviction in 1970 he emerged from jail to find the black panthers in shambles.
the womens liberation movement another fracture within the civil rights movement this one between men and women energized the modern womens movement.
when young white female activists began leaving the civil rights movement to join the womens movement they joined a crusade already well underway.
feminists did not speak with one voice but instead offered competing visions of how to empower women.
helen gurley brown and betty friedan each wrote bestsellers that helped re ignite the womens movement which had faltered since the 1920s.
marriage was overrated brown asserted in sex and the single girl a 1962 advice book counseling young single women to explore their sexuality while they im a server of food and a putter on of pants and a bedmaker but who am i a middle class housewife quoted in the feminine mystique 1963 what competing visions did brown and friedan offer on empowering women.
had the chance.
by using their sex appeal intelligently young women could thrive despite earning less than men and having fewer career opportunities.
browns prescription was find a job you liked flirt to get special treatment have your dates pay for everything and wait to get married until your looks start to deteriorate.
friedan also challenged the accepted notion that women should focus solely on homemaking and child rearing.
men were free to make careers enjoy hobbies and engage in politics friedan noted in her 1963 treatise the feminine mystique.
by contrast women never had a chance to be anything else than a housewife mother as they shopped for groceries made beds and drove their children to afterschool activities many wondered is this all unlike brown friedan did not believe that sex could fill the void nor did she urge women to avoid marriage or having children.
instead she believed that women should be able to engage in the full range of meaningful activities available to men.
her analysis resonated strongly among white middleclass women who felt imprisoned within their suburban lives.
brown continued to promote her philosophy of empowerment through sexuality in cosmopolitan a provocative womens magazine that she launched in 1965.
friedan took a different path joining the political activists frustrated with the governments failure to fully enforce the civil rights act of 1964 which barred discrimination in employment on the basis of race religion ethnicity or sex.
the new equal employment opportunity commission took complaints of racial discrimination seriously but ignored charges of sexual discrimination.
men are entitled to female secretaries the commission chairman glibly remarked.
in 1966 friedan helped found the national organization for women now to secure equal rights for women in employment education and politics traditionally male domains.
now also wanted to give women control over their own bodies through unfettered access to contraception and legal abortions.
a relatively small organization with only 5 000 members in the late 1960s now nonetheless convinced president johnson to issue an executive order that required government agencies and federal contractors to create affirmative action programs to hire and promote women and minority men.
now also persuaded airlines to stop employing only attractive single women under age 32 as flight attendants.
watch the video video lecture the birth control pill the solution to the worlds problems or sexual chaos.
the fractured left the womens movement grew as younger female activists unhappy with gender discrimination within the civil rights movement and new left took up the cause of female liberation.
collegeage women had participated enthusiastically in freedom summer by teaching in the freedom schools and registering blacks to vote.
women however also performed virtually all the clerical chores and housework for sncc and this gendered allocation of work provoked complaints.
at the height of freedom summer black female sncc workers staged a sit in at a sncc office in atlanta to protest gender discrimination within the civil rights movement.
the assumptions of male superiority are as crippling to the woman as the assumptions of white supremacy are to the negro asserted white activists mary king and casey hayden.
few males took these complaints seriously.
what is the position of women in sncc joked stokely carmichael while relaxing with staffers one evening.
the position of women in sncc is prone the punch line won carmichael appreciative laughter from his male colleagues but this oft repeated story hastened the departure of white female activists.
women in the new left experiencing similar problems with gender discrimination within sds also redirected their energies to the womens movement.
black women were more reluctant to abandon the civil rights movement.
in their view racial oppression affected them more severely than sexual discrimination.
the feminists who founded now lobbied for legislative solutions to womens problems.
in contrast more radicalized feminists steeped in new left ideology and nonviolent tactics adopted a grassroots approach that used consciousness raising heightening awareness of social and political issues to help women understand the universality of our oppression they emphasized changing attitudes rather than lobbying for legislative changes.

welcome to the miss america cattle auction they chanted while filling a trash can with bras high heeled shoes fashion magazines and copies of playboy items they believed reinforced the mindless sex object image of women.

the shift among the white working class had political significance.
in 1964 nearly 60 percent had voted for the democratic ticket four years later only 35 percent did.
the great societys troubles reflected more than persistent racism however.
johnsons unwillingness to raise taxes to pay for an exploding array of domestic programs and the war in vietnam also contributed to its undoing.
as the economy overheated interest rates doubled the national debt exploded and inflation caused prices to rise faster than wages.
this sudden decline in the standard of living after decades of prosperity dismayed americans.
this 1967 herblock political cartoon 27 16 illustrated johnsons dilemma in trying to fund both the vietnam war and the great society.

in the fall hippie stalwarts organized a mock death of hippie son of media funeral procession blaming the over hyped media image of the free loving hippie for the drug related violence and epidemic of rapes that now beset haight ashbury.

by this point most white americans had little tolerance for radical political protest and overwhelmingly supported the police for shutting the demonstrations down.

the indian activists issued the sardonic alcatraz proclamation that offered to purchase the island for 24 in glass beads and red cloth the same amount that the dutch had paid indigenous people for manhattan island in 1626.
the proclamation described alcatraz as the perfect site for an indian reservation because it lacked running water sanitation schools mineral resources and productive soil plus the population has always been held as prisoner and kept dependent upon others eventually the cold and isolation took its toll and the protest ended in june 1971.
native americans staged nearly 70 other occupations throughout the nation including the american indian movements armed takeover of the village of wounded knee south dakota in 1973 the site of the armys massacre of 300 sioux in 1890.
