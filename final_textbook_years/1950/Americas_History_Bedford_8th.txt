chapter 29 the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 hours in mile long lines at gasoline stations for much of the winter of 1973 1974.
oil had become a political weapon and the wests vulnerability stood revealed.
the united states scrambled to meet its energy needs in the face of the oil shortage.
just two months after the opec embargo began congress imposed a national speed limit of 55 miles per hour to conserve fuel.
americans began to buy smaller more fuelefficient cars such as volkswagens toyotas and datsuns later nissans while sales of detroit made cars now nicknamed gas guzzlers slumped.
with one of every six jobs in the country generated directly or indirectly by the auto industry the effects rippled across the economy.
compounding the distress was the raging inflation set off by the oil shortage prices of basic necessities such as bread milk and canned goods rose by nearly 20 percent in 1974 alone.
things will get worse one newspaper headline warned before they get worse environmentalism the energy crisis drove home the realization that the earths resources are not limitless.
such a notion was also at the heart of the eras revival of environmentalism.
the environmental movement was an offshoot of sixties activism but it had numerous historical precedents the preservationist conservationist and wilderness movements of the late nineteenth century the conservationist ethos of the new deal and anxiety about nuclear weapons and overpopulation in the 1940s.
three of the nations leading environmental organizations the sierra club the wilderness society and the natural resources council were founded in 1892 1935 and 1942 respectively.
environmental activists in the 1970s extended the movements historical roots through renewed efforts to ensure a healthy environment and access to unspoiled nature thinking like a historian p 940.
the movement had received a hefty boost back in 1962 when biologist rachel carson published silent spring a stunning analysis of the pesticide ddts toxic impact on the human and natural food chains.
a succession of galvanizing developments followed in the late 1960s.
the sierra club successfully fought two dams in 1966 that would have flooded the grand canyon.
and in 1969 three major events spurred the movement an offshore drilling rig spilled millions of gallons of oil off the coast of santa barbara the cuyahoga river near cleveland burst into flames because of the accumulation of flammable chemicals on its surface and friends of the everglades opposed an airport that threatened earth day 1970 no single event better encapsulated the growing environmental awareness of americans than the nationwide celebration of the first earth day on april 22 1970.

with these events serving as catalysts environmentalism became a certifiable mass movement on the first earth day april 22 1970 when 20 million citizens gathered in communities across the country to express their support for a cleaner healthier planet.

a thinking like a historian the environmental movement reimagining the human earth relationship the 1970s witnessed the emergence of the environmental movement in the united states.
environmentalism took a variety of forms and initially was embraced by politicians across the political spectrum including republican president richard nixon who signed the national environmental policy act in 1970.
yet environmentalism also proved to be politically divisive.
the following documents provide a range of perspectives on an important social and political movement discussed in this chapter.
rachel carson silent spring 1962.
for the first time in the history of the world every human being is now subjected to contact with dangerous chemicals from the moment of conception until death.
in the less than two decades of their use synthetic pesticides have been so thoroughly distributed throughout the animate and inanimate world that they occur virtually everywhere.
they have been recovered from most of the major river systems and even from streams of groundwater flowing unseen through the earth.
ralph nader foreword to ecotactics the sierra club handbook for environmental activists 1970.
in the sierra clubs guide to environmental activism environmental and consumer rights activist nader discusses environmental violence pollution is violence and environmental pollution is environmental violence.
it is a violence that has different impacts styles and time factors than the more primitive kinds of violence such as crime in the streets.
yet in the size of the population exposed and the seriousness of the harm done environmental violence far exceeds that of street crime.
to deal with a system of oppression and suppression which characterizes the environmental violence in this country the first priority is to deprive the polluters of their unfounded legitimacy.
we will have none to preserve.
therefore i shall propose new financing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now before they are lost to us.
the automobile is our worst polluter of the air.
adequate control requires further advances in engine design and fuel composition.
we shall intensify our research set increasingly strict standards and strengthen enforcement procedures and we shall do it now.
we can no longer afford to consider air and water common property free to be abused by anyone without regard to the consequences.
instead we should begin now to treat them as scarce resources which we are no more free to contaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbors yard.

as the most powerful nation in the world today and its largest consumer the united states cannot stand isolated.
we are today involved in the events leading to famine tomorrow we may be destroyed by its consequences.
our position requires that we take immediate action at home and promote effective action world wide.
we must have population control at home hopefully through a system of incentives and penalties but by compulsion if voluntary methods fail.
we must use our political power to push other countries into programs which combine agricultural development and population control.
and while this is being done we must take action to reverse the deterioration of our environment before population pressure permanently ruins our planet.
president ronald reagan speech at the republican national convention july 17 1980.
make no mistake.
we will not permit the safety of our people or our environmental heritage to be jeopardized but we are going to reaffirm that the economic prosperity of our people is a fundamental part of our environment.
our problems are both acute and chronic yet all we hear from those in positions of leadership are the same tired proposals for more government tinkering more meddling and more control all of which led us to this state in the first place.

why did some americans oppose the environmental movement.
putting it all together using what you have learned about the environmental movement in this chapter and the documents above construct an essay in which you make a historical argument about the origins of the movement the issues that it raised and the opposition that developed.
how did the movement shape politics in the 1970s.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 spate of new laws followed the clean air act 1970 the occupational health and safety act 1970 the water pollution control act 1972 and the endangered species act 1973.
the democratic majority in congress and the republican president generally found common ground on these issues and time magazine wondered if the environment was the gut issue that can unify a polarized nation despite the broad popularity of the movement however times prediction was not borne out.
corporations opposed environmental regulations as did many of their workers who believed that tightened standards threatened their jobs.
if youre hungry and out of work eat an environmentalist read one labor union bumper sticker.
by the 1980s environmentalism starkly divided americans with proponents of unfettered economic growth on one side and environmental activists preaching limits on the other.
nuclear power an early foreshadowing of those divisions came in the brewing controversy over nuclear power.
electricity from the atom what could be better.
that was how americans had greeted the arrival of power generating nuclear technology in the 1950s.
by 1974 u s utility companies were operating forty two nuclear power plants with a hundred more planned.
given the oil crisis nuclear energy might have seemed a godsend unlike coal or oil driven plants nuclear operations produced no air pollutants.
environmentalists however publicized the dangers of nuclear power plants a reactor meltdown would be catastrophic and so in slow motion would the dumping of the radioactive waste which would generate toxic levels of radioactivity for hundreds of years.
these fears seemed to be confirmed in march 1979 when the reactor core at the three mile island nuclear plant near harrisburg pennsylvania came close to meltdown.
more than 100 000 people fled their homes.
a prompt shutdown saved the plant but the near catastrophe enabled environmentalists to win the battle over nuclear energy.
after the incident at three mile island no new nuclear plants were authorized though a handful with existing authorization were built in the 1980s.
today nuclear reactors account for 20 percent of all u s power generation substantially less than several european nations but still fourth in the world.
economic transformation in addition to the energy crisis the economy was beset by a host of longer term problems.
government spending on the vietnam war and the great society made for a growing federal deficit and spiraling inflation.
in the industrial sector the country faced more robust competition from west germany and japan.
americas share of world trade dropped from 32 percent in 1955 to 18 percent in 1970 and was headed downward.
as a result in a blow to national pride nine western european countries had surpassed the united states in per capita gross domestic product gdp by 1980.
many of these economic woes highlighted a broader multigenerational transformation in the united states from an industrial manufacturing economy to a postindustrial service one.
that transformation which continues to this day meant that the united states began to produce fewer automobiles appliances and televisions and more financial services health care services and management consulting services not to mention many millions of low paying jobs in the restaurant retail and tourist industries.
in the 1970s the u s economy was hit simultaneously by unemployment stagnant consumer demand and inflation a combination called stagflation which contradicted a basic principle taught by economists prices were not supposed to rise in a stagnant economy figure 29 2.
for ordinary americans stagflation meant a noticeable decline in purchasing power as discretionary income per worker dropped 18 percent between 1973 and 1982.
none of the three presidents of the decade richard nixon gerald ford and jimmy carter had much luck tackling stagflation.
nixons new economic policy was perhaps the most radical attempt.
nixon imposed temporary price and wage controls in 1971 in an effort to curb inflation.
then he took an even bolder step removing the united states from the gold standard which allowed the dollar to float in international currency markets and effectively ended the bretton woods monetary system established after world war ii.
the underlying weaknesses in the u s economy remained however.
ford too had little success.
his whip inflation now win campaign urged americans to cut food waste and do more with less a noble but deeply unpopular idea among the american public.
carters policies considered in a subsequent section of this chapter were similarly ineffective.
the fruitless search for a new economic order was a hallmark of 1970s politics.
deindustrialization americas economic woes struck hardest at the industrial sector which suddenly shockingly began to be dismantled.
worst hit was the steel industry which for seventy five years had been the economys crown jewel.

the dip in 1974 reflects the sharp recession that began that year after which the inflation rate zoomed up to a staggering 14 percent in 1980.
the return to normal levels after 1980 stemmed from very harsh measures by the federal reserve board which while they succeeded came at the cost of a painful slowdown in the economy.
war ii u s steel producers had enjoyed an open hugely profitable market.
but lack of serious competition left them without incentives to replace outdated plants and equipment.
when west germany and japan rebuilt their steel industries these facilities incorporated the latest technology.
foreign steel flooded into the united states during the 1970s and the american industry was simply overwhelmed.
formerly titanic steel companies began a massive dismantling virtually the entire pittsburgh region once a national hub of steel production lost its heavy industry in a single generation.
by the mid 1980s downsizing automation and investment in new technologies made the american steel industry competitive again but it was deindustrialization increasing economic competition from overseas created hard times for american industry in the 1970s and 1980s.
many of the nations once proud core industries such as steel declined precipitously in these decades.
this photo shows a steel mill in pittsburgh pennsylvania being demolished in 1982.
once the center of american steel production pittsburgh suffered hard times in the 1970s and 1980s.
the result of such closures was the creation of the so called rust belt in the northeast and midwest map 29 1.

texas gulf of mexico mexico e w 500 miles 500 kilometers map 29 1 from rust belt to sunbelt 1940 2000 one of the most significant developments of the post world war ii era was the growth of the sunbelt.
sparked by federal spending for military bases the defense industry and the space program states of the south and southwest experienced an economic boom in the 1950s.
this growth was further enhanced in the 1970s as the heavily industrialized regions of the northeast and midwest declined and migrants from what was quickly dubbed the rust belt headed to the south and west in search of jobs.
chapter 29 such giants as ford uniroyal and u s steel closed factories employing 18 000 workers.
these ohio and california workers like hundreds of thousands of their counterparts across the nation had fallen from their perch in the middle class america compared p 946.
deindustrialization dealt an especially harsh blow to the labor movement which had facilitated the postwar expansion of that middle class.
in the early 1970s as inflation hit the number of strikes surged 2 4 million workers participated in work stoppages in 1970 alone.
however industry argued that it could no longer afford union demands and labors bargaining power produced fewer and fewer concrete results.
in these hard years the much vaunted labor management accord of the 1950s which raised profits and wages by passing costs on to consumers went bust.
instead of seeking higher wages unions now mainly fought to save jobs.
union membership went into steep decline and by the mid 1980s organized labor represented less than 18 percent of american workers the lowest level since the 1920s.
the impact on liberal politics was huge.
with labors decline a main buttress of the new deal coalition was coming undone.
urban crisis and suburban revolt the economic downturn pushed already struggling american cities to the brink of fiscal collapse.
middleclass flight to the suburbs continued apace and the ford to city drop dead in the summer of 1975 new york city nearly went bankrupt.
when mayor abraham beame appealed to president gerald ford for assistance these newspaper headlines captured the chief executives response.
though it was ultimately saved from financial ruin the citys brush with insolvency symbolized the larger problems facing the nation economic stagnation high inflation and unemployment.
hard times had seemingly spared no one.
the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 urban crisis of the 1960s spilled into the era of limits facing huge price inflation and mounting piles of debt to finance social services for the poor and to replace disappearing tax revenue nearly every major american city struggled to pay its bills in the 1970s.
surrounded by prosperous postwar suburbs central cities seemingly could not catch a break.
new york the nations financial capital and its largest city fared the worst.
its annual budget was in the billions larger than that of most states.
unable to borrow compare and on the tightening international contrast bond market new york neared how did cities and suburbs collapse in the summer of 1975 experience the era of limbankruptcy was a real possibility.
its differently and why.
when mayor abraham beame appealed to the federal government for assistance president ford refused.
ford to city drop dead read the headline in the new york daily news.
fresh appeals ultimately produced a solution the federal government would lend new york money and banks would declare a three year moratorium on municipal debt.
the arrangement saved the city from defaulting but the mayor was forced to cut city services freeze wages and lay off workers.
one pessimistic observer declared that the banks have been saved and the city has been condemned cities faced declining fortunes in these years for many reasons but one key was the continued loss of america c o m pa r e d most major economic indicators in the united states turned downward in the 1970s as the long postwar expansion ground to an unmistakable halt.
the figures below offer evidence of how developments in the united states compared with other industrialized countries.
economic malaise in the seventies 14 0 12 0 unemployment rate percent 1 8 0 6 0 4 0 u s germany u k japan u s germany figure 29 3 figure 29 4 falling gross domestic product rising unemployment 0 0 2 0 3 10 0 real gdp growth percent u k france questions for analysis 1.
in what ways do these figures demonstrate an integrated global economy.
residents and businesses to nearby suburbs.
in the 1970s alone 13 million people 6 percent of the total u s population moved to the suburbs.
new suburban shopping centers opened weekly across the country and other businesses such as banks insurance companies and technology firms increasingly sought suburban locations.
more and more people lived and worked in suburbs.
in the san francisco bay area 75 percent of all daily commutes were suburb tosuburb and 78 percent of new yorks suburban 2.
what does the gdp graph indicate about how global economic integration affected the u s economy.
notice that japans gdp growth remained strong in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
with what historical development within the u s does that correspond.
residents worked in nearby suburbs.
the 1950s organization man commuting downtown from his suburban home had been replaced by the engineer teacher nurse student and carpenter who lived in one suburb and worked in another.
beyond city limits suburbanization and the economic crisis combined powerfully in what became known as the tax revolt a dramatic reversal of the postwar spirit of generous public investment.
the premier example was california.
inflation pushed real chapter 29 estate values upward and property taxes skyrocketed.
hardest hit were suburban property owners along with retirees and others on fixed incomes who suddenly faced unaffordable tax bills.
into this dire situation stepped howard jarvis a conservative anti new dealer and a genius at mobilizing grassroots discontent.
in 1978 jarvis proposed proposition 13 an initiative that would roll back property taxes cap future increases for present owners and require that all tax measures have a two thirds majority in the legislature.
despite opposition by virtually the entire state leadership including politicians from both parties californians voted overwhelmingly for jarviss measure.
proposition 13 hobbled public spending in the nations most populous state.
per capita funding of california public schools once the envy of the nation plunged from the top tier to the bottom where it was second only to mississippi.
moreover proposition 13s complicated formula benefitted middle class and wealthy home owners at the expense of less well off citizens especially those who depended heavily on public services.
businesses too came out ahead because commercial property got the same protection as residential property.
more broadly proposition 13 inspired tax revolts across the country and helped conservatives define an enduring issue low taxes.
in addition to public investment another cardinal marker of new deal and great society liberalism had been a remarkable decline in income inequality.
in the 1970s that trend reversed and the wealthiest americans those among the top 10 percent began to pull ahead again.
as corporations restructured to boost profits during the 1970s slump they increasingly laid off high wage workers paid the remaining workers less and relocated overseas.
thus upper class americans benefitted while blue collar families who had been lifted into the middle class during the postwar boom increasingly lost out.
an unmistakable trend was apparent by the end of the 1970s.
the u s labor market was dividing in two a vast low wage market at the bottom and a much narrower high wage market at the top with the middle squeezed smaller and smaller.
politics in flux 1973 1980 a search for order characterized national politics in the 1970s as well.
it began with a scandal.
misbehavior is endemic to politics.
yet what became known as the watergate affair or simply watergate implicated president richard nixon in illegal behavior severe enough to bring down his presidency.
liberals the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 benefitted from nixons fall in the short term but their long term retreat continued.
politics remained in flux because while liberals were on the defensive conservatives had not yet put forth a clear alternative.
watergate and the fall of a president on june 17 1972 something strange happened at washingtons watergate office apartment hotel complex.
early that morning five men carrying wiretapping equipment were apprehended there attempting to break into the headquarters of the democratic national committee dnc.
queried by the press a white house spokesman dismissed the episode as a thirdrate burglary attempt pressed further nixon himself denied any white house involvement in this very bizarre incident in fact the two masterminds of the break in g gordon liddy and e howard hunt were former fbi and cia agents currently working for nixons committee to re elect the president creep.
the watergate burglary was no isolated incident.
it was part of a broad pattern of abuse of power by a white house obsessed with its enemies.
liddy and hunt were on the white house payroll part of a clandestine squad hired to stop leaks to the press.
but they were soon arranging illegal wiretaps at dnc headquarters part of a campaign of dirty tricks against the democrats.
nixons siege mentality best explains his fatal misstep.
he could have dissociated himself from the break in by firing his guilty aides or even just by letting justice take its course.
but it was election time and nixon did not trust his political future to such a strategy.
instead he arranged hush money for the burglars and instructed the cia to stop an fbi investigation into the affair.
this was obstruction of justice a criminal offense.
nixon kept the lid on until after the election but in early 1973 one of the watergate burglars began to talk.
in the meantime two reporters at the washington post carl bernstein and bob woodward uncovered creeps links to key white house aides.
in may 1973 a senate investigating committee began holding nationally televised hearings at which administration officials implicated nixon in the illegal cover up.
the president kept investigators at bay for a year but in june 1974 the house judiciary committee began to consider articles of impeachment.
certain of being convicted by the senate nixon became on august 9 1974 the first u s president to resign his office.
the next day vice president gerald ford was sworn in as president.
ford the republican minority leader in the house of representatives had replaced vice president spiro agnew part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 who had himself resigned in 1973 for accepting kickbacks while governor of maryland.
a month after he took office ford stunned the nation by granting nixon a full free and absolute pardon.
congress pushed back passing a raft of laws against the abuses of the nixon administration the war powers act 1973 which reined in the presidents ability to deploy u s forces without congressional approval amendments strengthening the freedom of information act 1974 which gave citizens access to federal records the ethics in government act 1978 and the foreign intelligence surveillance act 1978 which prohibited domestic wiretapping without a warrant.
popular disdain for politicians evident in declining voter turnout deepened with nixons resignation in 1974.
dont vote read one bumper sticker in 1976.
it only encourages them watergate not only damaged short term republican prospects but also shifted the partys balance to the right.
despite mastering the populist appeal to the silent majority the moderate nixon was never beloved by conservatives.
his relaxation of tensions with the soviet union and his visit to communist china in particular won him no friends on the right.
his disgraceful exit benefitted the more conservative republicans who proceeded to reshape the party in their image.
watergate babies as for the democrats watergate granted them a reprieve a second chance at recapturing their eroding base.
backed by a public deeply disenchanted with politicians especially scandal tainted republicans congressional democrats had an opportunity to repair the partys image.
fords pardon of nixon saved the nation a prolonged and agonizing trial which was fords rationale but it was decidedly unpopular among the public.
pollster louis harris remarked that should a politician defend that pardon in any part of this country north or south he is almost literally going to have his head handed to him democratic candidates in the 1974 midterm elections made watergate and fords pardon their top issues.
seventy five new democratic members of the house came to washington in 1975 many of them under the age of forty five and the press dubbed them watergate babies.
explain young and reform minded consequences the watergate babies solidified what changed and what huge democratic majorities in remained the same in both houses of congress and american politics as a result quickly set to work.
they elimiof the watergate scandal.
nated the house un american activities committee huac which had investigated alleged communists in the 1940s and 1950s and antiwar activists in the 1960s.
in the senate democrats reduced the number of votes needed to end a filibuster from 67 to 60 a move intended to weaken the power of the minority to block legislation.
in both houses democrats dismantled the existing committee structure which had entrenched power in the hands of a few elite committee chairs.
and in 1978 the ethics in government act forced political candidates to disclose financial contributions and limited the lobbying activities of former elected officials.
overall the watergate babies helped to decentralize power in washington and bring greater transparency to american government.
in one of the great ironies of american political history however the post watergate reforms made government less efficient and more susceptible to special interests the opposite of what had been intended.
under the new committee structure smaller subcommittees proliferated and the size of the congressional staff doubled to more than 20 000.
a diffuse power structure actually gave lobbyists more places to exert influence.
as the power of committee chairs weakened influence shifted to party leaders such as the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader.
with little incentive to compromise the parties grew more rigid and bipartisanship became rare.
finally filibustering a seldom used tactic largely employed by anti civil rights southerners increased in frequency.
the congress that we have come to know today with its partisan rancor its army of lobbyists and its slow moving response to public needs came into being in the 1970s.
political realignment despite democratic gains in 1974 the electoral realignment that had begun with richard nixons presidential victories in 1968 and 1972 continued.
as liberalism proved unable to stop runaway inflation or speed up economic growth conservatism gained greater traction with the public.
the postwar liberal economic formula sometimes known as the keynesian consensus consisted of microadjustments to the money supply coupled with federal spending.
when that formula failed to restart the economy in the mid 1970s conservatives in congress used this opening to articulate alternatives especially economic deregulation and tax cuts.
on a grander scale deindustrialization in the northeast and midwest and continued population growth in the sunbelt was changing the political geography of the country.
power was shifting incrementally but perceptibly toward the west and south table 29 1.
as states with strong trade unions at the center of the postwar chapter 29 table 29 1 political realignment congressional seats apportionment state new york new jersey pennsylvania ohio illinois indiana michigan wisconsin arizona nevada colorado new mexico texas georgia north carolina virginia florida total rust belt massachusetts connecticut total sunbelt california in the fifty years between 1940 and 1990 the rust belt states lost political clout while the sunbelt states gained it measured here in congressional seats which are apportioned based on population.
sunbelt states gained 66 seats with the rust belt losing 44.
this shifting political geography helped undermine the liberal coalition which was strongest in industrial states with large labor unions and paved the way for the rise of the conservative coalition which was strongest in southern and bible belt states as well as california.
source office of the clerk of the house clerk house gov art history house history congapp bystate html.
liberal political coalition such as new york illinois and michigan lost industry jobs and people states with traditions of libertarian conservatism such as the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 california arizona florida and texas gained greater political clout.
the full impact of this shifting political geography would not be felt until the 1980s and 1990s but its effects had become apparent by the mid 1970s.
jimmy carter the outsider as president jimmy who was how journalists first responded when james earl carter who had been a naval officer a peanut farmer and the governor of georgia emerged from the pack to win the democratic presidential nomination in 1976.
when carter told his mother that he intended to run for president she had asked president of what trading on watergate and his down home image carter pledged to restore morality to the white house.
i will never lie to you he promised voters.
carter played up his credentials as a washington outsider although he selected senator walter f mondale of minnesota as his running mate to ensure his ties to traditional democratic voting blocs.
ford still might have prevailed but his pardon of nixon likely cost him enough votes in key states to swing the election to the democratic candidate.
carter won with 50 percent of the popular vote to fords 48 percent.
for a time carter got some mileage as an outsider the common man who walked to the white house after the inauguration and delivered fireside chats in a cardigan sweater.
the fact that he was a bornagain christian also played well.
but carters inexperience began to show.
he responded to feminists an important democratic constituency by establishing a new womens commission in his administration.
but later he dismissed the commissions concerns and became embroiled in a public fight with prominent womens advocates.
most consequentially his outsider strategy made for chilly relations with congressional leaders.
disdainful of the democratic establishment carter relied heavily on inexperienced advisors from georgia.
and as a detail oriented micromanager he exhausted himself over the fine points of policy better left to his aides.
on the domestic front carters big challenge was managing the economy.
the problems that he faced defied easy solution.
most confounding was stagflation.

in a major tv address having lived through a decade of profound social and political upheaval the vietnam war protests riots watergate recession many americans were exhausted and cynical by the mid 1970s.
but while some retreated to private concerns others took reform in new directions.
civil rights battles continued the womens movement achieved some of its most far reaching aims and gay rights blossomed.
these movements pushed the rights revolution of the 1960s deeper into american life.
others however pushed back.
social conservatives responded by forming their own organizations and resisting the emergence of what they saw as a permissive society.
civil rights in a new era when congress banned job discrimination in the 1964 civil rights act the law required only that employers hire without regard to race color religion sex or national origin but after centuries of slavery and decades of segregation would nondiscrimination bring african americans into the economic mainstream.
many liberals thought not.
they believed that government universities and private employers needed to take positive steps to open their doors to a wider more diverse range of americans including other minority groups and women.
among the most significant efforts to address the legacy of exclusion was affirmative action procedures designed to take into account the disadvantaged position of minority groups after centuries chapter 29 the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 march for affirmative action following the supreme courts 1978 bakke decision americans grew even more divided over the policy of affirmative action.
for many people such as african americans and latinos affirmative action promised that groups who faced historical discrimination would have equal opportunity in jobs and education.
for many whites affirmative action looked like reverse discrimination and they fought its implementation.

of discrimination.
first advanced by the kennedy administration in 1961 affirmative action received a boost under president lyndon johnson whose labor department fashioned a series of plans in the late 1960s to encourage government contractors to recruit underrepresented racial minorities.
women were added under the last of these plans when pressure from the womens movement highlighted the problem of sex discrimination.
by the early 1970s affirmative action had been refined by court rulings that identified acceptable procedures hiring and enrollment goals special recruitment and training programs and setasides specially reserved slots for both racial minority groups and women.
affirmative action however did not please many whites who felt that the deck was being stacked against them.
much of the dissent came from conservative groups that had opposed civil rights all along.
they charged affirmative action advocates with reverse discrimination legal challenges abounded as employees students and university applicants went to court to object to these new procedures.
some liberal groups sought a middle position.
in a widely publicized 1972 letter jewish organizations seared by the memory of quotas that once kept jewish students out of elite colleges came out against all racial quotas but nonetheless endorsed rectifying the imbalances resulting from past discrimination a major shift in affirmative action policy came in 1978.

campuses and vigorous discussion on television and radio and in the white house.
ultimately the supreme court rejected the medical schools quota system which set aside 16 of 100 places for disadvantaged students.
the court ordered bakke admitted but indicated that a more flexible affirmative action plan in which race could be considered along with other factors would still pass constitutional muster.
bakke v university of california thus upheld affirmative action but by rejecting a quota system also called it into question.
future court rulings and state referenda in the 1990s and 2000s would further limit part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the scope of affirmative action.
in particular california voters passed proposition 209 in 1996 prohibiting public institutions from using affirmative action to increase diversity in employment and education.
the womens movement and gay rights unlike the civil rights movement whose signal achievements came in the 1960s the womens and gay rights movements flourished in the 1970s.
with three influential wings radical liberal and third world the womens movement inspired both grassroots activism and legislative action across the nation.
for their part gay activists had further to go they needed to convince explain americans that same sex relaconsequences tionships were natural and that how did the idea of civil rights expand during the gay men and lesbians deserved 1970s.
the same protection of the law as all other citizens.
neither movement achieved all of its aims in this era but each laid a strong foundation for the future.
womens activism in the first half of the 1970s the womens liberation movement reached its historic peak.
taking a dizzying array of forms from lobbying legislatures to marching in the streets and establishing all female collectives womens liberation produced activism on the scale of the earlier black led civil rights movement.
womens centers as well as womenrun child care facilities began to spring up in cities and towns.
a feminist art and poetry movement flourished.
women challenged the admissions policies of all male colleges and universities opening such prestigious universities as yale and columbia and nearly bringing an end to male only institutions of higher education.
female scholars began to transform higher education by studying womens history by increasing the number of women on college and university faculties and by founding womens studies programs.
much of womens liberation activism focused on the female body.
inspired by the boston collective that first published our bodies ourselves a groundbreaking book on womens health the womens health movement founded dozens of medical clinics encouraged women to become physicians and educated millions of women about their bodies.
to reform antiabortion laws activists pushed for remedies in more than thirty state legislatures.
womens liberationists founded the antirape movement established rape crisis centers around the nation and lobbied state legislatures and congress to reform rape laws.
many of these endeavors and movements began as shoestring operations in living rooms and kitchens our bodies ourselves was first published as a 35 cent mimeographed booklet and the antirape movement began in small consciousness raising groups that met in churches and community centers.
by the end of the decade however all of these causes had national organizations and touched the lives of millions of american women.
equal rights amendment buoyed by this flourishing of activism the womens movement renewed the fight for an equal rights amendment era to the constitution.
first introduced in 1923 the era stated in its entirety equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or any state on the basis of sex vocal congressional women such as patsy mink democrat hawaii bella abzug phyllis schlafly phyllis schlafly leader of the organization stop era talks with reporters during a rally at the illinois state capitol on march 4 1975 at a time when the state legislature was considering whether to ratify the equal rights amendment.
schlafly described herself as a housewife and called her strenuous political career a hobby.
bettmann corbis.
chapter 29 democrat new york and shirley chisholm democrat new york found enthusiastic male allies among both democrats and republicans and congress adopted the amendment in 1972.
within just two years thirty four of the necessary thirty eight states had ratified it and the era appeared headed for adoption.
but then progress abruptly halted map 29 2.
credit for putting the brakes on era ratification goes chiefly to a remarkable woman phyllis schlafly a lawyer long active in conservative causes.
despite her own flourishing career schlafly advocated traditional roles for women.
the era she proclaimed would create an unnatural unisex society with women drafted into the army and forced to use single sex toilets.
abortion she alleged could never be prohibited by law.

the era never was ratified despite a congressional extension of the deadline to june 30 1982.
roe v wade in addition to the era the womens movement had identified another major goal winning reproductive rights.
activists pursued two tracks legislative and judicial.
in the early 1960s abortion was illegal in virtually every state.
a decade later thanks to intensive lobbying by womens organizations liberal ministers and physicians a handful of states such as new york hawaii california and colorado adopted laws making legal abortions easier to obtain.
but progress after that was slow and womens advocates turned to the courts.
there was reason to be optimistic.

the turning point came in 1976 when era advocates lobbied extensively particularly in florida north carolina and illinois but failed to sway the conservative legislatures in those states.
after indiana ratified in 1977 the amendment still lacked three votes toward the three fourths majority needed for adoption.
efforts to revive the era in the 1980s were unsuccessful and it became a dead issue.
1974 1977 not ratifying american voices debating the equal rights amendment fifty years after its introduction the equal rights amendment equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex finally met congressional approval in 1972 and was sent to the states for ratification.
the amendment set off a furious debate especially in the south and midwest and fell short of ratification.
following are four of the voices in that debate.
phyllis schlafly jerry falwell lawyer and political activist phyllis schlafly was the most prominent opponent of the era.
her organization stop era campaigned against the amendment in critical states and helped to halt ratification.
jerry falwell was a fundamentalist baptist preacher in virginia a television evangelist and the founder of the political lobbying organization known as the moral majority.
womens magazines the womens pages of newspapers and television and radio talk shows have been filled for months with a strident advocacy of the rights of women to be treated on an equal basis with men in all walks of life.
but what about the rights of the woman who doesnt want to compete on an equal basis with men.
does she have the right to be treated as a woman by her family by society and by the law.
the laws of every one of our 50 states now guarantee the right to be a woman protected and provided for in her career as a woman wife and mother.
the proposed equal rights amendment will wipe out all our laws which through rights benefits and exemptions guarantee this right to be a woman.
is this what american women want.
is this what american men want.
the laws of every one of the 50 states now require the husband to support his wife and children and to provide a home for them to live in.
in other words the law protects a womans right to be a full time wife and mother her right not to take a job outside the home her right to care for her own baby in her own home while being financially supported by her husband.
there are two very different types of women lobbying for the equal rights amendment.
one group is the womens liberationists.
their motive is totally radical.
they hate men marriage and children.
they are out to destroy morality and the family.
there is another type of woman supporting the equal rights amendment from the most sincere motives.
it is easy to see why the business and professional women are supporting the equal rights amendment many of them have felt the keen edge of discrimination in their employment.
i believe that at the foundation of the womens liberation movement there is a minority core of women who were once bored with life whose real problems are spiritual problems.
many women have never accepted their godgiven roles.
god almighty created men and women biologically different and with differing needs and roles.
he made men and women to complement each other and to love each other.
women who work should be respected and accorded dignity and equal rewards for equal work.
but this is not what the present feminist movement and equal rights movement are all about.
the equal rights amendment is a delusion.
i believe that women deserve more than equal rights.
and in families and in nations where the bible is believed christian women are honored above men.
only in places where the bible is believed and practiced do women receive more than equal rights.
men and women have differing strengths.
the equal rights amendment can never do for women what needs to be done for them.
women need to know jesus christ as their lord and savior and be under his lordship.
they need a man who knows jesus christ as his lord and savior and they need to be part of a home where their husband is a godly leader and where there is a christian family.
era is not merely a political issue but a moral issue as well.
a definite violation of holy scripture era defies the mandate that the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church ep.
in 1 peter 3 7 we read that husbands are to give their wives honor as unto the weaker vessel that they are both heirs together of the grace of life.
because a woman is weaker does not mean that she is less important.

elizabeth duncan koontz caroline bird elizabeth duncan koontz was a distinguished educator and the first black woman to head the national education association and the u s womens bureau.
at the time she made this statement at state legislative hearings on the era in 1977 she was assistant state superintendent for public instruction in north carolina.
caroline bird was the lead author of what women want a report produced by womens rights advocates following the 1977 national womens conference held in houston texas.
a short time ago i had the misfortune to break my foot.
did not hurt me as much as when i went into the emergency room and the young woman upon asking me my name the nature of my ailment then asked me for my husbands social security number and his hospitalization number.
i asked her what did that have to do with my emergency.
and she said we have to be sure of who is going to pay your bill i said suppose im not married then and she said then give me your fathers name i did not go through that twenty years ago when i was denied the use of that emergency room because of my color.
i went through that because there is an underlying assumption that all women in our society are protected dependent cared for by somebody whos got a social security number and hospitalization insurance.
never once did she assume i might be a woman who might be caring for my husband instead of him by me because of some illness.
she did not take into account the fact that one out of almost eight women heading families in poverty today is in the same condition as men in families and poverty.
my greater concern is that so many women today.
oppose the passage of the era very sincerely and.
tell you without batting an eye i dont want to see women treated that way and i speak up what way is that.
women themselves have been a bit misguided.
we have mistaken present practice for law and women have.
assumed too many times that their present condition cannot change.
the rate of divorce the rate of desertion the rate of separation and the death rate of male supporters is enough for us to say let us remove all legal barriers to women and girls making their choices this state cannot afford it source william a.

the declaration of independence signed in 1776 stated that all men are created equal and that governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed women were not included in either concept.
the original american constitution of 1787 was founded on english common law which did not recognize women as citizens or as individuals with legal rights.
a woman was expected to obey her husband or nearest male kin and if she was married her person and her property were owned by her husband.
it has been argued that the era is not necessary because the fourteenth amendment passed after the civil war guarantees that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
aside from the fact that women have been subjected to varying inconsistent and often unfavorable decisions under the fourteenth amendment the equal rights amendment is a more immediate and effective remedy to sex discrimination in federal and state laws than case bycase interpretation under the fourteenth amendment could ever be.

questions for analysis 1.
schlafly and koontz have different notions of what it means to be a woman.
explain what these differences are and how they inform the authors distinct views of the era.
why does schlafly believe that women will be harmed by the era.
schlafly and falwell argue that women need the protection and support of men.
are they right.
how would koontz likely respond.
how do each of the four authors define womens roles and responsibilities in society.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 supreme court had first addressed reproductive rights in a 1965 case griswold v connecticut.
griswold struck down an 1879 state law prohibiting the possession of contraception as a violation of married couples constitutional right of privacy following the logic articulated in griswold the court gradually expanded the right of privacy in a series of cases in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
those cases culminated in roe v wade 1973.
in that landmark decision the justices nullified a texas law that prohibited abortion under any circumstances even when the womans health was at risk and laid out a new national standard abortions performed during the first trimester were protected by the right of privacy.
at the time and afterward some legal authorities questioned whether the constitution recognized any such privacy right and criticized the courts seemingly arbitrary first trimester timeline.
nevertheless the supreme court chose to move forward transforming a traditionally state regulated policy into a national constitutionally protected right.
for the womens movement roe v wade represented a triumph.
for evangelical and fundamentalist christians catholics and conservatives generally it was a bitter pill.
in their view abortion was unequivocally the taking of a human life.
these americans represented by groups such as the national right to life committee did not believe that something they regarded as immoral and sinful could be the basis for womens equality.
womens advocates responded that illegal abortions common prior to roe were often unsafe procedures which resulted in physical harm to women and even death.
roe polarized what was already a sharply divided public and mobilized conservatives to seek a supreme court reversal or short of that to pursue legislation that would strictly limit the conditions under which abortions could be performed.
in 1976 they convinced congress to deny medicaid funds for abortions an opening round in a campaign against roe v wade that continues today.
harvey milk the gay rights movement had achieved notable victories as well.
these too proved controversial.
more than a dozen cities had passed gay rights ordinances by the mid 1970s protecting gay men and lesbians from employment and housing discrimination.
one such ordinance in dade county miami florida sparked a protest led by anita bryant a conservative baptist and a television celebrity.
her save our children campaign in 1977 which garnered national media attention resulted in the repeal of the ordinance and symbolized the emergence of a conservative religious movement opposed to gay rights.
across the country from miami developments in san francisco looked promising for gay rights advocates then turned tragic.
no one embodied the combination of gay liberation and hard nosed politics better than a san francisco camera shop owner named harvey milk in november 1977 harvey milk became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the united states when he won a seat on the san francisco board of supervisors.
shockingly almost exactly a year from the day of his election milk was assassinated.
bettmann corbis.
chapter 29 harvey milk.
a closeted businessman in new york until he was forty milk arrived in san francisco in 1972 and threw himself into city politics.
fiercely independent he ran as an openly gay candidate for city supervisor city council twice and the state assembly once both times unsuccessfully.
by mobilizing the gay vote into a powerful bloc milk finally won a supervisor seat in 1977.
he was not the first openly gay elected official in the country kathy kozachenko of michigan and elaine noble of massachusetts share that distinction but he became a national symbol of emerging gay political power.
tragically after he helped to win passage of a gay rights ordinance in san francisco he was assassinated in 1978 along with the citys mayor george moscone by a disgruntled former supervisor named dan white.
when white was convicted of manslaughter rather than murder five thousand gays and lesbians in san francisco marched on city hall.
after the warren court in response to what conservatives considered the liberal judicial revolution under the warren court president nixon came into the presidency promising to appoint strict constructionists conservative minded justices to the bench.
in three short years between 1969 and 1972 he was able to appoint four new justices to the supreme court including the new chief justice warren burger.
surprisingly despite the conservative credentials of its new members the burger court refused to scale back the liberal precedents set under warren.
most prominently in roe v wade the burger court extended the right of privacy developed under warren to include womens access to abortion.
as we saw above few supreme court decisions in the twentieth century have disappointed conservatives more.
in a variety of cases the burger court either confirmed previous liberal rulings or chose a centrist course.
in 1972 for instance the court deepened its intervention in criminal procedure by striking down all existing capital punishment laws in furman v georgia.
in response los angeles police chief ed davis accused the court of establishing a legal oligarchy that had ignored the perspective of the average citizen he and other conservatives vowed a nationwide campaign to bring back the death penalty which was in fact shortly restored in gregg v georgia 1976.
other decisions advanced womens rights.
in 1976 the court ruled that arbitrary distinctions based on sex in the workplace and other arenas were unconstitutional and in 1986 that sexual harassment violated the civil the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 rights act.
these rulings helped women break employment barriers in the subsequent decades.
in all of their rulings on privacy rights however the burger court was reluctant to move ahead of public attitudes toward homosexuality.
gay men and lesbians still had no legal recourse if state laws prohibited same sex relations.
in a controversial 1986 case bowers v hardwick the supreme court upheld a georgia sodomy statute that criminalized same sex sexual acts.
the majority opinion held that homosexuality was contrary to ordered liberty and that extending sexual privacy to gays and lesbians would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching not until 2003 lawrence v texas would the court overturn that decision recognizing for all americans the right to sexual privacy.
the american family on trial in 1973 the public broadcasting system pbs aired a twelve part television series that followed the life of a real american family.
producers wanted the show called simply an american family to document how a middle class white family coped with the stresses of a changing society.
they did not anticipate that the family would dissolve in front of their cameras.
tensions and arguments raged and in the final episode bill the husband and father who had had numerous extramarital affairs moved out.
by the time the show aired the couple was divorced and pat the former wife had become a single working mother with five children.
an american family captured a traumatic moment in the twentieth century history of the family.
between 1965 and 1985 the divorce rate doubled and children born in the 1970s had a 40 percent chance of spending part of their youth in a single parent household.
as wages stagnated and inflation pushed prices up more and more families depended on two incomes for survival.
furthermore the womens movement and the counterculture had called into question traditional sex roles father as provider and mother as homemaker and middle class baby boomers rebelled against what they saw as the puritanical sexual values of their parents generation.
in the midst of such rapid change where did the family stand.
working families in the age of deindustrialization one of the most striking developments of the 1970s and 1980s was the relative stagnation of wages.
after world war ii hourly wages had grown steadily ahead part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 of inflation giving workers more buying power with each passing decade.
by 1973 that trend had stopped in its tracks.
the decline of organized labor the loss of manufacturing jobs and runaway inflation all played a role in the reversal.
hardest hit were blue collar and pink collar workers and those without college degrees.
women enter the workforce millions of wives and mothers had worked for wages for decades.
but many americans still believed in the family wage a breadwinner income earned by men sufficient to support a family.
after 1973 fewer and fewer americans had access to that luxury.
between 1973 and the early 1990s every major income group except the top 10 percent saw their real earnings accounting for inflation either remain the same or decline.
over this period the typical worker saw a 10 percent drop in real wages.
to keep their famiplace events lies from falling behind women in context why did the struggles of streamed into the workforce.
working families become between 1950 and 1994 the promore prominent in the portion of women ages 25 to 54 1970s and what social and working for pay increased from economic concerns did 37 to 75 percent.
much of that those families have.
increase occurred in the 1970s.
americans were fast becoming dependent on the twoincome household figure 29 5.
the numbers tell two different stories of american life in these decades.
on the one hand the trends unmistakably show that women especially in bluecollar and pink collar families had to work for wages to sustain their familys standard of living to buy a car pay for college afford medical bills support an aging parent or simply pay the rent.
moreover the number of single women raising children nearly doubled between 1965 and 1990.
womens paid labor was making up for the declining earning power or the absence of men in american households.
on the other hand womens real income overall grew during the same period.
this increase reflected the opening of professional and skilled jobs to educated baby boomer women.
as older barriers began to fall women poured into law and medicine business and government and though more slowly the sciences and engineering.
beneficiaries of feminism these women pursued careers of which their mothers had only dreamed.
workers in the national spotlight for a brief period in the 1970s the trials of working men and women made a distinct imprint on national culture.
figure 29 5 the increase in two worker families in 1968 about 43 percent of married couples sent both the husband and the wife into the workforce thirty years later 60 percent were twoearner families.
the percentage of families in which the wife alone worked increased from 3 to 5 percent during these years while those with no earners welfare recipients and increasingly retired couples rose from 8 to 13 percent.
because these figures do not include unmarried persons and most illegal immigrants they do not give a complete picture of the american workplace.
but there is no doubt that women now play a major role in the workforce.

the decade also saw the rise of musicians such as bruce springsteen johnny paycheck and john cougar mellencamp who became stars by turning the hardscrabble lives of people in small towns and workingclass communities into rock anthems that filled arenas.
springsteen wrote songs about characters who sweat it out in the streets of a runaway american dream and to the delight of his audience paycheck famously sang take this job and shove it meanwhile on the streets of harlem and the south bronx in new york young working class african american men experimenting with dance and musical forms invented break dancing and rap music styles that expressed both the hardship and the creativity of working class black life in the deindustrialized american city.
navigating the sexual revolution the economic downturn was not the only force that placed stress on american families in this era.
another such force was what many came to call the sexual revolution hardly revolutionary sexual attitudes in the 1970s were in many ways a logical evolution of developments in the first half of the twentieth century.
beginning in the 1910s americans increasingly viewed sex as a component of personal happiness distinct from reproduction.
attitudes toward sex grew even more lenient in the postwar decades a fact reflected in the kinsey studies of the 1940s and 1950s.
by the 1960s sex before marriage had grown more socially acceptable an especially profound change for women and frank discussions of sex in the media and popular culture had grown more common.
in that decade three developments dramatically accelerated this process the introduction of the birth control pill the rise of the baby boomer led counterculture and the influence of feminism.

of this pharmaceutical advance.
rapid shifts in attitude accompanied the technological breakthrough.
middle class baby boomers embraced a sexual ethic of greater freedom and in many cases a more casual approach to sex outside marriage.
i just feel i am expressing myself the way i feel at that moment in the most natural way a female california college student explaining her sex life told a reporter in 1966.
the rebellious counterculture encouraged this attitudinal shift by associating a puritanical view of sex with their parents generation.
finally womens rights activists reacted to the new emphasis on sexual freedom in at least two distinct ways.
many feminists felt that the sexual revolution was by and for men the emphasis on casual sex seemed to perpetuate male privilege the old double standard sexual harassment was all too common in the workplace and the proliferation of pornography continued to commercialize women as sex objects.
on the other hand they remained optimistic that the new sexual ethic could free women from those older moral constraints.
they called for a revolution in sexual values not simply behavior that would end exploitation and grant women the freedom to explore their sexuality on equal terms with men.
sex and popular culture in the 1970s popular culture was suffused with discussions of the sexual revolution.
mass market books with titles such as everything you always wanted to know about sex human sexual response and the sensuous man shot up the best seller list.
william masters and virginia johnson became the most famous sex researchers since alfred kinsey by studying couples in the act of lovemaking.
in 1972 english physician alex comfort published the joy of sex a guidebook for couples that became one of the most popular books of the decade.
comfort made certain to distinguish his writing from pornographic exploitation.
sex is the one place where we today can learn to treat people as people he wrote.
hollywood took advantage of the new sexual ethic by making films with explicit erotic content that pushed the boundaries of middle class taste.
films such as midnight cowboy 1969 carnal knowledge 1971 and shampoo 1974 the latter starring hollywoods leading ladies man warren beatty led the way.
throughout the decade and into the 1980s the motion picture association of america mpaa scrambled to keep its guide for parents the system of rating pictures g pg r and x and after 1984 pg 13 in tune with hollywoods advancing sexual revolution.
on television the popularity of social problem shows such as all in the family and the fear of losing chapter 29 midnight cowboy in the mid 1970s the movie industry embraced the sexual revolution and pushed the boundaries of middle class taste.
movies such as midnight cowboy 1975 starring dustin hoffman and jon voight were part of a larger shift in american culture in which frank sexual discussions and the portrayal of sexual situations in various media grew more acceptable.
john springer collection corbis.
advertising revenue moderated the portrayal of sex in the early 1970s.
however in the second half of the decade networks both exploited and criticized the new sexual ethic.
in frivolous lighthearted shows such as the popular charlies angels threes company and the love boat heterosexual couples explored the often confusing and usually comical landscape of sexual morality.
at the same time between 1974 and 1981 the major networks produced more than a dozen madefor tv movies about children in sexual danger a sensationalized warning to parents of the potential threats to children posed by a less strict sexual morality.
middle class marriage many americans worried that the sexual revolution threatened marriage itself.
the notion of marriage as romantic companionship had defined middle class norms since the late nineteenth century.
it was also quite common throughout most of the twentieth century for americans to see sexual satisfaction as a healthy part of the marriage bond.
the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 but what defined a healthy marriage in an age of rising divorce rates changing sexual values and feminist critiques of the nuclear family.
only a small minority of americans rejected marriage outright most continued to create monogamous relationships codified in marriage.
but many came to believe that they needed help as marriage came under a variety of economic and psychological stresses.
a therapeutic industry arose in response.
churches and secular groups alike established marriage seminars and counseling services to assist couples in sustaining a healthy marriage.
a popular form of 1960s psychotherapy the encounter group was adapted to marriage counseling couples met in large groups to explore new methods of communicating.
one of the most successful of these organizations marriage encounter was founded by the catholic church.
it expanded into protestant and jewish communities in the 1970s and became one of the nations largest counseling organizations.
such groups embodied another long term shift in how middle class americans understood marriage.
spurred by both feminism and psychotherapeutic models that stressed self improvement americans increasingly defined marriage not simply by companionship and sexual fidelity but also by the deeply felt emotional connection between two people.
religion in the 1970s the fourth great awakening for three centuries american society has been punctuated by intense periods of religious revival what historians have called great awakenings chapters 4 and 8.
these periods have seen a rise in church membership the appearance of charismatic religious leaders and the increasing influence of religion usually of the evangelical variety on society and politics.
one such awakening the fourth in u s history took shape in the 1970s and 1980s.
it had many elements but one of its central features was a growing concern with the family.
in the 1950s and 1960s many mainstream protestants had embraced the reform spirit of the age.
some of the most visible protestant leaders were social activists who condemned racism and opposed the vietnam war.
organizations such as the national council of churches along with many progressive catholics and jews joined with martin luther king jr and other african american ministers in the long battle for civil rights.
many mainline protestant churches among them the episcopal methodist and congregationalist denominations practiced a version part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 of the social gospel the reform minded christianity of the early twentieth century.
evangelical resurgence meanwhile evangelicalism survived at the grass roots.
evangelical protestant churches emphasized an intimate personal salvation being born again focused on a explain literal interpretation of the bible consequences and regarded the death and resurhow did evangelical chrisrection of jesus as the central tianity influence american message of christianity.
these society in the 1970s.
tenets distinguished evangelicals from mainline protestants as well as from catholics and jews and they flourished in a handful of evangelical colleges bible schools and seminaries in the postwar decades.
no one did more to keep the evangelical fire burning than billy graham.
a graduate of the evangelical wheaton college in illinois graham cofounded youth for christ in 1945 and then toured the united states and europe preaching the gospel.
following a stunning 1949 tent revival in los angeles that lasted eight weeks graham shot to national fame.
his success in los angeles led to a popular radio program but televangelism television minister televangelist and conservative political activist pat robertson shown here in the control room of his 700 club tv show was a leading figure in the resurgence of evangelical christianity in the 1970s and 1980s.
reaching millions of viewers through their television ministries men such as robertson built huge churches and large popular followings.
wally mcnamee corbis chapter 29 he continued to travel relentlessly conducting oldfashioned revival meetings he called crusades.
a massive sixteen week 1957 crusade held in new york citys madison square garden made graham along with the conservative catholic priest fulton sheen one of the nations most visible religious leaders.
graham and other evangelicals in the 1950s and 1960s laid the groundwork for the fourth great awakening.
but it was a startling combination of events in the late 1960s and early 1970s that sparked the evangelical revival.
first rising divorce rates social unrest and challenges to prevailing values led people to seek the stability of faith.
second many americans regarded feminism the counterculture sexual freedom homosexuality pornography and legalized abortion not as distinct issues but as a collective sign of moral decay in society.
to seek answers and find order more and more people turned to evangelical ministries especially southern baptist pentecostal and assemblies of god churches.
numbers tell part of the story.
as mainline churches lost about 15 percent of their membership between 1970 and 1985 evangelical church membership soared.
the southern baptist convention the largest protestant denomination grew by 23 percent while the assemblies of god grew by an astounding 300 percent.
newsweek magazine declared 1976 the year of the evangelical and that november the nation made jimmy carter the nations first evangelical president.
in a national gallup poll 34 percent of americans answered yes when asked would you describe yourself as a born again or evangelical christian much of this astonishing growth came from the creative use of television.
graham had pounded the pavement and worn out shoe leather to reach his converts.
but a new generation of preachers brought religious conversion directly into americans living rooms through television.
these so called televangelists built huge media empires through small donations from millions of avid viewers not to mention advertising.
jerry falwells old time gospel hour pat robertsons 700 club and jim and tammy bakkers ptl praise the lord club were the leading pioneers in this televised race for american souls but another half dozen including oral roberts and jimmy swaggart followed them onto the airwaves.
together they made the 1970s and 1980s the era of christian broadcasting.
religion and the family of primary concern to evangelical christians was the family.
drawing on selected bible passages evangelicals believed that the the search for order in an era of limits 1973 1980 nuclear family and not the individual represented the fundamental unit of society.
the family itself was organized along paternalist lines father was breadwinner and disciplinarian mother was nurturer and supporter.
motherhood is the highest form of femininity the evangelical author beverly lahaye wrote in an influential book on christian women.
another popular christian author declared a church a family a nation is only as strong as its men evangelicals spread their message about the christian family through more than the pulpit and television.
they founded publishing houses wrote books established foundations and offered seminars.
helen b andelin for instance a california housewife produced a homemade book called fascinating womanhood that eventually sold more than 2 million copies.
she used the book as the basis for her classes which by the early 1970s had been attended by 400 000 women and boasted 11 000 trained teachers.
fascinating womanhood led evangelical women in the opposite direction of feminism.
whereas the latter encouraged women to be independent and to seek equality with men andelin taught that submissiveness will bring a strange but righteous power over your man andelin was but one of dozens of evangelical authors and educators who encouraged women to defer to men.
evangelical christians held that strict gender roles in the family would ward off the influences of an immoral society.
christian activists were especially concerned with sex education in public schools the proliferation of pornography legalized abortion and the rising divorce rate.
for them the answer was to strengthen what they called traditional family structures.
by the early 1980s christians could choose from among hundreds of evangelical books take classes on how to save a marriage or how to be a christian parent attend evangelical churches and bible study courses watch evangelical ministers on television and donate to foundations that promoted christian values in state legislatures and the u s congress.
wherever one looked in the 1970s and early 1980s american families were under strain.
nearly everyone agreed that the waves of social liberalism and economic transformation that swept over the nation in the 1960s and 1970s had destabilized society and especially family relationships.
but americans did not agree about how to restabilize families.
indeed different approaches to the family would further divide the country in the 1980s and 1990s as the new right would increasingly make family values a political issue.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 family values during the 1980 presidential campaign the reverend jerry falwell pictured here with phyllis schlafly supported ronald reagan and the republican party with i love america rallies around the country.
falwell head of the moral majority helped to bring a new focus on family values to american politics in the late 1970s.
this was a conservative version of the emphasis on male breadwinner nuclear families that had long been characteristic of american values.

summary for much of the 1970s americans struggled with economic problems including inflation energy shortages income stagnation and deindustrialization.
these challenges highlighted the limits of postwar prosperity and forced americans to consider lowering their economic expectations.
a movement for environmental protection widely supported led to new laws and an awareness of natures limits and the energy crisis highlighted the nations dependence on resources from abroad especially oil.
in the midst of this gloomy economic climate americans also sought political and cultural resolutions to the upheavals of the 1960s.
in politics the watergate scandal led to a brief period of political reform.
meanwhile the battle for civil rights entered a second stage expanding to encompass womens rights gay rights and the rights of alleged criminals and prisoners and in the realm of racial justice focusing on the problem of producing concrete results rather than legislation.
many liberals cheered these developments but another effect was to strengthen a new more conservative social mood that began to challenge liberal values in politics and society more generally.
finally we considered the multiple challenges faced by the american family in the 1970s and how a perception that the family was in trouble helped to spur an evangelical religious revival that would shape american society for decades to come.

chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 the great society president lyndon johnson toured poverty stricken regions of the country in 1964.
here he visits with tom fletcher a father of eight children in martin county kentucky.
johnson envisioned a dramatic expansion of liberal social programs both to assist the needy and to strengthen the middle class that he called the great society.
bettmann corbis.
because he would move so fast on civil rights they would be running to catch up.
politically the choice was risky.
johnson would please the democratic partys liberal wing but because most northern african americans already voted democratic the party would gain few additional votes.
moreover southern white democrats would likely revolt dividing the party at a time when johnsons legislative agenda most required unanimity.
but johnson pushed ahead and the 1964 civil rights act stands in part as a testament to the presidents political risk taking.
more than civil rights what drove johnson hardest was his determination to end poverty in our time the president called it a national disgrace that in the midst of plenty one fifth of all americans hidden from most peoples sight in appalachia urban ghettos migrant labor camps and indian reservations lived in poverty.
but johnson declared for the first time in our history it is possible to conquer poverty the economic opportunity act of 1964 which created a series of programs to reach these americans was the presidents answer what he called the war on poverty.
this legislation included several different initiatives.
head start provided free nursery schools to prepare disadvantaged preschoolers for kindergarten.
the job corps and upward bound provided young people with training and employment.
volunteers in service to america vista modeled on the peace corps offered technical assistance to the urban and rural poor.
an array of regional development programs focused on spurring economic growth in impoverished areas.
on balance the 1964 legislation provided services to the poor rather than jobs leading some critics to charge the war on poverty with doing too little.
the 1964 election with the civil rights act passed and his war on poverty initiatives off the ground johnson turned his attention to the upcoming presidential election.
not content to govern in kennedys shadow he wanted a national mandate of his own.
privately johnson cast himself less like kennedy than as the heir of franklin roosevelt and the expansive liberalism of the 1930s.
johnson had come to congress for the first time in 1937 and had long admired fdrs political skills.
he reminded his advisors never to forget the meek and the humble and the lowly because president roosevelt never did in the 1964 election johnson faced republican barry goldwater of arizona.
an archconservative goldwater ran on an anticommunist antigovernment platform offering a choice not an echo meaning he represented a genuinely conservative alternative to liberalism rather than the echo of liberalism offered by the moderate wing of the republican party chapter 25.
goldwater campaigned against the civil rights act of 1964 and promised a more vigorous cold war foreign policy.
among those supporting him was former actor ronald reagan whose speech on behalf of goldwater at the republican convention called a part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 time for choosing made him a rising star in the party.
but goldwaters strident foreign policy alienated voters.
extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice he told republicans at the convention.
moreover there remained strong national sentiment for kennedy.
telling americans that he was running to fulfill kennedys legacy johnson and his running mate hubert h humphrey of minnesota won in a landslide map 28 1.
in the long run goldwaters candidacy marked the beginning of a grassroots conservative revolt that would eventually transform the republican party.
in the short run however johnsons sweeping victory gave him a popular mandate and equally important congressional majorities that rivaled fdrs in 1935 just what he needed to push the great society forward table 28 1.
great society initiatives one of johnsons first successes was breaking a congressional deadlock on education and health care.
passed in april 1965 the 26 11 7 12 3 washington d c.
electoral vote popular vote percent of popular vote lyndon b johnson democrat 43 121 085 61 1 barry m goldwater republican 27 145 161 38 5 candidate map 28 1 the presidential election of 1964 this map reveals how one sided was the victory of lyndon johnson over barry goldwater in 1964.
except for arizona his home state goldwater won only five states in the deep south not of much immediate consolation to him but a sure indicator that the south was cutting its historic ties to the democratic party.
moreover although soundly rejected in 1964 goldwaters far right critique of big government laid the foundation for a republican resurgence in the 1980s.
elementary and secondary education act authorized 1 billion in federal funds for teacher training and other educational programs.
standing in his old texas schoolhouse johnson a former teacher said i believe no law i have signed or will ever sign means more to the future of america six months later johnson signed the higher education act providing federal scholarships for college students.
johnson also had the votes he needed to achieve some form of national health insurance.
that year he also won passage of two new programs medicare a health plan for the elderly funded by a surcharge on social security payroll taxes and medicaid a health plan for the poor paid for by general tax revenues and administered by the states.
the great societys agenda included environmental reform as well an expanded national park system improvement of the nations air and water protection for endangered species stronger land use planning and highway beautification.
hardly pausing for breath johnson oversaw the creation of the department of housing and urban development hud won funding for hundreds of thousands of units of public housing made new investments in urban rapid transit such as the new washington d c metro and the bay area rapid transit bart system in san francisco ushered new child safety and consumer protection laws through congress and helped create the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities to support the work of artists writers and scholars.
it even became possible at this moment of reform zeal to tackle the nations discriminatory immigration policy.
the immigration act of 1965 abandoned the quota system that favored northern europeans replacing it with numerical limits that did not discriminate among nations.
to promote family reunification the law also stipulated that close relatives of legal residents in the united states could be admitted outside the numerical limits an exception that especially benefitted asian and latin american immigrants.
since 1965 as a result immigrants from those regions have become increasingly visible in american society chapter 31.
assessing the great society the great society enjoyed mixed results.
the proportion of americans living below the poverty line dropped from 20 percent to 13 percent between 1963 and 1968 figure 28 1.
medicare and medicaid the most enduring of the great society programs helped millions of elderly and poor citizens afford necessary health care.
further as millions of african americans moved into the middle chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 table 28 1 major great society legislation civil rights twenty fourth amendment outlawed poll tax in federal elections civil rights act banned discrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of race religion sex or national origin voting rights act outlawed literacy tests for voting provided federal supervision of registration in historically low registration areas social welfare economic opportunity act created office of economic opportunity oeo to administer war on poverty programs such as head start job corps and volunteers in service to america vista medical care act provided medical care for the poor medicaid and the elderly medicare minimum wage act raised hourly minimum wage from 1 25 to 1 40 and expanded coverage to new groups education elementary and secondary education act granted federal aid for education of poor children national endowment for the arts and humanities provided federal funding and support for artists and scholars higher education act provided federal scholarships for postsecondary education housing and urban development urban mass transportation act provided federal aid to urban mass transit omnibus housing act provided federal funds for public housing and rent subsidies for low income families housing and urban development act created department of housing and urban development hud metropolitan area redevelopment and demonstration cities acts designated 150 model cities for combined programs of public housing social services and job training environment wilderness preservation act designated 9 1 million acres of federal lands as wilderness areas barring future roads buildings or commercial use air and water quality acts set tougher air quality standards required states to enforce water quality standards for interstate waters miscellaneous tax reduction act reduced personal and corporate income tax rates immigration act abandoned national quotas of 1924 law allowing more noneuropean immigration appalachian regional and development act provided federal funding for roads health clinics and other public works projects in economically depressed regions part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 percentage poverty rate 1959 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 year 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99 figure 28 1 americans in poverty 1959 2000 between 1959 and 1973 the poverty rate among american families dropped by more than half from 23 percent to 11 percent.
there was however sharp disagreement about the reasons for that notable decline.
liberals credited the war on poverty while conservatives favored the high performing economy with the significant poverty dip of 1965 1966 caused by military spending not johnsons domestic programs.
class the black poverty rate fell by half.
liberals believed they were on the right track.
what new roles did the conservatives however gave federal government more credit for these changes to assume under great socithe decades booming economy ety initiatives and how did than to government programs.
they extend the new deal indeed conservative critics tradition.
accused johnson and other liberals of believing that every social problem could be solved with a government program.
in the final analysis the great society dramatically improved the financial situation of the elderly reached millions of children and increased the racial diversity of american society and workplaces.
however entrenched poverty remained racial segregation in the largest cities worsened and the national distribution of wealth remained highly skewed.
in relative terms the bottom 20 percent remained as far behind as ever.
in these arenas the great society made little progress.
place events in context rebirth of the womens movement the new era of liberal reform reawakened the american womens movement.
inspired by the civil rights movement and legislative advances under the great society but frustrated by the lack of attention both gave to women feminists entered the political fray and demanded not simply inclusion but a rethinking of national priorities.
labor feminists the womens movement had not languished entirely in the postwar years.
feminist concerns were kept alive in the 1950s and early 1960s by working women who campaigned for such things as maternity leave and equal pay for equal work.
one historian has called these women labor feminists because they belonged to unions and fought for equality and dignity in the workplace.
it became apparent to me why so many employers could legally discriminate against women because it was written right into the law said one female labor activist.
trade union women were especially critical in pushing for and winning congressional passage of the 1963 equal pay act which established the principle of equal pay for equal work.
labor feminists were responding to the times.
more women including married women 40 percent by 1970 and mothers with young children 30 percent by 1970 were working outside the home than ever before.
but they faced a labor market that undervalued their contributions.
moreover most working women faced the double day they were expected to earn a paycheck and then return home to domestic labor.
one woman put the problem succinctly the working mother has no wife to care for her children betty friedan and the national organization for women when betty friedans indictment of suburban domesticity the feminine mystique appeared in 1963 it targeted a different audience college educated chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 middle class women who found themselves not working for wages but rather stifled by their domestic routine.
tens of thousands of women read friedans book and thought shes talking about me the feminine mystique became a runaway best seller.
friedan persuaded middle class women that they needed more than the convenience foods improved diapers and better laundry detergents that magazines and television urged them to buy.
to live rich and fulfilling lives they needed education and work outside the home.
paradoxically the domesticity described in the feminine mystique was already crumbling.
after the postwar baby boom women were again having fewer children aided now by the birth control pill first marketed in 1960.
and as states liberalized divorce laws more women were divorcing.
educational levels were also rising by 1970 women made up 42 percent of the college population.
all of these changes undermined traditional gender roles and enabled many women to embrace the feminine mystiques liberating prescriptions.
government action also made a difference.
in 1961 kennedy appointed the presidential commission on the status of women which issued a 1963 report documenting job and educational discrimination.
a bigger breakthrough came when congress added the word sex to the categories protected against discrimination national organization for women kathryn f clarenbach left and betty friedan right announced a bill of rights for women in 1968 to be presented to candidates in that election year.
clarenbach was the first chairwoman of the national organization for women now and friedan the organizations first president.
now became a fixture of the womens movement and the leading liberal voice for womens legal and social equality.

in the civil rights act of 1964.
identify causes women suddenly had a power what factors accounted ful legal tool for fighting sex for the resurgence of femidiscrimination.
nism in the 1960s.
to force compliance with the new act friedan and others including many labor feminists from around the country founded the national organization for women now in 1966.
modeled on the naacp now intended to be a civil rights organization for women with the aim of bringing women into full participation in.
american society now exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men under friedans leadership membership grew to fifteen thousand by 1971 and now became like the naacp a powerful voice for equal rights.
one of the ironies of the 1960s was the enormous strain that all of this liberal activism placed on the new deal coalition.
faced with often competing demands from the civil rights movement feminists the poor labor unions conservative southern democrats the suburban middle class and urban political machines the old rooseveltian coalition had begun to fray.
johnson hoped that the new deal coalition was strong enough to negotiate competing demands among its own constituents while simultaneously resisting conservative attacks.
in 1965 that still seemed possible.
it would not remain so for long.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 enough to repel the south vietnam national liberation front nlf or vietcong.
but when diem was overthrown on november 1 the south vietnamese generals went further than kennedys team had anticipated and assassinated both diem and his brother.
this made the coup look less like an organic uprising and more like an american plot.
south vietnam fell into a period of chaos marked by several coups and defined by the increasing ungovernability of both the cities and countryside.
kennedy himself was assassinated in late november and would not live to see the grim results of diems murder american engagement in a long and costly civil conflict in the name of fighting communism.
the vietnam war begins as the accelerating rights revolution placed strain on the democratic coalition the war in vietnam divided the country.
in a cbs interview before his death kennedy remarked that it was up to the south vietnamese whether their war would be won or lost.
but the young president had already placed the united states on a course that would make retreat difficult.
like other presidents kennedy believed that giving up in vietnam would weaken americas credibility withdrawal would be a great mistake he said.
it is impossible to know how jfk would have managed vietnam had he lived.
what is known is that in the fall of 1963 kennedy had lost patience with ngo dinh diem the dictatorial head of south vietnam whom the united states had supported since 1955.
the president let it be known in saigon that the united states would support a military coup.
kennedys hope was that if diem reviled throughout the south because of his brutal repression of political opponents could be replaced by a popular general or other military figure a stable government would emerge one strong escalation under johnson just as kennedy had inherited vietnam from eisenhower so lyndon johnson inherited vietnam from kennedy.
johnsons inheritance was more burdensome however for by now only massive american intervention could prevent the collapse of south vietnam map 28 2.
johnson like kennedy was a subscriber to the cold war tenets of global containment.

in january 1968 vietcong forces launched the tet offensive a surprise attack on cities and provincial centers across south vietnam.
although the attackers were pushed back with heavy losses the tet offensive revealed the futility of american efforts to suppress the vietcong guerrillas and marked a turning point in the war.

gulf of tonkin it did not take long for johnson to place his stamp on the war.
during the summer of 1964 the president got reports that north vietnamese torpedo boats had fired on the u s destroyer maddox in the gulf of tonkin.
in the first attack on august 2 the damage inflicted was limited to a single bullet hole a second attack on august 4 later proved to be only misread radar sightings.
to johnson it didnt matter if the attack was real or imagined the president believed a wider war was inevitable and issued a call to arms sending his national approval rating from 42 to 72 percent.
in the entire congress only two senators voted against his request for authorization to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the united states and to prevent further aggression the gulf of tonkin resolution as it became known gave johnson the freedom to conduct operations in vietnam as he saw fit.
despite his congressional mandate johnson was initially cautious about revealing his plans to the american people.
i had no choice but to keep my foreign policy in the wings.
johnson later said.
i knew that the day it exploded into a major debate on the war that day would be the beginning of the end of the great society so he ran in 1964 on the pledge that there would be no escalation no american boys fighting vietnams fight.
privately he doubted the pledge could be kept.

by 1966 more than 380 000 american soldiers were stationed in vietnam by 1967 485 000 and by 1968 536 000 figure 28 2.
the escalating demands of general william westmoreland the commander of u s forces and robert mcnamara the secretary of defense pushed johnson to americanize the ground war in an attempt to stabilize south vietnam.
i cant run and pull a chamberlain at munich johnson privately told a reporter in early march 1965 referring to the british prime minister who had appeased hitler in 1938.
meanwhile johnson authorized operation rolling thunder a massive bombing campaign against north vietnam in 1965.
over the entire course of the war the united states dropped twice as many tons of bombs on vietnam as the allies had dropped in both europe and the pacific during the whole of world war ii.
to mcnamaras surprise the bombing had little effect on the vietcongs ability to wage war in the south.
the north vietnamese quickly rebuilt roads and bridges and moved munitions plants underground.
instead of destroying the morale of the north vietnamese operation rolling thunder hardened their will to fight.
the massive commitment of troops and air power devastated vietnams countryside however.

donald whitfield george olsen donald l whitfield was a draftee from alabama who was interviewed some years after the war.
george olsen served in vietnam from august 1969 to march 1970 when he was killed in action.
he wrote this letter to a close female friend.
im gonna be honest with you.
i had heard some about vietnam in 1968 but i was a poor fellow and i didnt keep up with it.
i was working at a standard oil station making eight dollars a day.
i pumped gas and tinkered a little with cars.
i had a girl i saw every now and then but i still spent most of my time with a car.
when i got my letter from the draft lady i appealed it on the reason it was just me and my sister at home.
we were a poor family and they needed me at home but it did no good.
my company did a lot of patrolling.
we got the roughest damn deal.
shit i thought i was going to get killed every night.
i was terrified the whole time.
we didnt have no trouble with the blacks.
i saw movies that said we done the blacks wrong but it wasnt like that where i was.
lets put it like this they make pretty good soldiers but theyre not what we are.
white americans cant nobody whip our ass.
were the baddest son of a bitches on the face of this earth.
you can take a hundred russians and twentyfive americans and well whip their ass.
i fly the rebel flag because this is the south bubba.
the american flag represents the whole fifty states.
that flag represents the southern part.
im a confederate im a southerner.
i feel cheated about vietnam i sure do.
political restrictions we won every goddamned battle we was in but didnt win the whole goddamn little country.
before i die the democratic controlled congress of this country and i blame it on em they gonna goddamn apologize to the vietnam veterans.

31 aug 69 dear red last monday i went on my first hunter killer operation.
the frightening thing about it all is that it is so very easy to kill in war.
theres no remorse no theatrical washing of the hands to get rid of nonexistent blood not even any regrets.
when it happens you are more afraid than youve ever been in your life my hands shook so much i had trouble reloading.
youre scared really scared and theres no thinking about it.
you kill because that little sob is doing his best to kill you and you desperately want to live to go home to get drunk or walk down the street on a date again.
and suddenly the grenades arent going off any more the weapons stop and unbelievably fast it seems its all over.
i have truly come to envy the honest pacifist who honestly believes that no killing is permissible and can with a clear conscience stay home and not take part in these conflicts.
i wish i could do the same but i cant see letting another take my place and my risks over here.
the only reason pacifists such as the amish can even live in an orderly society is because someone be they police or soldiers is taking risks to keep the wolves away.
i guess thats why im over here why i fought so hard to come here and why even though im scared most of the time im content to be here.

arthur e woodley jr special forces ranger arthur e woodley jr gave this interview a decade after his return.
you had to fight to survive where i grew up.
lower east baltimore.
it was a mixed up neighborhood of puerto ricans indians italians and blacks.
being that im lightskinned curly hair i wasnt readily accepted in the black community.
i was more accepted by puerto ricans and some rednecks.
they didnt ask what my race classification was.
i went with them to white movies white restaurants and so forth.
but after i got older i came to the realization that i was what i am and came to deal with my black peers.
i figured i was just what my country needed.
a black patriot who could do any physical job they could come up with.
six feet one hundred and ninety pounds and healthy.
i didnt ask no questions about the war.
i thought communism was spreading and as an american citizen it was my part to do as much as i could to defeat the communist from coming here.
whatever america states is correct was the tradition that i was brought up in.
and i thought the only way i could possibly make it out of the ghetto was to be the best soldier i possibly could.
then came the second week of february of 69.
we recon this area and we came across this fella a white guy who was staked to the ground.
his arms and legs tied down to stakes.
he had numerous scars on his face where he might have been beaten and mutilated.
and he had been peeled from his upper part of chest to down to his waist.
like they slit your skin with a knife.
and they take a pair of pliers or a instrument similar and they just peel the skin off your body and expose it to the elements.
and he start to cryin beggin to die.
he said i cant go back like this.
i cant live like this.
you cant leave me here like this dying.
it took me somewhere close to 20 minutes to get my mind together.
not because i was squeamish about killing someone because i had at that time numerous body counts.
killing someone wasnt the issue.
it was killing another american citizen another gi.
we buried him.
we buried him.
then i cried.
when we first started going into the fields i would not wear a finger ear or mutilate another persons body.
until i had the misfortune to come upon those american soldiers who were castrated.
then it got to be a game between the communists and ourselves to see how many fingers and ears that we could capture from each other.
after a kill we would cut his finger or ear off as a trophy stuff our unit patch in his mouth and let him die.
with 89 days left in country i came out of the field.
what i now felt was emptiness.
i started seeing the atrocities that we caused each other as human beings.
i came to the realization that i was committing crimes against humanity and myself.
that i really didnt believe in these things i was doin.
gayle smith gayle smith was a nurse in a surgical unit in vietnam in 1970 1971 and gave this interview a few years later.
i objected to the war and i got the idea into my head of going there to bring people back.
i started thinking about it in 1966 and knew that i would eventually go when i felt i was prepared enough.
boy i remember how they came in all torn up.
it was incredible.
the first time a medevac came in i got right into it.
i didnt have a lot of feeling at that time.
it was later on that i began to have a lot of feeling about it after id seen it over and over and over again.
i turned that pain into anger and hatred and placed it onto the vietnamese.
i did not consider the vietnamese to be people.
they were human but they werent people.
they werent like us so it was okay to kill them.
it was okay to hate them.
i would have dreams about putting a 45 to someones head and see it blow away over and over again.
and for a long time i swore that if the vietnamese ever came to this country id kill them.
it was in a vietnam veterans group that i realized that all my hatred for the vietnamese and my wanting to kill them was really a reflection of all the pain that i had felt for seeing all those young men die and hurt.
i would stand there and look at them and think to myself youve just lost your leg for no reason at all or youre going to die and its for nothing for nothing.
i would never never say that to them but they knew it.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the town in order to save it a statement that came to symbolize the terrible logic of the war.
the johnson administration gambled that american superiority in personnel and weaponry would ultimately triumph.
this strategy was inextricably tied to political considerations.
for domestic reasons policymakers searched for an elusive middle ground between all out invasion of north vietnam which included the possibility of war with china and disengagement.
in effect we are fighting a war of attrition said general westmoreland.
the only alternative is a war of annihilation public opinion and the war johnson gradually grew more confident that his vietnam policy had the support of the american people.
both democrats and republicans approved johnsons escalation in vietnam and so did public opinion polls in 1965 and 1966.
but then opinion began to shift thinking like a historian p 916.
every night americans saw the carnage of war on their television screens including images of dead and wounded americans.
one such incident occurred in the first months of fighting in 1965.
television reporter morley safer witnessed a marine unit burning the village of cam ne to the ground.
todays operation is the frustration of vietnam in miniature safer explained.
america can win a military victory here but to a vietnamese peasant whose home is destroyed it will take more than presidential promises to convince him that we are on his side with such firsthand knowledge of the war journalists began to write about a credibility gap the johnson administration they charged was concealing bad news about the wars progress.
in february 1966 television coverage of hearings by the senate foreign relations committee chaired by j william fulbright an outspoken critic of the war raised further questions about the administrations policy.
johnson complained to his staff in 1966 that our people cant stand firm in the face of heavy losses and they can bring down the government economic problems put johnson even more on the defensive.
the vietnam war cost taxpayers 27 billion in 1967 pushing the federal deficit from 9 8 billion to 23 billion.
by then military spending had set in motion the inflationary spiral that would plague the u s economy throughout the 1970s.
out of these troubling developments an antiwar movement began to crystallize.
its core in addition to long standing pacifist groups comprised a new generation of peace activists such as sane the national committee for a sane nuclear policy which in the 1950s had protested atmospheric nuclear testing.
after the escalation in 1965 the activist groups were joined by students clergy civil rights advocates and even dr benjamin spock whose book on child care had helped raise many of the younger activists.
despite their diversity these opponents of the war shared a skepticism about u s policy in vietnam.
they charged variously that intervention was antithetical to american ideals that an independent anticommunist south vietnam was unattainable and that no american objective justified the suffering that was being inflicted on the vietnamese people.
rise of the student movement college students many of them inspired by the civil rights movement had begun to organize and agitate for social change.
in ann arbor michigan they founded students for a democratic society sds in 1960.
two years later forty students from big ten and ivy league universities held the first national sds convention in port huron michigan.
tom hayden penned a manifesto the port huron statement expressing students disillusionment with the nations consumer culture and the gulf between rich and poor.
we are people of this generation hayden wrote bred in at least modest comfort housed now in universities looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit these students rejected cold war foreign policy including the war in vietnam.
the new left the founders of sds referred to their movement as the new left to distinguish themselves from the old left communists and socialists of the 1930s and 1940s.
as new left influence spread it hit major university towns first places such as madison wisconsin and berkeley california.
one of the first major demonstrations erupted in the fall of 1964 at the university of california at berkeley after administrators banned student political activity on university grounds.
in protest student organizations formed the free speech movement and organized a sit in at the administration building.
some students had just returned from freedom summer in mississippi radicalized by their experience.
mario savio spoke for many when he compared the conflict in berkeley to the civil rights struggle in the south the same rights are at stake in both places the right to participate as citizens in a democratic society and to struggle against the same enemy emboldened by the berkeley movement students across the nation were soon protesting their chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 free speech at berkeley 1964 students at the university of californias berkeley campus protested the administrations decision to ban political activity in the school plaza.
free speech demonstrators many of them active in the civil rights movement relied on the tactics and arguments that they learned during that struggle.
dr jim jumblatt free speech movement archive.
universities academic policies and then more passionately the vietnam war.
one spur to student protest was the militarys selective service system which in 1967 abolished automatic student deferments.
to avoid the draft some young men enlisted in the national guard or applied for conscientious objector status others avoided the draft by leaving the country most often for canada or sweden.
in public demonstrations opponents of the war burned their draft cards picketed induction centers and on a few occasions broke into selective service offices and destroyed records.
antiwar demonstrators numbered in the tens or at most hundreds of thousands a small fraction of american youth but they were vocal visible and determined.
students were on the front lines as the campaign against the war escalated.
the 1967 mobilization to end the war brought 100 000 protesters into the streets of san francisco while more than a quarter million followed martin luther king jr from central park to the united nations in new york.
another 100 000 marched on the pentagon.
president johnson absorbed the blows and counterpunched the enemys hope for victory.
is in our division our weariness our uncertainty he proclaimed but it had become clear that johnsons war as many began calling it was no longer uniting the country.
young americans for freedom the new left was not the only political force on college campuses.
conservative students were less noisy but more numerous.
for them the 1960s was not about protesting the war staging student strikes and idolizing black power.
inspired compare and by the group young americans contrast contrast the political views for freedom yaf conservative of the sds the yaf and students asserted their faith in the counterculture.
how god given free will and their would you explain the fear that the federal government differences.
accumulates power which tends thinking like a historian debating the war in vietnam the war in vietnam divided americans and ultimately divided world opinion.
a product of the cold war policy of containment the war led many to question the application of that policy to southeast asia.
yet every american president from truman to nixon believed that opposing the unification of vietnam under communist rule was essential.
historians continue to research and debate what led to the war and what effects the war had on both vietnam and the united states.
the following documents help us to consider different views of the war.
president dwight eisenhowers domino theory speech april 7 1954.
president lyndon johnson johns hopkins university speech april 7 1965.
finally you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the falling domino principle.
you have a row of dominoes set up you knock over the first one and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly.
so you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.

over the past hundred years the vietnamese people repeatedly rose up to fight against foreign aggression for the independence and freedom of their fatherland.
in 1945 the people throughout the country surged up in an armed uprising overthrew the japanese and french domination and seized power.
however the american imperialists who had in the past helped the french colonialists to massacre our people have now replaced the french in enslaving the southern part of our country through a disguised colonial regime.
they have been using their stooge the ngo dinh diem administration in their downright repression and exploitation of our compatriots in their maneuvers to permanently divide our country and to turn its southern part into a base in preparation for war in southeast asia.
james fallows what did you do in the class war daddy washington monthly october 1975.
the journalist fallows highlighted the economic unfairness of the vietnam era draft.
the children of the bright good parents were spared the more immediate sort of suffering that our inferiors were undergoing.
and because of that when our parents were opposed to the war they were opposed in a bloodless theoretical fashion as they might be opposed to political corruption or racism in south africa.
as long as the little gold stars sent to parents whose son was killed in war kept going to homes in chelsea a working class part of boston and the backwoods of west virginia the mothers of beverly hills and chevy chase and great neck and belmont all affluent suburbs were not on the telephone to their congressman screaming you killed my boy.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 to diminish order and liberty the yaf the largest student political organization in the country defended free enterprise and supported the war in vietnam.
its founding principles were outlined in the sharon statement drafted in sharon connecticut two years before the port huron statement and inspired young conservatives many of whom would play important roles in the reagan administration in the 1980s.
the counterculture while the new left organized against the political and economic system and the yaf defended it many other young americans embarked on a general revolt against authority and middle class respectability.
the hippie identified by ragged blue jeans or army fatigues tie dyed t shirts beads and long unkempt hair symbolized the new counterculture.
with roots in the 1950s beat culture of new yorks greenwich village and san franciscos north beach the 1960s counterculture initially turned to folk music for its inspiration.
pete seeger set the tone for the eras idealism with songs such as the 1961 antiwar ballad where have all the flowers gone in 1963 the year of the civil rights demonstrations in birmingham and president kennedys assassination bob dylans blowin in the wind reflected the impatience of people whose faith in america was wearing thin.
joan baez emerged alongside dylan and pioneered a folk sound that inspired a generation of female musicians.
by the mid 1960s other winds of change in popular music came from the beatles four working class brits whose awe inspiring music by turns lyrical and driving spawned a commercial and cultural phenomenon known as beatlemania.
american youths embrace of the beatles as well as even more rebellious bands such as the rolling stones the who and the doors deepened the generational divide between young people and their elders.
so did the recreational the counterculture the three day outdoor woodstock concert in august 1969 was a defining moment in the rise of the counterculture.
the event attracted 400 000 young people like those pictured here to bethel new york for a weekend of music drugs and sex.
the counterculture was distinct from the new left and was less a political movement than a shifting set of cultural styles attitudes and practices.
it rejected conformity of all kinds and placed rebellion and contrariness among its highest values.
another concept held dear by the counterculture was simply love in an era of military violence abroad and police violence at home many in the counterculture hoped that peace and love would prevail instead.

days of rage 1968 1972 by 1968 a sense of crisis gripped the country.
riots in the cities campus unrest and a nose thumbing counterculture escalated into a general youth rebellion that seemed on the verge of tearing america apart.
calling 1968 the watershed year for a generation sds founder tom hayden wrote that it started with legendary events then raised hopes only to end by immersing innocence in tragedy it was perhaps the most shocking year in all the postwar decades.
violent clashes both in vietnam and back home in the united states combined with political assassinations to produce a palpable sense of despair and hopelessness america compared p 920.
war abroad tragedy at home president johnson had gambled in 1965 on a quick victory in vietnam before the political cost of escalation came due.
but there was no quick victory.
north vietnamese and vietcong forces fought on the south vietnamese government repeatedly collapsed and american casualties mounted.
by early 1968 the death rate of u s troops had reached several hundred a week.
johnson and his generals kept insisting that there was light at the end of the tunnel facts on the ground showed otherwise.
the tet offensive on january 30 1968 the vietcong unleashed a massive well coordinated assault in south vietnam.
timed to coincide with tet the vietnamese new year the offensive struck thirty six provincial capitals and five of the trace change six major cities including saigon over time where the vietcong nearly over what changed between ran the u s embassy.
in strictly 1965 and 1968 and how military terms the tet offensive did these developments was a failure with very heavy affect national political vietcong losses.
but psychologi life.
cally the effect was devastating.
television brought into american homes shocking live images the american embassy under siege and the saigon police chief placing a pistol to the head of a vietcong suspect and executing him.
the tet offensive made a mockery of official pronouncements that the united states was winning the war.
how could an enemy on the run manage such a large scale complex and coordinated attack.
just before tet a gallup poll found that 56 percent of americans considered themselves hawks supporters of the war while only 28 percent identified with the doves war opponents.
three months later doves outnumbered hawks 42 to 41 percent.
without embracing the peace movement many americans simply concluded that the war was unwinnable.
the tet offensive undermined johnson and discredited his war policies.
when the 1968 presidential primary season got under way in march antiwar senators eugene mccarthy of minnesota and robert kennedy of new york jfks brother challenged johnson for the democratic nomination.
discouraged perhaps even physically exhausted on march 31 johnson stunned the nation by announcing that he would not seek reelection.
political assassinations americans had barely adjusted to the news that a sitting president would not stand for reelection when on april 4 james earl ray shot and killed martin luther king jr in memphis.
riots erupted in more than a hundred cities.
the worst of them in baltimore chicago and washington d c left dozens dead and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damaged or destroyed.
the violence on the streets of saigon had found an eerie parallel on the streets of the united states.
one city that did not erupt was indianapolis.
there robert kennedy in town campaigning in the indiana primary gave a quiet somber speech to the black community on the night of kings assassination.
americans could continue to move toward greater polarization kennedy said black people amongst blacks white amongst whites or we can replace that violence.
with an effort to understand compassion and love kennedy sympathized with african america c o m pa r e d the global protests of 1968 nineteen sixty eight was a year of youthful protest political unrest and violence across the globe.
the year of massive antiwar protests at the democratic national convention in chicago as well as the assassinations of martin luther king jr and robert kennedy saw equal or greater turmoil around the world.

but two months later having emerged as the frontrunner for the democratic presidential nomination kennedy too would be gone.

amid the national mourning for yet another political murder one newspaper columnist declared that the country does not work anymore newsweek asked has violence become a way of life kennedys assassination was a calamity for the democratic party because only he had seemed able to surmount the partys fissures over vietnam.
in the space of eight weeks american liberals had lost two of their most important national figures king and kennedy.
a third johnson was unpopular and politically damaged.
without these unifying leaders the crisis of liberalism had become unmanageable.
the antiwar movement and the 1968 election before their deaths martin luther king jr and robert kennedy had spoken eloquently against the vietnam war.
to antiwar activists however bold speeches and marches had not produced the desired effect.
we are no longer interested in merely protesting the war declared one.
we are out to stop it they sought nothing short of an immediate american withdrawal.
their anger at johnson and the democratic party fueled by news of the tet offensive the murders of king and kennedy and the general youth rebellion had radicalized the movement.
democratic convention in august at the 1968 democratic national convention in chicago the political divisions generated by the war consumed the party.
thousands of protesters descended on the city.
the most visible group led by jerry rubin and abbie hoffman a remarkable pair of troublemakers claimed to represent the youth international party.
to mock those inside the convention hall these yippies nominated a pig pigasus for president.
the yippies stunts were geared toward maximum media exposure.
but a far larger and more serious group of activists had come to chicago to demonstrate against the war as well and they staged what many came to call the siege of chicago.
democratic mayor richard j daley ordered the police to break up the demonstrations.
several nights of skirmishes between protesters and police culminated on the evening of the nominations.
in what an official report later described as a police riot police officers attacked protesters with tear gas and clubs.
as the nominating speeches proceeded television networks broadcast scenes of the riot cementing a popular impression of the democrats as the party of disorder.

richard nixon on the republican side richard nixon had engineered a remarkable political comeback.
after losing the presidential campaign in 1960 and the california gubernatorial race in 1962 he won the republican presidential nomination in 1968.
sensing democratic weakness nixon and his advisors believed there were two groups of voters ready to switch sides northern working class voters and southern whites.
tired of the antiwar movement the counterculture and urban riots northern blue collar voters especially catholics had drifted away from the democratic party.
growing up in the great depression these families were admirers of fdr and perhaps even had his picture on their living room wall.
but times had changed over three decades.
to show how much they had changed the social scientists ben j wattenberg and richard scammon profiled blue collar workers in their study the real majority 1970.
wattenberg and scammon asked their readers to consider people such as a fortyseven year old machinists wife from dayton ohio she is afraid to walk the streets understand alone at night.
she has a mixed points of view view about blacks and civil rights why might a democratic moreover they wrote she is supporter of fdr in the deeply distressed that her son is 1940s have decided to vote going to a community junior colfor republican richard lege where lsd was found on camnixon in 1968.
pus such northern blue collar families were once reliable democratic voters but their political loyalties were increasingly up for grabs a fact republicans knew well.
george wallace working class anxieties over student protests and urban riots were first exploited by the controversial governor of alabama george c wallace.
running in 1968 as a third party presidential candidate wallace traded on his fame as a segregationist governor.
he had tried to stop the federal government from desegregating the university of alabama in 1963 and he was equally obstructive during the selma crisis of 1965.
appealing to whites in both the north and the south wallace called for law and order and claimed that mothers on public assistance were thanks to johnsons great society breeding children as a cash crop wallaces hope was that by carrying the south he could deny a major candidate an electoral majority and force the election into the house of representatives.
that strategy failed as wallace finished with just 13 5 percent of the popular vote.
but he had defined hot button issues liberal elitism welfare policies and law and order that became hallmarks for the next generation of mainstream conservatives.
nixons strategy nixon offered a subtler version of wallaces populism in a two pronged approach to the campaign.
he adopted what his advisors called the southern strategy which aimed at attracting southern white voters still smarting over the civil rights gains by george wallace george wallace had become famous as the segregationist governor who stood in the schoolhouse door to prevent black students from enrolling at the university of alabama in 1963 though after being confronted by federal marshals he stepped aside.
in 1968 he campaigned for the democratic presidential nomination on a populist law and order platform that appealed to many blue collar voters concerned about antiwar protests urban riots and the rise of the counterculture.

nixon won over the key southerner democrat turned republican senator strom thurmond of south carolina the 1948 dixiecrat presidential nominee.

he also campaigned against the antiwar movement urban riots and protests calling for a strict adherence to law and order he pledged to represent the quiet voice of the great majority of americans the forgotten americans the nonshouters the nondemonstrators here nixon was speaking not just to the south but to the many millions of suburban voters across the country who worried that social disorder had gripped the nation.
these strategies southern and suburban worked.
nixon received 43 4 percent of the vote to humphreys 42 7 percent defeating him by a scant 500 000 votes out of the 73 million that were cast map 28 3.
but the numerical closeness of the race could not disguise the devastating blow to the democrats.
humphrey received almost 12 million fewer votes than johnson had in 1964.
the white south largely abandoned the democratic party an exodus that would accelerate in the 1970s.
in the north nixon and wallace made significant inroads among traditionally democratic voters.
new deal democrats lost the unity of purpose that had served them for thirty years.
a nation exhausted by months of turmoil and violence had chosen a new direction.
nixons victory in 1968 foreshadowed and helped propel a national electoral realignment in the coming decade.
the nationalist turn vietnam and the increasingly radical youth rebellion intersected with the turn toward racial and ethnic nationalism by young african american and chicano activists.
as we saw in chapter 27 the black power and chicano movements broke with the liberal rights politics of an older generation of leaders.
these new activists expressed fury at the poverty and white racism that were beyond the reach of civil rights laws they also saw vietnam as an unjust war against other people of color.
in this spirit the chicano moratorium committee organized demonstrations against the war.

governor george wallace of alabama who left the democrats to run as a third party candidate campaigned on the backlash against the civil rights movement.
as late as mid september wallace held the support of 21 percent of the voters.
but in november he received only 13 5 percent of the vote winning five southern states.
republican richard m nixon who like wallace emphasized law and order in his campaign defeated hubert h humphrey with only 43 4 percent of the popular vote but it was now clear given that wallaces southern support would otherwise have gone to nixon that the south had shifted decisively to the republican side.

womens liberation among women 1968 also marked a break with the past.
the late 1960s spawned a new brand of feminism womens liberation.
these feminists were primarily younger college educated women fresh from the new left antiwar and civil rights movements.
those movements male leaders they discovered considered women little more than pretty helpers who typed memos and fetched coffee.
women who tried to raise feminist issues at civil rights and antiwar events were shouted off the platform with jeers such as move on little girl we have more important issues to talk about here than womens compare and liberation contrast fed up with second class stahow did womens liberation after 1968 differ from tus and well versed in the tactics the womens movement of of organization and protest the early 1960s.
women radicals broke away and organized on their own.
unlike the national organization for women now the womens liberation movement was loosely structured comprising an alliance of collectives in new york san francisco boston and other big cities and college towns.
womens lib as it was dubbed by a skeptical media went public in 1968 at the miss america pageant.
demonstrators carried posters of womens bodies labeled as slabs of beef implying that society treated them as meat.
mirroring the identity politics of black power activists and the self dramatization of the counterculture womens liberation sought an end to the denigration and exploitation of women.
sisterhood is powerful read one womens liberationist manifesto.
the national womens strike for equality in august 1970 brought hundreds of thousands of women into the streets of the nations cities for marches and demonstrations.
by that year new terms such as sexism and male chauvinism had become part of the national vocabulary.
as converts flooded in the two branches of the womens movement began to converge.
radical women realized that key feminist goals child care equal pay and reproduction rights could best be achieved in the political arena.
at the same time more traditional activists exemplified by betty friedan developed a broader view of womens oppression.
they came to understand that women required more than equal opportunity the culture that regarded women as nothing more than sexual objects and helpmates to men had to change as well.
although still largely white and middle class feminists began to think of themselves as part of a broad social crusade.
sisterhood did not unite all women however.
rather than joining white led womens liberation organizations african american and latina women continued to work within the larger framework of the civil rights movement.
new groups such as the combahee river collective and the national black feminist organization arose to speak for the concerns of african american women.
they criticized sexism but were reluctant to break completely with black men and the chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 ms magazine cofounded by the feminist gloria steinem ms magazine made its initial appearance in 1972.
steinem and her cofounders believed that american women needed an explicitly feminist magazine distinct from the slew of available female focused lifestyle magazines such as mccalls and redbook.
ms would take on crucial but neglected issues relevant to women reproductive rights child care employment and educational equality sexual harassment and marriage and relations between men and women.
inspired by womens liberation ms has remained an important forum for feminist opinion and debate down to the present.

chicana feminists came from catholic backgrounds in which motherhood and family were held in high regard.
we want to walk hand in hand with the chicano brothers with our children our viejitos elders our familia de la raza one chicana feminist wrote.
black and chicana feminists embraced the larger movement for womens rights but carried on their own struggles to address specific needs in their communities.
one of the most important contributions of womens liberation was to raise awareness about what feminist kate millett called sexual politics.
liberationists argued that unless women had control over their own bodies they could not freely shape their destinies.
they campaigned for reproductive rights especially access to abortion and railed against a culture that blamed women in cases of sexual assault and turned a blind eye to sexual harassment in the workplace.
meanwhile womens opportunities expanded dramatically in higher education.
dozens of formerly allmale bastions such as yale princeton and the u s military academies admitted women undergraduates for the first time.
colleges started womens studies programs which eventually numbered in the hundreds and the proportion of women attending graduate and professional schools rose markedly.
with the adoption of title ix in 1972 congress broadened the 1964 civil rights act to include educational institutions prohibiting colleges and universities that received federal funds from discriminating on the basis of sex.
by requiring comparable funding for sports programs title ix made womens athletics a real presence on college campuses.
women also became increasingly visible in public life.
congresswomen bella abzug and shirley chisholm joined betty friedan and gloria steinem the founder of ms magazine to create the national womens political caucus in 1971.
abzug and chisholm both from new york joined congresswomen patsy mink from hawaii and martha griffiths from michigan to sponsor equal rights legislation.
congress authorized childcare tax deductions for working parents in 1972 and in 1974 passed the equal credit opportunity act which enabled married women to get credit including credit cards and mortgages in their own names.
antiwar activists black and chicano nationalists and womens liberationists had each challenged the cold war liberalism of the democratic party.
in doing so they helped build on the rights liberalism forged first by the african american led civil rights movement.
but they also created rifts among competing parts of the former liberal consensus.
many catholics for instance opposed abortion rights and other freedoms sought by womens liberationists.
still other democrats many of them blue collar trade unionists believed that antiwar protesters were unpatriotic and that supporting ones government in time of war was a citizens duty.
the antiwar movement and the evolving rights liberalism of the sixties had made the old democratic coalition increasingly unworkable.
stonewall and gay liberation the liberationist impulse transformed the gay rights movement as well.
homophile activists in the 1960s chapter 26 had pursued rights by protesting but they adopted the respectable dress and behavior they knew part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 rights.
a gay newspaper in new york bore the title come out.
the new gay liberation found multiple expressions in major cities across the country but a defining event occurred in new yorks greenwich village.
police had raided gay bars for decades making arrests publicizing the names of patrons and harassing customers simply for being gay.
when a local gay bar called the stonewall inn was raided by police in the summer of 1969 however its patrons rioted for two days burning the bar and battling with police in the narrow streets of the village.
decades of police repression had taken their toll.
few commentators excused the violence and the stonewall riots were not repeated but activists celebrated them as a symbolic demand for full citizenship.
the gay liberation movement grew quickly after stonewall.
local gay and lesbian organizations proliferated and activists began pushing for nondiscrimination ordinances and consensual sex laws at the state level.
by 1975 the national gay task force and other national organizations lobbied congress served as media watchdogs and advanced suits in the courts.
despite all the activity progress was slow in most arenas of american life gays and lesbians did not enjoy the same legal protections and rights as other americans.
a lesbian and gay rights protest in greenwich village new york city 1970 building on the momentum of the black power and womens liberation movements of the late 1960s a gay liberation movement had emerged by the early 1970s.
its history was longer than most americans recognized dating to the homophile movement of the 1950s but the struggle for gay and lesbian rights and freedoms gained new adherents after the stonewall riots of 1969.
under the banner of coming out lesbian and gay americans refused to accept second class citizenship.

meanwhile the vast majority of gay men and lesbians remained in the closet so many were closeted because homosexuality was considered immoral and was even illegal in the vast majority of states sodomy statutes outlawed samesex relations and police used explain other morals laws to harass and consequences arrest gay men and lesbians.
in how did the antiwar the late 1960s however inspired movement womens by the black power and womens liberation and gay liberamovements gay activists increastion break with an earlier ingly demanded immediate and liberal politics.
unconditional recognition of their richard nixon and the politics of the silent majority vietnam abroad and the antiwar movement and the counterculture at home tore at the fabric of the democratic coalition and proved too difficult for lyndon johnson to navigate.
richard nixon in contrast showed himself adept at taking advantage of the nations unrest through carefully timed speeches and displays of moral outrage.
a centrist by nature and temperament nixon was not part of the conservative goldwater wing of the republican party.
though he was an ardent anticommunist like goldwater nixon also shared some of eisenhowers traits including a basic acceptance of governments role in economic matters.
nixon is thus most profitably viewed as a transitional figure a national politician who formed a bridge between the liberal postwar era and the much more conservative decades that followed the 1970s.
in late 1969 following a massive antiwar rally in washington president nixon gave a televised speech in which he referred to his supporters as the silent majority.
it was classic nixonian rhetoric.
in a single phrase he summed up a generational and cultural chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 struggle placing himself on the side of ordinary americans against the rabble rousers and troublemakers.
it was an oversimplification but the label silent majority stuck and nixon had defined a political phenomenon.
for the remainder of his presidency nixon cultivated the impression that he was the defender of a reasonable middle ground under assault from the radical left.
nixon in vietnam on the war in vietnam nixon picked up where johnson had left off.
cold war assumptions continued to dictate presidential policy.
abandoning vietnam nixon insisted would damage americas credibility and make the country seem a pitiful helpless giant nixon wanted peace but only peace with honor the north vietnamese were not about to oblige him.
the only outcome acceptable to them was a unified vietnam under their control.
vietnamization and cambodia to neutralize criticism at home nixon began delegating the ground fighting to the south vietnamese.
under this new policy of vietnamization american troop levels dropped from 543 000 in 1968 to 334 000 in 1971 to barely 24 000 by early 1973.
american casualties dropped correspondingly.
but the killing in vietnam continued.
as ellsworth bunker the u s ambassador to vietnam noted cynically it was just a matter of changing the color of the bodies far from abating however the antiwar movement intensified.
in november 1969 half a million demonstrators staged a huge protest in washington called the vietnam compare and moratorium.

my lai massacre meanwhile one of the worst atrocities of the war had become public.
in 1968 u s army troops had executed nearly five hundred people in the south vietnamese village of my lai including a large number of women and children.
the massacre was known only within the military until 1969 when journalist seymour hersh broke the story and photos of the massacre appeared in life magazine discrediting the united states around the world.
americans time observed must stand in the larger dock of guilt and human conscience although high ranking officers participated in the my lai massacre and its cover up only one soldier a low ranking second lieutenant named william calley was convicted.
believing that calley had been made a fall guy for official u s policies that inevitably brought death to innocent civilians a group called vietnam veterans against the war publicized other atrocities committed by u s troops.
in a controversial protest in 1971 they returned their combat medals at demonstrations outside the u s capitol literally hurling them onto the capitol steps.
heres my merit badge for murder one vet said.
supporters of the war called these veterans cowardly and un american but their heartfelt antiwar protest exposed the deep personal torment that vietnam had caused many soldiers.
dtente as protests continued at home nixon pursued two strategies to achieve his declared peace with honor one diplomatic and the other brutal.
first he chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 sought dtente a lessening of tensions with the soviet union and a new openness with china.
in a series of meetings between 1970 and 1972 nixon and soviet premier leonid brezhnev resolved tensions over cuba and berlin and signed the first strategic arms limitation treaty salt i the latter a symbolic step toward ending the cold war arms race.
heavily influenced by his national security advisor the harvard professor henry kissinger nixon believed that he could break the cold war impasse that had kept the united states from productive dialogue with the soviet union.
then in 1972 nixon visited china becoming the first sitting u s president to do so.
in a televised weeklong trip the president pledged better relations with china and declared that the two nations one capitalist the other communist could peacefully coexist.
this was the man who had risen to prominence in the 1950s by railing against the democrats for losing china and by hounding communists and fellow travelers.
indeed the presidents impeccable anticommunist credentials gave him the political cover to travel to beijing.
he remarked genially to mao those on the right can do what those on the left only talk about praised for his efforts to lessen cold war tensions nixon also had tactical objectives in mind.
he hoped that by befriending both the soviet union and china he could play one against the other and strike a better deal over vietnam at the ongoing peace talks in paris.
his second strategy however would prove less praiseworthy and cost more lives.
exit america in april 1972 in an attempt to strengthen his negotiating position nixon ordered b 52 bombing raids against north vietnam.
a month later he approved the mining of north vietnamese ports something johnson had never dared to do.
the north vietnamese were not isolated however supplies from china and the soviet union continued and the vietcong fought on.
with the 1972 presidential election approaching nixon sent kissinger back to the paris peace talks which had been initiated under johnson.
in a key concession kissinger accepted the presence of north vietnamese troops in south vietnam.
north vietnam then agreed to an interim arrangement whereby the south vietnamese government in saigon would stay in power while a special commission arranged a final settlement.
with kissingers announcement that peace is at hand nixon got the election lift he wanted but the agreement was then sabotaged by general nguyen van thieu the south vietnamese president.
so nixon in one final spasm of bloodletting unleashed the twoweek christmas bombing the most intense of the entire war.
on january 27 1973 the two sides signed the paris peace accords.
nixon hoped that with massive u s aid the thieu regime might survive.
but congress was in revolt.
it refused appropriations for bombing cambodia after august 15 1973 and gradually cut back aid to south vietnam.
in march 1975 north vietnamese forces launched a final offensive and on april 30 vietnam was reunited.
saigon the south vietnamese capital was renamed ho chi minh city after the founding father of the communist regime.
the collapse of south vietnam in 1975 produced a powerful and tragic historical irony an outcome little different from what would likely have resulted from the unification vote in 1954 chapter 25.
in other words americas most disastrous military adventure of the twentieth century barely altered the geopolitical realities in southeast asia.
the hanoi regime called itself communist but never intended to be a satellite of any country least of all china vietnams ancient enemy.
many paid a steep price for the vietnam war.
americas vietnamese friends lost jobs and property spent years in reeducation camps or had to flee the country.
millions of vietnamese had died in a decade of war which included some of the most intensive aerial bombing of the twentieth century.
in bordering cambodia the maniacal khmer rouge followers of cambodias ruling communist party took power and murdered 1 7 million people in bloody purges.
and in the united states more than 58 000 americans had sacrificed their lives and 300 000 had been wounded.
on top of the wars 150 billion price tag slow to heal internal wounds divided the country and americans increasingly lost confidence in their political leaders.
the silent majority speaks out nixon placed himself on the side of what he called the nonshouters the nondemonstrators but moderate and conservative americans increasingly spoke out.
they were not in the mood to simply remain silent.
during nixons first presidential term those opposed to the direction liberalism had taken since the early 1960s focused their discontent on what they believed were the excesses of the rights revolution the enormous changes in american law and society initiated by the civil rights movement and advanced by feminists and others thereafter.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the fall of saigon after the 1973 u s withdrawal from vietnam the south vietnamese government lasted another two years.
in march 1975 the north vietnamese forces launched a final offensive by april they had surrounded the capital saigon.
as seen here many vietnamese some of them associated with the fallen south vietnamese regime sought sanctuary at the u s embassy compound.
thousands of vietnamese and americans were evacuated before the last helicopter left the embassy on april 30.

law and order and the supreme court the rights revolution found an ally in an unexpected place the u s supreme court.
the decision that stood as a landmark in the civil rights movement brown v board of education 1954 triggered a larger judicial revolution.
following brown the court increasingly agreed to hear human rights and civil liberties cases as opposed to its previous focus on property related suits.
surprisingly this shift was led by the man whom president dwight eisenhower had appointed chief justice in 1953 earl warren.
a popular republican governor of california warren surprised many including eisenhower himself with his robust advocacy of civil rights and civil liberties.
the warren court lasted from 1954 until 1969 and established some of the most far reaching liberal jurisprudence in u s history.
right wing activists fiercely opposed the warren court which they accused of legislating from the bench and contributing to social breakdown.
they pointed for instance to the courts rulings that people who are arrested have a constitutional right to counsel 1963 1964 and in miranda v arizona 1966 that arrestees have to be informed by police of their right to remain silent.
compounding conservatives frustration was a series of decisions that liberalized restrictions on pornography.
trying to walk the fine line between censorship and obscenity the court ruled in roth v united states 1957 that obscene material had to be utterly without redeeming social importance to be banned.
the social importance test however proved nearly impossible to define and left wide latitude for pornography to flourish.
that measure was finally abandoned in 1972 when the court ruled in miller v california that contemporary community standards were the rightful measure of obscenity.
but miller too had little effect on the pornographic magazines films and peep shows proliferating in the 1970s.
conservatives found these decisions especially distasteful since the court had also ruled that religious ritual of any kind in public schools including prayers and bible reading violated the constitutional separation of church and state.
to many chapter 28 uncivil wars liberal crisis and conservative rebirth 1961 1972 religious americans the court had taken the side of immorality over christian values.
supreme court critics blamed rising crime rates and social breakdown on the warren courts liberal judicial record.
every category of crime was up in the 1970s but especially disconcerting was the doubling of the murder rate since the 1950s and the 76 percent increase in burglary and theft between 1967 and 1976.
sensational crimes had always grabbed headlines but now crime itself preoccupied politicians the media and the public.
however no one could establish a direct causal link between increases in crime and supreme court decisions given a myriad of other social factors including drugs income inequality enhanced statistical record keeping and the proliferation of guns.
but when many americans looked at their cities in the 1970s they saw pornographic theaters x rated bookstores and rising crime rates.
where they wondered was law and order.
busing another major civil rights objective desegregating schools produced even more controversy and fireworks.
for fifteen years southern states by a variety of stratagems had fended off court directives that they desegregate with all deliberate speed in 1968 only about one third of all black children in the south attended schools with whites.
at that point the federal courts got serious and in a series of stiff decisions ordered an end to dual school systems where schools remained highly segregated the courts increasingly endorsed the strategy of busing students to achieve integration.
plans differed across the country.
in some states black children rode buses from their neighborhoods to attend previously all white schools.
in others white children were bused to black an antibusing confrontation in boston where busing was implemented it often faced stiff resistance.
many white communities resented judges dictating which children would attend which neighborhood school.
in working class irish south boston mobs attacked african american students bused in from roxbury in 1974.
a police presence was required to keep south boston high school open.
when lawyer and civil rights activist ted landsmark tried to enter bostons city hall during a 1976 antibusing demonstration he was assaulted.

or latino neighborhoods.
in an important 1971 decision the supreme court upheld a countywide busing plan for charlotte mecklenburg a north carolina school district.
despite local opposition desegregation proceeded and many cities in the south followed suit.
by the mid 1970s 86 percent of southern black children were attending school with whites.
in recent years this trend has reversed.
in the north where segregated schooling was also a fact of life arising from suburban residential patterns busing orders proved less effective.
detroit dramatized the problem.
to integrate detroit schools would have required merging city and suburban school districts.
a lower court ordered just such a merger in 1971 but in milliken v bradley 1974 the supreme court reversed the ruling requiring busing plans to remain within the boundaries of a single school district.
without including the largely white suburbs in busing efforts however achieving racial balance in detroit and other major northern cities was all but impossible.
postwar suburbanization had produced in the north what law had mandated in the south entrenched racial segregation of schools.
as the 1972 election approached president nixon took advantage of rising discontent over law and order and busing.
he was the political beneficiary of a growing reaction against liberalism that had begun to take hold between 1968 and the early 1970s.
the 1972 election political realignments have been infrequent in american history.
one occurred between 1932 and 1936 when many republicans despairing over the great depression had switched sides and voted for fdr.
the part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 map 28 4 the presidential election of 1972 26 13 6 11 in one of the most lopsided presidential elections of the twentieth century republican richard nixon defeated democrat george mcgovern in a landslide in 1972.
it was a reversal of the 1964 election just eight years before in which republican barry goldwater had been defeated by a similar margin.
nixon hoped that his victory signaled what kevin phillips called the emerging republican majority but the presidents missteps and criminal actions in the watergate scandal would soon bring an end to his tenure in office.

this time democrats were the ones who abandoned their party.
after the 1968 elections the democrats fell into disarray.
bent on sweeping away the partys old guard reformers took over adopting new rules that granted women african americans and young people delegate seats in reasonable relation to their presence in the population in the past an alliance of urban machines labor unions and white ethnic groups the heart of the new deal coalition dominated the nominating process.
but at the 1972 convention few of the party faithful qualified as delegates under the changed rules.
the crowning insult came when the convention rejected the credentials of chicago mayor richard daley and his delegation seating instead an illinois delegation led by jesse jackson a firebrand young black minister and former aide to martin luther king jr capturing the party was one thing beating the republicans was quite another.
these party reforms opened the door for george mcgovern a liberal south dakota senator and favorite of the antiwar and womens movements to capture the nomination.
but mcgovern took a number of missteps including failing to mollify key party backers such as the afl cio which for the first time in memory refused to endorse the democratic ticket.
a weak campaigner mcgovern was also no match for nixon who pulled out all the stops.
using the advantages of incumbency nixon gave the economy a well timed lift and proclaimed prematurely a cease fire in vietnam.
nixons appeal to the silent majority people who care about a strong united states about patriotism about moral and spiritual values was by now well honed.
nixon won in a landslide receiving nearly 61 percent of the popular vote and carrying every state except massachusetts and the district of columbia map 28 4.
the returns revealed how fractured traditional democratic voting blocs had become.
mcgovern received only 38 percent of the big city catholic vote and lost 42 percent of self identified democrats overall.
the 1972 election marked a pivotal moment in the countrys shift to the right.
yet observers legitimately wondered whether the 1972 election results proved the popularity of conservatism or merely showed that the country had grown weary of liberalism and the changes it had wrought in national life.
summary in this chapter we saw that the combined pressures of the vietnam war and racial and cultural conflict fractured and split the new deal coalition.
following john kennedys assassination in 1963 lyndon johnson chapter 28 advanced the most ambitious liberal reform program since the new deal securing not only civil rights legislation but also many programs in education medical care transportation environmental protection and above all his war on poverty.
but the great society fell short of its promise as johnson escalated american involvement in vietnam.
the war bitterly divided americans.
galvanized by the carnage of war and the draft the antiwar movement spread rapidly among young people and the spirit of rebellion spilled beyond the war.
the new left took the lead among college students while the more apolitical counterculture preached liberation through sex drugs music and personal transformation.
womens liberationists broke from the new left and raised new concerns about societys sexism.
conservative chapter review students rallied in support of the war and on behalf of conservative principles but they were often drowned out by the more vocal and demonstrative liberals and radicals.
in 1968 the nation was rocked by the assassinations of martin luther king jr and robert f kennedy as well as by a wave of urban riots fueling a growing popular desire for law and order.
adding to the national disquiet was the democratic national convention that summer divided by the vietnam war and besieged by street riots outside.
the stage was set for a new wave of conservatism to take hold of the country and a resurgence of the republican party under richard nixon between 1968 and 1972.
president nixon ended the war in vietnam but only after five more years and many more casualties.

the song celebrated a bygone era when girls were girls and men were men disdainful of the liberal social movements of the 1960s archie professed a conservative hardscrabble view of the world.
archie bunker became a folk hero to many conservative americans in the 1970s he said what they felt.
but his significance went beyond his politics.
all in the family gave voice to a national search for order.
his feminist daughter liberal son in law and black neighbors brought that changing world into archies modest home in queens new york.
not all americans were as resistant to change as archie.
most were ordinary middle of the road people confronting the aftermath of the tumultuous late 1960s and early 1970s.
the liberalism of those years challenged americans to think in new ways about race gender roles sexual morality and the family.
vietnam and the watergate scandal had compounded matters by producing a crisis of political authority.
an old order had seemingly collapsed.
but what would take its place was not yet clear.
alongside cultural dislocation and political alienation the country confronted economic setbacks.
in 1973 inflation began to climb at a pace unprecedented in the post world war ii decades and economic growth slowed.
an energy crisis aggravated by u s foreign policy in the middle east produced fuel shortages.
foreign competition in manufacturing brought less expensive and often more reliable goods into the u s market from nations such as japan and west germany.
as a result more american plants closed.
the great economic ride enjoyed by the united states since world war ii was over.
what distinguishes the period between the energy crisis 1973 and the election of ronald reagan to the presidency 1980 is the collective national search for order in the midst of economic crisis political realignment and rapid social change.
virtually all the verities and touchstones of the postwar decades cold war liberalism rising living standards and the nuclear family had come under question and most agreed on the urgency to act.
for some this search demanded new forms of liberal experimentation.
for others it led instead to the conservatism of the emerging new right.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 an era of limits the economic downturn of the early 1970s was the deepest slump since the great depression.
every major economic indicator employment productivity growth turned negative and by 1973 the economy was in a tailspin.
inflation brought on in part by military spending in vietnam proved especially difficult to control.
when a middle east embargo cut oil supplies in 1973 prices climbed even more.
unemployment remained high and productivity growth low until 1982.
overall the 1970s represented the worst economic decade of the postwar period what california governor jerry brown called an era of limits in this time of distress americans were forced to consider other limits to the growth and expansion that had long been markers of national progress.
the environmental movement brought attention to the toxic effects of modern industrial capitalism on the natural world.
as the urban crisis grew worse several major cities verged on bankruptcy.
finally political limits were reached as well none of the presidents of the 1970s could reverse the nations economic slide though each spent years trying.
energy crisis modern economies run on oil.
if the oil supply is drastically reduced woe follows.
something like that happened to the united states in the 1970s.
once the worlds leading oil producer the united states had become heavily dependent on inexpensive imported oil mostly from the persian gulf figure 29 1.
american and european oil companies had discovered and developed the middle eastern fields early in the twentieth century when much of the region was ruled by the british and french empires.
when middle eastern states threw off the remnants of european colonialism they demanded concessions for access to the fields.
foreign companies still extracted the oil but now they did so under profit sharing agreements with the persian gulf states.
in 1960 these nations and other oil rich developing countries formed a cartel a business association formed to control prices the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec.
conflict between israel and the neighboring arab states of egypt syria and jordan prompted opec to take political sides between 1967 and 1973.
following israels victory in the 1967 six day war israeli arab tensions in the region grew closer to boiling over with each passing year.
in the 1973 yom kippur war egypt and syria invaded israel to regain territory lost in the 1967 conflict.
israel prevailed but only after being resupplied by an emergency american airlift.
in response to u s support for israel the arab states in opec declared an oil embargo in october 1973.
gas prices in the united states quickly jumped by 40 percent and heating oil prices by 30 percent.
demand outpaced supply and americans found themselves parked for figure 29 1 u s energy consumption 1900 2000 quadrillion btu fuel wood hydroelectric nuclear coal oil natural gas coal was the nations primary source of energy until the 1950s when it was surpassed by oil and natural gas.
the revival of coal consumption after 1960 stemmed from new open pit mining in the west that provided cheaper fuel for power plants.
the decline in oil consumption in 1980 reflects the nations response to the oil crisis of the 1970s including most notably fuel efficient automobiles.
nuclear energy became an important new fuel source but after 1990 its contribution leveled off as a result of the safety concerns triggered by the three mile island incident.
from power.
instead he won passage of un resolution 687 which imposed economic sanctions against iraq unless it allowed unfettered inspection of its weapons systems destroyed all biological and chemical arms and unconditionally pledged not to develop nuclear weapons.
the military victory the low incidence of american casualties and the quick withdrawal produced a euphoric reaction at home.
by god weve kicked the vietnam syndrome once and for all bush announced and his approval rating shot up precipitously.
but saddam hussein remained a formidable power in the region and in march 2003 he would become the pretext for bushs son president george w bush to initiate another war in iraq one that would be much more protracted expensive and bloody for americans and iraqis alike chapter 31.
thus the end of the cold war brought not peace but a new american presence in the middle east.
for half a century the united states and the soviet union had tried to divide the world into two rival economic and ideological blocs communist and capitalist.
the next decades promised a new set of struggles one of them between a western led agenda of economic and cultural globalization and an anti western ideology of muslim and arab regionalism.
still more post cold war shifts were coming into view as well.
one was the chapter 30 spectacular emergence of the european union as a massive united trading bloc economic engine and global political force.
another was the equally spectacular economic growth in china which was just beginning to take off in the early 1990s.
the post cold war world promised to be a multipolar one with great centers of power in europe the united states and east asia and seemingly intractable conflict in the middle east.
summary this chapter examined two central developments of the years 1980 1991 the rise of the new right in u s politics and the end of the cold war.
each development set the stage for a new era in american life one that stretches to our own day.
domestically the new right which had been building in strength since the mid 1960s criticized the liberalism of the great society and the permissiveness that conservative activists associated with feminism and the sexual revolution.
shifting their allegiance from barry goldwater to ronald reagan right wing americans built a conservative chapter review movement from the ground up and in 1980 elected reagan president.
advocating free market economics lower taxes and fewer government regulations reagan became a champion of the new right.
his record as president was more mixed than his rhetoric would suggest however.
reagans initial tax cuts were followed by tax hikes.
moreover he frequently dismayed the christian right by not pursuing their interests forcefully enough especially regarding abortion and school prayer.
reagan played a role in the ending of the cold war.
his massive military buildup in the early 1980s strained an already overstretched soviet economy which struggled to keep pace.
reagan then agreed to meet with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in several summits between 1985 and 1987.
more important than reagans actions however were inefficiencies and contradictions in the soviet economic structure itself.
combined with the forced military buildup and the disastrous war in afghanistan these strains led gorbachev to institute the first significant reforms in soviet society in half a century.
the reforms stirred popular criticism of the soviet union which formally collapsed in 1991.

millions of americans and many more people worldwide watched live on television and the internet as the towers burned and collapsed.
simultaneously a third plane was flown into the pentagon and a fourth hijacked plane crashed in rural pennsylvania.
it took federal bureau of investigation officials only a few hours to determine the identity of most of the hijackers as well as the organization behind the murderous attacks al qaeda.
the attacks were made possible by the new era of globalization.
of the nineteen terrorists involved in the hijackings fifteen were from saudi arabia two were from the united arab emirates one was from egypt and one was from lebanon.
many had trained in afghanistan in guerrilla warfare camps operated by osama bin laden.
four had gone to flight school in the united states itself.
several had lived and studied in germany.
they communicated with one another and with planners in afghanistan through e mail web sites and cell phones.
al qaeda sympathizers could be found among muslims from indonesia to algeria.
the most conspicuous crime of the twentyfirst century which left 2 900 people dead and sent waves of shock and anxiety through the american public would have been impossible without the openness and interconnectivity that are central features of globalization.
messages of sympathy and support poured into the united states from nearly every nation.
citizens of fifty three different countries had perished in the world trade center itself a symbol of the global financial industries.
the world quite literally stood in shock.
the emergence in the middle east of a radical muslim movement willing to use terrorism to inflict major damage on the united states and the west testified to the altered realities of global politics.
the simple cold war duality communism versus capitalism had for decades obscured regional ethnic and religious loyalties and conflicts.
those loyalties and conflicts moved to center stage in an era of globalization.
for americans the period between the end of the cold war and our own day has been defined by twin dilemmas.
the first relates to globalization.
how would the united states engage in global trade and commerce.
how would it relate to emerging nations.
how should it confront radical terrorists.
the second dilemma relates to domestic politics and the economy.
in an era of conservative political dominance how would the nation manage its cultural conflicts and ensure economic opportunity and security for its citizens.
as profound and powerful forces shook the world these were as the chapter title suggests americans dilemmas in a global society.
energy and the environment at the dawn of the twenty first century few issues were more critical in the united states and across the globe than energy and the environment.
this wind farm is an example of the search for non fossil sources of new energy a search that is among the many challenges facing the globalized world of our century.

part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present america in the global economy on november 30 1999 more than 50 000 protesters took to the streets of seattle washington immobilizing a wide swath of the citys downtown.
police armed with pepper spray and arrayed in riot gear worked feverishly to clear the clogged streets get traffic moving and usher well dressed government ministers from around the world into a conference hall.
protesters jeered chanted and held hundreds of signs and banners aloft.
a radical contingent joined the otherwise peaceful march and a handful of them began breaking the windows of the chain stores they saw as symbols of global capitalism starbucks gap old navy.
what had aroused such passion in the so called battle of seattle.
globalization.
the vast majority of americans never surged into the streets as had the seattle protesters who tried to shut down this 1999 meeting of the world trade organization wto but no american by the late 1990s could deny that developments in the global economy reverberated at home.
in that decade americans rediscovered a longstanding truth the united states was not an island but was linked in countless different ways to a global economy and society.
economic prosperity in the post world war ii decades had obscured for americans this fundamental reality figure 31 1.
globalization saw the rapid spread of capitalism around the world huge increases in global trade and commerce and a diffusion of communications technology including the internet that linked the worlds wto demonstration seattle 1999 in november 1999 an estimated 50 000 to 100 000 people from many states and foreign nations staged an effective protest at a world trade organization wto meeting in seattle.
the goals of the protesters were diffuse many feared that the trend toward a system of free capitalist run trade would primarily benefit multinational corporations and would hurt both developing nations and the working classes in the industrialized world.
protests have continued at subsequent meetings of the wto and the world bank.

chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present figure 31 1 productivity family income and wages 1970 2004 this chart tells a complex and not altogether happy story.
the median hourly wages of american workers adjusted for inflation stagnated between 1970 and 1995.
the rise in median family income reflected the increasing proportion of two earner families as more married women entered the workforce.
the dramatic increases in productivity did not lead to higher wages for workers.
rather businesses used those gains either to cut prices to compete in the global marketplace or to reward owners shareholders and particularly corporate executives.

suddenly the united states faced a dizzying array of opportunities and challenges both at home and abroad.
profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world said a young president bill clinton in his first inaugural address in 1993.
the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy an additional question remained however.
in whose interest was the global economy structured.
many of the seattle activists took inspiration from the five point declaration for global democracy issued by the human rights organization global exchange during the wtos seattle meeting.
global trade and investment the declaration demanded must not be ends in themselves but rather the instruments for achieving equitable and sustainable development including protections for workers and the environment the declaration also addressed inequality among nations calling attention to who benefitted from globalization and who did not.
the rise of the european union and china during the cold war the united states and the soviet union dominated the global balance of power.
these two superpowers oversaw what observers called a bipolar world two powerful poles one capitalist and the other communist around which global geopolitics were organized.
since the early 1990s however a multipolar world has emerged with centers of power in europe japan china and the united states along with rising regional powers such as india and brazil america compared p 1008.
in 1992 the nations of western europe created the european union eu and moved toward the creation of a single federal state somewhat like the united states.
by the end of the 1990s the european union embraced more than twenty countries and 450 million people the third largest population in the world behind china and india and accounted for a fifth of all global imports and exports.
in 2002 the eu introduced a single currency the euro which soon rivaled 04 thinking like a historian globalization its proponents and its discontents globalization is perhaps one of the most commonly used yet least understood concepts in our modern vocabulary.
this chapter has explored how while there has long been an international or global dimension to trade migration and other economic activity there is nevertheless something distinct about the post cold war global order.
economic integration and communication networking have created new opportunities for millions of people.
yet those same processes may not benefit all equally.
the following documents offer different perspectives on the broad process called globalization.
interview with petra mata mexican immigrant to the united states 2003.
an immigrant from a lowwage country who was insourced mata worked as a low paid garment worker until she lost her job in the united states because it was outsourced sent abroad to workers paid even less.
my name is petra mata.
i was born in mexico.
i have completed no more than the sixth grade in school.
in 1969 my husband and i came to the u s believing we would find better opportunities for our children and ourselves.
we first arrived without documents then became legal and finally became citizens.
for years i moved from job to job until i was employed in 1976 by the most popular company in the market levi strauss company.
i earned 9 73 an hour and also had vacation and sick leave.
levis provided me and my family with a stable situation and in return i was a loyal employee and worked there for fourteen years.
on january 16 1990 levis closed its plant in san antonio texas where i had been working leaving 1 150 workers unemployed a majority of whom were mexicanamerican women.
the company moved its factory to costa rica.
as a result of being laid off i personally lost my house my method of transportation and the tranquility of my home.
my family and i had to face new problems.
my husband was forced to look for a second job on top of the one he already had.
he worked from seven in the morning to six at night.
our reality was very difficult.
at that time i had not the slightest idea what free trade was or meant.
our governments make agreements behind closed doors without participation from the working persons who are most affected by these decisions decisions that to my knowledge only benefit large corporations and those in positions of power.

seattle chapter national lawyers guild bringing in an undemocratic institution brings an undemocratic response 2000.
many of the businesses that most promote the wto world trade organization and its allied institutions rely on undemocratic practices to promote their business interest.
in recent years these policies have included not only monopolistic business practices but also outright interference with local governments.
frequently to promote the interests of business a militaristic type of government is either promoted or even created.
the effects these governments and their policies have on the citizenry of these nations are disastrous.
farms and forests are ruined and denuded.
low cost toxic waste dumps are created near population centers to service skyrocketing debts.
the wto was nominally chartered as a dispute resolution organization.
the problem is it is an organization with no real oversight or accountability and a process that favors the most powerful corporations.
world trade organization press release 2000.
extreme poverty is a huge problem.
1 2 billion people survive on less than a dollar a day.
a further 1 6 billion more than a quarter of the worlds population make do with one to two dollars a day.
to alleviate poverty developing economies need to grow faster and the poor need to benefit from this growth.
trade can play an important part in reducing poverty because it boosts economic growth and the poor tend to benefit from that faster growth.
the study finds that in general living standards in developing countries are not catching up with those in developed countries.
but some developing countries are catching up.
what distinguishes them is their openness to trade.
the countries that are catching up with rich ones are those that are open to trade and the more open they are the faster they are converging.
stuart carlson political cartoon from the milwaukee journal sentinel 2005.
former president bill clinton speech at guildhall london 2006.
i spent a lot of time working on globalization when i was president coming to terms with the fundamental fact of interdependence that goes far beyond economics open border easy travel easy immigration free flow of money as well as people products and services.
i tried to figure out how to maximize the dynamism of global interdependence and still broaden its impact in terms of economics and opportunity.
the one thing that i am quite sure of is that interdependence is not a choice its not a policy it is the inevitable condition of our time.
so divorce is not an option.
therefore the mission of the moment clearly is to build up the positive and reduce the negative forces of global interdependence in a way that enables us to keep score in the right way.
are people going to be better off will our children have a better chance will we be more united than divided.

in particular use your essay to define globalization and to outline some of its potential positive and negative effects.
america c o m pa r e d global trade 1960 2009 one of the major consequences of economic globalization is an increase in trade among nations.
the figures below show imports and exports for four of the worlds largest economies.
1 6 2 5 1 4 exports trillions in u s dollars imports trillions in u s dollars 2 0 1 5 1 0 1 2 1 0 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 5 u s china germany japan u s china figure 31 3 figure 31 4 imports 1960 2009 exports 1960 2009 0 2 germany japan questions for analysis 1.
notice how u s imports rose at roughly the same rate as those of other countries until the 1970s.
what accounts for the acceleration of u s imports thereafter.
chinas exports rose spectacularly after the 1990s.
germany increased its exports in this period dramatically as well.
what evidence do you see here for increasing competition for the united states in a globalizing economy.
the dollar and the japanese yen as a major international currency map 31 1.
militarily however the eu remained a secondary power.
an economic juggernaut and trading rival with a suspicion of warfare the eu presented a number of new dilemmas for american officials.
so did china a vast nation of 1 3 billion people that was the worlds fastest rising economic power in the first decade of the twenty first century.
between 2000 and 2008 china quadrupled its gross domestic product gdp.
economic growth rates during those years were consistently near 10 percent higher than the united states achieved during its periods of furious economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s.
although still governed by the communist party china embraced capitalism and its factories produced inexpensive products for export which americans eagerly purchased everything from childrens toys and television sets to clothing household appliances and video games.
to maintain this symbiotic relationship china deliberately kept its currency weak against the american dollar ensuring that its exports remained cheap in the united states.
beneficial to american consumers in the short run the implications of this relationship for the future may be less promising.
two such implications stand out.

second china has kept its currency low against the dollar primarily by purchasing american debt.
china now owns nearly 25 percent of total u s debt more than any other nation.
many economists believe that it is unwise to allow a single country to wield so much influence over the u s currency supply.
should this relationship continue unchanged americans may find their manufacturing sector contracting even more severely in the coming decades.
an era of globalization americans have long depended on foreign markets to which they export their goods and have long received imported products and immigrants from other countries.
but the intensity of international exchange has varied over time.
the end of the cold war shattered barriers that had restrained international trade and impeded capitalist development of vast areas of the world.

over the course of the following decades it created stronger common institutions such as the european parliament in strasbourg the eu commission in brussels and the court of justice in luxembourg.
with the collapse of communism the eu has expanded to include the nations of eastern and central europe.
it now includes twentyeight nations and over 500 million people.

international organizations and corporations international organizations many of them created in the wake of world war ii set the rules for capitalisms worldwide expansion.
during the final decades of the cold war the leading capitalist industrial nations formed the group of seven g7 to manage global economic policy.
russia joined in 1997 creating the group of eight g8.
the g8 nations the united states britain germany france italy japan canada and russia largely controlled the major international financial organizations the world bank the international monetary fund imf and the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt.
in 1995 gatt evolved into the world trade organization wto with nearly 150 participating nations that regulate and formalize trade agreements with member states.
part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present compare and contrast what were the potential benefits and risks of globalization to the united states and other countries.
as globalization accelerated so did the integration of regional economies.
to offset the economic clout of the european bloc in 1993 the united states canada and mexico signed the north american free trade agreement nafta.
this treaty as ratified by the u s congress envisioned the eventual creation of a free trade zone covering all of north america.
in east asia the capitalist nations of japan south korea taiwan and singapore consulted on economic policy as china developed a quasi capitalist economy and became a major exporter of manufactures its communist led government joined their deliberations.
international organizations set the rules but globalization was made possible by the proliferation of multinational corporations mncs.
in 1970 there were 7 000 corporations with offices and factories in multiple countries by 2000 the number had exploded to 63 000.
many of the most powerful mncs were and continue to be based in the united states.
walmart the biggest american retailer is also one of the worlds largest corporations with 1 200 stores in other nations and more than 400 billion in sales.
apple maker of the iphone and ipad grew spectacularly in the 2000s and now has more than 60 billion annually in global sales.
the mcdonalds restaurant chain had 1 000 outlets outside the united states in 1980 twenty years later there were nearly 13 000 and mcworld had become a popular shorthand term for globalization.
globalization was driven by more than a quest for new markets.
corporations also sought ever cheaper sources of labor.
many american mncs closed their factories in the united states and outsourced manufacturing jobs to plants in mexico eastern europe a nike factory in china in 2005 nike produced its shoes and sportswear at 124 plants in china additional factories were located in other low wage countries.
most of the chinese plants were run by subcontractors who housed the workers mostly women between the ages of sixteen and twenty five in crowded dormitories.
the wages were low about 3 a day but more than the women could earn if they remained in their rural villages.
chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present and especially asia.
the athletic sportswear firm nike was a prime example.
by 2005 nike had established 700 factories worldwide that employed more than 650 000 workers most of whom received low wages endured harsh working conditions and had no health or pension benefits.
highly skilled jobs were outsourced as well.
financial deregulation one of the principal differences between this new era of globalization and previous eras has been the opening of national financial and currency markets to investment from around the world.
the united states and britain led the way.
both countries came under the sway of powerful political forces in the 1980s calling for the total deregulation of banks brokerage houses investment firms and financial markets letting the free market replace government oversight.
together the united states and britain led a quiet revolution in which investment markets around the world were gradually set free.
financial deregulation led to spectacular profits for investors but produced a more fragile crash prone global economy.
on the profit side financial industry profits in the united states rose from less than 10 percent of total business profits in the 1950s to more than 40 percent beginning in the 1990s.
but the costs were becoming clear as well the bankruptcy of the american savings and loan industry in the 1980s the lost decade in japan in the 1990s the near bankruptcy of russia in the late 1990s and of argentina in 2001 the 1997 asian financial crisis centered in thailand and indonesia and the collapse of nearly the entire global economy in 2008 p 1030.
these and other episodes dramatized the extraordinary risks that financial globalization has introduced.
revolutions in technology the technological advances of the 1980s and 1990s changed the character of everyday life for millions of americans linking them with a global information and media environment unprecedented in world history.
not since television was introduced to american homes in the years following world war ii had technology so profoundly changed the way people lived their lives.
personal computers cell phones and smartphones the internet and the world wide web and other electronic devices and systems altered internet versus newspapers between 2000 and 2010 dozens of large and medium sized newspapers went out of business their oncerobust readership drained away by the convenience of news available for free on the internet.
in 2009 the seattle post intelligencer newspaper ceased print publication and became an online only news source.
in this photo the papers news boxes sit empty an ominous sign of the struggling newspaper business in the early 2000s.

part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present work leisure and access to knowledge in stunning ways.
like unimpeded trade these advances in communications and personal technologies enhanced globalization.
during the 1990s personal computers which had emerged in the late 1970s grew even more significant with the spread of the internet and the world wide web.
like the computer itself the internet was the product of military based research.
during the late 1960s the u s department of defense in conjunction with the massachusetts institute of technology began developing a decentralized computer network the advanced research projects agency network arpanet.
the internet which grew out of the arpanet was soon used by government scientists academic specialists and military contractors to exchange data information and electronic mail e mail.
by the 1980s the internet had spread to universities businesses and the general public.
the debut in 1991 of the graphics based world wide web a collection of servers that allowed access to millions of documents pictures and other materials enhanced the popular appeal and commercial possibilities of the internet.
by 2011 78 percent of all americans and more than two billion people worldwide used the internet to send messages and view information.
businesses used the world wide web to sell their products and services e commerce transactions totaled 114 billion in 2003 172 billion in 2005 and neared 500 billion in 2010.
the web proved instantly democratic providing ordinary people with easy access to knowledge.
politics and partisanship in a new era standing at the podium at the 1992 republican national convention his supporters cheering by the thousands patrick buchanan did not mince words.
buchanan was a former speechwriter for president richard nixon and a white house aide to president ronald reagan and despite having lost the nomination for president he still hoped to shape the partys message to voters.
this election he told the audience including millions watching on television is about what we stand for as americans citing democratic support for abortion rights and the rights of lesbians and gay men buchanan claimed there was a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it was he emphasized a culture war buchanans war was another name for a longstanding political struggle dating to the 1920s between religious traditionalists and secular liberals chapter 22.
this time however americans struggled over these questions in the long shadow of the sixties which had taken on an exaggerated meaning in the nations new immigrants in the early years of the 2000s more immigrants lived in the united states than at any time since the first decades of the twentieth century.
most came from asia latin america and africa.
many like those pictured here started small businesses that helped revive the economies of urban and suburban neighborhoods across the country.

numbers in thousands chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present eastern and southern europe northwestern and central europe latin america and caribbean asia figure 31 5 american immigration 1920 2000 legislation inspired by nativism slowed the influx of immigrants after 1920 as did the dislocations brought on by economic depression and war in the 1930s and 1940s.
note the high rate of noneuropean immigration since the 1970s the result of new eligibility rules in the immigration act of 1965 chapter 28.
the dramatic increase since 1980 in the number of migrants from latin america and asia reflects american economic prosperity traditionally a magnet for migrants and the rapid acceleration of illegal immigration.
against the backdrop of globalization american politics in the 1990s and early 2000s careened back and forth between contests over divisive social issues and concern over the nations economic future.
an increasingly plural society exact estimates vary but demographers predict that at some point between 2040 and 2050 the united states will become a majority minority nation no single ethnic or racial group will be in the numerical majority.
this is already the case in california where in 2010 african americans latinos and asians together constituted a majority of the states residents.
as this unmistakable trend became apparent in the 1990s it fueled renewed debates over ethnic and racial identity and over public policies such as affirmative action.
new immigrants according to the census bureau the population of the united states grew from 203 million in 1970 to 280 million in 2000 american voices p 1016.
of that 77 million person increase immigrants accounted for 28 million with legal entrants numbering 21 million and illegal entrants adding another 7 million figure 31 5.
as a result by 2000 26 percent of californias population was foreign born as was 20 percent of new yorks and 17 percent each of new jerseys and floridas.
relatively few immigrants came from europe which had dominated immigration to the united states between 1880 and 1924.
the overwhelming majority some 25 million now came from latin america 16 million and east asia 9 million map 31 2.
this extraordinary inflow of immigrants was the unintended result of the immigration and nationality act of 1965 one of the less well known but most influential pieces of great society legislation.
known as the hart celler act the legislation eliminated the 1924 quota system which had favored northern europe.
in its place congress created a more equal playing field among nations and a slightly higher total limit on immigration.
the legislation also included provisions that eased the entry of immigrants who possessed skills in high demand in the united states.
finally a provision with far reaching implications was included in the new law immediate family members of those already part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present map 31 2 vt wash north dakota montana oregon minn nevada sacramento stockton san francisco fresno salinas visalia mich bakersfield ill denver utah colorado w va n j del.

american residents from latin america and the caribbean were best positioned to take advantage of the family provision.
millions of mexicans came to the united states to join their families and u s residents from el salvador and guatemala tens of thousands of whom had arrived seeking sanctuary or asylum percent of state population 4 6 2 3 less than 2 during the civil wars of the 1980s and the dominican republic now brought their families to join them.
nationally there were now more latinos than african americans.
many of these immigrants profoundly shaped the emerging global economy by sending substantial portions of their earnings called remittances back to family members in their home countries.
in 2006 for instance workers in the united states sent chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present 23 billion to mexico a massive remittance flow that constituted mexicos third largest source of foreign exchange.
asian immigrants came largely from china the philippines south korea india and pakistan.
in addition 700 000 refugees came to the united states from southeast asia vietnam laos and cambodia after the vietnam war.
this immigration signaled more than new flows of people into the united states.
throughout much of its history the united states had oriented itself toward the atlantic.
indeed at the end of the nineteenth century american secretary of state john hay observed the mediterranean is the ocean of the past the atlantic the ocean of the present he added presciently the pacific is the ocean of the future by the last decades of the twentieth century hays future had arrived.
as immigration from asia increased as japan and china grew more influential economically and as more and more transnational trade crossed the pacific commentators on both sides of the ocean began speaking of the pacific rim as an important new region.
multiculturalism and its critics most new immigrants arrived under the terms of the 1965 law.
but those who entered without legal documentation stirred political controversy.
after twenty years under the new law there were three to five million immigrants without legal status.
in 1986 to remedy this situation congress passed the immigration reform and control act.
the law granted citizenship to many of those who had arrived illegally provided incentives for employers not to hire undocumented immigrants and increased surveillance along the border with mexico.
immigration critics persisted however.
in 1992 patrick buchanan then campaigning for the republican presidential nomination warned americans that their country was undergoing the greatest invasion in its history a migration of millions of illegal aliens a year from mexico many states took immigration matters into their own hands.
in 1994 for instance californians approved proposition 187 a ballot initiative that barred illegal aliens from public schools nonemergency care at public health clinics and all other state social services.
the proposed law declared that u s citizens have a right to the protection of their government from any person or persons entering this country unlawfully but after five years in federal court the controversial measure was ruled unconstitutional.
to see a longer excerpt of proposition 187 along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
debates over post 1965 immigration looked a great deal like conflicts in the early decades of the century.
then many native born white protestants worried that the largely jewish and catholic immigrants from southern and eastern europe along with african american migrants leaving the south could not assimilate and threatened the purity of the nation.
although the conflicts looked the same the cultural paradigm had shifted.
in the earlier era the melting pot a term borrowed from the title of a 1908 play became the metaphor for how american society would accommodate its newfound diversity.
some native born americans found solace in the meltingpot concept because it implied that a single american culture would predominate.
in the 1990s however a different concept multiculturalism emerged to define social diversity.
americans this concept suggested were not a single people into whom others melted rather they comprised a diverse set of ethnic and racial groups living and working together.
a shared set of public values held the multicultural society together even as different groups maintained unique practices and traditions.
critics however charged that multiculturalism perpetuated ethnic chauvinism and conferred preferential treatment on minority groups.
many government policies as well as a large number of private employers for instance continued to support affirmative action programs designed to bring african americans and latinos into public and private sector jobs and universities in larger numbers.
conservatives argued that such governmental programs were deeply flawed because they promoted reverse discrimination against white men and women and resulted in the selection and promotion of less qualified applicants for jobs and educational advancement.
california stood at the center of the debate.
in 1995 under pressure from republican governor pete wilson the regents of the university of california scrapped their twenty year old policy of affirmative action.
a year later california voters approved proposition 209 which outlawed affirmative action in state employment and public education.
at the height of the 1995 controversy president bill clinton delivered a major speech defending affirmative action.
he reminded americans that richard nixon a republican president had endorsed affirmative action and he concluded by saying the nation should mend it not end it however as in the bakke decision of the 1970s chapter 29 it was the u s supreme court that spoke loudest on the subject.
in two parallel 2003 cases the court invalidated one affirmative action plan at the university of american voices immigration after 1965 its defenders and critics as we have seen in this chapter the immigration law passed by congress in 1965 combined with global developments to shift the flows of people seeking entry to the united states.
more and more immigrants came from latin america the caribbean asia and africa.
immigration has always been politically controversial but in the 1990s a renewed and often polarized debate over immigration emerged.
john f kennedy a nation of immigrants 1964 this selection is from a revised and posthumously published version of a book kennedy originally published in 1958.
immigration policy should be generous it should be fair it should be flexible.
with such a policy we can turn to the world and to our own past with clean hands and a clean conscience.
such a policy would be a reaffirmation of old principles.
it would be an expression of our agreement with george washington that the bosom of america is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment source nicholas capaldi ed immigration debating the issues amherst ny prometheus books 1997 128.
roy beck a nation of too many immigrants 1996 boy beck is a former journalist who became an activist for immigration reduction.
since 1970 more than 30 million foreign citizens and their descendants have been added to the local communities and labor pools of the united states.
it is the numerical equivalent of having relocated within our borders the entire present population of all central american countries.
demographic change on such a massive scale primarily caused by the increased admission of legal immigrants inevitably has created winners and losers among americans.
based on opinion polls it appears that most americans consider themselves net losers and believe that the united states has become a nation of too many immigrants what level of immigration is best for america and of real help to the world.
although we often hear that the united states is a nation of immigrants we seldom ask just what that means.
it can be difficult to ask tough questions about immigration when we see nostalgic images of ellis island recall our own families coming to america or encounter a new immigrant who is striving admirably to achieve the american dream.
but tough questions about immigration can no longer be avoided as we enter a fourth decade of unprecedentedly high immigration and struggle with its impact on our job markets on the quality of life and social fabric of our communities and on the state of the environment.
the task before the nation in setting a fair level of immigration is not about race or some vision of a homogenous white america it is about protecting and enhancing the united states unique experiment in democracy for all americans including recent immigrants regardless of their particular ethnicity.
it is time to confront the true costs and benefits of immigration numbers which have skyrocketed beyond our societys ability to handle them successfully.

vernon m briggs jr and stephen moore still an open door 1994 two academic policy analysts weigh in on the immigration debate.
immigrants are certainly not an unmixed blessing.
when the newcomers first arrive they impose short term costs on the citizenry.
because immigration means more people they cause more congestion of our highways a more crowded housing market and longer waiting lines in stores and hospitals.
in states such as california immigrants children are heavy users of an already overburdened public school system and so on.
some immigrants abuse the welfare system which means that tax dollars from americans are transferred to immigrant populations.
los angeles county officials estimate that immigrants use of county services costs the local government hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
the benefits of immigration however are manifold.
perhaps the most important benefit is that immigrants come to the united states with critically needed talents energies and ambitions that serve as an engine for economic progress and help the united states retain economic and geopolitical leadership.
because for most of the worlds immigrants america is their first choice the united states is in a unique position to select the most brilliant and inventive minds from the united kingdom canada china korea india ireland mexico philippines russia taiwan and other nations.
because most immigrants are not poor tired huddled masses but rather are above the average of their compatriots in skill and education levels the immigration process has a highly beneficial self selection component a skimming of the cream of the best workers and top brainpower from the rest of the world.

they are americans in their heart in their minds in every single way but one on paper.
they were brought to this country by their parents sometimes even as infants and often have no idea that theyre undocumented until they apply for a job or a drivers license or a college scholarship.
put yourself in their shoes.
imagine youve done everything right your entire life studied hard worked hard maybe even graduated at the top of your class only to suddenly face the threat of deportation to a country that you know nothing about with a language that you may not even speak.
thats what gave rise to the dream act.
it says that if your parents brought you here as a child youve been here for five years and youre willing to go to college or serve in our military you can one day earn your citizenship.
and ive said time and time and time again to congress that send me the dream act put it on my desk and i will sign it right away.

questions for analysis 1.
compare and contrast the different views on immigration presented here.
what are the pros and cons of immigration.
does the debate over immigration depend on whether immigrants are pictured as skilled and educated or unskilled and poor.
explain why it should or shouldnt.
the dream act that president obama mentions was stalled in congress in 2012.
what kinds of appeals does he make on behalf of immigrants.
how do they compare with kennedys remarks.
part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present english only not everyone was pleased with the new influx of immigrants.
anti immigrant movements arose in various states especially those along the mexican border.
in 1998 conservative activist ron unz sponsored proposition 227 in california.
the measure which banned bilingual education in public schools passed by a wide margin.
in this photo unz delivers a speech supporting proposition 227 to an audience in los angeles.
michigan but allowed racial preference policies that promoted a diverse student body.
thus diversity became the law of the land the constitutionally acceptable basis for affirmative action.
the policy had been narrowed but preserved.
additional anxieties about a multicultural nation centered on language.
in 1998 silicon valley software entrepreneur ron unz sponsored a california initiative calling for an end to bilingual education in public schools.
unz argued that bilingual education had failed because it did not adequately prepare spanish speaking students to succeed in an english speaking society.
the states white anglo residents largely approved of the measure most mexican trace change american asian american and over time civil rights organizations opposed how did anti immigrant it.
when unzs measure propsentiment increase between osition 227 passed with a healthy the 1960s and the 1990s 61 percent majority it seemed to and what sorts of actions confirm the limits of multiculturwere taken by those alism in the nations most diverse opposed to immigration.
clashes over family values if the promise of a multicultural nation was one contested political issue another was the state of american families.
new right conservatives charged that the abrasive experiments of two liberal decades as a reagan administration report put it had eroded respect for marriage and what they had called since the 1970s family values they pointed to the 40 percent rate of divorce among whites and the nearly 60 percent rate of out of wedlock pregnancies among african americans.
to conservatives there was a wide range of culprits legislators who enacted liberal divorce laws funded child care and allowed welfare payments to unmarried mothers as well as judges who condoned abortion and banished religious instruction from public schools.
abortion abortion was central to the battles between feminists and religious conservatives and a defining issue between democrats and republicans.
feminists who described themselves as prochoice viewed the issue from the perspective of the pregnant woman they argued that the right to a legal safe abortion was crucial to her control over her body and life.
conversely religious conservatives who pronounced themselves prolife viewed abortion from the perspective of the unborn fetus and claimed that its rights trumped those of the mother.
that is where the debate had stood since the u s supreme courts 1973 decision in roe v wade.
by the 1980s fundamentalist protestants had assumed leadership of the antiabortion movement chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present activists protesting outside the supreme court in 2002 in 2002 the supreme court considered a case in which the national organization for women now had challenged the legality of abortion clinic protests such as those undertaken by operation rescue.
the activists and the case itself demonstrated that the question of abortion remained far from settled and americans on all sides of the issue continued to hold passionate opinions.

which became increasingly confrontational and politically powerful.
in 1987 the religious activist randall terry founded operation rescue which mounted protests outside abortion clinics and harassed their staffs and clients.
while such vocal protests took shape outside clinics antiabortion activists also won state laws that limited public funding for abortions required parental notification before minors could obtain abortions and mandated waiting periods before any woman could undergo an abortion procedure.
such laws further restricted womens reproductive choices.
gay rights the issue of homosexuality stirred equally deep passions.
as more gay men and women came out of the closet in the years after stonewall chapter 28 they demanded legal protections from discrimination in housing education and employment.
public opinion about these demands varied by region but by the 1990s many cities and states had banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
gay rights groups also sought legal explain rights for same sex couples consequences such as the eligibility for work how did clashes over place health care coverage that family values alter were akin to those enjoyed by american politics in the married heterosexuals.
many of 1990s.
the most prominent national gay rights organizations such as the human rights campaign focused on full marriage equality a legal recognition of same sex marriage that was on par with opposite sex marriages.
the religious right had long condemned homosexuality as morally wrong and public opinion remained sharply divided.
in 1992 colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that prevented local governments from enacting ordinances protecting gays and lesbians a measure that the supreme court subsequently overturned as unconstitutional.
that same year however oregon voters defeated a more radical initiative that would have part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present prevented the state from using any funds to promote encourage or facilitate homosexuality.
in 1998 congress entered the fray by enacting the defense of marriage act which allowed states to refuse to recognize gay marriages or civil unions formed in other jurisdictions.
more recently gay marriage has been legalized in eleven states california connecticut iowa maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new york vermont washington and rhode island.
culture wars and the supreme court divisive rights issues increasingly came before the u s supreme court.
abortion led the way with abortion rights activists challenging the constitutionality of the new state laws limiting access to the procedure.
in webster v reproductive health services 1989 the supreme court upheld the authority of state governments to limit the use of public funds and facilities for abortions.
then in the important case of planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey 1992 the court upheld a law requiring a twenty four hour waiting period prior to an abortion.
surveying these and other decisions a reporter suggested that 1989 was the year the court turned right with a conservative majority ready and willing to limit or invalidate liberal legislation and legal precedents.
this observation was only partly correct.
the court was not yet firmly conservative.
although the casey decision upheld certain restrictions on abortions it affirmed the essential holding in roe v wade 1973 that women had a constitutional right to control their reproduction.
justice david souter appointed to the court by president george h w bush in 1990 voted with reagan appointees sandra day oconnor and anthony kennedy to uphold roe.
souter like oconnor emerged as an ideologically moderate justice on a range of issues.
moreover in a landmark decision lawrence v texas 2003 the supreme court limited the power of states to prohibit private homosexual activity between consenting adults and more recently in windsor v united states 2013 declared the defense of marriage act unconstitutional.
the court had crept incrementally rather than lurched to the right while signaling its continued desire to remain within the broad mainstream of american public opinion.
the clinton presidency 1993 2001 the culture wars contributed to a new divisive partisanship in national politics.
rarely in the twentieth century had the two major parties so adamantly refused to work together.
also rare was the vitriolic rhetoric that politicians used to describe their opponents.
the fractious partisanship was filtered through or many would argue created by the new twenty four hour cable news television networks such as fox news and cnn.
commentators on these channels finding that nothing drew viewers like aggressive partisanship increasingly abandoned their roles as conveyors of information and became entertainers and provocateurs.
that divisiveness was a hallmark of the presidency of william jefferson clinton.
in 1992 clinton the governor of arkansas styled himself a new democrat who would bring reagan democrats and middle class voters back to the party.
only forty six he was an energetic ambitious policy wonk extraordinarily well informed about the details of public policy.
to win the democratic nomination in 1992 clinton had to survive charges that he embodied the permissive social values conservatives associated with the 1960s namely that he dodged the draft to avoid service in vietnam smoked marijuana and cheated repeatedly on his wife.
the charges were damaging but clinton adroitly talked his way into the presidential nomination he had charisma and a way with words.
for his running mate he chose albert a gore a senator from tennessee.
gore was about the same age as clinton making them the first baby boom national ticket as well as the nations first all southern major party ticket.
president george h w bush won renomination over his lone opponent the conservative columnist pat buchanan.
the democrats mounted an aggressive campaign that focused on clintons domestic agenda he promised a tax cut for the middle class universal health insurance and a reduction of the huge republican budget deficit.
it was an audacious combination of traditional social welfare liberalism and fiscal conservatism.
for his part bush could not overcome voters discontent with the weak economy and conservatives disgust at his tax hikes.
he received only 38 0 percent of the popular vote as millions of republicans cast their ballots for independent businessman ross perot who won more votes 19 0 percent than any independent candidate since theodore roosevelt in 1912.
with 43 7 percent of the vote clinton won the election map 31 3.
still there were reasons for him to worry.
among all post world war ii presidents only richard nixon in 1969 entered the white house with a comparably small share of the national vote.
new democrats and public policy clinton tried to steer a middle course through the nations increasingly chapter 31 22 12 5 13 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present washington d c.

the first ever all southern democratic ticket of bill clinton arkansas and al gore tennessee won support across the country but won the election with only 43 7 percent of the popular vote.
the republican candidate president george h w bush ran strongly in his home state of texas and the south an emerging republican stronghold.
independent candidate h ross perot a wealthy technology entrepreneur polled an impressive 19 0 percent of the popular vote by capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with the huge federal deficits of the reagan bush administrations.
divisive partisanship.
on his left was the democratic partys weakened but still vocal liberal wing.
on his right were party moderates influenced by reagan era notions of reducing government regulation and the welfare state.
clintons third way as he dubbed it called for the new president to tailor his proposals to satisfy these two quite different and often antagonistic political constituencies.
clinton had notable successes as well as spectacular failures pursuing this course.
the spectacular failure came first.
clintons most ambitious social welfare goal was to provide a system of health care that would cover all americans and reduce the burden of health care costs on the larger economy.
although the united states spent a higher percentage of its gross national product gnp on medical care than any other nation it was the only major industrialized country that understand did not provide government points of view guaranteed health insurance to all what made president citizens.
it was an objective that clinton a new demohad eluded every democratic crat and how much president since harry truman.
did his proposals differ recognizing the potency of from traditional liberal reagans attack on big govern objectives.
ment clintons health care task force led by first lady hillary rodham clinton proposed a system of managed competition private insurance companies and market forces were to rein in health care expenditures.
the cost of this system would fall heavily on employers and many smaller businesses campaigned strongly against it.
so did the health insurance industry and the american medical association powerful lobbies with considerable influence in washington.
by mid 1994 democratic leaders in congress declared that the clintons universal health care proposal was dead.
forty million americans or 15 percent of the population remained without health insurance coverage.
more successful was clintons plan to reduce the budget deficits of the reagan bush presidencies.
in 1993 clinton secured a five year budget package that would reduce the federal deficit by 500 billion.
republicans unanimously opposed the proposal because it raised taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals and liberal democrats complained because it limited social spending.
but shared sacrifice led to shared rewards.
by 1998 clintons fiscal policies had balanced the federal budget and begun to pay down the federal debt at a rate of 156 billion a year between 1999 and 2001.
as fiscal sanity returned to washington the economy boomed thanks in part to the low interest rates stemming from deficit reduction.
the republican resurgence the midterm election of 1994 confirmed that the clinton presidency had not produced an electoral realignment conservatives still had a working majority.
in a well organized campaign in which grassroots appeals to the new right dominated republicans gained fifty two seats in the house of representatives giving them a majority for the first time since 1954.
they also retook control of the senate and captured eleven governorships.
leading the republican charge was representative newt gingrich of georgia who revived calls for significant tax cuts reductions in welfare programs anticrime initiatives and cutbacks in federal regulations.
these initiatives which gingrich promoted under the banner of a contract with america had been central components part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present an influential first lady and senator hillary clinton was the most influential first lady since eleanor roosevelt.
but she had ambitions beyond being a political spouse.
in 2000 and again in 2006 she won election to the u s senate from new york.
in 2008 she nearly captured the democratic nomination for president and in 2009 she was appointed secretary of state by the man who defeated her in the democratic primaries and who went on to win the presidency barack obama.
here she is shown with a group of her supporters in one of her senate campaigns.

of the conservative backed reagan revolution of the 1980s but gingrich believed that under the presidency of george h w bush republicans had not emphasized them enough.
in response to the massive democratic losses in 1994 clinton moved to the right.
claiming in 1996 that the era of big government is over he avoided expansive social welfare proposals for the remainder of his presidency and sought republican support for a centrist new democrat program.
the signal piece of that program was reforming the welfare system a measure that saved relatively little money but carried a big ideological message.
many taxpaying americans believed with some supporting evidence that the aid to families with dependent children afdc program encouraged female recipients to remain on welfare rather than seek employment.
in august 1996 the federal government abolished afdc achieving a longstanding goal of conservatives when clinton signed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act.
liberals were furious with the president.
clintons impeachment following a relatively easy victory in the 1996 election clintons second term unraveled when a sex scandal led to his impeachment.
clinton denied having had a sexual affair with monica lewinsky a former white house intern.
independent prosecutor kenneth starr a conservative republican concluded that clinton had committed perjury and obstructed justice and that these actions were grounds for impeachment.
viewed historically americans have usually defined high crimes and misdemeanors the constitutional standard for impeachment as involving a serious abuse of public trust that endangered the republic.
in 1998 conservative republicans favored a much lower standard because they did not accept clintons legitimacy as president.
they vowed to oust him from office for lying about an extramarital affair.
on december 19 the house of representatives narrowly approved two articles of impeachment.
only a minority of americans supported the houses action according to a cbs news poll 38 percent favored impeachment while 58 percent opposed it.
lacking public support in early 1999 republicans in the senate fell well short of the two thirds majority they needed to remove the president.
but like andrew johnson the only other president to be tried by the senate clinton and the democratic party paid a high price for his acquittal.
preoccupied with defending himself the president was unable to fashion a democratic alternative to the republicans domestic agenda.
the american public also paid a high price because the republicans vendetta against clinton drew attention away from pressing national problems.
post cold war foreign policy politically weakened domestically after 1994 clinton believed he could nonetheless make a difference on the international stage.
there post cold war developments chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present bill clinton president william bill clinton returned the democratic party to the white house after twelve years under ronald reagan and george h w bush.
clinton was best known politically for what he called the third way a phrase that described his efforts to craft policies that appealed to both liberals and moderates in his party.
here he signs the welfare reform act of 1996 officially the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act which brought an end to the federal afdc program that democrats had created in 1935.
gave him historic opportunities.
the 1990s was a decade of stunning change in europe and central asia.
a great arc of newly independent states emerged as the soviet empire collapsed.
the majority of the 142 million people living in the former soviet states were poor but the region had a sizable middle class and was rich in natural resources especially oil and natural gas.
among the challenges for the united states was the question of whether to support the admission of some of the new states into the north atlantic treaty organization nato chapter 25.
many observers believed with some justification that extending the nato alliance into eastern europe right up to russias western border would damage u s russian relations.
however czechoslovakia poland and hungary were also eager to become nato members an outcome that would draw into the western alliance three nations that stalin had decisively placed in the soviet sphere of influence at the close of world war ii.
clinton encouraged nato admission for those three countries but stopped short of advocating a broader expansion of the alliance during his terms in office.
nonetheless by 2010 twelve new nations most of them in eastern europe had been admitted to the nato alliance.
nothing symbolized the end of the cold war more than the fact that ten of those nations were former members of the warsaw pact.
the breakup of yugoslavia two of the new nato states slovenia and croatia emerged from an intrac table set of conflicts that led to place events the dissolution of the communist in context nation of yugoslavia.
in 1992 the in what specific ways were heavily muslim province of foreign policy developbosnia herzegovina declared its ments during the clinton independence but its substan presidency evidence of the tial serbian population refused to end of the cold war.
live in a muslim run multiethnic state.
slobodan milosevic an uncompromising serbian nationalist launched a ruthless campaign of ethnic cleansing to create a serbian state.
in november 1995 clinton organized a nato led bombing campaign and peacekeeping effort backed by 20 000 american troops that ended the serbs vicious expansionist drive.
four years later a new crisis emerged in kosovo another province of the serbian dominated federal republic of yugoslavia.
again led by the united states nato intervened with air strikes and military forces to preserve kosovos autonomy.
by 2008 seven independent nations had emerged from the wreckage of yugoslavia.
america and the middle east no post cold war development proved more challenging than the emergence of radical islamic movements in the middle east.
muslim nations there had a long list of grievances against the west.
colonialism both british and french in the early decades of the twentieth century had been ruthless.
a u s sponsored overthrow of irans government in 1953 and twenty five years of part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present american support for the iranian shah was also a sore point.
americas support for israel in the 1967 six day war and the 1973 yom kippur war and its near unconditional backing of israel in the 1980s were particularly galling to muslims.
the regions religious and secular moderates complained about these injustices but many of them had political and economic ties to the west which constrained their criticism.
this situation left an opening for radical islamic fundamentalists to build a movement based on fanatical opposition to western imperialism and consumer culture.
these groups interpreted the american presence in saudi arabia as signaling new u s colonial ambitions in the region.
clinton had inherited from president george h w bush a defeated iraq and a sizable military force about 4 000 air force personnel in saudi arabia.
american fighter jets left saudi arabian air bases to fly regular missions over iraq enforcing a no fly zone where iraqi planes were forbidden and bombing select targets.
clinton also enforced a un sanctioned embargo on all trade with iraq a policy designed to constrain saddam husseins military that ultimately denied crucial goods to the civilian population.
angered by the continued u s presence in saudi arabia muslim fundamentalists soon began targeting americans.
in 1993 radical muslim immigrants set off a bomb in a parking garage beneath the world trade center in new york city killing six people and injuring more than a thousand.
terrorists used truck bombs to blow up u s embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 and they bombed the uss cole in the yemeni port of aden in 2000.
the clinton administration knew these attacks were the work of al qaeda a network of radical islamic terrorists organized by the wealthy saudi exile osama bin laden.
in february 1998 bin laden had issued a call for holy war a jihad against jews and crusaders in which it was said to be the duty of every muslim to terrorists bomb uss cole on october 12 2000 a radical muslim group with ties to al qaeda detonated a powerful bomb alongside the uss cole which was refueling in the port of aden in yemen.
the explosion tore a large hole in the ships hull killing seventeen american sailors and injuring thirty seven others.
after repairs costing 250 million the uss cole returned to active duty in april 2002.

chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present kill americans and their allies.
after the embassy attacks clinton ordered air strikes on al qaeda bases in afghanistan where an estimated 15 000 radical operatives had been trained since 1990.
the strikes failed to disrupt this growing terrorist network and when clinton left office the central intelligence agency cia the state department and the pentagon were well aware of the potential threat posed by bin ladens followers.
that was where things stood on september 10 2001.
into a new century in the second decade of the new century americans can reflect on two significant developments that have profoundly shaped their own day the terrorist attack on the united states on september 11 2001 and the election of the nations first african american president barack obama on november 4 2008.
too little time has passed for us to assess whether either event will be remembered as helping to define the twentyfirst century.
but both have indelibly marked our present.
and both had distinct antecedents and still have profound implications.
the ascendance of george w bush the 2000 presidential election briefly offered the promise of a break with the intense partisanship of the final clinton years.
the republican nominee george w bush the son of president george h w bush pre the contested vote in florida 2000 when the vote recount got under way in palm beach florida in 2000 both sides brought out supporters to demonstrate outside the supervisor of elections office in hopes of influencing the officials doing the counting.

reuters corbis.
sented himself as an outsider deploring washington partisanship and casting himself as a uniter not a divider his opponent al gore clintons vice president was a liberal policy specialist.
the election of 2000 would join those of 1876 and 1960 as the closest and most contested in american history.
gore won the popular vote amassing 50 9 million votes to bushs 50 4 million but fell short in the electoral college 267 to 271.
consumer and labor rights activist ralph nader ran as the green party candidate and drew away precious votes in key states that certainly would have carried gore to victory.
late on election night the vote tally in florida gave bush the narrowest of victories.
as was their legal prerogative the democrats demanded hand recounts in several counties.
a month of tumult followed until the u s supreme court voting strictly along conservative liberal lines ordered the recount stopped and let bushs victory stand.
recounting ballots without a consistent standard to determine voter intent the court reasoned violated the rights of floridian voters under the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause.
as if acknowledging the frailty of this argument the court declared that bush v gore was not to be regarded as precedent.
but in a dissenting opinion justice john paul stevens warned that the transparently partisan decision undermined the nations confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law although bush had positioned himself as a moderate countertendencies drove his administration from the start.
his vice president the uncompromising conservative richard dick cheney became with bushs part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present consent virtually a copresident.
bush also brought into the administration his campaign advisor karl rove whose advice made for an exceptionally politicized white house.
rove foreclosed the easygoing centrism of bush the campaigner by arguing that a permanent republican majority could be built on the partys conservative base.
on capitol hill roves hard line was reinforced by tom delay the house majority leader who in 1995 had declared all out war on the democrats.
to win that war delay pushed congressional republicans to endorse a fierce partisanship.
the senate although more collegial went through a similar hardening process.
after 2002 with republicans in control of both congress and the white house bipartisan lawmaking came to an end.
tax cuts the domestic issue that most engaged president bush as it had ronald reagan was taxes.
bushs economic growth and tax relief act of 2001 had something for everyone.
it slashed income tax rates extended the earned income credit for the poor and marked the estate tax to be phased out by 2010.
a second round of cuts in 2003 targeted dividend income and capital gains.
bushs signature cuts those favoring big estates and well to do owners of stocks and bonds skewed the distribution of tax benefits upward table 31 1.
bush had pushed far compare and beyond any other postwar presicontrast dent even reagan in slashing in what ways was george federal taxes.
h w bush a political folcritics warned that such maslower of ronald reagan sive tax cuts would plunge the chapter 30.
in what federal government into debt.
by ways was he not.
2006 federal expenditures had jumped 33 percent at a faster clip than under any president since lyndon johnson.
huge increases in healthcare costs were the main culprit.
two of the largest federal programs medicare and medicaid health care for the elderly and the poor respectively could not contain runaway medical costs.
midway through bushs second term the national debt stood at over 8 trillion much of it owned by foreign investors who also financed the nations huge trade deficit.
on top of that staggering social security and medicare obligations were coming due for retiring baby boomers.
it seemed that these burdens would be passed on to future generations figure 31 6.
september 11 2001 how bushs presidency might have fared in normal times is another of those unanswerable questions of history.
as a candidate in 2000 george w bush had said little about foreign policy.
he had assumed that his administration would rise or fall on his domestic program.
but nine months into his presidency an altogether different political scenario unfolded.
on a sunny september morning nineteen islamic terrorists from al qaeda hijacked four commercial jets and flew two of them into new york citys world trade center destroying its twin towers and killing more than 2 900 people.
a third plane crashed into the pentagon near washington d c.
the fourth presumably headed for the white house or possibly the u s capitol crashed in pennsylvania when the passengers fought back and thwarted the hijackers.
as an outburst of patriotism swept the united states in the wake of the september 11 attacks george w bush proclaimed a war on terror and vowed to carry the battle to al qaeda.

gross income total tax cut change in tax bill income in 2003 tax bill tax rate chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present figure 31 6 gross federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product 150 economists argue that the best measure of a nations debt is its size relative to the overall economy that is its percentage of gross domestic product gdp.
the size of the total u s debt declined from its world war ii high until the 1980s when it increased dramatically under president reagan.
since then the debt has consistently increased as a percentage of gdp aside from a small decline under president clintons deficit reduction plans in the mid 1990s.

by early 2002 this lethal combination had ousted the taliban destroyed al qaedas training camps and killed or captured many of its operatives.
however the big prize al qaeda leader osama bin laden had retreated to a mountain redoubt.
inexplicably u s forces failed to press the attack and bin laden escaped over the border into pakistan.
the invasion of iraq on the domestic side bush declared the terrorist threat too big to be contained by ordinary law enforcement means.
he wanted the governments powers of domestic surveillance placed on a wartime footing.
with little debate in 2001 congress september 11 2001 photographers at the scene after a plane crashed into the north tower of new york citys world trade center on september 11 found themselves recording a defining moment in the nations history.
when a second airliner approached and then slammed into the buildings south tower at 9 03 a m the nation knew this was no accident.
the united states was under attack.
of the 2 843 people killed on that day 2 617 died at the world trade center.
robert clark institute artist management.
part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present none of these considerations either singly or together met bushs declared threshold for preventive war.
so the president reluctantly acceded to the demand by americas anxious european allies that the united states go to the un security council which demanded that saddam hussein allow the return of the un weapons inspectors expelled in 1998.
saddam surprisingly agreed.
nevertheless anxious to invade iraq for its own reasons the bush administration geared up for war.
insisting that iraq constituted a grave and gathering danger and ignoring its failure to secure a second legitimizing un resolution bush invaded in march 2003.
americas one major ally in the rush to war was great britain.
relations with france and germany became poisonous.
even neighboring mexico and canada condemned the invasion and turkey a key military ally refused transit permission ruining the armys plan for a northern thrust into iraq.
as for the arab world it exploded in anti american demonstrations.
within three weeks american troops had taken the iraqi capital.
the regime collapsed and its leaders went into hiding saddam hussein was captured nine months later.
but despite meticulous military planning the pentagon had made no provision for postconflict operations.
thousands of poor iraqis looted passed the usa patriot act granting the administration sweeping authority to monitor citizens and apprehend suspected terrorists.
on the international front bush used the war on terror as the premise for a new policy of preventive war.
under international law only an imminent threat justified a nations right to strike first.
now under the so called bush doctrine the united states lowered the bar.
it reserved for itself the right to act in anticipatory self defense in 2002 president bush singled out iran north korea and iraq an axis of evil as the targeted states.
of the three iraq was the preferred mark.
officials in the pentagon regarded iraq as unfinished business left over from the gulf war of 1991.
more grandly they saw in iraq an opportunity to unveil americas supposed mission to democratize the world.
iraqis they believed would abandon the tyrant saddam hussein and embrace democracy if given the chance.
the democratizing effect would spread across the middle east toppling or reforming other unpopular arab regimes and stabilizing the region.
that in turn would secure the middle easts oil supply whose fragility saddams 1990 invasion of kuwait had made all too clear.
it was the oil in the end that was of vital interest to the united states map 31 4.

this map shows the highlights of that troubled involvement from the tehran embassy hostage taking in 1979 to the invasion and current occupation of both iraq and afghanistan.
500 miles 500 kilometers chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present everything they could get their hands on shattering the infrastructure of iraqs cities and leaving them without reliable supplies of electricity and water.
in the midst of this turmoil an insurgency began sparked by sunni muslims who had dominated iraq under saddams baathist regime.
iraqs shiite majority long oppressed by saddam at first welcomed the americans but extremist shiite elements soon turned hostile and u s forces found themselves under fire from both sides.
with the borders unguarded al qaeda supporters flocked in from all over the middle east eager to do battle with the infidel americans bringing along a specialty of the jihad the suicide bomber.
blinded by their own nationalism dominant nations tend to underestimate the strength of nationalism in other people.
lyndon johnson discovered this in vietnam.
soviet premier leonid brezhnev discovered it in afghanistan.
and george w bush rediscovered it in iraq.
although it was hard for americans to believe iraqis of all stripes viewed the u s forces as invaders.
moreover in a war against insurgents no occupation force comes out with clean hands.
in 2004 in iraq that painful truth burst forth graphically in photographs showing american guards at baghdads abu ghraib prison abusing and torturing suspected insurgents.
the ghastly images shocked the world.
for muslims they offered final proof of american treachery.
at that low point in 2004 the united states had spent upward of 100 billion.
more than 1 000 american soldiers had died and 10 000 others had been wounded many maimed for life.
but if the united states pulled out iraq would descend into chaos.
so as bush took to saying the united states had to stay the course abu ghraib this image of one of the milder forms of torture experienced by inmates at the abu ghraib prison was obtained by the associated press in 2003.
it shows a detainee bent over with his hands through the bars of a cell while being watched by a comfortably seated soldier.
this photograph and others showing far worse treatment administered by sometimes jeering military personnel outraged many in the united states and abroad particularly in the muslim world.

the 2004 election as the 2004 presidential election approached rove bushs top advisor theorized that stirring the culture wars and emphasizing patriotism and bushs war on terror would mobilize conservatives to vote for bush.
rove encouraged activists to place antigay initiatives on the ballot in key states to draw conservative voters to the polls in all eleven states would pass ballot initiatives that wrote bans on gay marriage equality into state constitutions that year.
the democratic nominee senator john kerry of massachusetts was a vietnam hero twice wounded and decorated for bravery in contrast to the president who had spent the vietnam years comfortably in the texas air national guard.
but when kerry returned from service in vietnam he had joined the antiwar group vietnam veterans against the war and in 1971 had delivered a blistering critique of the war to the senate armed services committee.
in the logic of the culture wars this made him vulnerable to charges of being weak and unpatriotic.
the democratic convention in august was a tableau of patriotism filled with waving flags retired generals and kerrys vietnam buddies.
however a sudden onslaught of slickly produced television ads by a group calling itself swift boat veterans for truth falsely charging that kerry had lied to win his medals fatally undercut his advantage.
nor did it help that kerry as a three term senator had a lengthy record that was easily mined for hard to explain votes.
republicans tagged him a flip flopper and the accusation endlessly repeated stuck.
nearly 60 percent of eligible voters the highest percentage since 1968 went to the polls.
bush beat kerry with 286 electoral votes to kerrys 252.
in exit polls bush did well among voters part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present for whom moral values and national security were top concerns.
voters told interviewers that bush made them feel safer bush was no longer a minority president.
he had won a clear if narrow popular majority.
violence abroad and economic collapse at home george bushs second term was defined by crisis management.
in 2005 hurricane katrina one of the deadliest hurricanes in the nations history devastated new orleans.
chaos ensued as floodwaters breached earthen barricades surrounding the city.
many residents remained without food drinking water or shelter for days following the storm and deaths mounted the final death toll stood at more than 2 000.
initial emergency responses to the catastrophe by federal and local authorities were uncoordinated and inadequate.
because the hardest hit parts of the city were poor and african american katrina had revealed the poverty and vulnerability at the heart of american cities.
the run of crises did not abate after katrina.
increasing violence and a rising insurgency in iraq made the war there even more unpopular in the united states.
in 2007 changes in u s military strategy helped quell some of the worst violence but the war dragged into its fifth and sixth years under bushs watch.
a war weary public grew impatient.
then in 2008 the american economy began to stumble.
by the fall the dow jones industrial average had lost half its total value and major banks insurance companies and financial institutions were on the verge of collapse.
the entire automobile industry was near bankruptcy.
millions of americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate surged to 10 percent.
housing prices dropped by as much as 40 percent in some parts of the country and millions of americans defaulted on their mortgages.
the united states had entered the worst economic recession since the 1930s what soon became known as the great recession technically the recession had begun in 2007 but its major effects were not felt until the fall of 2008.
the 2008 presidential election took shape in that perilous context.
in a historically remarkable primary season the democratic nomination was contested between the first woman and the first african american to be viable presidential contenders hillary rodham clinton and barack hussein obama.
in a close fought contest obama had emerged by early summer as the nominee.
meanwhile the bush administration confronted an economy in free fall.
in september less than two months before the election secretary of the treasury henry paulson urged congress to pass the emergency economic stabilization act commonly referred to as the bailout of the financial sector.
passed in early october the act dedicated 700 billion to rescuing many of the nations largest banks and brokerage houses.
between congresss actions and the independent efforts of the treasury department and the federal reserve the u s government invested close to 1 trillion in saving the nations financial system.
the obama presidency during his campaign for the presidency against republican senator john mccain barack obama a democratic senator from illinois established himself as a unique figure in american politics.
the son of an african immigrant student and a young white woman from kansas obama was raised in hawaii and indonesia and he easily connected with an increasingly multiracial and multicultural america.
a generation younger than bill clinton and george w bush obama born in 1961 seemed at once a product of the 1960s especially civil rights gains and outside its heated conflicts.
obama took the oath of office of the presidency on january 21 2009 amid the deepest economic recession since the great depression and with the united states mired in two wars in the middle east.
from the podium the new president recognized the crises and worried about a nagging fear that americas decline is inevitable but obama also hoped to strike an optimistic tone.
americans he said must begin again the work of remaking america remaking america a nation that a mere two generations ago would not allow black americans to dine with white americans had elected a black man to the highest office.
obama himself was less taken with this historic accomplishment which was also part of his deliberate strategy to downplay race than with developing a plan to deal with the nations innumerable challenges at home and abroad.
with explicit comparisons to franklin roosevelt obama used the first hundred days of his presidency to lay out an ambitious agenda an economic stimulus package of federal spending to invigorate the economy plans to draw down the war in iraq and refocus american military efforts in afghanistan a reform of the nations health insurance system and new federal laws to regulate wall street.
remarkably the president accomplished much of that agenda.
the democratic controlled congress chapter 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present barack obama in 2008 barack obama became the first african american president in u s history.
and in 2012 he was reelected to a second term.
here president obama and first lady michelle obama walk along pennsylvania avenue during his second inauguration.
chip somodevilla getty images.
elected alongside obama passed the american recovery and reinvestment act an economic stimulus bill that provided 787 billion to state and local governments for schools hospitals and transportation projects roads bridges and rail one of the largest single packages of government spending in american history.
congress next passed the wall street reform and consumer protection act a complex law that added new regulations limiting the financial industry and new consumer protections.
political debate over both measures was heated.
critics on the left argued that obama and congress had been too cautious given the scale of the nations problems while those on the right decried both laws as irresponsible government interference in private investment.
political debate was fiercest however over obamas health insurance reform proposal.
obama encouraged congressional democrats to put forth their own proposals while he worked to find republican allies who might be persuaded to support the first major reform of the nations health care system since the introduction of medicare in 1965.
none came forward.
moreover as debate dragged on a set of far right opposition groups known collectively as the tea party emerged.
giving voice to the extreme individualism and antigovernment sentiment traditionally associated with rightwing movements in the united states the tea party rallied americans against obamas health care bill.
despite the opposition the legislation officially called the patient protection and affordable care act passed and obama signed it into law on identify causes march 23 2010.
however politi as the nations first african cal opposition and the powerful american president what lobbying of the private health kinds of unique challenges insurance industry ensured that did barack obama face the new law contained enough and how did these issues compromises that few could pre impact his presidency.
dict its long term impact.
following the legislative victories of his first two years in office president obama faced a divided congress.
democrats lost control of the house of representatives in 2010 and failed to regain it in 2012.
with the legislative process stalled obama used executive authority to advance his broader cautiously liberal agenda.
in 2011 for instance the president repealed the militarys dont ask dont tell policy and ordered that gay men and lesbians be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces.
and he made two appointments to the supreme court sonia sotomayor in 2009 the first latina to serve on the high court and elena kagan in 2010.
both sotomayor and kagan are committed liberals though they serve on a court that has shifted to the right under chief justice john roberts a george w bush appointee.
war and instability in the middle east even as he pursued an ambitious domestic agenda obama faced two wars in the middle east that he inherited from his predecessor.
determined to end american occupation of iraq the president began in 2010 to draw down part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present troops stationed there and the last convoy of u s soldiers departed in late 2011.
the nine year war in iraq begun to find alleged weapons of mass destruction had followed a long and bloody arc to its end.
disengaging from afghanistan proved more difficult.
early in his first term the president ordered an additional 30 000 american troops to parts of the country where the taliban had regained control a surge he believed necessary to avoid further taliban victories.
securing long term political stability in this fractious nation however has eluded obama.
leaving with the least damage done was his only viable option and he pledged to withdraw all u s troops by 2014.
meanwhile a host of events in the middle east deepened the regions volatility.
in late 2010 a series of multicountry demonstrations and protests dubbed the arab spring began to topple some of the regions autocratic rulers.
leaders in egypt tunisia libya and yemen were forced from power by mass movements calling for greater democracy.
these movements which the obama administration has cautiously supported continue to reverberate in more than a dozen nations in the middle east.
not long after the arab spring was under way in may 2011 u s special forces found and killed osama bin laden in pakistan where he had been hiding for many years.
obama received much praise for the tactics that led to the discovery of bin laden.
more controversial has been the presidents use of drone strikes to assassinate al qaeda leaders and other u s enemies in the region.
climate change american wars and other involvement in the middle east hinged on the regions centrality to global oil production.
oil is important in another sense however its role in climate change.
scientists have known for decades that the production of energy through the burning of carbon based substances especially petroleum and coal increases the presence of socalled greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warming the earth.
increasing temperatures will produce dramatically new weather patterns and rising sea levels developments that threaten agriculture the global distributions of plant and animal life and whole cities and regions at or near the current sea level.
how to halt or at least mitigate climate change has been one of the most pressing issues of the twenty first century.
arriving at a scientific consensus on climate change has proven easier than developing government policies to address it.
this has been especially true in the united states where oil company lobbyists defenders of free market capitalism and conservatives who deny global warming altogether have been instrumental in blocking action.
for instance the united states is not a signatory to the major international treaty the socalled kyoto protocol that is designed to reduce carbon emissions.
legislative proposals have not fared better.
cap and trade legislation so named because it places a cap on individual polluters emissions but allows those companies to trade for more emission allowances from low polluters has stalled in congress.
another proposal a tax on carbon emissions has likewise gained little political support.
there is little doubt however that global climate change and the role of the united states in both causing and mitigating it will remain among the most critical questions of the next decades.
electoral shifts it remains to be seen how the obama presidency will affect american politics.
from one vantage point obama looks like the beneficiary of an electoral shift in a liberal direction.
since 1992 democrats have won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections and in 2008 obama won a greater share of the popular vote nearly 53 percent than either clinton who won 43 percent in 1992 and 49 percent in 1996 or gore 48 percent in 2000.
in his bid for reelection in 2012 against republican nominee mitt romney obama won a lower percentage of the popular vote 51 percent but still won by a comfortable margin of nearly 5 million votes.
he won the support of 93 percent of african americans 71 percent of hispanics 73 percent of asian americans 55 percent of women and 60 percent of americans under the age of thirty.
his coalition was multiracial heavily female and young.
from another vantage point any electoral shift toward liberalism appears contingent and fragile.
even with democratic majorities in both houses of congress that rivaled franklin roosevelts in 1937 and lyndon johnsons in 1965 obama in 2009 2010 was not able to generate political momentum for the kind of legislative advances achieved by those presidential forerunners.
the history of obamas presidency and of the early twenty first century more broadly continues to unfold.
summary this chapter has stressed how globalization the worldwide flow of capital goods and people entered a new phase after the end of the cold war.
the number of multinational corporations many of them based in the united states increased dramatically and people goods and investment capital moved easily across chapter 31 political boundaries.
financial markets in particular grew increasingly open and interconnected across the globe.
technological innovations strengthened the american economy and transformed daily life.
the computer revolution and the spread of the internet changed the ways in which americans shopped worked learned and stayed in touch with family and friends.
globalization facilitated the immigration of millions of asians and latin americans into the united states.
in the decades since 1989 american life has been characterized by the dilemmas presented by the twin issues of globalization and divisive cultural politics.
conservatives spoke out strongly and with increasing effectiveness against multiculturalism and what they viewed as serious threats to family values debates chapter review over access to abortion affirmative action and the legal rights of homosexuals intensified.
the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 diverted attention from this increasingly bitter partisanship but that partisanship was revived after president bushs decision to invade iraq a nation not involved in the events of 9 11 in 2003 led to a protracted war.
when barack obama was elected in 2008 the first african american president in the nations history he inherited two wars and the great recession the most significant economic collapse since the 1930s.
his and the nations efforts to address these and other pressing issues including the national debt and global climate change remain ongoing unfinished business after obamas reelection in 2012.

chapter 30 conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 c h a p t e r 31 confronting global and national dilemmas 1989 to the present global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present for historians the recent past can be a challenge to evaluate and assess.
insufficient time has passed for scholars to weigh the significance of events and to determine which developments will have a lasting effect and which are more fleeting.
nevertheless the period between the early 1980s and our own day has begun to emerge in the minds of historians with some clarity.
scholars generally agree on the eras three most significant developments the resurgence of political conservatism the end of the cold war and the globalization of communications and the economy.
what time magazine publisher henry luce had named the american century in his call for the united states to assume global leadership in the decades after world war ii came decisively to an end in the last quarter of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty first.
the united states lost its role as the worlds dominant economy faced rising competition from a united europe and a surging china and experienced a wide ranging and divisive internal debate over its own values and priorities.
part 9 remains necessarily a work in progress as events continue to unfold however through equal parts conflict struggle and ingenuity americans collectively created a new era in national history after the 1980s which we consider in terms of the aforementioned three developments conservative ascendancy end of the cold war and rising conflict in the middle east the 1980s constituted a crucial period in which the forthright conservatism of ronald reagan and the new right was consolidated in the republican party and challenged the aggressive liberalism of lyndon johnsons great society.
under reagan the conservative agenda reduced the regulatory power of the federal government shrank the welfare state created by liberal democrats during the new deal and the great society and expanded the military.
evangelical christians and conservative lawmakers challenged abortion rights feminism and gay rights setting off a culture war that sharply divided americans.
even as the reagan coalition brought an end to decades of liberal government activism much of the legacy of the new deal was preserved and in some instances expanded.
medicare medicaid and social security survived and grew as a proportion of the federal budget.
conservatives put a stamp on u s foreign policy however dramatically increasing the defense budget and under george w bush asserting a new doctrine of preemptive war that led to a decades long war in iraq.
by the presidential election of 2012 national politics seemed as divided as ever.
americans reelected barack obama but returned a conservative majority to the house of representatives.
polls showed that americans embraced a moderate liberalism on such issues as gay rights and taxes but the national political system remained mired in stalemate.
under ronald reagan between 1981 and 1989 the united states increased government military spending and returned to the sharp cold war rhetoric of earlier decades.
yet during the second half of the 1980s as internal reforms swept through the soviet union reagan softened his stance measuredly and engaged in productive dialogue with the soviet leader mikhail gorbachev.
then between 1989 and 1991 the four decade cold war came to a stunning halt.
the soviet union and its satellite communist regimes in eastern europe collapsed.
the result was in the words of president george h w bush a new world order without a credible rival the united states emerged in the 1990s as the lone military superpower in the world.
in the absence of a clear cold war enemy it intervened in civil wars worked to disrupt terrorist activities and provided humanitarian aid but on a case by case basis guided more by pragmatism than by principle.
the foremost region that occupied u s attention was the middle east where strategic interest in oil supplies remained paramount.
between 1991 and 2011 u s armed forces fought three wars in the region two in iraq and one in afghanistan and became even more deeply embedded in its politics.
the end of the cold war thus brought a dramatic expansion of the u s role in the middle east and renewed debates at home about the proper american role in the world.
part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present globalization and increasing social inequality thematic understanding the post world war ii expansion of the american economy had ended by the early 1970s.
wages stagnated.
inflation skyrocketed.
in the 1980s and 1990s however productivity increased military spending boosted production and new industries such as computer technology emerged.
these developments led to renewed economic growth.
more and more though the economy produced services rather than goods which americans increasingly bought from overseas.
the fall of communism and the end of the cold war had made possible this global expansion of capitalism as multinational corporations moved production to low wage countries and international trade increased.
governments across the world facilitated this process by deregulating financial markets and by creating new trading zones such as the european union eu and the north american free trade agreement nafta.
conservative tax policies deindustrialization the decline of unions and globalization all contributed to a widening inequality between the wealthiest americans and the middle class and poor.
between 2007 and 2010 the negative side of global market deregulation became apparent as europe and much of north america suffered the worst economic downturn since the great depression.
globalization thus brought new economic opportunities and interconnections as well as the potential for renewed economic insecurity.

as a result about freedom and citizenship did many ordinary citizens developed a deep conservatives articulate in the 1980s.
distrust of the muscular great society liberalism of the 1960s.
seizing political advantage amid the trauma and divisions a revived republican party led by the new right offered the nation a fresh way forward economic deregulation low taxes christian morality and a reenergized cold war foreign policy.
the election of president ronald reagan in 1980 symbolized the ascendance of this new political formula and the president himself helped shape the era.
the new right revived confidence in free markets and called for a smaller government role in economic regulation and social welfare.
reagan famously said government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem like the new right generally reagan was profoundly skeptical of the liberal ideology that had informed american public policy since franklin d roosevelts new deal.
his presidency combined an economically conservative domestic agenda with aggressive anticommunism abroad.
reagans foreign policy brought an end to dtente a lessening of tensions with the soviet union which had begun with richard nixon and then unexpectedly a sudden thawing of u s soviet relations laying the groundwork for the end of the cold war.
reagan defined the conservative ascendancy of the 1980s but he did not create the new right groundswell that brought him into office.
grassroots conservative activists in the 1960s and 1970s built a formidable right wing movement that awaited an opportune political moment to challenge for national power.
that moment came in 1980 when democratic president jimmy carters popularity plummeted as a result of his mismanagement of two national crises.
raging inflation and the iranian seizure of u s hostages in tehran undid carter and provided an opening for the new right which would shape the nations politics for the remainder of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty first.

part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present the rise of the new right the great depression and world war ii discredited the traditional conservative program of limited government at home and diplomatic isolationism abroad.
nevertheless a right wing faction survived within the republican party.
its adherents continued to oppose the new deal but reversed their earlier isolationism.
in the postwar decades conservatives pushed for military interventions against communism in europe asia and the developing world while calling for the broadest possible investigation of subversives at home chapter 25.
however conservatives failed to devise policies that could win the allegiance of american voters in the two decades after world war ii.
republicans by and large continued to favor party moderates such as dwight eisenhower thomas dewey and nelson rockefeller.
these were politicians often called liberal republicans who supported much of the new deal endorsed the containment policy overseas and steered a middle course through the volatile social and political changes of the postwar era.
the conservative faction held out hope however that it might one day win the loyalty of a majority of republicans and remake the party in its image.
in the 1960s and 1970s these conservatives invested their hopes for national resurgence in two dynamic figures barry goldwater and ronald reagan.
together the two carried the conservative banner until the national mood grew more receptive to right wing appeals.
barry goldwater and ronald reagan champions of the right the personal odyssey of ronald reagan embodies the story of new right republican conservatism.
before world war ii reagan was a well known movie actor as well as a new deal democrat and admirer of roosevelt.
however he turned away from liberalism partly from self interest he disliked paying high taxes and partly on principle.
as head of the screen actors guild from 1947 to 1952 reagan had to deal with its communist members who formed the understand extreme left wing of the american points of view labor movement.
dismayed by why was the new right their hard line tactics and goals disappointed with the he became a militant anticommrepublican party in the unist.
after nearly a decade as a decades after world spokesperson for the general elecwar ii.
tric corporation reagan joined barry goldwater barry goldwater was a three term senator from arizona before he ran for the presidency in 1964 this photo was taken during the campaign.
goldwaters conservative influence on the republican party was considerable and laid the political groundwork for the rise of ronald reagan a decade and a half later.
everett collection inc alamy.
the republican party in the early 1960s and began speaking for conservative causes and candidates.
one of those candidates was archconservative barry goldwater a republican senator from arizona.
confident in their power centrist republicans did not anticipate that grassroots conservatives could challenge the partys old guard and nominate one of their own for president goldwater himself.
understanding how they did so in 1964 brings us closer to comprehending the forces that propelled reagan to the presidency a decade and a half later.
indeed reagan the politician came to national attention in 1964 with a televised speech at the republican convention supporting goldwater for the presidency.
in a dramatic speech titled a time for choosing reagan warned that if we trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state the nation would take the first step into a thousand years of darkness the conscience of a conservative like reagan goldwater came from the sunbelt where citizens chapter 30 embraced a libertarian spirit of limited government and great personal freedom.
his 1960 book the conscience of a conservative set forth an uncompromising conservatism.
in direct and accessible prose goldwater attacked the new deal state arguing that the natural tendency of government is to expand in the direction of absolutism the problem with the republican party as he saw it was that eisenhower had been too accommodating to liberalism.
when ike told reporters that he was liberal when it comes to human problems goldwater privately fumed.
the conscience of a conservative spurred a republican grassroots movement in support of goldwater.
by distributing his book widely and mobilizing activists at state party conventions conservatives hoped to create such a groundswell of support that goldwater could be drafted to run for president in 1964 something he reportedly did not wish to do.
meanwhile goldwater further enchanted conservatives with another book why not victory in which he criticized the containment policy the strategy of preventing the spread of communism followed by both democrats and republicans since 1947 chapter 25.
it was he complained a policy of timidly refusing to draw our own lines against aggression.
unmarked by pride or the prospect of victory here was a politician saying exactly what conservatives wanted to hear.
grassroots conservatives because moderates dominated the republican party leadership winning the 1964 nomination for goldwater required conservative activists to build their campaign from the bottom up.
they found thousands upon thousands of americans willing to wear down shoe leather for their political hero.
organizations such as the john birch society young americans for freedom and the liberty lobby supplied an army of eager volunteers.
they came from such conservative strongholds as orange county california and the fast growing suburbs of phoenix dallas houston atlanta and other sunbelt metropolises.
a critical boost came in the early spring of 1964 when conservatives outmaneuvered moderates at the state convention of the california republican party which then enthusiastically endorsed goldwater.
the fight had been bruising and one moderate republican warned that sinister forces are at work to take over the whole republican apparatus in california another spur to goldwater backers was the appearance of a book by phyllis schlafly who was then a relatively unknown conservative activist from the midwest.
like goldwaters own book schlaflys a choice not an echo accused moderate republicans of being conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 democrats in disguise that is an echo of democrats.
schlafly who reappeared in the national spotlight in the early 1970s to help halt the ratification of the equal rights amendment denounced the rockefeller republicans of the northeast and encouraged the party to embrace a defiant conservatism.
contrasting goldwaters grassroots republicans with rockefellers kingmakers schlafly hoped to forestall another defeat like 1940 1944 1948 and 1960 democratic victories all.
the conservative groundswell won the republican nomination for goldwater.
however his strident tone and militarist foreign policy were too much for a nation mourning the death of john f kennedy and still committed to liberalism.
democrat lyndon b johnson defeated goldwater in a historic landslide chapter 28.
many believed that goldwater conservatism would wither and die but instead the nearly four million volunteers who had campaigned for the arizona senator swung their support to ronald reagan and built toward the future.
skilled conservative political operatives such as richard viguerie a louisiana born catholic and antiabortion activist applied new computer technology to political campaigning.
viguerie took a list of 12 000 goldwater contributors and used computerized mailing lists to solicit campaign funds rally support for conservative causes and get out the vote on election day.
conservatism was down but not out.
backed financially by wealthy southern californians and supported by goldwaterites reagan won californias governorship in 1966 and again in 1970.
his impassioned rhetoric supporting limited government and law and order he vowed to clean up the mess in berkeley referring to campus radicals won broad support among citizens of the nations most populous state.
more significantly it made him a force in national politics.
his supporters believed that he was in line to succeed nixon as the next republican president.
the watergate scandal intervened however discrediting nixon and making gerald ford the incumbent.
after narrowly losing a campaign against ford for the republican presidential nomination in 1976 reagan was forced to bide his time.
when ford lost to carter in that years election as the partys brightest star reagan was a near lock to be the nominee in 1980.
free market economics and religious conservatism the last phase of reagans rise was the product of several additional developments within the new right.
the burgeoning conservative movement increasingly part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present resembled a three legged stool.
each leg represented an ideological position and a popular conwhat was the threestituency anticommunism freelegged stool of the new market economics and religious right and how did each traditionalism.
uniting all three leg develop within the in a political coalition was no context of the cold war.
religious traditionalists demanded strong government action to implement their faith based agenda while economic conservatives favored limited government and free markets.
both groups however were ardent anticommunists free marketeers loathed the state directed soviet economy and religious conservatives despised the godless secularism of the soviet state.
in the end the success of the new right would come to depend on balancing the interests of economic and moral conservatives.
since the 1950s william f buckley the founder and editor of the conservative magazine national review and milton friedman the nobel prize winning economist at the university of chicago had been the most prominent conservative intellectuals.
convinced that the growth of government must be fought relentlessly buckley used the national review to criticize liberal policy.
for his part friedman became a national conservative icon with the publication of capitalism and freedom 1962 in which he argued that economic freedom is.
an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom friedmans free market ideology along with that of friedrich von hayek another university of chicago economist was taken up by wealthy conservatives who funded think tanks during the 1980s to disseminate market based public policy ideas.
the heritage foundation the american enterprise institute and the cato institute issued policy proposals and attacked liberal legislation and the stranglehold of economic regulation they believed it exerted.
followers of buckley and friedman envisioned themselves as crusaders working against what one conservative called the despotic aspects of egalitarianism the most striking addition to the conservative coalition was the religious right.
until the 1970s politics was an earthly concern of secondary interest to most fundamentalist and evangelical protestants.
but the perception that american society had become immoral combined with the influence of a new generation of popular ministers made politics relevant.
conservative protestants and catholics joined together in a tentative alliance as the religious right condemned divorce abortion premarital sex and feminism.
the route to a moral life and to peace pardon place events in context purpose and power as one evangelical activist said was to plug yourself into the one the only one god charismatic televangelists such as pat robertson and jerry falwell emerged as the champions of a morality based political agenda during the late 1970s.
falwell founder of liberty university and host of the old time gospel hour television program established the moral majority in 1979.
with 400 000 members and 1 5 million in contributions in its first year it would be the organizational vehicle for transforming the fourth great awakening into a religious political movement.
falwell made no secret of his views if you want to know where i am politically he told reporters i thought goldwater was too liberal falwell was not alone.
phyllis schlaflys stop era which became eagle forum in 1975 continued to advocate for conservative public policy focus on the family was jerry falwell the resurgence of evangelical religion in the 1970s was accompanied by a conservative movement in politics known as the religious right.
founded in 1979 by televangelist jerry falwell the moral majority was one of the earliest religious right groups committed to promoting family values and as the title to the record album he is holding in this photo suggests patriotism in american society and politics.

chapter 30 founded in 1977 and a succession of conservative organizations would emerge in the 1980s including the family research council.
the conservative message preached by barry goldwater and ronald reagan had appealed to few american voters in 1964.
then came the series of events that undermined support for the liberal agenda of the democratic party the failed war in vietnam a judiciary that legalized abortion and pornography enforced school busing and curtailed public expression of religion urban riots and a stagnating economy.
by the late 1970s the new right had developed a conservative message that commanded much greater popular support than goldwaters program had.
religious and free market conservatives joined with traditional anticommunist hard liners alongside whites opposed to black civil rights affirmative action and busing in a broad coalition that attacked welfare state liberalism social permissiveness and an allegedly weak and defensive foreign policy.
ronald reagan expertly appealed to all of these conservative constituencies and captured the republican presidential nomination in 1980 american voices p 978.
it had taken almost two decades but the new right appeared on the verge of winning the presidency.
the carter presidency first the republican party had to defeat incumbent president jimmy carter.
carters outsider status and his disdain for professional politicians had made him the ideal post watergate president.
but his ineffectiveness and missteps as an executive also made him the perfect foil for ronald reagan.
carter had an idealistic vision of american leadership in world affairs.
he presented himself as the antinixon a world leader who rejected henry kissingers realism in favor of human rights and peacemaking.
human rights is the soul of our foreign policy carter asserted because human rights is the very soul of our sense of nationhood he established the office of human rights in the state department and withdrew economic and military aid from repressive regimes in argentina uruguay and ethiopia although in realist fashion he still funded equally repressive u s allies such as the philippines south africa and iran.
in latin america carter eliminated a decades old symbol of yankee imperialism by signing a treaty on september 7 1977 turning control of the panama canal over to panama effective december 31 1999.
carters most important efforts came in forging an enduring although in retrospect limited peace in the intractable conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 arab israeli conflict.
in 1978 he invited israeli prime minister menachem begin and egyptian president anwar el sadat to camp david where they crafted a framework for peace under which egypt recognized israel and received back the sinai peninsula which israel had occupied since 1967.
carter deplored what he called the inordinate fear of communism but his efforts at improving relations with the soviet union foundered.
his criticism of the kremlins record on human rights offended soviet leader leonid brezhnev and slowed arms reduction negotiations.
when in 1979 carter finally signed the second strategic arms limitations treaty salt ii limiting bombers and missiles senate hawks objected.
then when the soviet union invaded afghanistan that december carter suddenly endorsed the hawks position and treated the invasion as the gravest threat to world peace since world war ii after ordering an embargo on wheat shipments to the soviet union and withdrawing salt ii from senate consideration carter called for increased defense spending and declared an american boycott of the 1980 summer olympics in moscow.
in a fateful decision he and congress began providing covert assistance to anti soviet fighters in afghanistan some of whom including osama bin laden would metamorphose into anti american islamic radicals decades later.
hostage crisis carters ultimate undoing came in iran however.
the united states had long counted iran as a faithful ally a bulwark against soviet expansion into the middle east and a steady source of oil.
since the 1940s iran had been ruled by mohammad reza shah pahlavi.
ousted by a democratically elected parliament in the early 1950s the shah king sought and received the assistance of the u s central intelligence agency cia which helped him reclaim power in 1953.
american intervention soured iranian views of the united states for decades.
early in 1979 a revolution drove the shah into exile and brought a fundamentalist shiite cleric the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to power shiites represent one branch of islam sunnis the other.
when the united states admitted the deposed shah into the country for cancer treatment iranian students seized the u s embassy in tehran taking sixty six americans hostage.
the captors demanded that the shah be returned to iran for trial.
carter refused.
instead he suspended arms sales to iran and froze iranian assets in american banks.
for the next fourteen months the hostage crisis paralyzed carters presidency.
night after night humiliating pictures of blindfolded american hostages american voices christianity and public life modern social welfare liberalism embodies an ethic of moral pluralism and favors the separation of church and state.
conservative christians challenge the legitimacy of pluralism and secularism and seek through political agitation and legal action to make religion an integral part of public life.
president ronald reagan donald e wildmon the rule of law under god network television as a moral danger reagans candidacy was strongly supported by christian conservatives.
he delivered these remarks to the national association of american evangelicals in 1983.
wildmon was a christian minister a grassroots religious activist and the founder of the american family association.
i want you to know that this administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of america in you her people and in your families churches neighborhoods communities the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under god.
now i dont have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to or at least out of step with a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern day secularism discarding the tried and time tested values upon which our very civilization is based.
no matter how well intentioned their value system is radically different from that of most americans.
and while they proclaim that theyre freeing us from superstitions of the past theyve taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation.
sometimes their voices are louder than ours but they are not yet a majority.
freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under god is acknowledged.
when our founding fathers passed the first amendment they sought to protect churches from government interference.
they never intended to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself.
last year i sent the congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools.
already this session theres growing bipartisan support for the amendment and i am calling on the congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray.

one night during the christmas holidays of 1976 i decided to watch television with my family.
not far into the program was a scene of adultery.
i reacted to the situation in the manner as i had been taught.
i asked one of the children to change channels.
getting involved in the second program we were shocked with some crude profanity.
as i sat in my den that night i became angry.
i had been disturbed by the deterioration of morals i had witnessed in the media and society during the previous twenty five years.
this was accompanied by a dramatic rise in crime a proliferation of pornography increasingly explicit sexual lyrics in music increasing numbers of broken homes a rise in drug and alcohol use among the youth and various other negative factors.
realizing that these changes were being brought into the sanctity of my home i decided i could and would no longer remain silent.
this great struggle is one of values particularly which ones will be the standard for our society and a base for our system of justice in the years to come.
for 200 years our country has based its morals its sense of right and wrong on the christian view of man.
the ten commandments and the sermon on the mount have been our solid foundation.
television is the most pervasive and persuasive medium we have.
at times it is larger than life.
it is our only true national medium.
network television is the greatest educator we have.
it is teaching that adultery is an acceptable and approved lifestyle.
it is teaching that hardly anyone goes to church that very few people in our society are christian or live by christian principles.
by simply censoring christian characters christian values and christian culture from the programs.

a bartlett giamatti the moral majority as a threat to liberty a bartlett giamatti was the president of yale university 1978 1986 and subsequently commissioner of major league baseball.
he offered these remarks to the entering class of yale undergraduates in 1981.
a self proclaimed moral majority and its satellite or client groups cunning in the use of a native blend of old intimidation and new technology threaten the values of pluralism and freedom.
from the maw of this morality come those who presume to know what justice for all is come those who presume to know which books are fit to read which television programs are fit to watch.
from the maw of this morality rise the tax exempt savonarolas who believe they and they alone possess the truth there is no debate no discussion no dissent.
what nonsense.
what dangerous malicious nonsense.
we should be concerned that so much of our political and religious leadership acts intimidated for the moment and will not say with clarity that this most recent denial of the legitimacy of differentness is a radical assault on the very pluralism of peoples political beliefs values forms of merit and systems of religion our country was founded to welcome and foster.
liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.
in our tradition the state is not omnipresent in the home.
and there are other spheres of our lives and existence outside the home where the state should not be a dominant presence.
freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.
liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought belief expression and certain intimate conduct.
in houston texas officers of the harris county police department were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons disturbance.
they entered an apartment where one of the petitioners john geddes lawrence resided.
the officers observed lawrence and another man tyron garner engaging in a sexual act.
the two petitioners were arrested held in custody over night and charged and convicted before a justice of the peace.
the complaints described their crime as deviate sexual intercourse namely.
sex with a member of the same sex man.
we conclude the case should be resolved by determining whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.
the texas statute in question seeks to control a personal relationship that whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.
the liberty protected by the constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice.
the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.
the state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.
their right to liberty under the due process clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.

part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present american hostages in iran images of blindfolded handcuffed american hostages seized by iranian militants at the u s embassy in tehran in november 1979 shocked the nation and created a foreign policy crisis that eventually cost president carter his chance for reelection.

appeared on television newscasts.
an attempt to mount a military rescue in april 1980 had to be in terms of presidential aborted because of equipment politics and policy how failures in the desert.
several successful was jimmy months later however a stunning carters term coming development changed the calcubetween two republicans lus on both sides iraq led by nixon and reagan.
saddam hussein invaded iran officially because of a dispute over deep water ports but also to prevent the shiite led iranian revolution from spreading across the border into sunni run iraq.
desperate to focus his nations attention on iraqs invasion khomeini began to talk with the united states about releasing the hostages.
difficult negotiations dragged on past the american presidential election in november 1980 and the hostages were finally released the day after carter left office a final indignity endured by a well intentioned but ineffectual president.
place events in context the election of 1980 president carters sinking popularity hurt his bid for reelection.
when the democrats barely renominated him over his liberal challenger edward ted kennedy of massachusetts carters approval rating was historically low a mere 21 percent of americans believed that he was an effective president.
the reasons were clear.
economically millions of citizens were feeling the pinch from stagnant wages high inflation crippling mortgage rates and an unemployment rate of nearly 8 percent.
in international affairs the nation blamed carter for his weak response to soviet expansion and the iranians seizure of american diplomats.
with carter on the defensive reagan remained upbeat and decisive.
this is the greatest country in the world reagan reassured the nation in his warm baritone voice.
we have the talent we have the drive.
all we need is the leadership to emphasize his intention to be a formidable international leader reagan hinted that he would take strong action to win the hostages return.
to signal his rejection of liberal policies he declared his opposition to affirmative action and forced busing and promised to get the government off our backs most important reagan effectively appealed to the many americans who felt financially insecure.
in a televised debate with carter reagan emphasized the hardships facing workingand middle class americans in an era of stagflation and asked them are you better off today than you were four years ago in november the voters gave a clear answer.
they repudiated carter giving him only 41 0 percent of the vote.
independent candidate john anderson garnered 6 6 percent with a few minor candidates receiving fractions of a percent and reagan won with 50 7 percent of the popular vote map 30 1.
moreover the republicans elected thirty three new members of the house of representatives and twelve new senators chapter 30 26 13 6 12 3 washington d c.
candidate ronald reagan republican jimmy carter democrat electoral vote popular vote percent of popular vote 43 899 248 50 7 35 481 435 41 0 john b anderson independent 5 719 437 6 6 minor parties 1 395 558 map 30 1 the presidential election of 1980 ronald reagan easily defeated democratic incumbent jimmy carter taking 50 7 percent of the popular vote to carters 41 0 percent and winning the electoral vote in all but six states and the district of columbia.
reagan cut deeply into the traditional democratic coalition by wooing many southern whites urban ethnics and blue collar workers.
more than five million americans expressed their discontent with carters ineffectiveness and reagans conservatism by voting for independent candidate john anderson a longtime republican member of the house of representatives.
which gave them control of the u s senate for the first time since 1954.
the new rights long road to national power had culminated in an election victory that signaled a new political alignment in the country.
the dawning of the conservative age by the time ronald reagan took office in 1981 conservatism commanded wider popular support than at any time since the 1920s.
as the new deal democratic coalition continued to fragment the republican party accelerated the realignment of the american electorate that had begun during the 1960s.
conservatisms ascendancy did more than realign the nation politically.
its emphasis on free markets low taxes and individual success shaped the nations culture and inaugurated a conservative era.
reagan exhorted americans let conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 the men and women of the marketplace decide what they want the reagan coalition reagans decades in public life especially his years working for general electric had equipped him to articulate conservative ideas in easily understandable aphorisms.
speaking against the growing size and influence of government reagan said concentrated power has always been the enemy of liberty under his leadership the core of the republican party remained the relatively affluent white protestant voters who supported balanced budgets opposed government activism feared communism and believed in a strong national defense.
reagan republicanism also attracted middle class suburbanites and migrants to the sunbelt states who endorsed the conservative agenda of combating crime and limiting social welfare spending.
suburban growth in particular a phenomenon that reshaped metropolitan areas across the country in the 1960s and 1970s benefitted conservatives politically.
suburban traditions of privatization and racial homogeneity combined with the amenities of middle class comfort made the residents of suburban cities more inclined to support conservative public policies.
this emerging reagan coalition was joined by a large and electorally key group of former democrats that had been gradually moving toward the republican party since 1964 southern whites.
reagan capitalized on the southern strategy developed by richard nixons advisors in the late 1960s.
many southern whites had lost confidence in the democratic party for a wide range of reasons but one factor stood out the partys support for civil rights.
when reagan came to philadelphia mississippi to deliver his first official speech as the republican presidential nominee his ringing endorsement of states rights sent a clear message he validated twenty five years of southern opposition to federal civil rights legislation.
some of reagans advisors had warned him not to go to philadelphia the site of the tragic murder of three civil rights workers in 1964 but reagan believed the opportunity to launch his campaign on a states rights note too important.
after 1980 compare and southern whites would remain a contrast cornerstone of the republican what different constituencies made up the reagan coalition.

ronald reagan presidential library.
two million new voters for the 1980 election and the republican partys platform reflected its influence.
that platform called for a constitutional ban on abortion voluntary prayer in public schools and a mandatory death penalty for certain crimes.
republicans also demanded an end to court mandated busing to achieve racial integration in schools and for the first time in forty years opposed the equal rights amendment.
within the republican party conservatism had triumphed.
reagans broad coalition attracted the allegiance of another group dissatisfied with the direction of liberalism in the 1970s blue collar voters a high number of catholics among them alarmed by antiwar protesters and rising welfare expenditures and hostile to feminist demands.
some observers saw these voters which many called reagan democrats as coming from the silent majority that nixon had swung into the republican fold in 1968 and 1972.
they lived in heavily industrialized midwestern states such as michigan ohio and illinois and had been a core part of the democratic coalition for three decades.
reagans victory in the 1980s thus hinged on both a revival of right wing conservative activism and broad dissatisfaction with liberal democrats a dissatisfaction that had been building since 1968 but had been interrupted by the post watergate backlash against the republican party.
conservatives in power the new president kept his political message clear and simple.
what i want to see above all he remarked is that this country remains a country where someone can always get rich standing in the way reagan believed was government.
in his first year in office reagan and his chief advisor james a baker iii quickly set new governmental priorities.
to roll back the expanded liberal state they launched a threepronged assault on federal taxes social welfare spending and the regulatory bureaucracy.
to prosecute the cold war they advocated a vast increase in defense spending and an end to dtente with the soviet union.
and to match the resurgent economies of germany and japan they set out to restore american leadership of the worlds capitalist societies and to inspire renewed faith in free markets reaganomics to achieve its economic objectives the new administration advanced a set of policies quickly dubbed reaganomics to increase the production and thus the supply of goods.
the theory underlying supply side economics as this approach was called emphasized investment in productive enterprises.
according to supply side theorists the best way to bolster investment was to reduce the taxes paid by chapter 30 corporations and wealthy americans who could then use these funds to expand production.
supply siders maintained that the resulting economic expansion would increase government revenues and offset the loss of tax dollars stemming from the original tax cuts.
meanwhile the increasing supply would generate its own demand as consumers stepped forward to buy ever more goods.
supply side theory presumed in fact gambled that future tax revenues would make up for present tax cuts.
the idea had a growing list of supporters in congress led by an exprofessional football player from buffalo named jack kemp.
kemp praised supply side economics as an alternative to the slow growth recession oriented policies of the carter administration reagan took advantage of republican control of the senate as well as high profile allies such as kemp to win congressional approval of the 1981 economic recovery tax act erta a massive tax cut that embodied supply side principles.
the act reduced income tax rates for most americans by 23 percent over three years.
for the wealthiest americans those with millions to invest the highest marginal tax rate dropped from 70 to 50 percent.
the act also slashed estate taxes levies on inheritances instituted during the progressive era to prevent the transmission of huge fortunes from one generation to the next.
finally the new legislation trimmed the taxes paid by business corporations by 150 billion over a period of five years.
as a result of erta by 1986 the annual revenue of the federal government had been cut by 200 billion nearly half a trillion in 2010 dollars.
david stockman reagans budget director hoped to match this reduction in tax revenue with a comparable cutback in federal expenditures.
to meet this ambitious goal he proposed substantial cuts in social security and medicare.
but congress and even the president himself rejected his idea they were not willing to antagonize middle class and elderly voters who viewed these government entitlements as sacred.
as conservative columnist george will noted ironically americans are conservative.
what they want to conserve is the new deal after defense spending social security and medicare were by far the nations largest budget items reductions in other programs would not achieve the savings the administration desired.
this contradiction between new right republican ideology and political reality would continue to frustrate the party into the twenty first century.
a more immediate embarrassment confronted conservatives however.
in a 1982 atlantic article stockman admitted that supply side theory was based conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 on faith not economics.
to produce optimistic projections of higher tax revenue in future years stockman had manipulated the figures.
worse stockman told the atlantic reporter candidly that supply side theory was based on a long discredited idea the trickle down notion that helping the rich would eventually benefit the lower and middle classes.
stockman had drawn back the curtain much to republicans consternation on the flawed reasoning of supply side theory.
but it was too late.
the plan had passed congress and since stockman could not cut major programs such as social security and medicare he had few options to balance the budget.
as the administrations spending cuts fell short the federal budget deficit increased dramatically.
military spending contributed a large share of the growing national debt.
but president reagan remained undaunted.
defense is not a budget item he declared.
you spend what you need to make america number one again reagan and defense secretary caspar weinberger pushed through congress a five year 1 2 trillion military spending program in 1981.
during reagans presidency military spending accounted for one fourth of all federal expenditures and contributed to rising annual budget deficits the amount overspent by the government in a single year and a skyrocketing national debt the cumulative total of all budget deficits.
by the time reagan left office the total federal debt had tripled rising from 930 billion in 1981 to 2 8 trillion in 1989.
the rising annual deficits of the 1980s contradicted reagans pledge of fiscal conservatism figure 30 1.
deregulation advocates of reaganomics asserted that excessive regulation by federal agencies impeded economic growth.
deregulation of prices in the trucking airline and railroad industries had begun under president carter in the late 1970s but reagan expanded the mandate to include cutting back on government protections of consumers workers and the environment.
some of the targeted federal bureaucracies such as the u s department of labor had risen to prominence during the new deal others such as the occupational safety and health administration osha and the environmental protection agency epa had been created during the johnson and nixon administrations.
although these agencies provided many services to business corporations they also increased their costs by protecting the rights of workers mandating safety improvements in factories and requiring expensive equipment to limit the release of toxic chemicals into the environment.
to reduce the part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present figure 30 1 in billions the annual federal budget deficit or surplus 1940 2009 clinton 200 400 600 world war ii r reagan and g h w bush 800 g w bush 1 000 1 200 1 400 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2009 reach of federal regulatory agencies the reagan administration in 1981 cut their budgets by an average of 12 percent.
reagan also rendered regulatory agencies less effective by staffing them with leaders who were opposed to the agencies missions.
james watt an outspoken conservative who headed the department of the interior attacked environmentalism as a left wing cult acting on his free enterprise principles watt opened public lands for use by private businesses oil and coal corporations large scale ranchers and timber companies.
anne gorsuch burford whom reagan appointed to head the epa likewise disparaged environmentalists and refused to cooperate with congress to clean up toxic waste sites under a program known as the superfund.
the sierra club and other environmental groups aroused enough public outrage about these appointees that the administration changed its position.
during president reagans second term he significantly increased the epas budget and added acreage to the national wilderness preservation system and animals and plants to the endangered species lists.
ultimately as these adjustments demonstrate politics in the united states remained the art of the possible savvy politicians know when to advance and when to retreat.
having attained two of his prime goals a major tax cut and a draexplain matic increase in defense spendconsequences ing reagan did not seriously why was reagan unable attempt to scale back big governto reduce federal expendiment and the welfare state.
when tures as much as many of he left office in 1989 federal his supporters had hoped.
spending stood at 22 1 percent of during world war ii the federal government incurred an enormous budget deficit.
but between 1946 and 1965 it ran either an annual budget surplus or incurred a relatively small debt.
the annual deficits rose significantly during the vietnam war and the stagflation of the 1970s but they really exploded between 1982 and 1994 in the budgets devised by the ronald reagan and george h w bush administrations and again between 2002 and 2005 in those prepared by george w bush.
the republican presidents increased military spending while cutting taxes an enjoy it now philosophy that transferred costs to future generations of americans.
the gross domestic product gdp and federal taxes at 19 percent of gdp both virtually the same as in 1981.
in the meantime though the federal debt had tripled in size and the number of government workers had increased from 2 9 to 3 1 million.
this outcome because it cut against the presidents rhetoric about balancing budgets and downsizing government elicited harsh criticism from some conservative commentators.
there was no reagan revolution one conservative noted.
a former reagan aide offered a more balanced assessment ronald reagan did far less than he had hoped.
and a hell of a lot more than people thought he would remaking the judiciary even if he did not achieve everything many of his supporters desired reagan left an indelible imprint on politics public policy and american culture.
one place this imprint was felt in far reaching ways was the judiciary where reagan and his attorney general edwin meese aimed at reversing the liberal judicial philosophy that had prevailed since the late 1950s.
during his two terms reagan appointed 368 federal court judges most of them with conservative credentials and three supreme court justices sandra day oconnor 1981 antonin scalia 1986 and anthony kennedy 1988.
ironically oconnor and kennedy turned out to be far less devoted to new right conservatism than reagan and his supporters imagined.
oconnor the first woman to serve on the court shaped its decision making as a swing vote between liberals and conservatives.
kennedy also emerged as a judicial moderate leaving scalia as reagans only genuinely conservative appointee.
chapter 30 another barrier falls in 1981 sandra day oconnor shown here with chief justice warren burger was appointed to the supreme court by president ronald reagan the first woman to serve on that body.
in 1993 she was joined by ruth bader ginsburg an appointee of president bill clinton.
oconnor emerged as a leader of the moderate bloc on the court during the 1990s she retired in 2006.
but reagan also elevated justice william rehnquist a conservative nixon appointee to the position of chief justice.
under rehnquists leadership 1986 2005 the courts conservatives took an activist stance limiting the reach of federal laws ending court ordered busing and endorsing constitutional protection of property rights.
however on controversial issues such as individual liberties abortion rights affirmative action and the rights of criminal defendants the presence of oconnor enabled the court to resist the rightward drift and to maintain a moderate position.
as a result the justices scaled back but did not usually overturn the liberal rulings of the warren and burger courts.
in the controversial webster v reproductive health services 1989 for instance scalia pushed for the justices to overturn the abortion rights decision in roe v wade 1973.
oconnor refused but she nonetheless approved the constitutional validity of state laws that limited the use of public funds and facilities for abortions.
a more conservative federal judiciary would remain a significant institutional legacy of the reagan presidency.
conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 hiv aids another conservative legacy was the slow national response to one of the worst disease epidemics of the postwar decades.
the human immunodeficiency virus hiv a deadly though slow acting pathogen developed in africa when a chimpanzee virus jumped to humans immigrants carried it to haiti and then to the united states during the 1970s.
in 1981 american physicians identified hiv as a new virus one that caused a disease known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids.
hundreds of gay men who were prominent among the earliest carriers of the virus were dying of aids.
within two decades hiv aids had spread worldwide infected more than 50 million people of both sexes and killed more than 20 million.
within the united states aids took nearly a hundred thousand lives in the 1980s more than were lost in the korean and vietnam wars combined.
however because its most prominent early victims were gay men president reagan emboldened by new right conservatives hesitated in declaring a national health emergency.
some of reagans advisors asserted that this gay disease might even be gods punishment of homosexuals.
between 1981 and 1986 as the epidemic spread the reagan administration took little action worse it prevented the surgeon general c everett koop from speaking forthrightly to the nation about the disease.
pressed by gay activists and prominent health officials from across the country in reagans last years in office the administration finally began to devote federal resources to treatment for hiv and aids patients and research into possible vaccines.
but the delay had proved costly inhumane and embarrassing.
morning in america during his first run for governor of california in 1966 reagan held a revelatory conversation with a campaign consultant.
politics is just like the movies reagan told him.
you have a hell of an opening coast for a while and then have a hell of a close reagan indeed had a hell of an opening one of the most lavish and expensive presidential inaugurations in american history in 1981 and another in 1985 showing that he was unafraid to celebrate luxury and opulence even with millions of americans unemployed.
following his spectacular inauguration reagan quickly won passage of his tax reduction bill and launched his plan to bolster the pentagon.
but then a long coasting period descended on his presidency during which he retreated on tax cuts and navigated a major foreign policy scandal.
finally toward the end of his two term presidency reagan found his hell of part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present hiv aids the hiv aids epidemic hit the united states in the early 1980s and remained a major social and political issue throughout the decade.
here aids patients and their supporters participate in the 1987 march on washington for gay and lesbian rights demanding that the reagan administration commit more federal resources to finding a cure for the deadly disease.
bettmann corbis.
a close leaving office as major reforms which he encouraged from afar had begun to tear apart the soviet union and bring an end to the cold war.
through all the ups and downs reagan remained a master of the politics of symbolism championing a resurgent american economy and reassuring the country that the pursuit of wealth was noble and that he had the reins of the nation firmly in hand.
reagans tax cuts had barely taken effect when he was forced to reverse course.
high interest rates set by the federal reserve board had cut the runaway inflation of the carter years.
but these rates as high as 18 percent sent the economy into a recession in 1981 1982 that put 10 million americans out of work and shuttered 17 000 businesses.
unemployment neared 10 percent the highest rate since the great depression.
these troubles combined with the booming deficit forced reagan to negotiate a tax increase with congress in 1982 to the loud complaints of supply side diehards.
the presidents job rating plummeted and in the 1982 midterm elections democrats picked up twenty six seats in the house of representatives and seven state governorships.
election of 1984 fortunately for reagan the economy had recovered by 1983 restoring the presidents job approval rating just in time for the 1984 presidential election.
during the campaign reagan emphasized the economic resurgence touring the country promoting his tax policies and the nations new prosperity.
the democrats nominated former vice president walter mondale of minnesota.
with strong ties to labor unions ethnic and racial minority groups and party leaders mondale epitomized the new deal coalition.
he selected representative geraldine ferraro of new york as his running mate the first woman to run on the presidential ticket of a major political party.
neither ferraros presence nor mondales credentials made a difference however reagan won a landslide victory losing only minnesota and the district of columbia.
still democrats retained their majority in the house and in 1986 regained control of the senate.
reagans 1984 campaign slogan its morning in america projected the image of a new day dawning on a confident people.
in reagan mythology the united states was an optimistic nation of small towns closeknit families and kindly neighbors.
the success story of america he once said is neighbor helping neighbor the mythology may not have reflected the actual nation which was overwhelmingly urban and suburban and in which the hard knocks of capitalism held down more than opportunity elevated but that mattered little.
reagans remarkable ability to produce chapter 30 conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 presidential landscaping as the cartoon published by the arkansas gazette illustrates powerful imagery was also wielded by reagans political opponents.
used with permission arkansas democrat gazette 1984 positive associations and feelings alongside robust economic growth after the 1981 1982 recession helped make the 1980s a decade characterized by both backward looking nostalgia and aggressive capitalism.
return to prosperity between 1945 and the 1970s the united states was the worlds leading exporter of agricultural products manufactured goods and investment capital.
then american manufacturers lost market share undercut by cheaper and better designed products from west germany and japan.
by 1985 for the first time since 1915 the united states registered a negative balance of international payments.
it now imported more goods and capital than it exported.
the country became a debtor rather than a creditor nation.
the rapid ascent of the japanese economy to become the worlds second largest was a key factor in this historic reversal america compared p 988.
more than one third of the american annual trade deficit of 138 billion in the 1980s was from trade with japan whose corporations exported huge quantities of electronic goods and made nearly one quarter of all cars bought in the united states.
meanwhile american businesses grappled with a worrisome decline in productivity.
between 1973 and 1992 american productivity the amount of goods or services per hour of work grew at the meager rate of 1 percent a year a far cry from the post world war ii rate of 3 percent.
because managers wanted to cut costs the wages of most employees stagnated.
further because of foreign competition the number of high paying union protected manufacturing jobs shrank.
by 1985 more people in the united states worked for mcdonalds slinging big macs than rolled out rails girders and sheet steel in the nations steel industry.
a brief return to competitiveness in the second half of the 1980s masked the steady long term transformation of the economy that had begun in the 1970s.
the nations heavy industries steel autos chemicals continued to lose market share to global competitors.
nevertheless the u s economy grew at the impressive average rate of 2 to 3 percent per year for much of the late 1980s and 1990s with a short recession in 1990 1991.
what had changed was the direction of growth and its beneficiaries.
increasingly financial services medical services and computer technology service industries broadly speaking were the leading sectors of growth.
this shift in the underlying foundation of the american economy from manufacturing to service from making things to producing services would have long term consequences for the global competitiveness of u s industries and the value of the dollar.
culture of success the economic growth of the second half of the 1980s popularized the materialistic values championed by the free marketeers.
every era has its capitalist heroes but americans in the 1980s celebrated wealth accumulation in ways unseen since the 1920s.
when the president christened self made entrepreneurs the heroes for the eighties he probably had people like lee iacocca in mind.

during the 1980s he lived in the united states as a columnist and later bureau chief for the asahi shimbun one of japans most important daily newspapers.
as japan struggled to rebuild itself after world war ii the charismatic shigeru yoshida prime minister during the critical years of 1948 to 1952 called on the country to be a good loser.
the japanese have lost the war he said but they must not lose heart.
japan must cooperate with the united states and pull itself out of misery and disgrace.
the japanese did indeed cooperate willingly with the allied occupation with the american and british devils whom they had been taught for years to despise to the very core of their souls.
postwar japan went on to prove that it could indeed be a good loser.
under the new constitution promulgated under the guidance of the occupation it has developed into a democratic country with a relatively moderate disparity between rich and poor and a stable smoothly functioning political system.
the japanese u s relationship has thus come to occupy a truly unique position in world history.
never before has a multiethnic contract based society and a homogenous traditional society joined together to form such a powerful team.
as global powers japan and the united states combined have a decisive impact on world politics it follows that their future relations will largely determine the blueprints of multilateral cooperation and world stability in the coming century.
potential sources of bilateral friction are as numerous as ever the trade imbalance market liberalization growing japanese investment in the united states heavy u s dependence on japanese technology and so on.
occasional outbursts of economic nationalism or revisionist thinking are probably inevitable as the debate over these issues unfolds.
of far greater concern however is that japaneseu s.
relations now face their gravest challenge since 1945.
the end of the cold war has drastically altered the global geopolitical and geoeconomic context that shaped japanese u s relations.
both countries now face the urgent need to redefine their relationship to suit the new context.
before they can build a strong bilateral relationship americans and japanese must outgrow their obsession with being number one.
this psychological adjustment is absolutely necessary for both peoples.
projecting the nature of its own hierarchical society japan tends to view the rest of the world it is said in terms of ranking.
this inclination fosters behavior patterns that are oriented more toward what to be than what to do.
japan is also overly conscious of itself as a late starter having entered modern international society only in the mid nineteenth century and this history has made catching up with and outpacing other countries a sort of national pastime.
it may be even more difficult for the united states which dominated the free world during the cold war to make the psychological adjustments required to enter into a partnership with japan that is truly equal.

americans had not set aside the traditional work ethic but the reagan era public was fascinated with money and celebrity.

one of the most enthralling of the eras money moguls was donald trump a real estate developer who craved publicity.

bill gates paul allen steve jobs and steve wozniak were four entrepreneurs who pioneered the computer revolution in the late 1970s and 1980s thinking like a historian p 990.
they took a technology that had been used exclusively for large scale enterprises the military and multinational corporations and made it accessible to individual consumers.
scientists had devised the first computers for military purposes during world war ii.
cold war military research subsequently funded the construction of large mainframe computers.
but government and private sector conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 first generation computers were bulky cumbersome machines that had to be placed in large air conditioned rooms.
between the 1950s and the 1970s concluding with the development of the microprocessor in 1971 each generation of computers grew faster and smaller.
by the mid 1970s a few microchips the size of the letter o on this page provided as much processing power as a world war ii era computer.
the day of the personal computer pc had arrived.
working in the san francisco bay area jobs and wozniak founded apple computers in 1976 and within a year were producing small individual computers that could be easily used by a single person.
when apple enjoyed success other companies scrambled to get into the market.

in 1975 they founded the microsoft corporation whose ms dos and windows operating systems soon dominated the software industry.
by 2000 the companys products ran nine out of every ten personal computers in the united states and a majority of those around the world.
gates and allen became billionaires and microsoft exploded into a huge company with 57 000 employees and annual revenues of 38 billion.
in three decades the computer had moved from a few military research centers to thousands of corporate offices and then to millions of peoples homes.
ironically in an age that celebrated free market capitalism government research and government funding had played an enormous role in the development of the most important technology since television.
the end of the cold war ronald reagan entered office determined to confront the soviet union diplomatically and militarily.
backed by republican and democratic hard liners alike reagan unleashed some of the harshest cold war rhetoric since the 1950s labeling the soviet union an evil thinking like a historian personal computing a technological revolution considered historically computers are a strikingly new phenomenon.
the ancestors of the first computers were developed in the 1940s using vacuum tubes and transistors.
integrated circuits were introduced in the 1950s and the first microprocessor in the 1970s.
prior to the decade of the 1980s only the federal government and large corporations and institutions used computers which were massive in size and expensive to purchase.
in the 1980s inventors and entrepreneurs developed the first personal computers which could fit on desks or tables and were soon within the price range of ordinary families.
the computers we know today date from that decade.
another enormous change came in the mid 1990s when the internet whose forerunner was a u s defense department computer network became widely available to the public for the first time.
moores law 1965.
in 1965 the electronics engineer gordon moore calculated that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubled roughly every two years meaning that the power of computers was increasing at that rate.
the complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year.
certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue if not increase.
that means by 1975 the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum cost will be 65 000.
i believe that such a large circuit can be built on a single wafer.

interview with steve jobs february 1 1985.
apple founder steve jobs one of the pioneers of the personal computer discusses the future of computers and computer networks.
question why should a person buy a computer.
steve jobs there are different answers for different people.
in business that question is easy to answer you can really prepare documents much faster and at a higher quality level and you can do many things to increase office productivity.
a computer frees people from much of the menial work.
remember computers are tools.
tools help us do our work better.
in education computers are the first thing to come along since books that will sit there and interact with you endlessly without judgment.
question what will change.
steve jobs the most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home in the future will be to link it into a nationwide communications network.
were just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people as remarkable as the telephone.

part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present empire and vowing that it would end up on the ash heap of history in a remarkable turnaround however by his second term reagan had decided that this goal would be best achieved by actively cooperating with mikhail gorbachev the reform minded russian communist leader.
the downfall of the soviet union in 1991 ended the nearly fifty year long cold war but a new set of foreign challenges quickly emerged.
u s soviet relations in a new era when reagan assumed the presidency in 1981 he broke with his immediate predecessors richard nixon gerald ford and jimmy carter in cold war strategy.
nixon regarded himself as a realist in foreign affairs.
that meant above all advancing the national interest without regard to ideology.
nixons policy of dtente with the soviet union and china embodied this realist view.
president carter endorsed dtente and continued to push for relaxing cold war tensions.
this worked for a time but the soviet invasion of afghanistan empowered hard liners in the u s congress and forced carter to take a tougher line which he did with the olympic boycott and grain embargo.
this was the relationship reagan inherited in 1981 a decade of dtente that had produced a noticeable relaxation of tensions with the communist world followed by a year of tense standoffs over soviet advances into central asia which threatened u s interests in the middle east.
reagans cold war revival conservatives did not believe in dtente.
neither did they believe in the containment policy that had guided u s.
cold war strategy since 1947.
reagan and his advisors wanted to defeat not merely contain the soviet union.
his administration pursued a two pronged strategy toward that end.
first it abandoned dtente and set about rearming america.
reagans military budgets authorized new weapons systems dramatically expanded military bases and significantly expanded the nations nuclear arsenal.
this buildup in american military strength reasoned secretary of defense caspar weinberger would force the soviets into an arms race that would strain their economy and cause domestic unrest.
one of the most controversial aspects of the buildup was reagans proposal for a strategic defense initiative popularly known as star wars a satellite based system that would theoretically destroy nuclear missiles in flight.
scientists doubted its viability and it was never built.
the reagan administration also proposed the strategic arms reduction talks start with the soviet union in which the united states put forward a plan calculated to increase american advantage in sea and air based nuclear systems over the soviets ground based system.
second the president supported cia initiatives to roll back soviet influence in the developing world by funding anticommunist movements in angola mozambique afghanistan and central america.
to accomplish this objective reagan supported repressive right wing regimes.
nowhere was this more conspicuous in the 1980s than in the central american countries of guatemala nicaragua and el salvador.
conditions were unique in each country but held to a pattern the united states sided with military dictatorships and oligarchies if democratically elected governments or left wing movements sought support from the soviet union.
in guatemala this approach produced a brutal military rule thousands of opponents of the government were executed or kidnapped.
in nicaragua reagan actively encouraged a coup against the left wing sandinista government which had overthrown the u s backed strongman anastasio somoza.
and in el salvador the u s backed government maintained secret death squads which murdered members of the opposition.
in each case reagan blocked soviet influence but the damage done to local communities and to the international reputation of the united states as in vietnam was great.
iran contra reagans determination to oppose leftwing movements in central america engulfed his administration in a major scandal during the presidents second term.
for years reagan had denounced iran as an outlaw state and a supporter of terrorism.
but in 1985 he wanted its help.
to win irans assistance in freeing two dozen american hostages held by hezbollah a pro iranian shiite group in lebanon the administration sold arms to iran without public or congressional knowledge.
while this secret arms deal was diplomatically and politically controversial the use of the resulting profits in nicaragua was explicitly illegal.
to overthrow the democratically elected sandinistas whom the president accused of threatening u s business interests reagan ordered the cia to assist an armed opposition group called the contras map 30 2.
although reagan praised the contras as freedom fighters congress worried that the president and other executive branch agencies were assuming warmaking powers that the constitution reserved to the legislature.
in 1984 congress banned the cia and all other government agencies from providing any military support to the contras.
chapter 30 conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 iran contra the 1987 iran contra congressional hearings which lasted more than a month and were broadcast on live television helped to uncover a secret and illegal white house scheme to provide arms to the nicaraguan contras.
though lt col oliver north shown here during his testimony before congress concocted much of the scheme and was convicted of three felonies he never served prison time and emerged from the hearings as a populist hero among american conservatives who saw him as a patriot.

oliver north a lieutenant colonel in the u s marines and an aide to the national security council defied that ban.
with the tacit or explicit consent of high ranking administration officials including the president north used the profits from the iranian arms deal to assist the contras.
when asked whether he knew of norths illegal actions reagan replied i dont remember the iran contra affair not only resulted in the prosecution of north and several other officials but also weakened reagan domestically he proposed no bold domestic policy initiatives in his last two years.
but the president remained steadfastly engaged in international affairs where events were unfolding that would bring a dramatic close to the cold war.
gorbachev and soviet reform the soviet system of state socialism and central economic planning had transformed russia from an agricultural to an industrial society between 1917 and the 1950s.
but it had done so inefficiently.
lacking the incentives of a market economy most enterprises hoarded raw materials employed too many workers and did not develop new products.
except in military weaponry and space technology the russian economy fell further and further behind those of capitalist societies and most people in the soviet bloc endured a low standard of living.
moreover the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 like the american war in vietnam turned out to be a major blunder an unwinnable war that cost vast amounts of money destroyed military morale and undermined popular support of the government.
mikhail gorbachev a relatively young russian leader who became general secretary of the communist party in 1985 recognized the need for internal economic reform and an end to the war in afghanistan.
an iconoclast in soviet terms gorbachev introduced policies of glasnost openness and perestroika economic restructuring which encouraged widespread criticism of the rigid institutions and authoritarian controls of the communist regime.
to lessen tensions with the united states gorbachev met with reagan in 1985 and the two leaders established a warm personal rapport.
by 1987 they had agreed to eliminate all intermediate range nuclear missiles based in europe.
a year later gorbachev ordered soviet troops out of afghanistan and reagan replaced many of his hardline advisors with policymakers who favored a renewal of dtente.
reagans sudden reversal with regard to the soviet union remains one of the most intriguing aspects trace change of his presidency.
many conserva over time how did reagans tives worried that their cowboyapproach to the soviet hero president had been duped union change between by a duplicitous gorbachev but 1981 and 1989.

during the cold war u s foreign policy throughout latin america focused on containing instability and the appeal of communism in a region plagued by poverty and military dictatorships.
providing foreign aid was one approach to addressing social and economic needs but the united states frequently intervened with military forces or by supporting military coups to remove unfriendly or socialist governments.
the reagan administrations support of the contra rebels in nicaragua some of which was contrary to u s law was one of those interventions.

alarmed by the reforms soviet military leaders seized power in august 1991 and arrested gorbachev.

the russian republic assumed leadership of the cis but chapter 30 conservative america in the ascent 1980 1991 reagan and gorbachev fellow political revolutionaries both ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev changed the political outlook of their nations.
as reagan undermined socialwelfare liberalism in the united states gorbachev challenged the rigidity of the communist party and state socialism in the soviet union.
although they remained ideological adversaries by the mid 1980s the two leaders had established a personal rapport which helped facilitate agreement on a series of arms reduction measures.

the soviet union was no more map 30 3.
the collapse of the soviet union was the result of internal weaknesses of the communist economy.
external pressure from the united states played an important though secondary role.
nobody no country no party no person won the cold war concluded george kennan the architect in 1947 of the american policy of containment.
the cold wars cost was enormous and both sides benefitted greatly from its end.
for more than forty years the united states had fought a bitter economic and ideological battle against that communist foe a struggle that exerted an enormous impact on american society.
taxpayers had spent some 4 trillion on nuclear weapons and trillions more on conventional arms placing the united states on a permanent war footing and creating a massive military industrial complex.
the physical and psychological costs were equally high radiation from atomic weapons tests anticommunist witch hunts and a constant fear of nuclear annihilation.
of course most americans had no qualms about proclaiming victory and advocates of free market capitalism particularly conservative republicans celebrated the outcome.
the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the disintegration of the soviet union itself they argued demonstrated that they had been right all along.
a new political order at home and abroad ronald reagans role in facilitating the end of the cold war was among his most important achievements.
overall his presidency left a mixed legacy.
despite his pledge to get the federal government off our backs he could not ultimately reduce its size or scope.

security and other entitlement programs remained untouched and enormous military spending outweighed cuts in other programs.
determined not to divide the country reagan did not actively push controversial policies espoused by the religious right.
he called for tax credits for private religious schools restrictions on abortions and a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools but he did not expend his political capital to secure these measures.
while reagan failed to roll back the social welfare and regulatory state of the new deal great society era he changed the dynamic of american politics.
the reagan presidency restored popular belief that america and individual americans could enjoy increasing prosperity.
and his antigovernment rhetoric won many adherents as did his bold and fiscally aggressive tax cuts.
social welfare liberalism ascendant since 1933 remained intact but was now on the defensive led by reagan conservatives had changed the political conversation.
election of 1988 george h w bush reagans vice president and successor was not beloved by conservatives who did not see him as one of their own.
but he possessed an insiders familiarity with government and a long list of powerful allies accumulated over three decades of public service.
bushs route to the white house reflected the post reagan alignments in american politics.
in the primaries he faced a spirited challenge from pat robertson the archconservative televangelist whose influence and profile had grown during reagans two terms.
after securing the presidential nomination which he won largely because of his fierce loyalty to reagan bush felt compelled to select as his vice presidential running mate an unknown and inexperienced indiana senator dan quayle.
bush hoped that quayle would help secure the christian family values vote upholding the traditional nuclear family and christian morality.
robertsons challenge and quayles selection showed that the religious right had become a major force in republican politics.
on the democratic side jesse jackson became the first african american to challenge for a major party nomination winning eleven states in primary and caucus voting.
however the much less charismatic massachusetts governor michael dukakis emerged as the democratic nominee.
dukakis a liberal from the northeast proved unable to win back the constituencies democrats had lost in the 1970s southern whites midwestern blue collar catholics and middle class suburbanites.
indeed bushs campaign manager lee atwater baited dukakis by calling him a card carrying liberal a not so subtle reference to j edgar hoovers 1958 phrase card carrying communist bush won with 53 percent of the vote a larger margin of victory than reagans in 1980.
the election confirmed a new pattern in presidential politics that would last through the turn of the twenty first century every four years americans would refight the battles of the 1960s with liberals on one side and conservatives on the other.
middle east the end of the cold war left the united states as the worlds only military superpower and raised the prospect of what president bush called a new world order dominated by the united states and its european and asian allies.
american officials and diplomats presumed that u s interests should prevail in this new environment but they now confronted an array of regional religious and ethnic conflicts that defied easy solutions.
none were more pressing or more complex than those in the middle east the oilrich lands stretching from iran to algeria.

after carters success negotiating the 1979 egyptisrael treaty at camp david there were few bright spots in u s middle eastern diplomacy.
in 1982 the reagan administration supported israels invasion of lebanon a military operation intended to destroy the palestine liberation organization plo.
but when lebanese militants angered at u s intervention on behalf of israel killed 241 american marines reagan abruptly withdrew the forces.
three years later palestinians living in the gaza strip and along the west bank of the jordan river territories occupied by israel since 1967 mounted an intifada a civilian uprising against israeli authority.
in response american diplomats stepped up their efforts to persuade the plo and arab nations to accept the legitimacy of israel and to convince the israelis to allow the creation of a palestinian state.
neither initiative met with much success.
unable or unwilling to solve the regions most intractable problems and burdened by a history of support for undemocratic regimes in middle eastern countries the united states was not seen by residents of the region as an honest broker.
persian gulf war american interest in a reliable supply of oil from the region led the united states into a short but consequential war in the persian gulf in the early 1990s.
ten years earlier in september 1980 the revolutionary shiite islamic nation of iran headed by ayatollah khomeini came under attack from iraq a secular state headed by the dictator saddam hussein.
the fighting was intense and long lasting a war of attrition that claimed a million casualties.
reagan supported hussein with military intelligence and other aid in order to maintain supplies of iraqi oil undermine iran and preserve a balance of power in the middle east.
finally in 1988 an armistice ended the inconclusive war with both sides still claiming the territory that sparked the conflict.
part 9 global capitalism and the end of the american century 1980 to the present men and women at war women played visible roles in the persian gulf war comprising approximately 10 percent of the american troops.
in the last decades of the twentieth century increasing numbers of women chose military careers and although prohibited from most fighting roles were increasingly assigned to combat zones.

two years later in august 1990 hussein went to war to expand iraqs boundaries and oil supply.
believing erroneously that he still had the support of the united states hussein sent in troops and quickly conquered kuwait iraqs small oil rich neighbor and threatened saudi arabia the site of one fifth of the worlds known oil reserves and an informal ally of the united states.
to preserve western access to oil president george h w bush sponsored a series of resolutions in the united nations security council calling for iraq to withdraw from kuwait.

for eight years between 1952 understand and 1960 eisenhower steered points of view a precarious course from the what were the components middle of the party with conser of cold war liberalism vative taft republicans on one and why did the demoside and liberal rockefeller cratic party embrace them.
republicans on the other.
his popularity temporarily kept the two sides at bay though more ardent conservatives considered him a closet new dealer.
ike as he was widely known proved willing to work with the mostly democraticcontrolled congresses of those years.
eisenhower signed bills increasing federal outlays for veterans benefits housing highway construction chapter 26 and social security and he increased the minimum wage from 75 cents an hour to 1.
like truman eisenhower accepted some government responsibility for the economic security of individuals part of a broad consensus in american politics in these years.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 america under eisenhower the global power realities that had called forth containment guided eisenhowers foreign policy.
new developments however altered the tone of the cold war.
stalins death in march 1953 precipitated an intraparty struggle in the soviet union that lasted until 1956 when nikita khrushchev emerged as stalins successor.
khrushchev soon startled communists around the world by denouncing stalin and detailing his crimes and blunders.
he also surprised many americans by calling for peaceful coexistence with the west and by dealing more flexibly with dissent in the communist world.
but the new soviet leader had his limits and when hungarians rose up in 1956 to demand independence from moscow khrushchev crushed the incipient revolution.
with no end to the cold war in sight eisenhower focused on limiting the cost of containment.
the president hoped to economize by relying on a nuclear arsenal and deemphasizing expensive conventional forces.
under this new look defense policy the eisenhower administration stepped up production of the hydrogen bomb and developed long range bombing capabilities.
the soviets however matched the united states weapon for weapon.
by 1958 both nations had intercontinental ballistic missiles.
when an american nuclear submarine launched an atomic tipped polaris missile in 1960 soviet engineers raced to produce an equivalent weapon.
this arms race was another critical feature of the cold war.
american officials believed the best deterrent to soviet aggression was the threat of an all out nuclear response by the united states which was dubbed massive retaliation by secretary of state dulles.
to see a longer excerpt of the dulles document along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
although confident in the international arena eisenhower started out as a novice in domestic affairs.
doing his best to set a less confrontational tone after the rancorous truman years he was reluctant to speak out against joe mccarthy and he was not a leader on civil rights.
democrats meanwhile maintained a strong presence in congress but proved weak in presidential elections in the 1950s.
in the two presidential contests of the decade 1952 and 1956 eisenhower defeated the admired but politically ineffectual liberal adlai stevenson.
in the 1952 election stevenson was hampered by the unpopularity of the truman administration.
the deadlocked korean war and a series of scandals that republicans dubbed the mess in washington combined to give the war hero general an easy victory.
in 1956 ike won an even more impressive victory over stevenson an eloquent and sophisticated spokesman for liberalism but no match for eisenhowers popularity with the public.
during eisenhowers presidency new political forces on both the right and the left had begun to stir.
but they had not yet fully transformed the party system itself.
particularly at the national level democrats and republicans seemed in broad agreement about the realities of the cold war and the demands of a modern industrial economy and welfare state.
indeed respected commentators in the 1950s declared the end of ideology and wondered if the great political clashes that had wracked the 1930s were gone forever.
below the apparent calm of national party politics however lay profound differences among americans over the direction of the nation.
those differences were most pronounced regarding the civil rights of african americans.
but a host of other issues had begun to emerge as controversial subjects that would soon starkly divide the country and in the 1960s bring an end to the brief and fragile cold war consensus.
containment in the postcolonial world as the cold war took shape the world scene was changing at a furious pace.
new nations were emerging across asia africa and the middle east created in the wake of powerful anticolonial movements whose origins dated to before world war ii.
between 1947 and 1962 the british french dutch and belgian empires all but disintegrated in a momentous collapse of european global reach.
fdr had favored the idea of national self determination often to the fury of his british and french allies.
he expected emerging democracies to be new partners in an american led freemarket world system.
but colonial revolts produced many independent or socialist minded regimes in the so called third world as well.
third world was a term that came into usage after world war ii to describe developing or ex colonial nations in asia africa latin america and the middle east that were not aligned with the western capitalist countries led by the united states or the socialist states of eastern europe led by the soviet union.
the truman and eisenhower administrations often treated third world countries as pawns of the soviet union to be opposed at all costs.
chapter 25 the cold war and colonial independence insisting that all nations had to choose sides the united states drew as many countries as possible into collective security agreements with the nato alliance in europe as a model.
secretary of state john foster dulles orchestrated the creation of the southeast asia treaty organization seato which in 1954 linked the united states and its major european allies with australia new zealand pakistan the philippines and thailand.
an extensive system of defense alliances eventually tied the united states to more than forty cold war america 1945 1963 other countries map 25 5.
the united states also sponsored a strategically valuable defensive alliance between iraq and iran on the southern flank of the soviet union.
despite american rhetoric the united states was often concerned less about democracy than about stability.
the truman and eisenhower administrations tended to support governments no matter how repressive that were overtly anticommunist.
some of americas staunchest allies the philippines south korea iran cuba south vietnam and nicaragua were governed by dictatorships or right wing regimes that lacked broad based support.

dating back to george washingtons call to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world the united states had avoided treaty obligations that entailed the defense of other nations.
as late as 1919 the u s senate had rejected the principle of collective security the centerpiece of the league of nations established by the treaty of versailles that ended world war i.
but after world war ii in response to fears of soviet global expansion the united states entered defense alliances with much of the non communist world.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 secretary of state dulles often resorted to covert operations against governments that in his opinion were too closely aligned with the soviets.
for these covert tasks dulles used the newly created 1947 central intelligence agency cia run by his brother allen dulles.
when irans democratically elected nationalist premier mohammad mossadegh seized british oil properties in 1953 cia agents helped depose him and installed the young mohammad reza pahlavi as shah of iran.
iranian resentment of the coup followed by twenty five years of u s support for the shah eventually led to the 1979 iranian revolution chapter 30.
in 1954 the cia also engineered a coup in guatemala against the democratically elected president jacobo arbenz guzmn who had seized land owned by the american owned united fruit company.
arbenz offered to pay united fruit the declared value of the land but the company rejected the offer and turned to the u s government.
eisenhower specifically approved those cia efforts and expanded the agencys mandate from gathering intelligence to intervening in the affairs of sovereign states.
vietnam but when covert operations and coups failed or proved impractical the american approach to emerging nations could entangle the united states in deeper more intractable conflicts.
one example was already unfolding on a distant stage in a small country unknown to most americans vietnam.
in august 1945 at the close of world war ii the japanese occupiers of vietnam surrendered to china in the north and britain in the south.
the vietminh the nationalist movement that had led the resistance against the japanese and the french prior to 1940 seized control in the north.
but their leader ho chi minh was a communist and this single fact outweighed american and british commitment to self determination.
when france moved to restore its control over the country the united states and britain sided with their european ally.
president truman rejected hos plea to support the vietnamese struggle for nationhood and france rejected hos offer of a negotiated independence.
shortly after france returned in late 1946 the vietminh resumed their war of national liberation.
eisenhower picked up where identify causes truman left off.
if the french how did the cold war failed eisenhower argued all between the united states non communist governments in and the soviet union the region would fall like domiaffect disparate regions noes.
this so called domino such as the middle east theory which represented an and southeast asia.
extension of the containment doctrine guided u s policy in southeast asia for the next twenty years.
the united states eventually provided most of the financing for the french war but money was not enough to defeat the determined vietminh who were fighting for the liberation of their country.
after a fifty six day siege in early 1954 the french were defeated at the huge fortress of dien bien phu.
the result was the 1954 geneva accords which partitioned vietnam temporarily at the 17th parallel and called for elections within two years to unify the strife torn nation.
the united states rejected the geneva accords and set about undermining them.
with the help of the cia a pro american government took power in south vietnam in june 1954.
ngo dinh diem an anticommunist catholic who had been residing in the united states returned to vietnam as premier.
the next year in a rigged election diem became president of an independent south vietnam.
facing certain defeat by the popular ho chi minh diem called off the scheduled reunification elections.
as the last french soldiers left in march 1956 the eisenhower administration propped up diem with an average of 200 million a year in aid and a contingent of 675 american military advisors.
this support was just the beginning.
the middle east if vietnam was still of minor concern the same could not be said of the middle east an area rich in oil and political complexity.
the most volatile area was palestine populated by arabs but also historically the ancient land of israel and coveted by the zionist movement as a jewish national homeland.
after world war ii many survivors of the nazi extermination camps resettled in palestine which was still controlled by britain under a world war i mandate.
on november 29 1947 the un general assembly voted to partition palestine between jewish and arab sectors.
when the british mandate ended in 1948 zionist leaders proclaimed the state of israel.
a coalition of arab nations known as the arab league invaded but israel survived.
many palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the fighting.
the arab defeat left these people permanently stranded in refugee camps.
president truman recognized the new state immediately which won him crucial support from jewish voters in the 1948 election but alienated the arab world.
southeast of palestine egypt began to assert its presence in the region.
having gained independence from britain several decades earlier egypt remained a monarchy until 1952 when gamal abdel nasser led a military coup that established a constitutional republic.
chapter 25 cold war america 1945 1963 the suez crisis 1956 in this photograph egyptian president gamal abdel nasser is greeted ecstatically by cairo crowds after he nationalized the suez canal.
nassers gamble paid off.
thanks to american intervention military action by britain france and israel failed and nasser emerged as the triumphant voice of arab nationalism across the middle east.
the popular emotions he unleashed against the west survived his death in 1970 and are more potent today than ever although now expressed more through islamic fundamentalism than nassers brand of secular nationalism.

caught between the soviet union and the united states nasser sought an independent route a panarab socialism designed to end the middle easts colonial relationship with the west.
when negotiations with the united states over nassers plan to build a massive hydroelectric dam on the nile broke down in 1956 he nationalized the suez canal which was the lifeline for western europes oil.
britain and france in alliance with israel attacked egypt and seized the canal.
concerned that the invasion would encourage egypt to turn to the soviets for help eisenhower urged france and britain to pull back.
he applied additional pressure through the un general assembly which called for a truce and troop withdrawal.
when the western nations backed down however egypt reclaimed the suez canal and built the aswan dam on the nile with soviet support.
eisenhower had likely avoided a larger war but the west lost a potential ally in nasser.
in early 1957 concerned about soviet influence in the middle east the president announced the eisenhower doctrine which stated that american forces would assist any nation in the region that required aid against overt armed aggression from any nation controlled by international communism invoking the doctrine later that year eisenhower helped king hussein of jordan put down a nasser backed revolt and propped up a pro american government in lebanon.
the eisenhower doctrine was further evidence that the united states had extended the global reach of containment in this instance accentuated by the strategic need to protect the wests access to steady supplies of oil.
john f kennedy and the cold war charisma style and personality these more than platforms and issues defined a new brand of politics in the early 1960s.
this was john f kennedys natural environment.
kennedy a harvard alumnus world war ii hero and senator from massachusetts had inherited his love of politics from his grandfathers colorful and often ruthless irish catholic politicians in boston.
ambitious and deeply aware of style the forty three year old kennedy made use of his many advantages to become as novelist norman mailer put it our leading man his one disadvantage that he was catholic in a country that had never elected a catholic president he masterfully neutralized.
and compare and thanks to both media advisors contrast and his youthful attractiveness how was kennedys kennedy projected a superb tele approach to the cold war similar to and different vision image.
from eisenhowers and at heart however kennedy trumans.
was a cold warrior who had part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the kennedy magnetism john f kennedy the 1960 democratic candidate for president used his youth and personality and those of his equally personable and stylish wife to attract voters.
here the massachusetts senator draws an enthusiastic crowd on a campaign stop in elgin illinois.
come of age in the shadow of munich yalta and mccarthyism.
he projected an air of idealism but his years in the senate 1953 1960 had proved him to be a conventional cold war politician.
once elected president kennedy would shape the nations foreign policy by drawing both on his ingenuity and on old style cold war power politics.
the election of 1960 and the new frontier kennedys republican opponent in the 1960 presidential election eisenhowers vice president richard nixon was a seasoned politician and cold warrior himself.
the great innovation of the 1960 campaign was a series of four nationally televised debates.
nixon less photogenic than kennedy looked sallow and unshaven under the intense studio lights.
voters who heard the first debate on the radio concluded that nixon had won but those who viewed it on television favored kennedy.
despite the edge kennedy enjoyed in the debates he won only the narrowest of electoral victories receiving 49 7 percent of the popular vote to nixons 49 5 percent.
kennedy attracted catholics african americans and the labor vote his vicepresidential running mate texas senator lyndon baines johnson helped bring in southern democrats.
yet only 120 000 votes separated the two candidates and a shift of a few thousand votes in key states would have reversed the outcome.
kennedy brought to washington a cadre of young ambitious newcomers including robert mcnamara a renowned systems analyst and former head of ford motor company as secretary of defense.
a host of trusted advisors and academics flocked to washington to join the new frontier kennedys term for the challenges the country faced.
included on the team as attorney general was kennedys younger brother robert who had made a name as a hard hitting investigator of organized crime.
relying on an old american trope kennedys new frontier suggested masculine toughness and adventurism and encouraged americans to again think of themselves as exploring uncharted terrain.
that terrain proved treacherous however as the new administration immediately faced a crisis.
crises in cuba and berlin in january 1961 the soviet union announced that it intended to support wars of national liberation wherever in the world they occurred.
kennedy took soviet premier nikita khrushchevs words as a challenge especially as they applied to cuba where in 1959 fidel castro had overthrown the right wing dictator fulgencio batista and declared a revolution.
determined to keep cuba out of the soviet orbit kennedy followed through on eisenhower administration plans to dispatch cuban exiles to foment an anti castro uprising.
the invaders trained by the central intelligence agency were illprepared for their task.
on landing at cubas bay of pigs on april 17 1961 the force of 1 400 was crushed by castros troops.
kennedy prudently rejected cia pleas for a u s air strike.
accepting defeat kennedy chapter 25 planes had spotted soviet built bases for intermediaterange ballistic missiles in cuba.
some of those weapons had already been installed and more were on the way.
kennedy announced that the united states would impose a quarantine on all offensive military equipment on its way to cuba.
as the world held its breath waiting to see if the conflict would escalate into war on october 25 ships carrying soviet missiles turned back.
after a week of tense negotiations both sides made concessions kennedy pledged not to invade cuba and khrushchev promised to dismantle the missile bases.
kennedy also secretly ordered u s missiles to be removed from turkey at khrushchevs insistence.
the risk of nuclear war greater during the cuban missile crisis than at any other time in the cold war prompted a slight thaw in u s soviet relations.
as national went before the american people and took full responsibility for the fiasco map 25 6.
already strained by the bay of pigs incident u s soviet relations deteriorated further in june 1961 when khrushchev stopped movement between communistcontrolled east berlin and the citys western sector.
kennedy responded by dispatching 40 000 more troops to europe.
in mid august to stop the exodus of east germans the communist regime began constructing the berlin wall policed by border guards under shootto kill orders.
until the 12 foot high concrete barrier came down in 1989 it served as the supreme symbol of the cold war.
a perilous cold war confrontation came next in october 1962.

bettmann corbis.
security advisor mcgeorge bundy put it both sides were chastened by having come so close to the edge kennedy and the world kennedy also launched a series of bold nonmilitary initiatives.
one was the peace corps which embodied a call to public service put forth in his inaugural address ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.
thousands of men and women agreed to devote two or more years as volunteers for projects such as teaching english to filipino schoolchildren or helping african villagers obtain clean water.
exhibiting the idealism of the early 1960s the peace corps was also a low cost cold war weapon intended to show the developing world that there was an alternative to communism.
kennedy championed space exploration as well.
in a 1962 speech he proposed that the nation commit itself to landing a man on the moon within the decade.
the soviets had already beaten the united states into space with the 1957 sputnik satellite and the 1961 flight of cosmonaut yuri gagarin.
capitalizing on americas fascination with space kennedy persuaded congress to increase funding for the governments space agency the national aeronautics and space administration nasa enabling the united states to pull ahead of the soviet union.
kennedys ambition was realized when u s astronauts arrived on the moon in 1969.
making a commitment in vietnam despite slight improvements u s soviet relations stayed tense and containment remained the cornerstone of u s policy.
when kennedy became president he inherited eisenhowers commitment in vietnam.
kennedy saw vietnam in cold war terms but rather than practicing brinksmanship threatening nuclear war to stop communism kennedy sought what at chapter 25 cold war america 1945 1963 the cuban missile crisis during the 1962 cuban missile crisis president kennedy meets with u s army officials.
over two tense weeks the world watched as the united states and the soviet union went to the brink of war when it became known that soviet military officials had begun to construct nuclear weapons bases in cuba a mere 90 miles from the southern tip of florida.
kennedys threat to intercept soviet missile shipments with american naval vessels forced the cold war adversary to back down.
the time seemed a more intelligent and realistic approach.
in 1961 he increased military aid to the south vietnamese and expanded the role of u s special forces green berets who would train the south vietnamese army in unconventional smallgroup warfare tactics.
south vietnams corrupt and repressive diem regime propped up by eisenhower since 1954 was losing ground in spite of american aid.
by 1961 diems opponents with backing from north vietnam had formed a revolutionary movement known as the national liberation front nlf.
nlf guerrilla forces the vietcong found allies among peasants alienated by diems strategic hamlet program which had uprooted entire villages and moved villagers into barbed wire compounds.
furthermore buddhists charged diem a catholic with religious persecution.
starting in may 1963 militant buddhists staged dramatic demonstrations including self immolations recorded by reporters covering the activities of the 16 000 u s military personnel then in vietnam.
these self immolations shown on television to an uneasy global audience powerfully illustrated the dilemmas of american policy in vietnam.
to ensure a stable southern government and prevent victory for ho chi minh and the north the united states had to support diems authoritarian regime.
but the regimes political repression of its opponents made diem more unpopular.
he was assassinated on november 3 1963.
whether one supported u s involvement in vietnam or not the elemental paradox remained unchanged in its efforts to win the united states brought defeat ever closer.
summary the cold war began as a conflict between the united states and the soviet union over eastern europe and the fate of post world war ii germany.
early in the conflict the united states adopted a strategy of containment which quickly expanded to asia after china became a communist state under mao zedong.
the first effect of that expansion was the korean war after which under dwight d eisenhower containment of communism became americas guiding principle across the developing world often called the third world.
cold war tensions relaxed in the late 1950s but erupted again under john f kennedy with the cuban part 8 chapter review missile crisis the building of the berlin wall and major increases in american military assistance to south vietnam.
cold war imperatives between 1945 and the early 1960s meant a major military buildup a massive nuclear arms race and unprecedented entanglements across the globe.
on the domestic front harry s truman started out with high hopes for an expanded new deal only to be confounded by resistance from congress and the competing demands of the cold war.
the greatest c h a p t e r cold war inspired development was a climate of fear over internal subversion by communists that gave rise to mccarthyism.
trumans successor eisenhower brought the republicans back into power.
although personally conservative eisenhower actually proved a new dealer in disguise.
when eisenhower left office and kennedy became president it seemed that a liberal consensus prevailed with old fashioned laissezfaire conservatism mostly marginalized in american political life.

faceaffect politics and society.
to face at the opening of an american exhibition in moscow nixon and khrushchev strolled through a model american home assembled to demonstrate the consumer products available to the typical citizen of the united states.
nixon explained to khrushchev that although the soviet union may have had superior rockets the united states was ahead in other areas such as color television.
this was cold war politics by other means a symbolic contest over which countrys standard of living was higher.
what was so striking about the so called kitchen debate was nixons insistence to a disbelieving khrushchev that a modern home filled with shiny new toasters televisions and other consumer products was accessible to the average american worker.
any steelworker could buy this house nixon told the soviet leader.
the kitchen debate settled little in the geopolitical rivalry between the united states and the soviet union.
but it speaks to us across the decades because it reveals how americans had come to see themselves by the late 1950s as home owners and consumers as a people for whom the middle class american dream was a commercial aspiration.
the real story of the postwar period was the growing number of americans who embraced that aspiration.
in the two decades following the end of world war ii a new middle class was born in the united states.
fortune magazine estimated that in the 1950s the middle class which fortune defined as families with more than 5 000 in annual earnings after taxes about 40 000 today was increasing at the rate of 1 1 million people per year.
riding a wave of rising incomes american dominance in the global economy and cold war federal spending the postwar middle class enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world.
however the success of the middle class could not hide deeper troubles.
this was an era of neither universal conformity nor diminishing social strife.
jim crow laws contradictions in womens lives a rebellious youth culture and changing sexual mores were only the most obvious sources of social tension.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 postwar prosperity and the affluent society the united states enjoyed enormous economic advantages at the close of world war ii.
while the europeans and japanese were still clearing the wars rubble america stood poised to enter a postwar boom.
as the only major industrial nation not devastated by war the united states held an unprecedented global position.
the american economy also benefitted from an expanding internal market and heavy investment in research and development.
two additional developments stood out first for the first time in the nations history employers generally accepted collective bargaining which for workers translated into rising wages expanding benefits and an increasing rate of home ownership.
second the federal governments outlays for military and domestic programs gave a huge boost to the economy.
economy from recovery to dominance u s corporations banks and manufacturers so dominated the global economy that the postwar period has been called the pax americana a latin term meaning american peace and harking back to the pax romana of the first and second centuries a d.
life magazine publisher henry luce was so confident in the nations growing power that during world war ii he had predicted the dawning of the american century the preponderance of american economic power in the postwar decades however was not simply an artifact of the world war it was not an inevitable development.
several key elements came together internationally and at home to propel three decades of unprecedented economic growth.
the bretton woods system american global supremacy rested partly on the economic institutions created at an international conference in bretton woods new hampshire in july 1944.
the first of those institutions was the world bank created to provide loans for the reconstruction of war torn europe as well as for the development of former colonized nations the so called third world or developing world.
a second institution the international monetary fund imf was set up to stabilize currencies and provide a predictable monetary environment for trade with the u s dollar serving as the benchmark.
the world bank and the imf formed the cornerstones of the bretton woods system which guided the global economy after the war.
the bretton woods system was joined in 1947 by the first general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which established an international framework for overseeing trade rules and practices.
together the bretton woods system and gatt served americas conception of an open market global economy and complemented the nations ambitious diplomatic aims in the cold war.
the chief idea of the bretton woods system was to make american capital available on cheap terms to nations that adopted free trade capitalist economies.
critics charged rightly that bretton woods and gatt favored the united states at the the kitchen debate at the american national exhibition in moscow in 1959 the united states put on display the technological wonders of american home life.
when vice president richard nixon visited he and soviet premier nikita khrushchev got into a heated debate over the relative merits of their rival systems with the up to date american kitchen as a case in point.

chapter 26 expense of recently independent countries because the united states could dictate lending terms and stood to benefit as nations purchased more american goods.
but the system provided needed economic stability.
the military industrial complex a second engine of postwar prosperity was defense spending.
in his final address to the nation in 1961 president dwight d eisenhower spoke about the power of what he called the military industrial complex which by then employed 3 5 million americans.
even though his administration had fostered this defense establishment eisenhower feared its implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex he said.
this complex had its roots in the businessgovernment partnerships of world war ii.
after 1945 though the country was nominally at peace the triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 economy and the government identify causes operated in a state of perpetual what primary factors readiness for war.
led to the growth of the based at the sprawling pen american economy after tagon in arlington virginia the world war ii.
defense department evolved into a massive bureaucracy.
in the name of national security defense related industries entered into long term relationships with the pentagon.
some companies did so much business with the government that they in effect became private divisions of the defense department.
over 60 percent of the income of boeing general dynamics and raytheon for instance came from military contracts and the percentages were even higher for lockheed and republic aviation.
in previous peacetime years military spending had constituted only 1 percent of gross domestic product gdp now it represented 10 percent.
economic growth was increasingly dependent on a robust defense sector.
the military industrial complex often technology developed for military purposes such as the complex design of jet airplanes was easily transferred to the consumer market.
the boeing aircraft company their seattle plant is pictured here in the mid 1950s became one of the leading commercial airplane manufacturers in the world in the 1960s boosted in part by tax dollar financed military contracts.
major american corporations such as boeing mcdonnell douglas general electric general dynamics and dozens of others benefitted enormously from military contracts from the department of defense in the years after world war ii.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 as permanent mobilization took hold science industry and government became intertwined.
cold war competition for military supremacy spawned both an arms race and a space race as the united states and the soviet union each sought to develop more explosive bombs and more powerful rockets.
federal spending underwrote 90 percent of the cost of research for aviation and space 65 percent for electricity and electronics 42 percent for scientific instruments and even 24 percent for automobiles.
with the government footing the bill corporations lost little time in transforming new technology into useful products.
backed by the pentagon for instance ibm and sperry rand pressed ahead with research on integrated circuits which later spawned the computer revolution.
when the soviet union launched the worlds first satellite sputnik in 1957 the startled united states went into high gear to catch up in the cold war space competition.
alarmed that the united states was falling behind in science and technology eisenhower persuaded congress to appropriate additional money for college scholarships and university research.
the national defense education act of 1958 funneled millions of dollars into american universities helping institutions such as the university of california at berkeley stanford university the massachusetts institute of technology and the university of michigan become the leading research centers in the world.
corporate power despite its massive size the military corporate partnership was only one part of the nations economy.
for over half a century the consolidation of economic power into large corporate firms had characterized american capitalism.
in the postwar decades that tendency accelerated.
by 1970 the top four u s automakers produced 91 percent of all motor vehicles sold in the country the top four firms in tires produced 72 percent those in cigarettes 84 percent and those in detergents 70 percent.
eric johnston former president of the american chamber of commerce declared that we have entered a period of accelerating bigness in all aspects of american life expansion into foreign markets also spurred corporate growth.
during the 1950s u s exports nearly doubled giving the nation a trade surplus of close to 5 billion in 1960.
by the 1970s such firms as coca cola gillette ibm and mobil made more than half their profits abroad.
to staff their bureaucracies the postwar corporate giants required a huge white collar army.
a new generation of corporate chieftains emerged operating in a complex environment that demanded long range forecasting.
companies turned to the universities which grew explosively after 1945.
postwar corporate culture inspired numerous critics who argued that the obedience demanded of white collar workers was stifling creativity and blighting lives.
in the lonely crowd 1950 the sociologist david riesman mourned a lost masculinity and contrasted the independent businessmen and professionals of earlier years with the managerial class of the postwar world.
the sociologist william whyte painted a somber picture of organization men who left the home spiritually as well as physically to take the vows of organization life andrew hacker in the corporation take over 1964 warned that a small handful of such organization men can draw up an investment program calling for the expenditure of several billions of dollars and thereby determine the quality of life for substantial segments of society many of these investment programs relied on mechanization or automation another important factor in the postwar boom.
from 1947 to 1975 worker productivity more than doubled across the whole of the economy.
american factories replaced manpower with machines substituting cheap fossil energy for human muscle.
as industries mechanized they could turn out products more efficiently and at lower cost.
mechanization did not come without social costs however.
over the course of the postwar decades millions of high wage manufacturing jobs were lost as machines replaced workers affecting entire cities and regions.
corporate leaders approved but workers and their union representatives were less enthusiastic.
how are you going to sell cars to all of these machines wondered walter reuther president of the united auto workers uaw.
the economic record the american economy produced an extraordinary postwar record.
annual gdp jumped from 213 billion in 1945 to more than 500 billion in 1960 by 1970 it exceeded 1 trillion figure 26 1.
this sustained economic growth meant a 25 percent rise in real income for ordinary americans between 1946 and 1959.
even better the new prosperity featured low inflation.
after a burst of high prices in the immediate postwar period inflation slowed to 2 to 3 percent annually and it stayed low until the escalation of the vietnam war in the mid 1960s.
feeling secure about the future americans were eager to spend and rightly felt that they were better off than ever before.
in 1940 43 percent of american families owned their homes by 1960 62 percent did.
in that period moreover income inequality dropped sharply.
the share of total income going to the top tenth the chapter 26 fully in american society and moreover fulfilling a social responsibility.
what the suburban family consumed asserted life magazine in a photo essay would help to ensure full employment and improved living standards for the rest of the nation billions 1 500 1 000 triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 gdp in constant 1972 dollars gdp figure 26 1 gross domestic product 1930 1972 after a sharp dip during the great depression the gdp rose steadily in both real and constant dollars in the postwar period.
richest americans declined by nearly one third from the 45 percent it had been in 1940.
american society had become not only more prosperous but also more egalitarian.
however the picture was not as rosy at the bottom where tenacious poverty accompanied the economic boom.
in the affluent society 1958 which analyzed the nations successful affluent middle class economist john kenneth galbraith argued that the poor were only an afterthought in the minds of economists and politicians who largely celebrated the new growth.
as galbraith noted one in thirteen families at the time earned less than 1 000 a year about 7 500 in todays dollars.
four years later in the other america 1962 the left wing social critic michael harrington chronicled the economic underworld of american life and a u s government study echoing a well known sentence from franklin roosevelts second inaugural address i see one third of a nation ill housed ill clad ill nourished declared one third of the nation to be poorly paid poorly educated and poorly housed.
it appeared that in economic terms as the top and the middle converged the bottom remained far behind.
a nation of consumers the most breathtaking development in the postwar american economy was the dramatic expansion of the domestic consumer market.
the sheer quantity of consumer goods available to the average person was without precedent.
in some respects the postwar decades seemed like the 1920s all over again with an abundance of new gadgets and appliances a craze for automobiles and new types of mass media.
yet there was a significant difference in the 1950s consumption became associated with citizenship.
buying things once a sign of personal indulgence now meant participating the gi bill the new ethic of consumption appealed to the postwar middle class the driving force behind the expanding domestic market.
middle class status was more accessible than ever before because of the servicemens readjustment act of 1944 popularly known as the gi bill.
in the immediate postwar years more than half of all u s college students were veterans attending class on the governments dime.
by the middle of the 1950s 2 2 million veterans had attended college and another 5 6 million had attended trade school with government financing.
before the gi bill commented one veteran i looked upon college education as likely as my owning a rolls royce with a chauffeur government financing of education helped make the u s workforce the best educated in the world in the 1950s and 1960s.
american colleges universities and trade schools grew by leaps and bounds to accommodate the flood of students and expanded again when the children of those students the baby boomers reached college age in the 1960s.
at rutgers university enrollment went from 7 000 before the war to 16 000 in 1947 at the university of minnesota from 15 000 to more than 27 000.
the gi bill trained nearly half a million engineers 200 000 doctors dentists and nurses and 150 000 scientists among many other professions.
better education meant higher earning power and higher earning power translated into the consumer spending that drove the postwar economy.
one observer of the gi bill was so impressed with its achievements that he declared it responsible for the most important educational and social transformation in american history the gi bill stimulated the economy and expanded the middle class in another way by increasing home ownership.
between the end of world war ii and 1966 one of every five single family homes built in the united states was financed through a gi bill mortgage 2 5 million new homes in all.
in cities and suburbs across the country the veterans administration va which helped former soldiers purchase new homes with no down payment sparked a building boom that created jobs in the construction industry and fueled consumer spending in home appliances and automobiles.
education and home ownership were more than personal triumphs for the families of world part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 college on the gi bill in 1947 the year this photo was taken of a crowded lecture hall at the university of iowa more than 6 000 of this universitys 10 000 students 60 percent were veterans whose education was financed by the gi bill.
across the country american universities were bursting at the seams from the massive enrollment of world war ii veterans.
government financing of college education for these vets made the u s workforce one of the best educated in the world in the 1950s and 1960s.

they were concrete financial assets that helped lift more americans than ever before into a mass consumption oriented middle class.
motors balked at that demand the two sides seemed set for a long struggle.
between 1947 and 1950 however a broad labor management accord gradually trade unions organized labor also expanded the ranks of the middle class.
for the first time ever trade unions and collective bargaining became major factors in the nations economic life.
in the past organized labor had been confined to a narrow band of craft trades and a few industries primarily coal mining railroading and the building and metal trades.
the power balance shifted during the great depression and by the time the dust settled after world war ii labor unions overwhelmingly represented americas industrial workforce figure 26 2.
by the beginning of the 1950s the nations major industries including auto steel clothing chemicals and virtually all consumer product manufacturing were operating with union contracts.
that outcome did not arrive without a fight.
unions staged major strikes in nearly all american industries in 1945 and 1946 and employers fought back.
head of the uaw walter reuther and cio president philip murray declared that employers could afford a 30 percent wage increase which would fuel postwar consumption.
when employers led by the giant general nonagricultural workers belonging to unions 1900 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 97 figure 26 2 labor union strength 1900 1997 labor unions reached their peak strength immediately after world war ii when they represented close to 40 percent of the nonfarm workforce.
although there was some decline after the mid1950s unions still represented nearly 30 percent in 1973.
thereafter their decline was precipitous.
afl cio information bureau washington dc.
chapter 26 emerged across most industries.
this was not industrial peace because the country still experienced many strikes but a general acceptance of collective bargaining as the method for setting the terms of employment.
the result was rising real income.
the average worker with three dependents gained 18 percent in spendable real income in the 1950s.
in addition unions delivered greater leisure more paid holidays and longer vacations and in a startling departure a social safety net.
in postwar europe americas allies were constructing welfare states.
but having lost the bruising battle in washington for national health care during trumans presidency american unions turned to the bargaining table.
by the end of the 1950s union contracts commonly provided pension plans and company paid health insurance.
collective bargaining the process of trade unions and employers negotiating workplace contracts had become in effect the american alternative to the european welfare state and as reuther boasted the passport into the middle class.
the labor management accord though impressive was never as durable or universal as it seemed.
vulnerabilities lurked.
for one thing the sheltered domestic markets the essential condition for generous contracts were quite fragile.
in certain industries the lead firms were already losing market share.
second generally overlooked were the many unorganized workers with no middle class passport those consigned to unorganized industries casual labor or low wage jobs in the service sector.
a final vulnerability was the most basic the abiding antiunionism of american employers.
at heart managers regarded the labormanagement accord as a negotiated truce not a permanent peace.
the postwar labor management accord turned out to be a transitory event not a permanent condition of american economic life.
houses cars and children increased educational levels growing home ownership and higher wages all enabled more americans than ever before to become members of what one historian has called a consumer republic but what did they buy.
the postwar emphasis on nuclear families and suburbs provides the answer.
in the emerging suburban nation three elements came together to create patterns of consumption that would endure for decades houses cars and children.
a feature in a 1949 issue of mccalls a magazine targeting middle class women illustrates the connections.

the article does not mention automobiles but the photo of the houses exterior makes the point clear father drives home from work in a new car.
consumption for the home including automobiles drove the postwar american economy as much as or more than the military industrial complex did.
if we think like advertisers and manufacturers we can see why.
between 1945 and 1970 more than 25 million new houses were built in the united states.
each required its own supply of new appliances from refrigerators to lawn mowers.
in 1955 alone americans purchased 4 million new refrigerators and between 1940 and 1951 the sale of power mowers increased from 35 000 per year to more than 1 million.
moreover as american industry discovered planned obsolescence the encouragement of consumers to replace appliances and cars every few years the home became a site of perpetual explain consumer desire.
consequences children also encouraged how did the tastes and consumption.
the baby boomers values of the postwar born between world war ii and middle class affect the the late 1950s have consistently country.
throughout every phase of their lives been the darlings of american advertising and consumption.
when they were infants companies focused on developing new baby products from disposable diapers to instant formula.
when they were toddlers and young children new television programs board games fast food tv dinners and thousands of different kinds of toys came to market to supply the rambunctious youth.
when they were teenagers rock music hollywood films and a constantly marketed teen culture with its appropriate clothing music hairstyles and other accessories bombarded them.
remarkably in 1956 middle class american teenagers on average had a weekly income of more than 10 close to the weekly disposable income of an entire family a generation earlier.
television the emergence of commercial television in the united states was swift and overwhelming.
in the realm of technology only the automobile and the personal computer were its equal in transforming everyday life in the twentieth century.
in 1947 there were 7 000 tv sets in american homes.
a year later the cbs and nbc radio networks began offering regular part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 teenagers these teenage girls and boys are being restrained by police outside an elvis presley concert in florida in 1956.
elvis who was instrumental in popularizing rock n roll music among white middle class teenagers in the mid 1950s was one example of a broader phenomenon the creation of the teenager as a distinct demographic cultural category and perhaps most significantly consumer group.
beginning in the 1950s middle class teenagers had money to spend and advertisers and other entrepreneurs such as the music executives who marketed elvis or the hollywood executives who invented the teen film sought ways to win their allegiance and their dollars.

programming and by 1950 americans owned 7 3 million sets.
ten years later 87 percent of american homes had at least one television set.
having conquered the home television would soon become the principal mediator between the consumer and the marketplace.
television advertisers mastered the art of manufacturing consumer desire.
tv stations like radio stations before them depended entirely on advertising for profits.
the first television executives understood that as long as they sold viewers to advertisers they would stay on the air.
early corporate sponsored shows such as general electric theater and u s steel hour and simple product jingles such as no matter what the time or place lets keep up with that happy pace.
7 up your thirst away gave way by the early 1960s to slick advertising campaigns that used popular music movie stars sports figures and stimulating graphics to captivate viewers.

by the late 1950s what americans saw on television both in the omnipresent commercials and in the programming was an overwhelmingly white anglosaxon protestant world of nuclear families suburban homes and middle class life.
a typical show was father knows best starring robert young and jane wyatt.
father left home each morning wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase.
mother was a full time housewife and stereotypical female prone to bad driving and tears.

earlier in the decade however television featured grittier realities.
the honeymooners starring jackie gleason as a brooklyn bus driver and chapter 26 triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 advertising in the tv age aggressive advertising of new products such as the color television helped fuel the surge in consumer spending during the 1950s.

two other early fifties television series beulah starring ethel waters and then louise beavers as an african american maid and the comedic amos n andy were the only shows featuring black actors in major roles.
television was never a showcase for the breadth of american society but in the second half of the 1950s broadcasting lost much of its ethnic racial and class diversity and became a vehicle for the transmission of a narrow range of middle class tastes and values.
youth culture one of the most striking developments in american life in the postwar decades was the emergence of the teenager as a cultural phenomenon.
in 1956 only partly in jest the cbs radio commentator eric sevareid questioned whether the teenagers will take over the united states lock stock living room and garage sevareid was grumbling about american youth culture a phenomenon first noticed in the 1920s and with its roots in the lengthening years of education the role of peer groups and the consumer tastes of young people.
market research revealed a distinct teen market to be exploited.
newsweek noted with awe in 1951 that the aggregate of the weekly spending money of teenagers was enough to buy 190 million candy bars 130 million soft drinks and 230 million sticks of gum.
increasingly advertisers targeted the young both to capture their spending money and to exploit their influence on family purchases.
hollywood movies played a large role in fostering a teenage culture.
young people made up the largest part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 audience for motion pictures and hollywood studios learned over the course of the 1950s to cater how did rebellion become to them.

by the early 1960s hollywood had retooled its business model shifting emphasis away from adults and families to teenagers.
the teenpic soon included multiple genres horror rock n roll dangerous youth and beach party among others.
understand points of view rock n roll what really defined the youth culture however was its music.
rejecting the romantic ballads of the 1940s teenagers discovered rock n roll which originated in african american rhythm and blues.
the cleveland disc jockey alan freed took the lead in introducing white america to the black created sound by playing what were called race records.
if i could find a white man who had the negro sound and the negro feel i could make a billion dollars a record company owner is quoted as saying.
the performer who fit that bill was elvis presley who rocketed into instant celebrity in 1956 with his hit records hound dog and heartbreak hotel covers of songs originally recorded by black artists such as big mama thornton.
between 1953 and 1959 record sales increased from 213 million to 603 million with rock n roll as the driving force.
many unhappy adults saw in rock n roll music an invitation to interracial dating rebellion and a more flagrant sexuality.
the media featured hundreds of stories on problem teens and denunciations of the new music poured forth from many corners.
such condemnation only deflected off the new youth culture or if anything increased its popularity.
both hollywood and the music industry had learned that youth rebellion sold tickets.
cultural dissenters youth rebellion was only one aspect of a broader discontent with the sometimes motown mary wilson diana ross and florence ballard from left to right were the founding members of the motown singing group the supremes shown here in concert in 1964 which produced twelve number one singles.

in the era of jim crow motown represented a small but noteworthy step toward a less racially segregated american culture.

chapter 26 saccharine consumer culture of the 1950s.
many artists writers and jazz musicians embarked on powerful new experimental projects in a remarkable flowering of intensely personal introspective art forms.
black musicians developed a hard driving improvisational style known as bebop.
whether the hot bebop of saxophonist charlie parker or the more subdued cool sound of the influential trumpeter miles davis postwar jazz was cerebral intimate and individualistic.
as such it stood in stark contrast to the commercialized dance oriented swing bands of the 1930s and 1940s.

peale taught that with faith in god and positive thinking anyone could overcome obstacles and become a success.
graham schuller peale and other 1950s evangelicals laid the foundation for the rise of the televangelists who created popular television ministries in the 1970s.
the postwar purveyors of religious faith cast americans as a righteous people opposed to communist atheism.
when julius and ethel rosenberg were sentenced to death in 1953 the judge criticized them for devoting themselves to the russian ideology of denial of god cold war imperatives drew catholics protestants and jews into an influential ecumenical movement that downplayed doctrinal differences.
the phrase under god was inserted into the pledge of allegiance in 1954 and u s coins carried the words religion and the middle class in an age of anxiety about nuclear annihilation and the spread of godless communism americans yearned for a reaffirmation of faith.
church membership jumped from 49 percent of the population in 1940 to 70 percent in 1960.
people flocked to the evangelical protestant denominations beneficiaries of a remarkable new crop of preachers.
most eloquent was the young reverend billy graham who made brilliant use of television radio and advertising.
his massive 1949 revival in los angeles and his 1957 crusade at madison square garden in new york attended or viewed by hundreds of thousands of americans established graham as the nations leading evangelical.
rather than clashing with the new middle class ethic of consumption the religious reawakening was designed to mesh with it.
preachers such as graham and the california based robert schuller told americans that so long as they lived moral lives they deserved the material blessings of modern life.
no one was more influential in this regard than the minister and author norman vincent peale whose best selling book the power of positive thinking 1952 embodied the billy graham charismatic and inspiring billy graham wore down shoe leather to bring christian conversion to hundreds of thousands of americans in the 1940s and 1950s preaching to large crowds such as this one in columbia south carolina.
he also migrated onto the radio and television airwaves using technology to reach even wider audiences.

these religious initiatives struck a distinctly moderate tone however in comparison with the politicized evangelism that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s chapter 29.
the american family in the era of containment marriage family structure and gender roles had been undergoing significant changes since the turn of the twentieth century chapter 18.
beginning in the nineteenth century middle class americans increasingly saw marriage as companionate that is based on romantic love and a lifetime of shared friendship.
companionate did not mean equal.
in the mid twentieth century family life remained governed by notions of paternalism in which men provided economic support and controlled the familys financial resources while women cared for children and occupied a secondary position in public life.
the resurgent postwar american middle class was preoccupied with the virtues of paternalism.
everyone from professional psychologists to television advertisers and every organization from schools to the popular press celebrated nuclear families.
children were prized and womens caregiving roles were valorized.
this view of family life and especially its emphasis on female domesticity was bolstered by cold war politics.
americans who deviated from prevailing gender and familial norms were not only viewed with scorn but were also sometimes thought to be subversive and politically dangerous.
the word containment could apply to the home as easily as to foreign policy.
the family had become politicized by the cold war.
the model of domesticity so highly esteemed in postwar middle class morality hid deeper longer term changes in the way marriage gender roles womens work and even sex were understood.
to comprehend the postwar decades we have to keep in mind both the value placed on domesticity and the tumultuous changes surging beneath its prescriptions.
the baby boom a popular 1945 song was called gotta make up for lost time and americans did just that.
two things were noteworthy about the families they formed after world war ii first marriages were remarkably stable.
not until the mid 1960s did the divorce rate begin to rise sharply.
second married couples were intent on having babies.
everyone expected to have several children it was part of adulthood almost a citizens responsibility.
after a century and a half of decline the birthrate shot up.
more babies were born in the six years between 1948 and 1953 than in the previous thirty years figure 26 3.
one of the reasons for this baby boom was that people were having children at the same time.
a second was a drop in the average marriage age down to twenty two for men and twenty for women.
younger parents meant a bumper crop of children.
women who came of age in the 1930s averaged 2 4 children their counterparts in the 1950s averaged 3 2 children.
such a dramatic turnaround reflected couples decisions during the great depression to limit childbearing and couples contrasting decisions in the postwar years to have more children.
the baby boom peaked in 1957 and remained at a high level until the early 1960s.
far from normal all of these developments were anomalies temporary reversals of long standing demographic trends.
from the perspective of the whole of the twentieth century the 1950s and early 1960s stand out as exceptions to declining birthrates rising divorce rates and the steadily rising marriage age.
the passage of time revealed the ever widening impact of the baby boom.
when baby boomers competed for jobs during the 1970s the labor market became tight.
when career oriented baby boomers belatedly began having children in the 1980s the birthrate jumped.
and in our own time as baby boomers birthrate per 1 000 year figure 26 3 the american birthrate 1860 1980 when birthrates are viewed over more than a century the postwar baby boom is clearly only a temporary reversal of the long term downward trend in the american birthrate.
chapter 26 begin retiring huge funding problems threaten to engulf social security and medicare.
the intimate decisions of so many couples after world war ii continued to shape american life well into the twenty first century.
improving health and education baby boom children benefitted from a host of important advances in public health and medical practice in the postwar years.
formerly serious illnesses became merely routine after the introduction of such miracle drugs as penicillin introduced in 1943 streptomycin 1945 and cortisone 1946.
when dr jonas salk perfected a polio vaccine in 1954 he became a national hero.
the free distribution of salks vaccine in the nations schools followed in 1961 by dr albert sabins oral polio vaccine demonstrated the potential of government sponsored public health programs.
the baby boom also gave the nations educational system a boost.
postwar middle class parents americas first college educated generation placed a high value on education.
suburban parents approved 90 percent of school bond issues during the 1950s.
by 1970 school expenditures accounted for 7 2 percent of the gross national product double the 1950 level.
in the 1960s the baby boom generation swelled college enrollments.
state university systems grew in tandem the pioneering university of california university of wisconsin and state university of new york systems added dozens of new campuses and offered students in their states a low cost college education.
dr benjamin spock to keep baby boom children healthy and happy middle class parents increasingly relied on the advice of experts.
dr benjamin spocks common sense book of baby and child care sold 1 million copies every year after its publication in 1946.
spock urged mothers to abandon the rigid feeding and baby care schedules of an earlier generation.
new mothers found spocks commonsense approach liberating.
your little paperback is still in my cupboard with loose pages rather worn from use because i brought up two babies using it as my bible a california housewife wrote to spock.
despite his commonsense approach to child rearing spock was part of a generation of psychological experts whose advice often failed to reassure women.
if mothers were too protective spock and others argued they might hamper their childrens preparation for adult life.
on the other hand mothers who wanted to work outside the home felt guilty because spock recommended that they be constantly available for their triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 children.
as american mothers aimed for the perfection demanded of them seemingly at every turn many began to question these mixed messages.
some of them would be inspired by the resurgence of feminism in the 1960s.
place events in context why was there an increase in births in the decades after world war ii and what were some of the effects of this baby boom.
women work and family two powerful forces shaped womens relationships to work and family life in the postwar decades.
one was the middle class domestic ideal in which women were expected to raise children attend to other duties in the home and devote themselves to their husbands happiness.
so powerful was this ideal that in 1957 the ladies home journal entitled an article is college education wasted on women the second force was the job market.
most working class women had to earn a paycheck to help their family.
and despite their education middle class women found that jobs in the professions and business were dominated by men and often closed to them.
for both groups the market offered mostly womens jobs in teaching nursing and other areas of the growing service sector and little room for advancement american voices p 852.
the idea that a womans place was in the home was of course not new.
the postwar obsession with femininity and motherhood bore a remarkable similarity to the nineteenth centurys notion of domesticity.
the updated version drew on new elements of twentiethcentury science and culture.
psychologists equated motherhood with normal female identity and suggested that career minded mothers needed therapy.
a mother who runs out on her children to work except in cases of absolute necessity betrays a deep dissatisfaction with motherhood or with her marriage wrote one leading psychiatrist.
television shows and movies depicted career women as social misfits.
the postwar consumer culture also emphasized womens domestic role as purchasing agents for home and family.
can a woman ever feel right cooking on a dirty range asked one advertisement.
the postwar domestic ideal held that womens principal economic contribution came through consumption women shopped for the family.
in reality their contributions increasingly took them outside their homes and into the workforce.
in 1954 married women made up half of all women workers.
six years later the 1960 census reported a stunning fact the number of mothers who worked had increased four times and over one third of these women had children american voices coming of age in the postwar years at the dawn of the postwar era americans faced new opportunities and new anxieties.
many former soldiers attended college and purchased new homes on the gi bill which forever changed their lives.
women faced new pressures to realize the ideal role of housewife and mother.
on the horizon both in reality and in the american imagination lurked communism which americans feared but little understood.
and racial segregation continued to shape the ordinary lives of americans.
recorded here are several different reactions to these postwar tensions distinct experiences of coming of age in the 1940s and 1950s.

i was moving as fast as i could when suddenly i knew i wasnt going to make it all the way down those stairs and across the warehouse walkway to the colored ladies toilet.
so i pushed open the door marked white ladies and taking a deep breath i crossed the threshold.
it was just as bright and pretty as i had imagined it to be.
across the room other white ladies sat on a couch reading the newspaper.
suddenly realizing i was there two of them looked at me in astonishment.
unless i was the maid they said i was in the wrong place.
while they shouted at me to get out my throbbing bladder consumed my attention as i frantically headed for the unoccupied stall.
they kept shouting good lord do something i was doing something by that time seated comfortably on the toilet listening to the hysteria building outside my locked stall.
one woman even knelt down to peep beneath the door to make certain that i didnt put my bottom on the toilet seat.
she ordered me not to pee.

in his memoir he recalls the ritual of buying a house.
we never looked at a used house my father remembers of those days in the early 1960s when he and my mother went shopping for a home of their own in the valley of hearts delight.
a used house did not interest us instead they roved in search of balloons and bunting and the many billboards advertising low interest.
no money down.
to military veterans like my father.
they would follow the signs to the model homes standing in empty fields and tour the empty floor plans and leave with notes carefully made about square footage and closet space.
we shopped for a new house my father says the way you shopped for a car.
we were blithe conquerors my tribe.
when we chose a new homeland invaded a place settled it and made it over in our image we did so with a smiling sense of our own inevitability.
we were drawn to the promise of a blank page inviting our design upon it.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 mom at home and at work middle class womens lives grew increasingly complicated in the postwar decades.
they may have dreamed of a suburban home with a brand new kitchen like the one shown in this 1955 photograph left but laboring all day over children dirty dishes and a hot stove proved dissatisfying to many.
betty friedan called the confinement of womens identities to motherhood the feminine mystique but did the working woman have it much better.
most women in the 1950s and 1960s were confined to low level secretarial work right waitressing and other service sector work or worse factory or domestic labor.
by the end of the 1960s women had begun to crack the glass ceiling and enter the professions in larger numbers.
but regardless of their occupation the majority of working women performed the double day a full day at work and a full day at home.
such were the expectations and double bind women faced.
elliott erwitt magnum photos inge morath the inge morath foundation magnum photos.
between the ages of six and seventeen.
in that same year 30 percent of wives worked and by 1970 it was 40 percent.
for working class women in particular the economic needs of their families demanded that they work outside the home.
despite rising employment rates occupational segmentation still haunted women.
until 1964 the classified sections of newspapers separated employment ads into help wanted male and help wanted female more than 80 percent of all employed women did stereotypical womens work as salesclerks health care trace change technicians waitresses stewardover time esses domestic servants recepwhat transformations in tionists telephone operators and womens economic role took place in the 1950s secretaries.
in 1960 only 3 perand 1960s.
cent of lawyers and 6 percent of physicians were women on the flip side 97 percent of nurses and 85 percent of librarians were women.
along with womens jobs went womens pay which averaged 60 percent of mens pay in 1963.
contrary to stereotype however womens paid work was not merely supplementary.
it helped lift families into the middle class.
even in the prosperous 1950s many men found that their wages could not pay for what middle class life demanded cars houses vacations and college education for the children.
many families needed more than one wage earner just to get by.
among married women the highest rates of laborforce participation in the 1950s were found in families at the lower end of the middle class.
over the course of the postwar decades from 1945 to 1965 more and more women including married women from all class backgrounds entered the paid workforce.
how could american society steadfastly uphold the domestic ideal when so many wives and mothers were out of the house and at work.
in many ways the contradiction was hidden by the women themselves.
fearing public disapproval women would explain chapter 26 their work in family oriented terms as a way to save money for the childrens college education for instance.
moreover when women took jobs outside the home they still bore full responsibility for child care and household management contributing to the double day of paid work and family work.
as one overburdened woman noted she now had two full time jobs instead of just one underpaid clerical worker and unpaid housekeeper finally the pressures of the cold war made strong nuclear families with breadwinning fathers and domesticated mothers symbols of a healthy nation.
americans wanted to believe this even if it did not perfectly describe the reality of their lives.
challenging middle class morality in many ways the two decades between 1945 and 1965 were a period of cultural conservatism that reflected the values of domesticity.
at the dawn of the 1960s going steady as a prelude to marriage was the fad in high school.
college women had curfews and needed permission to see a male visitor.
americans married young more than half of those who married in 1963 were under the age of twenty one.
after the birth control pill came on the market in 1960 few doctors prescribed it to unmarried women and even married women did not enjoy unfettered access to contraception until the supreme court ruled it a privacy right in the 1965 decision griswold v connecticut.
triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 alfred kinsey yet beneath the surface of middleclass morality americans were less repressed than confused.
they struggled to reconcile new freedoms with older moral traditions.
this was especially true with regard to sex.
two controversial studies by an unassuming indiana university zoologist named alfred kinsey forced questions about sexuality into the open.
kinsey and his research team published sexual behavior in the human male in 1948 and followed it up in 1953 with sexual behavior in the human female an 842 page book that sold 270 000 copies in the first month after its publication.
taking a scientific rather than explain moralistic approach kinsey who consequences became known as the sex doc what were the contor documented the full range of tradictions in postwar sexual experiences of thousands domesticity and middleof americans.
he broke numer class morality.
ous taboos discussing such topics as homosexuality and marital infidelity in the detached language of science.
both studies confirmed that a sexual revolution although a largely hidden one had already begun to transform american society by the early 1950s.
kinsey estimated that 85 percent of men had had sex prior to marriage and that more than 25 percent of married women had had sex outside of marriage by the age of forty.
these were shocking public admissions in the late 1940s and early 1950s and hotter than the kinsey the kinsey reports like the woman on the cover of this lighthearted 1953 book of photographs many americans reacted with surprise when alfred kinsey revealed the countrys sexual habits.
in his 1948 book about men and his 1953 book about women kinsey wrote about american sexual practices in the detached language of science.
but it still made for salacious reading.
evangelical minister billy graham p 849 warned it is impossible to estimate the damage this book will do to the already deteriorated morals of america picture research consultants archives.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 report became a national figure of speech.
kinsey was criticized by statisticians because his samples were not randomly selected and condemned even more fervently by religious leaders who charged him with encouraging promiscuity and adultery.
but his research opened a national conversation with profound implications for the future.
even if kinseys numbers were off he helped americans learn to talk more openly about sex.
the homophile movement among the most controversial of kinseys claims was that homosexuality was far more prevalent than most americans believed.
although the american psychiatric association would officially define homosexuality as a mental illness in 1952 kinseys research found that 37 percent of men had engaged in some form of homosexual activity by early adulthood as had 13 percent of women.
even more important kinsey claimed that 10 percent of american men were exclusively homosexual.
these claims came as little surprise but great encouragement to a group of gay and lesbian activists who called themselves homophiles organized primarily in the mattachine society the first gay rights organization in the country founded in 1951 and the daughters of bilitis a lesbian organization founded in 1955 homophiles were a small but determined collection of activists who sought equal rights for gays and lesbians.
the lesbian is a woman endowed with all the attributes of any other woman wrote the pioneer lesbian activist del martin in 1956.
the salvation of the lesbian lies in her acceptance of herself without guilt or anxiety building on the urban gay and lesbian communities that had coalesced during world war ii homophiles sought to change american attitudes about same sex love.
they faced daunting obstacles since same sex sexual relations were illegal in every state and scorned or feared by most americans.
to combat prejudice and change the laws homophile organizations cultivated a respectable middle class image.
members were encouraged to avoid bars and nightclubs to dress in conservative shirts and ties for men and modest skirts and blouses for women and to seek out professional psychologists who would attest to their normalcy only in the 1960s did homophiles begin to talk about the homophile vote and their rights as citizens laying the groundwork for the gay rights movement of the 1970s.
media and morality the homophile movement remained unknown to most americans.
but other challenges to traditional morality received national media attention and the media themselves became a controversial source of these challenges.
concerned that excessive crime violence and sex in comic books were encouraging juvenile delinquency the u s senate held nationally televised hearings in 1954.
the senates final report written largely by the tennessee democrat estes kefauver complained of the scantily clad women and penchant for violent death common in comic books aimed at teenagers.
kefauvers report forced the comics industry to tame its wildest practices but did little to slow the growing frankness about both sex and violence in the nations printed media and films.
to see a longer excerpt from the senate hearing on juvenile delinquency along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
a magazine entrepreneur from chicago named hugh hefner played a leading role in that growing frankness.
hefner founded playboy magazine in 1953 in which he created a countermorality to domesticity a fictional world populated by hip bachelor men and sexually available women.
hefners imagined bachelors condemned marriage and lived in sophisticated apartments filled with the latest stereo equipment and other consumer products.
while domesticated fathers bought lawn mowers and patio furniture hefners magazine encouraged men to spend money on clothing and jazz albums for themselves and for the scantily clad women that filled its pages.
hefner and his numerous imitators became powerful purveyors of sex in the media.
but hefner was the exception that proved the rule marriage not swinging bachelorhood remained the destination for the vast majority of men.
millions of men read playboy but few adopted its fantasy lifestyle.
a suburban nation prosperity how much an economy produces how much people earn is more easily measured than is quality of life.
during the 1950s however the american definition of the good life emerged with exceptional distinctness a high value on consumption a devotion to family and domesticity and preference for suburban living.
in this section we consider the third dimension of that definition suburbanization.
what drove the nation to abandon its cities for the suburbs and what social and political consequences did this shift have.
the postwar housing boom migration to the suburbs had been going on for a hundred years but never before on the scale that the country experienced after world war ii.
within a decade chapter 26 farmland on the outskirts of cities filled up with tract housing and shopping malls.
entire counties that had once been rural such as san mateo south of san francisco or passaic and bergen in new jersey west of manhattan went suburban.
by 1960 one third of americans lived in suburbs.
home construction having ground to a halt during the great depression surged after the war.
one fourth of the countrys entire housing stock in 1960 had not even existed a decade earlier.
william j levitt and the fha two unique postwar developments remade the national housing market and gave it a distinctly suburban shape.
first an innovative long island building contractor william j levitt revolutionized suburban housing by applying mass production techniques and turning out new homes at a dizzying speed.
levitts basic four room house complete with kitchen appliances was priced at 7 990 when homes in the first levittown went on sale in 1947 about 76 000 today.
levitt did not need to advertise word of mouth brought buyers flocking to his developments all called levittown in new york pennsylvania and new jersey.
dozens of other developers were soon snapping up cheap farmland and building subdivisions around the country.
even at 7 990 levitts homes would have been beyond the means of most young families had the traditional home financing standard a down payment of half the full price and ten years to pay off the balance still prevailed.
that is where the second postwar development came in.
the federal housing administration fha and the veterans administration va that is the federal government brought the home mortgage market within the reach of a broader range of americans than ever before.
after the war the fha insured thirty year mortgages with as little as 5 percent down and interest at 2 or 3 percent.
the va was even more generous requiring only a token 1 down for qualified ex gis.
fha and va mortgages best explain why after hovering around 45 percent for the previous half century home ownership jumped to 60 percent by 1960.
what purchasers of suburban houses got in addition to a good deal were homogeneous communities.
the developments contained few elderly people or unmarried adults.
even the trees were young.
levitts company enforced regulations about maintaining lawns and not hanging out laundry on the weekends.
then there was the matter of race.
levitts houses came with restrictive covenants prohibiting occupancy by members of other than the caucasian race restrictive covenants often applied to jews and in california triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 asian americans as well.
levittowns were hardly alone.
suburban developments from coast to coast exhibited the same age class and racial homogeneity thinking place events like a historian p 858.
in context in shelley v kraemer 1948 place postwar suburbanthe supreme court outlawed ization in the context restrictive covenants but racial dis of the growing size and crimination in housing changed influence of the federal little.
the practice persisted long government.
how did after shelley because the fha and the national government va continued the policy of redlin encourage suburbanizaing refusing mortgages to african tion.
americans and members of other minority groups seeking to buy in white neighborhoods.
indeed no federal law or even court decisions like shelley actually prohibited racial discrimination in housing until congress passed the fair housing act in 1968.
interstate highways without automobiles suburban growth on such a massive scale would have been impossible.
planners laid out subdivisions on the assumption that everybody would drive.
and they did to get to work to take the children to little league to shop.
with gas plentiful and cheap 15 cents a gallon no one cared about the fuel efficiency of their v 8 engines or seemed to mind the elaborate tail fins and chrome that weighed down their cars.
in 1945 americans owned twenty five million cars by 1965 just two decades later the number had tripled to seventy five million america compared p 860.
american oil consumption followed course tripling as well between 1949 and 1972.
more cars required more highways and the federal government obliged.
in 1956 in a move that drastically altered americas landscape and driving habits the national interstate and defense highways act authorized 26 billion over a ten year period for the construction of a nationally integrated highway system 42 500 miles map 26 1.
cast as a cold war necessity because broad highways made evacuating crowded cities easier in the event of a nuclear attack the law changed american cities forever.
an enormous public works program surpassing anything undertaken during the new deal and enthusiastically endorsed by the republican president dwight eisenhower federal highways made possible the massive suburbanization of the nation in the 1960s.
interstate highways rerouted traffic away from small towns bypassed well traveled main roads such as the cross country route 66 and cut wide swaths through old neighborhoods in the cities.
thinking like a historian the suburban landscape of cold war america between the end of world war ii and the 1980s americans built and moved into suburban homes in an unprecedented wave of construction and migration that changed the nation forever.
new home loan rules and government backing under the federal housing administration and veterans administration made new suburban houses cheaper and brought home ownership within reach of a larger number of americans than ever before.
commentators cheered these developments as a boon to ordinary citizens but by the 1960s a generation of urban critics led by journalist jane jacobs had begun to find fault with the nations suburban obsession.
the following documents provide the historian with evidence of how these new suburban communities arose and how they began to transform american culture.
peacetime cornucopia the new yorker october 6 1945.
life magazine a life round table on housing january 31 1949.
the most aggressive member of lifes round table whether as builder or debater was william j levitt president of levitt and sons inc of manhasset ny.
he feels that he has started a revolution the essence of which is size.
builders in his estimation are a poor and puny lot too small to put pressure on materials manufacturers or the local czars of the building codes or the bankers or labor.
a builder ought to be a manufacturer he said and to this end must be big.
he himself is a nonunion operator.
the levitt prescription for cheaper houses may be summarized as follows 1 take infinite pains with infinite details 2 be aggressive 3 be big enough to throw your weight around 4 buy at wholesale and 5 build houses in concentrated developments where mass production methods can be used on the site.

william h whyte jr the organization man 1956.
whyte a prominent journalist wrote about the decline of individualism and the rise of a national class of interchangeable white collar workers.
and is this not the whole drift of our society.
we are not interchangeable in the sense of being people without differences but in the externals of existence we are united by a culture increasingly national.
and this is part of the momentum of mobility.
the more people move about the more similar american environments become and the more similar they become the easier it is to move about.
more and more the young couples who move do so only physically.
with each transfer the dcor the architecture the faces and the names may change the people the conversation and the values do not and sometimes the dcor and architecture dont either.
suburban residents like to maintain that their suburbia not only looks classless but is classless.
that is they are apt to add on second thought there are no extremes and if the place isnt exactly without class it is at least a one class society identified as the middle or upper middle according to the inclination of the residents.
we are all they say in the same boat 5.
jane jacobs the death and life of great american cities 1961.
a classic celebration of vibrant urban neighborhoods by a new york writer and architectural critic.
although it is hard to believe while looking at dull gray areas or at housing projects or at civic centers the fact is that big cities are natural generators of diversity and prolific incubators of new enterprises and ideas of all kinds.
this is because city populations are large enough to support wide ranges of variety and choice in these things.
and again we find that bigness has all the advantages in smaller settlements.
towns and suburbs for instance are natural homes for huge supermarkets and for little else in the way of groceries for standard movie houses or drive ins and for little else in the way of theater.
there are simply not enough people to support further variety although there may be people too few of them who would draw upon it were it there.
cities however are the natural homes of supermarkets and standard movie houses plus delicatessens viennese bakeries foreign groceries art movies and so on.
the diversity of whatever kind that is generated by cities rests on the fact that in cities so many people are so close together and among them contain so many different tastes skills needs supplies and bees in their bonnets.
herbert j gans the levittowners 1967.
one of the first sociological studies of the new postwar suburbs and their residents.
the strengths and weakness of levittown are those of many american communities and the levittowners closely resemble other young middle class americans.
they are not america for they are not a numerical majority of the population but they represent the major constituency of the latest and more powerful economic and political institutions in american society the favored customers and voters whom these seek to attract and satisfy.
although they are citizens of a national polity and their lives are shaped by national economic social and political forces levittowners deceive themselves into thinking that the community or rather the home is the single most important unit of their lives.
in viewing their homes as the center of life levitowners are still using a societal model that fit the rural america of self sufficient farmers and the feudal europe of self isolating extended families.

fast food and shopping malls americans did not simply fill their new suburban homes with the latest appliances and gadgets they also pioneered entirely new forms of consumption.
through world war ii downtowns had remained the center of retail sales and restaurant dining with their grand department stores elegant eateries and low cost diners.
as suburbanites abandoned big city centers in the 1950s ambitious entrepreneurs invented two new commercial forms that would profoundly shape the rest of the century the shopping mall and the fast food restaurant.
by the late 1950s the suburban shopping center had become as much a part of the american landscape as the levittowns and their imitators.
a major developer of shopping malls in the northeast called them questions for analysis 1.
from bartovs observations what are the pluses and minuses of americas car culture.
in what ways was the automobile changing american society.
why did bartov find that owning a car was necessary especially in southern california.

in 1939 the suburban share of total metropolitan retail trade in the united states was a paltry 4 percent.
by 1961 it was an astonishing 60 percent in the nations ten largest metropolitan regions.
no one was more influential in creating suburban patterns of consumption than a chicago born son of czech immigrants named ray kroc.

the act not only pleased american drivers and enhanced their love affair with the automobile but also benefitted the petroleum construction trucking real estate and tourist industries.
the new highway system promoted the nations economic integration facilitated the growth of suburbs and contributed to the erosion of americas distinct regional identities.
musician and traveling salesman kroc found his calling in 1954 when he acquired a single franchise of the little known mcdonalds restaurant based in san bernardino california.
in 1956 kroc invested in twelve more franchises and by 1958 owned seventynine.
three years later kroc bought the company from fast food 1949 the sign atop this suburban los angeles restaurant says it all.
suburbanization laid the foundation for a unique postwar phenomenon that would forever change american life the rise of fast food.

at the end of the century californias economy was among the top ten largest in the world among nations.
a distinctive feature of sunbelt suburbanization was its close relationship to the military industrial complex.
building on world war ii expansion military bases proliferated in the south and southwest in the postwar decades especially in florida texas and california.
in some instances entire metropolitan regions such as san diego county california and the houston area in texas expanded in tandem with nearby military outposts.
moreover the aerospace defense and electronics industries were based largely in sunbelt metropolitan regions.
with government contracts fueling the economy and military bases providing thousands of jobs sunbelt politicians had every staple of the american diet in the subsequent decades.
by the year 2000 fast food was a 100 billion industry and more children recognized ronald mcdonald the clown in mcdonalds television commercials than santa claus.
rise of the sunbelt suburban living although a nationwide phenomenon was most at home in the sunbelt the southern and southwestern states where taxes were low the climate was mild and open space allowed for sprawling subdivisions map 26 2.
florida added 3 5 million people many of them retired between 1940 and 1970.

the second pattern involves the growth of metropolitan areas defined as a central city or urban area and its suburbs.
the central cities were themselves mostly not growing however.
the metropolitan growth shown in this map was accounted for by the expanding suburbs.

sunbelt suburbanization was best exemplified by orange county california.
southwest of los angeles orange county was until the 1940s mostly just that a land of oranges groves of them.
but during world war ii boosters attracted new bases and training facilities for the marines navy and air force at the time the army air corps.
cold war militarization and the korean war kept those bases humming and hughes aircraft ford aeronautics and other defense related manufacturers built new plants in the sunny sprawling groves.
so did subdivision developers who built so many new homes that the population of the county jumped from 130 760 in 1940 to 703 925 in 1960.
casting his eye on all this development in the early 1950s an entrepreneurial filmmaker and cartoonist named walt disney chose anaheim in orange county as the place for a massive new amusement park.
disneyland was to the new generation of suburbanites what coney island had been to an earlier generation of urbanites.
two societies urban and suburban while middle class whites flocked to the suburbs an opposite stream of working class migrants many of them southern african americans moved into the cities.
in the 1950s the nations twelve largest cities lost 3 6 million whites while gaining 4 5 million nonwhites.
these urban newcomers inherited a declining economy and a decaying infrastructure.
to those enjoying prosperity the other america as the social critic michael harrington called it remained largely invisible.
in 1968 however a report by the national advisory commission on civil disorders informally known as the kerner commission and formed by the president to investigate the causes of the 1967 urban riots delivered to president lyndon johnson warned that our nation is moving toward two societies one black one white separate and unequal american cities had long been the home of poverty slum housing and the hardships and cultural dislocations brought on by immigration from overseas or migration from rural areas.
but postwar american cities especially those in the industrial northeast and midwest experienced these problems with new intensity.
by the 1950s the manufacturing sector was contracting and mechanization was eliminating thousands upon thousands of unskilled and semiskilled jobs the kind traditionally taken up by new urban residents.
the disappearing jobs were the ones in which african americans are disproportionately triumph of the middle class 1945 1963 concentrated noted the civil rights activist bayard rustin.
the urban crisis the intensification of poverty the deterioration of older housing stock and the persistence of racial segregation produced what many at the time called the urban crisis.
unwelcome in the shiny new suburbs built by men such as william j levitt african americans found low paying jobs in the city and lived in aging slumlike apartment buildings.
despite a thriving black middle class indeed larger than ever before for those without resources upward mobility remained elusive.
racism in institutional forms frustrated african americans at every turn housing restrictions increasingly segregated schools and an urban infrastructure that stood underfunded and decaying as whites left for the suburbs.
housing and job discrimination were compounded by the frenzy of urban renewal that hit black neighborhoods in the 1950s and early 1960s.

two societies.
in boston almost one third of the old city including the historic west end a longestablished italian neighborhood was demolished to make way for a new highway high rise housing and government and commercial buildings.
in san francisco some 4 000 residents of the western addition a predominantly black neighborhood lost out to an urban renewal program that built luxury housing a shopping center and an express boulevard.
between 1949 and 1967 urban renewal nationwide demolished almost 400 000 buildings and displaced 1 4 million people.
the urban experts believed they knew what to do with the dislocated relocate them to federally funded housing projects an outgrowth of new deal housing policy now much expanded.
however well intended these grim projects too often took the form of cheap high rises that isolated their inhabitants from surrounding neighborhoods.
the impact was felt especially strongly among african americans who often found that public housing increased racial segregation and concentrated the poor.
the robert taylor homes in chicago with twenty eight buildings of sixteen stories each housed 20 000 residents almost all of them black.
despite the planners wish to build part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 urban crisis this pittsburgh neighborhood photographed in 1955 typified what many came to call the urban crisis of the 1950s and 1960s.
as suburbanization drew middle class residents investment and jobs away from the core of older cities those cities began to rot from the inside.
urban neglect left many working class neighborhoods increasingly occupied by the nations poor with few jobs little industry and dilapidated housing.
w eugene smith black star.
decent affordable apartments the huge complex became a notorious breeding ground for crime and hopelessness.
urban immigrants despite the evident urban crisis cities continued to attract immigrants from abroad.
since the passage of the national origins act of 1924 chapter 22 u s immigration policy had aimed mainly at keeping foreigners out.
but world war ii and the cold war began slowly to change american policy.
the displaced persons act of 1948 permitted the entry of approximately 415 000 europeans many of them jewish refugees.
in a gesture to an important war ally the chinese exclusion act was repealed in 1943.
more far reaching was the 1952 mccarran walter act which ended the exclusion of japanese koreans and southeast asians.
after the national origins quota system went into effect in 1924 mexico replaced eastern and southern europe as the nations labor reservoir.
during world war ii the federal government introduced the bracero program to ease wartime labor shortages chapter 24 and then revived it in 1951 during the korean war.
the federal governments ability to force workers to return to mexico however was strictly limited.
the mexican immigrant population continued to grow and by the time the bracero program ended in 1964 many of that group an estimated 350 000 had settled permanently in the united states.
braceros were joined by other mexicans from small towns and villages who immigrated to the united states to escape poverty or to earn money to return home and purchase land for farming.
as generations of immigrants had before them mexicans gravitated to major cities.
mostly they settled in los angeles long beach san jose el paso and other southwestern cities.
but many also went north augmenting well established mexican american communities in chicago detroit kansas city and denver.
although still important to american agriculture mexican americans were employed in substantial numbers as industrial and service workers by 1960.
another major group of spanish speaking migrants came from puerto rico.
american citizens since 1917 puerto ricans enjoyed an unrestricted right to move to the mainland united states.
migration increased dramatically after world war ii when mechanization of the islands sugarcane agriculture left many puerto ricans jobless.
airlines began to offer cheap direct flights between san juan and new york city.
with the fare at about 50 two weeks wages puerto ricans became americas first immigrants to arrive en masse by air.
most puerto ricans went to new york where they settled first in east spanish harlem and then scattered in neighborhoods across the citys five boroughs.
this massive migration which increased the puerto rican population to 613 000 by 1960 transformed the ethnic composition of the city.
more puerto ricans now lived in new york city than in san juan.
cuban refugees constituted the third largest group of spanish speaking immigrants.
in the six years after fidel castros seizure of power in 1959 chapter 25 an chapter 26 estimated 180 000 people fled cuba for the united states.
the cuban refugee community grew so quickly that it turned miami into a cosmopolitan bilingual city almost overnight.
unlike other urban migrants miamis cubans quickly prospered in large part because they had arrived with money and middle class skills.
spanish speaking immigrants whether mexican puerto rican or cuban created huge barrios in major american cities where bilingualism flourished the catholic church shaped religious life and families sought to join the economic mainstream.
though distinct from one another these spanish speaking communities remained largely segregated from white or anglo neighborhoods and suburbs as well as from african american districts.
summary we have explored how at the same time it became mired in the cold war the united states entered an unparalleled era of prosperity in which a new middle class came into being.
indeed the cold war was one of the engines of prosperity.
the postwar economy was chapter review marked by the dominance of big corporations and defense spending.
after years of depression and war induced insecurity americans turned inward toward religion home and family.
postwar couples married young had several children and if they were white and middle class raised their children in a climate of suburban comfort and consumerism.
the profamily orientation of the 1950s celebrated traditional gender roles even though millions of women entered the workforce in those years.
not everyone however shared in the postwar prosperity.
postwar cities increasingly became places of last resort for the nations poor.
black migrants unlike earlier immigrants encountered an urban economy that had little use for them.
without opportunity and faced with pervasive racism many of them were on their way to becoming an american underclass even as sparkling new suburbs emerged outside cities to house the new middle class.
many of the smoldering contradictions of the postwar period cold war anxiety in the midst of suburban domesticity tensions in womens lives economic and racial inequality helped spur the protest movements of the 1960s.

from vigorous gesturing eastland ridiculed black troops.
the negro soldier was an utter and dismal failure in combat he said.
eastlands assertions were untrue.
black soldiers had served honorably many won medals for bravery in combat.
all black units such as the 761st black panther tank battalion and the famous tuskegee airmen were widely praised by military commanders.
but segregationists like eastland were a nearly unassailable force in congress able to block civil rights legislation and shape national opinion.
in the 1940s two generations after w e b.
du bois famously wrote that the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line few white americans believed wholeheartedly in racial equality.
racial segregation remained entrenched across the country.
much of the deep south like eastlands mississippi was a closed society black people had no political rights and lived on the margins of white society impoverished and exploited.
northern cities proved more hospitable to african americans but schools neighborhoods and many businesses remained segregated and unequal in the north as well.
across the nation however winds of change were gathering.
between world war ii and the 1970s slowly at first and then with greater urgency in the 1960s the civil rights movement swept aside systematic racial segregation.
it could not sweep away racial inequality completely but the movement constituted a second reconstruction in which african american activism reshaped the nations laws and practices.
civil rights was the paradigmatic social movement of the twentieth century.
its model of nonviolent protest and its calls for self determination inspired the new left feminism the chicano movement the gay rights movement the american indian movement and many others.
the black led civil rights movement joined at key moments by latinos asian americans and native americans redefined liberalism.
in the 1930s new deal liberalism had established a welfare state to protect citizens from economic hardship.
the civil rights movement forged a new rights liberalism the notion that individuals require state protection from discrimination.
this version of liberalism focused on identities such as race or sex rather than general social welfare and as such would prove to be both a necessary expansion of the nations ideals and a divisive force that produced political backlash.
indeed the quest for racial justice would contribute to a crisis of liberalism itself.

bob adelman magnum photos inc part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the emerging civil rights struggle 1941 1957 as it took shape during world war ii and the early cold war the battle against racial injustice proceeded along two tracks at the grass roots and in governing institutions federal courts state legislatures and ultimately the u s congress.
labor unions churches and protest organizations such as the congress of racial equality core inspired hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens to join the movement.
but grassroots struggle was not african americans only weapon.
they also had the bill of rights and the reconstruction amendments to the constitution.
civil rights lived in those documents especially in the fourteenth amendment which guaranteed equal protection under the law to all u s citizens and in the fifteenth which guaranteed the right to vote regardless of race color or previous condition of servitude but had been ignored or violated for nearly a century.
the task was to restore the constitutions legal force.
neither track grassroots or legal legislative was entirely independent of the other.
together they were the foundation of the fight for racial equality in the postwar decades.
life under jim crow racial segregation and economic exploitation defined the lives of the majority of african americans in the postwar decades.
numbering 15 million in 1950 african americans were approximately 10 percent of the u s population.
in the south however they constituted between 30 and 50 percent of the population of several states such as south carolina and mississippi.
segregation commonly known as jim crow chapter 18 prevailed in every aspect of life in the southern states where two thirds of all african americans lived in 1950.
african americans could not eat in restaurants patronized by whites or use the same waiting rooms at bus stations.
all forms of public transportation were rigidly segregated by custom or by law.
public parks and libraries were segregated.
even drinking fountains were labeled white and colored this system of segregation underlay economic and political structures that further marginalized and disempowered black citizens.
virtually no african segregation in mobile 1956 as the law of the land in most southern states racial segregation known as jim crow required the complete separation of blacks and whites in most public spaces.
the white only drinking fountain shown in this 1956 photograph in mobile alabama was typical.
everything from waiting areas to libraries public parks schools restrooms and even cola vending machines was subject to strict racial segregation.

chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 american could work for city or state government and the best jobs in the private sector were reserved for whites.
black workers labored in the back cleaning cooking stocking shelves and loading trucks for the lowest wages.
rural african americans labored in a sharecropping system that kept them stuck in poverty often prevented them from obtaining an education and offered virtually no avenue of escape.
politically less than 20 percent of eligible black voters were allowed to vote the result of poll taxes literacy tests intimidation fraud and the white primary elections in which only whites could vote.
this near total disenfranchisement gave whites power disproportionate to their numbers black people were one third of the residents of mississippi south carolina and georgia but had virtually no political voice in those states.
in the north racial segregation in everyday life was less acute but equally tangible.
northern segregation took the form of a spatial system in which whites increasingly lived in suburbs or on the outskirts of cities while african americans were concentrated in declining downtown neighborhoods.
the result was what many called ghettos all black districts characterized by high rents low wages and inadequate city services.
employment discrimination and lack of adequate training left many african americans without any means of support.
few jobs other than the most menial were open to african americans journalists accountants engineers and other highly educated men from all black colleges and universities often labored as railroad porters or cooks because jobs commensurate with their skills remained for whites only.
these conditions produced a self perpetuating cycle that kept far too many black citizens trapped on the social margins.
to be certain african americans found greater freedom in the north and west than in the south.
they could vote participate in politics and at least after the early 1960s enjoy equal access to public accommodations.
but we err in thinking that racial segregation was only a southern problem or that poverty and racial discrimination were not also deeply entrenched in the north and west.
in northern cities such as detroit chicago and philadelphia for instance white home owners in the 1950s used various tactics from police harassment to thrown bricks burning crosses bombs and mob violence to keep african americans from living near them.
moreover as we saw in chapter 26 federal housing administration fha and bank redlining excluded african american home buyers from the all white suburbs emerging around major cities.
racial segregation was a national not regional problem.
origins of the civil rights movement since racial discrimination had been part of american life for hundreds of years why did the civil rights movement arise when it did.
after all the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp founded in 1909 had begun challenging racial segregation in a series of court cases in the 1930s.
and other organizations such as marcus garveys united negro improvement association in the 1920s had attracted significant popular support.
these precedents were important but several factors came together in the middle of the twentieth century to make a broad movement possible.
an important influence was world war ii.
the jewish people and the negro people both know the meaning of nordic supremacy wrote the african american poet langston hughes in 1945.
in the war against fascism the allies sought to discredit racist nazi ideology.
committed to fighting racism abroad americans increasingly condemned racism at home.
the cold war placed added pressure on u s officials.
more and more we are learning how closely our democracy is under observation president harry s truman commented in 1947.
to inspire other nations in the global standoff with the soviet union truman explained we must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy among the most consequential factors was the growth of the urban black middle class.
historically small the black middle class experienced robust growth after world war ii.
its ranks produced most of the civil identify causes rights leaders ministers teachers how did the growth of the trade unionists attorneys and black middle class assist other professionals.
churches for the civil rights movement.
centuries a sanctuary for black americans were especially important.
moreover in the 1960s african american college students part of the largest expansion of college enrollment in u s history joined the movement adding new energy and fresh ideas table 27 1.
with access to education media and institutions this new middle class had more resources than ever before.
less dependent on white patronage and therefore less vulnerable to white retaliation middle class african americans were in a position to lead a movement for change.
still other influences assisted the movement.
white labor leaders were generally more equality minded than the rank and file but the united auto workers the united steelworkers and the communications workers of america among many other trade unions part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 table 27 1 african american college enrollment year number of african americans enrolled rounded to nearest thousand 60 000 110 000 185 000 430 000 1 4 million 3 6 million were reliable allies at the national level.
the new medium of television too played a crucial role.
when television networks covered early desegregation struggles such as the 1957 integration of little rock high school americans across the country saw the violence of white supremacy firsthand.
none of these factors alone was decisive.
none ensured an easy path.
the civil rights movement faced enormous resistance and required dauntless courage and sacrifice from thousands upon thousands of activists for more than three decades.
ultimately however the movement changed the nation for the better and improved the lives of millions of americans.
world war ii the beginnings during the war fought to make the world safe for democracy the united states was far from ready to extend full equality to its own black citizens.
black workers faced discrimination in wartime employment and the more than one million black troops who served in world war ii were placed in segregated units commanded by whites.
both at home and abroad world war ii immeasurably magnified the negros awareness of the disparity between the american profession postwar desegregation picketers outside the july 1948 democratic national convention demand that the party include equal rights and anti jim crow planks in its official platform and desegregate the armed services.
leading the pickets is a philip randolph president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters.
randolph headed the march on washington movement that pressured president roosevelt to desegregate defense employment during world war ii and he led the committee that convinced president truman to desegregate the armed forces in 1948.

chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 and practice of democracy naacp president walter white observed.
executive order 8802 on the home front activists pushed two strategies.
first a philip randolph whose brotherhood of sleeping car porters was the most prominent black trade union called for a march on washington in early 1941.
randolph planned to bring 100 000 protesters to the nations capital if african americans were not given equal opportunity in war jobs then just beginning to expand with president franklin roosevelts pledge to supply the allies with materiel.
to avoid a divisive protest fdr issued executive order 8802 in june of that year prohibiting racial discrimination in defense industries and randolph agreed to cancel the march.
the resulting fair employment practices commission fepc had few enforcement powers but it set an important precedent federal action.
randolphs efforts showed that white leaders and institutions could be swayed by concerted african american action.
it would be a critical lesson for the movement.
the double v campaign a second strategy jumped from the pages of the pittsburgh courier one of the foremost african american newspapers of the era.
it was the brainchild of an ordinary cafeteria worker from kansas.
in a 1942 letter to the editor james g thompson urged that colored americans adopt the double vv for a double victory victory over fascism abroad and victory over racism at home.
edgar rouzeau editor of the papers new york office agreed black america must fight two wars and win in both instantly dubbed the double v campaign thompsons notion with rouzeaus backing spread like wildfire through black communities across the country.
african americans would demonstrate their loyalty and citizenship by fighting the axis powers.
but they would also demand peacefully but emphatically the defeat of racism at home.
the suffering and privation may be great rouzeau told his readers but the rewards loom even greater the double v efforts met considerable resistance.
in war industries factories periodically shut down in chicago baltimore philadelphia and other cities because of hate strikes the refusal of white workers to labor alongside black workers.
detroit was especially tense.
referring to the potential for racial strife life magazine reported in 1942 that detroit is dynamite.
it can either blow up hitler or blow up america in 1943 it nearly did the latter.
on a hot summer day whites from the citys ethnic neighborhoods wartime workers during world war ii hundreds of thousands of black migrants left the south bound for large cities in the north and west.
there they found jobs such as the welding work done by these african american women at the landers frary and clark plant in new britain connecticut.
fighting employment discrimination during the war represented one of the earliest phases in the long struggle against racial segregation in the united states.

three days of rioting ensued in which thirty four people were killed twenty five of them black.
federal troops were called in to restore order.
despite and because of such incidents a generation was spurred into action during the war years.
in new york city employment discrimination on the citys transit lines prompted one of the first bus boycotts in the nations history led in 1941 by harlem minister adam clayton explain powell jr.
in chicago james consequences farmer and three other members why did world war ii play of the fellowship of reconciliation such a critical role in the for a nonviolent peace orga civil rights movement.

another for member in new york bayard rustin was equally instrumental in promoting direct action he led one of part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 joining the brooklyn dodgers in 1947 but the growing black vote in northern cities proved more decisive.
during world war ii more than a million african americans migrated to northern and western cities where they joined the democratic party of franklin roosevelt and the new deal map 27 1.
this newfound political leverage awakened northern liberals many of whom became allies of civil rights advocates.
ultimately the cold war produced mixed results as the nations commitment to anticommunism opened some avenues for civil rights while closing others.
the earliest challenges to southern segregation the 1947 journey of reconciliation.
meanwhile after the war hundreds of thousands of african american veterans used the gi bill to go to college trade school or graduate school placing themselves in a position to push against segregation.
at the wars end powell affirmed that the black man.
is ready to throw himself into the struggle to make the dream of america become flesh and blood bread and butter cold war civil rights demands for justice persisted in the early years of the cold war.
african american efforts were propelled by symbolic victories as when jackie robinson broke through the color line in major league baseball by civil rights and the new deal coalition african american leaders were uncertain what to expect from president truman inheritor of the new deal coalition but not opposed to using racist language himself.

between world war i which marked the start of the great migration and the 1970s more than 6 million african americans left the south.
where they settled in the north and west they helped change the politics of entire cities and even states.
seeking black votes which had become a key to victory in major cities liberal democrats and republicans alike in new york illinois california and pennsylvania for instance increasingly made civil rights part of their platform.
in this way migration advanced the political cause of black equality.
300 miles 300 kilometers chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 though he did not immediately support social equality for african americans truman supported civil rights because he believed in equality before the law.
moreover he understood the growing importance of the small but often decisive black vote in key northern states such as new york illinois pennsylvania and michigan.
civil rights activists randolph and powell along with vocal white liberals such as hubert humphrey the mayor of minneapolis and members of americans for democratic action ada a liberal organization pressed truman to act.
with no support for civil rights in congress truman turned to executive action.
in 1946 he appointed the presidential committee on civil rights whose 1947 report to secure these rights called for robust federal action to ensure equality for african americans.
with the report fresh in his mind in 1948 truman issued an executive order desegregating employment in federal agencies and under pressure from randolphs committee against jim crow in military service desegregated the armed forces.
truman then sent a message to congress asking that all of the reports recommendations including the abolition of poll taxes and the restoration of the fair employment practices commission be made into law.
it was the most aggressive and politically bold call for racial equality by the leader of a major political party since reconstruction.
trumans boldness was too much for southern democrats.
under the leadership of strom thurmond governor of south carolina white democrats from the south formed the states rights democratic party known popularly as the dixiecrats for the 1948 election chapter 25.
this brought into focus an internal struggle developing within the democratic party and its still formidable new deal coalition.
would the civil rights aims of the partys liberal wing alienate southern white democrats as well as many suburban whites in the north.
it was the first hint of the discord that would eventually divide the democratic party in the 1960s.
race and anticommunism the cold war shaped civil rights in both positive and negative terms.
in a time of growing fear of communist expansionism truman worried about americas image in the world.
he reminded americans that when whites and blacks fail to live together in peace that failure hurt the cause of democracy itself in the whole world indeed the soviet union used american racism as a means of discrediting the united states abroad.
we cannot escape the fact that our civil rights record has been an issue in world politics the committee on civil rights wrote.
international tensions between the united states and the soviet union thus appeared to strengthen the hand of civil rights leaders because america needed to demonstrate to the rest of the world that its race relations were improving america compared p 876.
however the cold war strengthened one hand while weakening the other.
mccarthyism and the hunt for subversives at home held the civil rights movement back.
civil rights opponents charged that racial integration was communistic and the naacp was banned in many southern states as an anti american organization.

mexican americans and japanese americans african americans were the most prominent but not the only group in american society to organize against racial injustice in the 1940s.
in the southwest from texas to california mexican immigrants and mexican americans endured a caste system not unlike the jim crow system in the south.
in texas for instance poll taxes kept most mexican american citizens from voting.
decades of discrimination by employers in agriculture and manufacturing made possible by the constant supply of cheap labor from across the border suppressed wages and kept the majority of mexican americans barely above poverty.
many lived in colonias or barrios neighborhoods separated from anglos and often lacking sidewalks reliable electricity and water and public services.
developments within the mexican american community set the stage for fresh challenges to these conditions in the 1940s.

negroes are dirty say the whites but in nearly all restaurants i saw negro waiters and cooks.
theyre lazy i noticed that it is the negro who does the hardest manual work.
they are said to be uncultivated and are therefore denied access to culture.
as george bernard shaw said the haughty american nation makes the negro shine its shoes and then demonstrates his physical and mental inferiority by the fact that he is a shoe cleaner.
what is known as integration in the south is the ability of a negro to enter a shop and buy a record or the fact that of ten thousand students enrolled in a university two of them are negroes.
a miracle they cry.
real integration however does not exist not even in the north and by real integration i mean interracial communication complete equality in the strict sense of the word.
still another example drawn from the south the manager of a television studio told me in frigid terms that he would not hire negroes there would be a scandal and all his sponsors would protest.

here the american civil rights leader celebrates the independence of the african nation of ghana in 1957.
and its a beautiful thing isnt it that.
ghana is now free and is free without rising up with arms and ammunition.
it is free through nonviolent means.
because of that the british empire will not have the bitterness for ghana that she has for china so to speak.
because of that when the british empire leaves ghana she leaves with a different attitude than she would have left with if she had been driven out by armies.
weve got to revolt in such a way that after revolt is over we can live with people as their brothers and sisters.

all this makes a sad story but now we must be prepared to bury the past with its unpleasant memories and look to the future.

chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 bracero worker card in the southwest mexican immigrants and many mexican americans encountered a caste system not unlike jim crow segregation.
most of the hardest lowest paying work in states such as texas arizona and california was performed by people of mexican descent.
under a government program braceros or migrant mexican workers were allowed into the united states for a limited time to harvest a variety of fruit and vegetable crops.
a worker card issued to one such bracero is pictured here.
national museum of american history smithsonian institution behring center.
more than 400 000 mexican americans also served in world war ii.
having fought for their country many returned to the united states determined to challenge their second class citizenship.
additionally a new mexican american middle class began to take shape in major cities such as los angeles san antonio el paso and chicago which like the african american middle class gave leaders and resources to the cause.
in texas and california mexican americans created new civil rights organizations in the postwar years.
in corpus christi texas world war ii veterans founded the american gi forum in 1948 to protest the poor treatment of mexican american soldiers and veterans.
activists in los angeles created the community service organization cso the same year.
both groups arose to address compare and specific local injustices such as contrast the segregation of military ceme how were the circumteries but they quickly broad stances facing mexican ened their scope to encompass and japanese americans political and economic justice for similar to those facing the larger community.
among the african americans.
how first young activists to work for were they different.
the cso were cesar chavez and dolores huerta who would later found the united farm workers ufw and inspire the chicano movement of the 1960s.
activists also pushed for legal change.
in 1947 five mexican american fathers in california sued a local school district for placing their children in separate mexican schools.
the case mendez v westminster school district never made it to the u s supreme court.
but the ninth circuit court ruled such segregation unconstitutional laying the legal groundwork for broader challenges to racial inequality.
among those filing briefs in the case was the naacps thurgood marshall who was then developing the legal strategy to strike at racial segregation in the south.
in another significant legal victory the supreme court ruled in 1954 just two weeks before the landmark brown v board of education decision that mexican americans constituted a distinct class that could claim protection from discrimination.
also on the west coast japanese americans accelerated their legal challenge to discrimination.
undeterred by rulings in the hirabayashi 1943 and korematsu 1944 cases upholding wartime imprisonment chapter 24 the japanese american citizens league jacl filed lawsuits in the late 1940s to regain property lost during the war.
the jacl also challenged the constitutionality of californias alien land law which prohibited japanese immigrants from owning land and successfully lobbied congress to enable those same immigrants to become citizens a right they were denied for fifty years.
these efforts by mexican and japanese americans enlarged the sphere of civil rights and laid the foundation for a broader notion of racial equality in the postwar years.
fighting for equality before the law with civil rights legislation blocked in congress by southern democrats throughout the 1950s activists looked in two different directions for a breakthrough to northern state legislatures and to the federal courts.
school segregation remained a stubborn problem in northern states but the biggest obstacle to black part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 progress there was persistent job and housing discrimination.
the states with the largest african american populations and hence the largest share of black democratic party voters became testing grounds for state legislation to end such discriminatory practices.
winning antidiscrimination legislation depended on coalition politics.
african american activists forged alliances with trade unions and liberal organizations such as the american friends service committee a quaker group among many others.
progress was slow and often occurred only after long periods of unglamorous struggle to win votes in state capitals such as albany new york springfield illinois and lansing michigan.
the first fair employment laws had come in new york and new jersey in 1945.
a decade passed however before other states with significant black populations passed similar legislation.
antidiscrimination laws in housing were even more difficult to pass with most progress not coming until the 1960s.
these legislative campaigns in northern states received little national attention but they were instrumental in laying the groundwork for legal equality outside the south.
thurgood marshall because the vast majority of southern african americans were prohibited from voting state legislatures there were closed to the kind of organized political pressure possible in the north.
thus activists also looked to federal courts for leverage.
in the late 1930s naacp lawyers thurgood marshall charles hamilton houston and william hastie had begun preparing the legal ground in a series of cases challenging racial discrimination.
the key was prodding the u s supreme court to use the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause to overturn its 1896 ruling in plessy v ferguson which upheld racial segregation under the separate but equal doctrine.
marshall was the great grandson of slaves.
of modest origins his parents instilled in him a faith in law and the constitution.
after his 1930 graduation from lincoln university a prestigious african american institution near philadelphia marshall applied to the university of maryland law school.
denied admission because the school did not accept black applicants he enrolled at all black howard university.
there marshall met houston a law school dean and the two forged a friendship and intellectual parttrace change nership that would change the over time face of american legal history.
how did the naacp go marshall with houstons and about developing a legal hasties critical strategic input strategy to attack racial would argue most of the naacps segregation.
landmark cases.
in the late 1960s president johnson appointed marshall to the supreme court the first african american to have that honor.
marshall houston hastie and six other attorneys filed suit after suit deliberately selecting each one from dozens of possibilities.
the strategy was slow and timeconsuming but progress came.
in 1936 marshall and hamilton won a state case that forced the university of maryland law school to admit qualified african americans a ruling of obvious significance to marshall.
eight years later in smith v allwright 1944 marshall convinced the u s supreme court that allwhite primaries were unconstitutional.
in 1950 with marshall once again arguing the case the supreme court ruled in mclaurin v oklahoma that universities could not segregate black students from others on campus.
none of these cases produced swift changes in the daily lives of most african americans but they confirmed that civil rights attorneys were on the right track.
brown v board of education the naacps legal strategy achieved its ultimate validation in a case involving linda brown a black pupil in topeka kansas who had been forced to attend a distant segregated school rather than the nearby white elementary school.
in brown v board of education of topeka 1954 marshall argued that such segregation was unconstitutional because it denied linda brown the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment map 27 2.
in a unanimous decision on may 17 1954 the supreme court agreed overturning the separate but equal doctrine at last.
writing for the court the new chief justice earl warren wrote we conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.
separate educational facilities are inherently unequal in an implementing 1955 decision known as brown ii the court declared simply that integration should proceed with all deliberate speed in the south however virginia senator harry f byrd issued a call for massive resistance calling may 17 black monday the mississippi segregationist tom p brady invoked the language of the cold war to discredit the decision assailing the totalitarian government that had rendered the decision in the name of socialism and communism that year half a million southerners joined white citizens councils dedicated to blocking school integration.

this map helps show that racial segregation and discrimination were a national not simply a southern problem.
brown decision as a clear abuse of judicial power and encouraged local officials to defy it.
the white south had declared all out war on brown.
enforcement of the supreme courts decision was complicated further by dwight eisenhowers presence in the white house the president was no champion of civil rights.
eisenhower accepted the brown decision as the law of the land but he thought it a mistake.
ike was especially unhappy about the prospect of committing federal power to enforce the decision.
a crisis in little rock arkansas finally forced his hand.
in september 1957 when nine black students attempted to enroll at the all white central high school governor orval faubus called out the national guard to bar them.
angry white mobs appeared daily to taunt the students chanting go back to the jungle as the vicious scenes played out on television night after night eisenhower finally acted.
he sent 1 000 federal troops to little rock and nationalized the arkansas national guard ordering them to protect the black students.
eisenhower thus became the first president since reconstruction to use federal troops to enforce the rights of african americans.
but little rock also showed that southern officials had more loyalty to local custom than to the law a repeated problem in the post brown era.
forging a protest movement 1955 1965 declaring racial segregation integral to the souths habits traditions and way of life the southern manifesto signaled that many whites would not accept african american equality readily.
as americans had part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the legal strategy on the steps of the supreme court on the day in 1954 that brown v board of education of topeka was decided are the architects of the naacp legal strategy in the brown case and dozens of others.
together from left to right george e c hayes thurgood marshall and james m nabrit pursued cases that undermined the constitutional foundation of racial segregation.
their efforts were not enough to destroy jim crow however that would take marches protests and sacrifices from ordinary citizens.
witnessed in little rock the unwillingness of local officials to enforce brown could render the decision invalid in practice.
if legal victories would not be enough citizens themselves black and white would have to take to the streets and demand justice.
following the brown decision they did just that forging a protest movement unique in the history of the united states.
nonviolent direct action brown had been the law of the land for barely a year when a single act of violence struck at the heart of black america.
a fourteen year old african american from the south side of chicago emmett till was visiting relatives in mississippi in the summer of 1955.
seen talking to a white woman in a grocery store till was tortured and murdered under cover of night.
his mutilated body was found at the bottom of a river tied with barbed wire to a heavy steel cotton gin fan.
photos of tills body in jet magazine brought national attention to the heinous crime.
two white men were arrested for tills murder.
during the trial followed closely in african american communities across the country the lone witness to tills kidnapping his uncle mose wright identified both killers.
feeling the blood boil in hundreds of white people as they sat glaring in the courtroom wright said it was the first time in my life i had the courage to accuse a white man of a crime despite wrights eyewitness testimony the all white jury found the defendants innocent.
this miscarriage of justice later the killers even admitted their guilt in a look magazine article galvanized an entire generation of african americans no one who lived through the till case ever forgot it.
montgomery bus boycott in the wake of the till case civil rights advocates needed some good news.
chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 school desegregation in little rock arkansas less well known than the crisis at little rocks central high school the same year the circumstances at north little rock were nonetheless strikingly similar white resistance to the enrollment of a handful of black students.
in this photograph white students block the doors of north little rock high school preventing six african american students from entering on september 9 1957.
this photograph is noteworthy because it shows a striking new feature of southern racial politics the presence of film and television cameras that broadcast these images to the nation and the world.
they received it three months later as southern black leaders embraced an old tactic put to new ends nonviolent protest.
on december 1 1955 rosa parks a civil rights activist in montgomery alabama refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man.
she was arrested and charged with violating a local segregation ordinance.
parkss act was not the spur of the moment decision that it seemed a woman of sterling reputation and a longtime naacp member she had been contemplating such an act for some time.
middle aged and unassuming rosa parks fit the bill perfectly for the naacps challenge against segregated buses.
once the die was cast the black community turned for leadership to the reverend martin luther king jr the recently appointed pastor of montgomerys dexter street baptist church.
the son of a prominent atlanta minister king embraced the teachings of mahatma gandhi.
working closely but behind the scenes with bayard rustin king studied nonviolent philosophy which rustin and others in the fellowship of reconciliation had first used in the 1940s.
after rosa parkss arrest king endorsed a plan proposed by a local black womens organization to boycott montgomerys bus system.
the montgomery bus boycott was inspired by similar boycotts that had taken place in harlem in 1941 and baton rouge louisiana in 1953.
for the next 381 days montgomerys african americans formed car pools or walked to work.
darling its empty coretta scott king exclaimed to her husband as a bus normally filled with black riders rolled by their living room window on the first day of the boycott.
the transit company neared bankruptcy and downtown stores complained about the loss of business.
but only after the supreme court ruled in november 1956 that bus segregation was unconstitutional did the city of montgomery finally comply.
my feets is tired but my soul is rested said one woman boycotter.
the montgomery bus boycott catapulted king to national prominence.
in 1957 along with the reverend part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 ralph abernathy and dozens of black ministers from across the south he founded the atlanta based southern christian leadership conference sclc.
the black church long the center of african american social and cultural life now lent its moral and organizational strength to the civil rights movement.
black churchwomen were a tower of strength transferring the skills they had honed during years of church work to the fight for civil rights.
the sclc quickly joined the naacp at the leading edge of the movement for racial justice.
greensboro sit ins the battle for civil rights entered a new phase in greensboro north carolina on february 1 1960 when four black college students took seats at the whites only lunch counter at the local woolworths five and dime store.
this simple act was entirely the brainchild of the four students who had discussed it in their dorm rooms over several preceding nights.
a new york based spokesman for woolworths said the chain would abide by local custom which meant refusing to serve african americans at the lunch counter.
the students were determined to sit in until they were served.
for three weeks hundreds of students inspired by the original foursome took turns sitting at the counters quietly eating doing homework or reading.
taunted by groups of whites pelted with food and other debris the black students often occupying more than sixty of the sixty six seats held strong.
although many were arrested the tactic worked the woolworths lunch counter was desegregated and sit ins quickly spread to other southern cities american voices p 884.
ella baker and sncc inspired by the developments in greensboro and elsewhere ella baker an administrator with the sclc helped organize the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc pronounced snick in 1960 to facilitate student sit ins.
rolling like a great wave across the upper south from north carolina into virginia maryland and tennessee by the end of the year students had launched sit ins in 126 cities.
more than 50 000 people participated and 3 600 were jailed.
the sit ins drew african american college students into the movement in significant numbers for the first time.
northern students formed solidarity committees and raised money for bail.
sncc quickly emerged as the most important student protest organization in the country and inspired a generation of students on college campuses across the nation.
baker took a special interest in these students because she found them receptive to her notion of ella baker born in virginia and educated at shaw university in raleigh north carolina ella baker was one of the foremost theorists of grassroots participatory democracy in the united states.
active all her life in the black freedom movement in 1960 baker cofounded the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc.
her advocacy of leadership by ordinary nonelite people often led her to disagree with the top down movement strategy of martin luther king jr and other ministers of the southern christian leadership conference sclc.
participatory democracy.
the granddaughter of slaves baker had moved to harlem in the 1930s where she worked for new deal agencies and then the naacp.
she believed in nurturing leaders from the grass roots encouraging ordinary people to stand up for their rights rather than to depend on charismatic figureheads.
my theory is strong people dont need strong leaders she once said.
nonetheless baker nurtured a generation of young activists in sncc including stokely carmichael anne moody john lewis and diane nash who went on to become some of the most important civil rights leaders in the united states.
freedom rides emboldened by snccs sit in tactics in 1961 the congress of racial equality core organized a series of what were called freedom rides chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 on interstate bus lines throughout the south.
the aim was to call attention to blatant violations of recent supreme court rulings against segregation in interstate commerce.
the activists who signed on mostly young both black and white knew that they were taking their lives in their hands.
they found courage in song as civil rights activists had begun to do across the country with lyrics such as im taking a ride on the greyhound bus line.
hallelujah im traveling down freedoms main line courage they needed.
club wielding klansmen attacked the buses when they stopped in small towns.
outside anniston alabama one bus was firebombed the freedom riders escaped only moments before it exploded.
some riders were then brutally beaten.
freedom riders and news reporters were also viciously attacked by klansmen in birmingham and montgomery.
despite the violence state authorities refused to intervene.
i cannot guarantee protection for this bunch of rabble rousers declared governor john patterson of alabama.
once again local officials refusal to enforce the law left the fate of the freedom riders in washingtons hands.
the new president john f kennedy was cautious about civil rights.
despite a campaign commitment he failed to deliver on a civil rights bill.
elected by a thin margin kennedy believed that he could ill afford to lose the support of powerful southern senators.
but civil rights was unlike other domestic issues.
its fate was going to be decided not in the halls of congress but on the streets of southern cities.
although president kennedy discouraged the freedom rides beatings shown on the nightly news forced attorney general robert kennedy to dispatch federal marshals.
civil rights activists thus learned the value of nonviolent protest that provoked violent white resistance.
the victories so far had been limited but the groundwork had been laid for a civil rights offensive that would transform the nation.
the naacps legal strategy had been followed closely by the emergence of a major protest movement.
and now civil rights leaders focused their attention on congress.
legislating civil rights 1963 1965 the first civil rights law in the nations history came in 1866 just after the civil war.
its provisions were long ignored chapter 15.
a second law was passed during reconstruction in 1875 but it was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court.
for nearly ninety years new civil rights legislation was blocked or filibustered by southern democrats in contrace change gress.
only a weak largely sym over time bolic act was passed in 1957 what lessons did activists during the eisenhower adminis learn from the evolution tration.
but by the early 1960s of the civil rights movewith legal precedents in their ment between 1957 and favor and nonviolent protest awak 1961.
ening the nation civil rights leaders believed the time had come for a serious civil rights bill.
the challenge was getting one through a still reluctant congress.
the battle for birmingham the road to such a bill began when martin luther king jr called for demonstrations in the most segregated city in the united states birmingham alabama.
king and the sclc needed a concrete victory in birmingham to validate their strategy of nonviolent protest.
in may 1963 thousands of black marchers tried to picket birminghams department stores.
eugene bull connor the citys public safety commissioner ordered the citys police troops to meet the marchers with violent force snarling dogs electric cattle prods and high pressure fire hoses.
television cameras captured the scene for the evening news.
while serving a jail sentence for leading the march king scribbling in pencil on any paper he could find composed one of the classic documents of nonviolent direct action letter from birmingham jail why direct action king asked.
there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension that is necessary for growth the civil rights movement sought he continued to create such a crisis and establish such a creative tension grounding his actions in equal parts christian brotherhood and democratic liberalism king argued that americans confronted a moral choice they could preserve the evil system of segregation or take the side of those great wells of democracy.
the constitution and the declaration of independence outraged by the brutality in birmingham and embarrassed by kings imprisonment for leading a nonviolent march president kennedy decided that it was time to act.
on june 11 1963 after newly elected alabama governor george wallace barred two black students from the state university kennedy denounced racism on national television and promised a new civil rights bill.
many black leaders felt kennedys action was long overdue but they nonetheless hailed this second emancipation proclamation that night medgar evers president of the mississippi chapter of the naacp was shot in the back in his driveway in american voices challenging white supremacy among the many challenges historians face is figuring out the processes by which long oppressed ordinary people finally rise up and demand justice.
during the 1950s a liberating process was quietly under way among southern blacks bursting forth dramatically in the montgomery bus boycott of 1955 and then by the end of the decade emerging across the south.
here are excerpts of the testimony of two individuals who stepped forward and took the lead in those struggles.
franklin mccain desegregating lunch counters franklin mccain was one of the four african american students at north carolina a t college in greensboro north carolina who sat down at the woolworths lunch counter on february 1 1960 setting off a wave of student sit ins that rocked the south and helped initiate a national civil rights movement.
in the following interview mccain describes how he and his friends took that momentous step.
the planning process was on a sunday night i remember it quite well.
i think it was joseph who said its time that we take some action now.
weve been getting together and weve been up to this point still like most people weve talked about for the past few weeks or so that is people who talk a lot but in fact make very little action after selecting the technique then we said lets go down and just ask for service it certainly wasnt titled a sit in or sit down at that time.
lets just go down to woolworths tomorrow and ask for service and the tactic is going to be simply this well just stay there.
once getting there.
we did make purchases of school supplies and took the patience and time to get receipts for our purchases and joseph and myself went over to the counter and asked to be served coffee and doughnuts.
as anticipated the reply was im sorry we dont serve you here and of course we said we just beg to disagree with you.
weve in fact already been served.
the attendant or waitress was a little bit dumbfounded just didnt know what to say under circumstances like that.
at that point there was a policeman who had walked in off the street who was pacing the aisle.
behind us where we were seated with his club in his hand just sort of knocking it in his hand and just looking mean and red and a little bit upset and a little bit disgusted.
and you had the feeling that he didnt know what the hell to do.
usually his defense is offense and weve provoked him yes but we havent provoked outwardly enough for him to resort to violence.
and i think this is just killing him you can see it all over him.
if its possible to know what it means to have your soul cleansed i felt pretty clean at that time.
i probably felt better on that day than ive ever felt in my life.
seems like a lot of feelings of guilt or what have you suddenly left me and i felt as though i had gained my manhood.
not franklin mccain only as an individual but i felt as though the manhood of a number of other black persons had been restored and had gotten some respect from just that one day.
the movement started out as a movement of nonviolence and a christian movement.
it was a movement that was seeking justice more than anything else and not a movement to start a war.
we knew that probably the most powerful and potent weapon that people have literally no defense for is love kindness.
that is whip the enemy with something that he doesnt understand.
the individual who had probably the most influence on us was gandhi.
yes martin luther kings name was well known when the sit in movement was in effect but.
no he was not the individual we had upmost in mind when we started the sit in movement.

john mcferren demanding the right to vote in this interview given about ten years after the events he describes john mcferren tells of the battle he undertook in 1959 to gain the vote for the blacks of fayette county tennessee.
by the time of the interview mcferren had risen in life and become a grocery store owner and property holder thanks he says to the economic boycott imposed on him by angry whites.
unlike greensboro the struggle in fayette county never made national headlines.
it was just one of many local struggles that signaled the beginning of a new day in the south.
my name is john mcferren.
im forty six years old.
im a negro was born and raised in west tennessee the county of fayette district 1.
my foreparents was brought here from north carolina five years before the civil war.
because the rumor got out among the slaveholders that west tennessee was still goin to be a slaveholdin state.
and my people was brought over here and sold.
and after the civil war my people settled in west tennessee.
thats why fayette and haywood counties have a great number of negroes.
back in 1957 and 58 there was a negro man accused of killin a deputy sheriff.
this was burton dodson.
he was brought back after hed been gone twenty years.
j f estes was the lawyer defendin him.
myself and him both was in the army together.
and the stimulation from the trial got me interested in the way justice was bein used.
the only way to bring justice would be through the ballot box.
in 1959 we got out a charter called the fayette county civic and welfare league.
fourteen of us started out in that charter.
we tried to support a white liberal candidate that was named l t redfearn in the sheriff election and the local democrat party refused to let negroes vote.
we brought a suit against the democrat party and i went to washington for a civil rights hearing.
myself and estes and harpman jameson made the trip.
it took us twenty two hours steady drivin.
i was lookin all up lotsa big tall buildins.
i had never seen old tall buildins like that before.
after talkin to john doar we come on back to the justice department building and we sat out in the hall while he had a meetin inside the attorney generals office.
and when they come out they told us they was gonna indict the landowners who kept us from voting.
just after that in 1960 in january we organized a thousand negroes to line up at the courthouse to register to vote.
we started pourin in with big numbers in this county it was 72 percent negroes when we started to register to vote to change the situation.
in the followin.
october and november they started puttin our people offa the land.
once you registered you had to move.
once you registered they took your job.
then after they done that in november we had three hundred people forced to live in tents on shepard towless land.
and when we started puttin em in tents then thats when the white citizens council and the ku klux klan started shootin in the tents to run us out.

the local merchants run me outa the stores and said i went to washington and caused this mess to start.
they had a blacklist.
and they had the list sent around to all merchants.
once you registered you couldnt buy for credit or cash.
but the best thing in the world was when they run me outa them stores.
it started me thinkin for myself.
the southern white has a slogan keep em niggers happy and keep em singin in the schools and the biggest mistake of the past is that the negro has not been teached economics and the value of a dollar.
back at one time we had a teacher.
from mississippi and he pulled up and left the county because he was teachin the negroes to buy land and own land and work it for hisself and the county board of education didnt want that taught in the county.
and they told him keep em niggers singin and keep em happy and dont teach em nothin.
you cannot be free when youre beggin the man for bread.
but when youve got the dollar in your pocket and then got the vote in your pocket thats the only way to be free.
and i have been successful and made good progress because i could see the only way i could survive is to stay independent.

questions for analysis 1.
mccain took a stand on segregated lunch counters.
mcferren took a stand on the right to vote.
how did these targets represent two different goals of the civil rights movement.
mccain speaks of the sense of manhood he felt as he sat at that woolworths counter.
what does his personal feeling suggest about the civil rights movement as a whole.
almost certainly mccain and mcferren never met.
suppose they had.
what would they have had in common.
would what they had in common have been more important than what separated them.
mccain speaks knowingly of the figures and ideas that influenced him.
why do you suppose mcferren is silent about such matters.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 the battle of birmingham one of the hardest fought desegregation struggles of the early 1960s took place in april and may 1963 in birmingham alabama.
in response to the daily rallies and peaceful protests authorities cracked down arresting hundreds.
they also employed tactics such as those shown here turning fire hoses on young nonviolent student demonstrators and using police dogs to intimidate peaceful marchers.
these protests led by martin luther king jr and broadcast on television news prompted president kennedy to introduce a civil rights bill in congress in june 1963.

the march on washington and the civil rights act to marshal support for kennedys bill civil rights leaders adopted a tactic that a philip randolph had first advanced in 1941 a massive demonstration in washington.
under the leadership of randolph and bayard rustin thousands of volunteers across the country coordinated car pools freedom buses and freedom trains and on august 28 1963 delivered a quarter of a million people to the lincoln memorial for the officially named march on washington for jobs and freedom thinking like a historian p 888.
although other people did the planning martin luther king jr was the public face of the march.
it was kings dramatic i have a dream speech beginning with his admonition that too many black people lived on a lonely island of poverty and ending with the exclamation from a traditional black spiritual free at last.
free at last.
thank god almighty we are free at last that captured the nations imagination.
the sight of 250 000 blacks and whites marching solemnly together marked the high point of the civil rights movement and confirmed kings position as the leading spokesperson for the cause.
to have any chance of getting the civil rights bill through congress king randolph and rustin knew they had to sustain this broad coalition of blacks and whites.
they could afford to alienate no one.
reflecting a younger more militant set of activists however sncc member john lewis had prepared a more provocative speech for that afternoon.
lewis wrote the time will come when we will not confine our marching to washington.

as indicated on this map the struggle then quickly spread raising other issues and seeding new organizations.
other organizations quickly joined the battle and shifted the focus away from the courts to mass action and organization.

martin luther king jr if the negro wins labor wins speech 1962.
king speaking to a meeting of the nations trade union leaders explained the economic objectives of the black freedom struggle.
if we do not advance the crushing burden of centuries of neglect and economic deprivation will destroy our will our spirits and our hopes.
in this way labors historic tradition of moving forward to create vital people as consumers and citizens has become our own tradition and for the same reasons.
this unity of purpose is not an historical coincidence.
negroes are almost entirely a working people.
there are pitifully few negro millionaires and few negro employers.
our needs are identical with labors needs decent wages fair working conditions livable housing old age security health and welfare measures conditions in which families can grow have education for their children and respect in the community.
that is why negroes support labors demands and fight laws which curb labor.
the two most dynamic and cohesive liberal forces in the country are the labor movement and the negro freedom movement.

it would be hard to quarrel with the assertion that the elaborate legal structure of segregation and discrimination particularly in relation to public accommodations has virtually collapsed.
on the other hand without making light of the human sacrifices involved in the direct action tactics sit ins freedom rides and the rest that were so instrumental to this achievement we must recognize that in desegregating public accommodations we affected institutions which are relatively peripheral both to the american socio economic order and to the fundamental conditions of life of the negro people.

but when will the demonstrations end the perpetual question.
and a serious question.
actually it is several questions for the meaning of the question differs depending upon who asks it.
coming from those whose dominant consideration is peace public peace and peace of mind the question means when are you going to stop tempting violence and rioting some put it more strongly when are you going to stop sponsoring violence assumed is the necessary connection between demonstration and violence.
isnt the patience of the white majority wearing thin.
why nourish the displeasure of 90 percent of the population with provocative demonstrations.
remember you need allies and the assumptions of these cassandras of the backlash is that freedom and equality are in the last analysis wholly gifts in the white mans power to bestow.
what the public must realize is that in a demonstration more things are happening at more levels of human activity than meets the eye.
demonstrations in the last few years have provided literally millions of negroes with their first taste of self determination and political selfexpression.

black people must redefine themselves and only they can do that.
throughout this country vast segments of the black communities are beginning to recognize the need to assert their own definitions to reclaim their history their culture to create their own sense of community and togetherness.
there is a growing resentment of the word negro for example because this term is the invention of our oppressor it is his image of us that he describes.
the concept of black power rests on a fundamental premise before a group can enter the open society it must first close ranks.
by this we mean that group solidarity is necessary before a group can operate effectively from a bargaining position of strength in a pluralistic society.

in june 1964 congress approved the most far reaching civil rights law since reconstruction.
the keystone of the civil rights act of 1964 title vii outlawed discrimination in employment on the basis of race religion national origin and sex.
another section guaranteed equal access to public accommodations and schools.
the law granted new enforcement powers to the u s attorney general and established the equal employment opportunity commission to implement the prohibition against job discrimination.
compare and contrast freedom summer the civil rights act was a law with real teeth but it left untouched the obstacles to black voting rights.
so protesters went back into the streets.
in 1964 in what came to be known as freedom summer black organizations mounted a major campaign in mississippi.
the effort drew several thousand volunteers from across the country including nearly one thousand white college students from the north.
led by the charismatic sncc activist robert moses the four major civil rights organizations sncc core naacp and sclc spread out across the state.
they established freedom schools for black children and conducted a major voter registration drive.
yet so determined was the opposition that only about twelve hundred black voters were registered that summer at a cost of four murdered civil rights workers and thirtyseven black churches bombed or burned.
the murders strengthened the resolve of the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp which had been founded during freedom summer.
banned women in the movement though often overshadowed by men in the public spotlight women were crucial to the black freedom movement.

chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 from the whites only mississippi democratic party mfdp leaders were determined to attend the 1964 democratic national convention in atlantic city new jersey as the legitimate representatives of their state.
inspired by fannie lou hamer a former sharecropper turned civil rights activist the mfdp challenged the most powerful figures in the democratic party including lyndon johnson the democrats presidential nominee.
is this america hamer asked party officials when she demanded that the mfdp and not the allwhite mississippi delegation be recognized by the convention.
democratic leaders however seated the white mississippi delegation and refused to recognize the mfdp.
demoralized and convinced that the democratic party would not change moses told television reporters i will have nothing to do with the political system any longer selma and the voting rights act martin luther king jr and the sclc did not share mosess skepticism.
they believed that another confrontation with southern injustice could provoke further congressional action.
in march 1965 james bevel of the sclc called for a march from selma alabama to the state capital montgomery to protest the murder of a voting rights activist.
as soon as the six hundred marchers left selma crossing over the edmund pettus bridge mounted state troopers attacked them with tear gas and clubs.
the scene was shown on national television that night and the day became known as bloody sunday.
calling the episode an american tragedy president johnson went back to congress.
the voting rights act of 1965 which was signed by president johnson on august 6 outlawed the literacy tests and other devices that prevented african americans from registering to vote and authorized the attorney general to send federal examiners to register voters in any county where registration was less than 50 percent.
together with the twenty fourth amendment 1964 which outlawed the poll tax in federal elections the voting rights act enabled millions of african americans to vote for the first time since the reconstruction era.
in the south the results were stunning.
in 1960 only 20 percent of black citizens had been registered to vote by 1971 registration reached 62 percent map 27 4.
moreover across the nation the number of black elected officials began to climb quadrupling from 1 400 to 4 900 between 1970 and 1980 and doubling again by the early 1990s.
most of those elected held local offices from sheriff to county commissioner but nonetheless embodied a shift in political representation nearly unimaginable a generation earlier.
as hartman turnbow a mississippi farmer who risked his life to register in 1964 later declared it wont never go back where it was something else would never go back either the liberal new deal coalition.
by the second half of the 1960s the liberal wing of the democratic party had won its battle with the conservative segregationist wing.
democrats had embraced the civil rights movement and made african american equality a cornerstone of a new rights liberalism.
but over the next generation between the 1960s and the 1980s southern whites and many conservative northern whites would respond by switching to the republican party.
strom thurmond the segregationist senator from south carolina symbolically led the revolt by renouncing the map 27 4 black voter registration in the south 1964 and 1975 va after passage of the voting rights act of 1965 black registration in the south increased dramatically.
the bars on the map show the number of african americans registered in 1964 before the act was passed and in 1975 after it had been in effect for ten years.

the new deal coalition which had joined working class whites northern african americans urban professionals and white southern segregationists together in a fragile political alliance since the 1930s was beginning to crumble.
beyond civil rights 1966 1973 activists had long known that supreme court decisions and new laws do not automatically produce changes in society.
but in the mid 1960s civil rights advocates confronted a more profound issue perhaps even protests were not enough.
in 1965 bayard rustin wrote of the need to move from protest to politics in order to build institutional black power.
some black leaders such as the young sncc activists stokely carmichael frances beal and john lewis grew frustrated with the slow pace of reform and the stubborn resistance of whites.
still others believed that addressing black poverty and economic disadvantage remained the most important objective.
neither new laws nor long marches appeared capable of meeting these varied and complex challenges.
the conviction that civil rights alone were incapable of guaranteeing equality took hold in many minority communities in this period.
african americans were joined by mexican americans puerto ricans and american indians.
they came at the problem of inequality from different perspectives but each group asked a similar question as crucial as legal equality was how much did it matter if most people of color remained in or close to poverty if white society still regarded nonwhites as inferior and if the major social and political institutions in the country were run by whites.
black leaders and representatives of other nonwhite communities increasingly asked themselves this question as they searched for ways to build on the achievements of the civil rights decade of 1954 1965.
black nationalism seeking answers to these questions led many african americans to embrace black nationalism.
the philosophy of black nationalism signified many things in the 1960s.
it could mean anything from pride in ones community to total separatism from building african american owned businesses to wearing dashikis in honor of african traditions.
historically nationalism had emphasized the differences between blacks and whites as well as black peoples power and right to shape their own destiny.
in the late nineteenth century nationalists founded the back to africa movement and in the 1920s the nationalist marcus garvey inspired african americans to take pride in their racial heritage chapter 22.
in the early 1960s the leading exponent of black nationalism was the nation of islam which fused a rejection of christianity with a strong philosophy of self improvement.
black muslims as they were known adhered to a strict code of personal behavior men were recognizable by their dark suits white shirts and ties women by their long dresses and head coverings.
black muslims preached an apocalyptic brand of islam anticipating the day when allah would banish the white devils and give the black nation justice.
although its full converts numbered only about ten thousand the nation of islam had a wide popular following among african americans in northern cities.
malcolm x the most charismatic black muslim was malcolm x the x stood for his african family name lost under slavery.
a spellbinding speaker malcolm x preached a philosophy of militant separatism although he advocated violence only for self defense.
hostile to mainstream civil rights organizations he caustically referred to the 1963 march on washington as the farce on washington malcolm x said plainly i believe in the brotherhood of man all men but i dont believe in brotherhood with anybody who doesnt want brotherhood with me malcolm x had little interest in changing the minds of hostile whites.
strengthening the black community he believed represented a surer path to freedom and equality.
in 1964 after a power struggle with founder elijah muhammad malcolm x broke with the nation of islam.
while he remained a black nationalist he moderated his antiwhite views and began to talk of a class struggle uniting poor whites and blacks.
following an inspiring trip to the middle east where he saw muslims of all races worshipping together malcolm x formed the organization of afro american unity to promote black pride and to work with traditional civil rights groups.
but he got no further.
on february 21 1965 malcolm x was assassinated while delivering a speech in harlem.
three black muslims were later convicted of his murder.
black power a more secular brand of black nationalism emerged in 1966 when sncc and core activists following the lead of stokely carmichael began to chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 malcolm x until his murder in 1965 malcolm x was the leading proponent of black nationalism in the united states.
a brilliant and dynamic orator malcolm had been a minister in the nation of islam for nearly thirteen years until he broke with the nation in 1964.
his emphasis on black pride and self help and his unrelenting criticism of white supremacy made him one of the freedom movements most inspirational figures both in life and well after his death.
topham the image works.
call for black self reliance under the banner of black power.
advocates of black power asked fundamental questions if alliances with whites were necessary to achieve racial justice as king believed they were did that make african americans dependent on the good intentions of whites.
if so could black people trust those good intentions in the long run.
increasingly those inclined toward black power believed that african americans should build economic and political power in their own communities.
such power would translate into a less dependent relationship with white america.
for once carmichael wrote black people are going to use the words they want to use not the words whites want to hear spurred by the black power slogan african american activists turned their attention to the poverty and social injustice faced by so many black people.
president johnson had declared the war on poverty and black organizers joined setting up day care centers running community job training programs and working to improve housing and health care in urban neighborhoods.
in major cities such as philadelphia new york chicago and pittsburgh activists sought to open jobs in police and fire departments and in construction and transportation to black workers who had been excluded from these occupations for decades.
others understand points worked to end police harass of view ment a major problem in urban why were black power black communities and to help and black nationalism black entrepreneurs to receive compelling to many small business loans.
core leader african americans.
floyd mckissick explained black power is not black supremacy it is a united black voice reflecting racial pride the attention to racial pride led some african americans to reject white society and to pursue more authentic cultural forms.
in addition to focusing on economic disadvantage black power emphasized black pride and self determination.
those subscribing to these beliefs wore african clothing chose natural hairstyles and celebrated black history art and literature.
the black arts movement thrived and musical tastes shifted from the crossover sounds of motown to the soul music of philadelphia memphis and chicago.
part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 black panther party one of the most radical nationalist groups was the black panther party founded in oakland california in 1966 by two college students huey newton and bobby seale.
a militant organization dedicated to protecting african americans from police violence the panthers took their cue from the slain malcolm x.
they vehemently opposed the vietnam war and declared their affinity for third world revolutionary movements and armed struggle map 27 5.
in their manifesto what we want what we believe the panthers outlined their ten point program for black liberation.
the panthers organization spread to other cities in the late 1960s where members undertook a wide range of community organizing projects.
their free breakfast program for children and their testing program for sickle cell anemia an inherited disease with a high incidence among african americans were especially popular.
however the panthers radicalism and belief in armed self defense resulted in violent clashes with police.
newton was charged with murdering a police officer several panthers were killed by police and dozens went to prison.
moreover under its domestic counterintelligence program the federal bureau of investigation fbi had begun disrupting party activities.
young lords among those inspired by the black panthers were puerto ricans in new york.
their vehicle was the young lords organization ylo later renamed the young lords party.
like the black panthers ylo activists sought self determination for puerto ricans both those in the united states and those on the island in the caribbean.
in practical terms the ylo focused on improving neighborhood conditions city garbage collection was notoriously poor in east harlem where most puerto ricans lived and slumlords had allowed the housing to become squalid.
women in the ylo were especially active protesting sterilization campaigns against puerto rican women and fighting to improve access to health care.
as was true of so many nationalist groups immediate victories for the ylo were few but their dedicated community the black panther party one of the most radical organizations of the 1960s the black panther party was founded in 1966 by bobby seale and huey newton shown together in the photograph on the left in oakland california.
its members carried weapons advocated socialism and fought police brutality in black communities but they also ran into their own trouble with the law.
nevertheless the party had great success in reaching ordinary people often with programs targeted at the poor.

some new nations such as ghana the former british colony of gold coast achieved independence rather peacefully.
others such as algeria and mozambique did so only after bloody anticolonial wars.
american civil rights activists watched african decolonization with great enthusiasm seeing the two struggles as linked.
sure we identified with the blacks in africa civil rights leader john lewis said.
here were black people talking of freedom and liberation and independence thousands of miles away in 1960 alone the year that student sit ins swept across the american south more than a dozen african nations gained independence.
organizing produced a generation of leaders many of whom later went into politics and awakened community consciousness.
the new urban politics black power also inspired african americans to work within the political system.
by the mid 1960s black residents neared 50 percent of the population in several major american cities such as atlanta cleveland detroit and washington d c black power in these cities was not abstract it counted in real votes.
residents of gary indiana and cleveland ohio elected the first black mayors of large cities in 1967.
richard hatcher in gary and carl stokes in cleveland helped forge a new urban politics in the united states.
their campaign teams registered thousands of black voters and made alliances with enough whites to create a working majority.
many saw stokess victory in particular as heralding a new day.
as one of stokess campaign staffers said if carl stokes could run for mayor in the eighth largest city in america then maybe who knows.
we could be senators.
we could be anything we wanted having met with some political success black leaders gathered in gary for the 1972 national black political convention.
in a meeting that brought together radicals liberals and centrists debate centered on whether to form a third political party.
hatcher recalled that many in attendance believed that there was going to be a black third party in the end however delegates decided to give the democratic party one more chance instead of creating a third party the convention issued the national black political agenda which included calls for community control of schools in black neighborhoods national health insurance and the elimination of the death penalty.
democrats failed to enact the national black political agenda but african americans were increasingly integrated into american political institutions.
by the end of the century black elected officials had become commonplace in major american cities.
there were forty seven african american big city mayors by the 1990s and blacks had led most of the nations most prominent cities atlanta chicago detroit los angeles new york philadelphia and washington d c vanuatu part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 these politicians had translated black power not into a wholesale rejection of white society but into a revitalized liberalism that would remain an indelible feature of urban politics for the rest of the century.
poverty and urban violence black power was not fundamentally a violent political ideology.
but violence did play a decisive role in the politics of black liberation in the mid 1960s.
too many americans white and black had little knowledge or understanding of the rage that existed just below the surface in many poor northern black neighborhoods.
that rage boiled over in a wave of riots that struck the nations cities in mid decade.
the first long hot summer began in july 1964 in new york city when police shot a black criminal suspect in harlem.
angry youths looted and rioted there for a week.
over the next four years the volatile issue of police brutality set off riots in dozens of cities.
in august 1965 the arrest of a young black motorist in the watts section of los angeles sparked six days of rioting that left thirty four people dead.
there is a different type of negro emerging one riot participant told investigators.
they are not going to wait for the evolutionary process for their rights to be a man the riots of 1967 however were the most serious engulfing twenty two cities in july and august.
forty three people were killed in detroit alone nearly all of them black and 50 million worth of property was destroyed.
president johnson called in the national guard and u s army troops many of them having just returned from vietnam to restore order.
johnson who believed that the civil rights act and the voting rights act had immeasurably helped african americans was stunned by the rioting.
despondent at the news from watts he refused to look at the cables from los angeles recalled one aide.
virtually all black leaders condemned the rioting though they understood its origins in poverty and deprivation.
at a meeting in watts martin luther king jr admitted that he had failed to take the civil rights movement to the masses of the people such as those in the los angeles ghetto.
his appearance appeased few.
we dont need your dreams we need jobs one heckler shouted at king.
following the gut wrenching riots in detroit and newark in 1967 johnson appointed a presidential commission headed by illinois governor otto kerner to investigate the causes of the violence.
released in 1968 the kerner commission report was a searing look at race in america the most honest and forthright government document about race since the presidential committee on civil rights 1947 report to secure these rights our nation is moving toward two societies the kerner commission report concluded one black one white separate and unequal the report did not excuse the brick throwing firebombing and looting of the previous summers but it placed the riots in sociological context.
shut out of white dominated society impoverished african americans felt they had no stake in the social order.
stirred by turmoil in the cities and seeing the limitations of his civil rights achievements martin luther king jr began to expand his vision beyond civil rights to confront the deep seated problems of poverty and racism in america as a whole.
he criticized president johnson and congress for prioritizing the war in vietnam over the fight against poverty at home and he planned a massive movement called the poor peoples campaign to fight economic injustice.
to advance that cause he went to memphis tennessee to support a strike by predominantly black sanitation workers.
there on april 4 1968 he was assassinated by escaped white convict james earl ray.
kings death set off a further round of urban rioting with major violence breaking out in more than a hundred cities.
tragically king was murdered before achieving the transformations he sought an end to racial injustice and a solution to poverty.
the civil rights movement had helped set in motion permanent indeed revolutionary changes in american race relations.
jim crow segregation ended federal legislation ensured black americans most basic civil rights and the white monopoly on political power in the south was broken.
however by 1968 the fight over civil rights had also divided the nation.
the democratic party was splitting and a new conservatism was gaining strength.
many whites felt that the issue of civil rights was receiving too much attention to the detriment of other national concerns.
the riots of 1965 1967 and 1968 further alienated many whites who blamed the violence on the inability of democratic officials to maintain law and order.
rise of the chicano movement mexican americans had something of a counterpart to martin luther king cesar chavez.
in chavezs case however economic struggle in community organizations and the labor movement had shaped his approach to mobilizing societys disadvantaged.
he and dolores huerta had worked for the community service organization cso a california group founded in the 1950s to promote mexican political participation and civil rights.
leaving that organization in 1962 chavez concentrated on the agricultural region around delano chapter 27 walking into freedom land the civil rights movement 1941 1973 california.
with huerta he organized the united farm workers ufw a union for migrant workers.
huerta was a brilliant organizer but the deeply spiritual and ascetic chavez embodied the moral force behind what was popularly called la causa.
a 1965 grape pickers strike led the ufw to call a nationwide boycott of table grapes bringing chavez huge publicity and backing from the afl cio.
in a bid for attention to the struggle chavez staged a hunger strike in 1968 which ended dramatically after twenty eight days with senator robert f kennedy at his side to break the fast.
victory came in 1970 when california grape growers signed contracts recognizing the ufw.
mexican americans shared some civil rights concerns with african americans especially access to jobs but they also had unique concerns the status of the spanish language in schools for instance and immigration policy.
mexican americans had been politically active since the 1940s aiming to surmount factors that obstructed their political involvement poverty language barriers and discrimination.
their efforts began to pay off in the 1960s when the mexican american political association mapa mobilized support for john f kennedy and worked successfully with other organizations to elect mexican american candidates such as edward roybal of california and henry gonzlez of texas to congress.
two other organizations the mexican american legal defense fund maldf and the southwest voter registration and education project carried the fight against discrimination to washington d c and mobilized mexican americans into an increasingly powerful voting bloc.
cesar chavez influenced equally by the catholic church and mahatma gandhi cesar chavez was one of the leading mexican american civil rights and social justice activists of the 1960s.
with dolores huerta he cofounded the united farm workers ufw a union of primarily mexican american agricultural laborers in california.
here he speaks at a rally in support of the grape boycott an attempt by the ufw to force the nations grape growers and by extension the larger agriculture industry to improve wages and working conditions and to bargain in good faith with the union.

younger mexican americans grew impatient with civil rights groups such as mapa and maldf however.
the barrios of los angeles and other western cities produced the militant brown berets modeled on the black panthers who wore black berets.
rejecting their elders assimilationist approach that is a belief in adapting to anglo society fifteen hundred mexican american stu compare and dents met in denver in 1969 to contrast hammer out a new political and what did the chicano and cultural agenda.
they proclaimed american indian movea new term chicano and its fem ments have in common inine form chicana to replace with the black freedom mexican american and later movement.
organized a political party la raza unida the united race to promote chicano interests.
young chicana feminists formed a number of organizations including las hijas the daughters which organized women both on college campuses and in the barrios.
in california and many southwestern states students staged demonstrations to press for bilingual education the hiring of more chicano teachers and the creation of chicano studies programs.
by the 1970s dozens of such programs were offered at universities throughout the region.
the american indian movement american indians inspired by the black power and chicano movements organized to address their unique circumstances.
numbering nearly 800 000 in the 1960s native people were exceedingly diverse divided by part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 language tribal history region and degree of integration into american life.
as a group they shared a staggering unemployment rate ten times the national average and were the worst off in housing disease rates and access to education.
native people also had an often troubling relationship with the federal government.
in the 1960s the prevailing spirit of protest swept through indian communities.
young militants challenged their elders in the national congress of american indians.
beginning in 1960 the national indian youth council niyc under the slogan for a greater indian america promoted the ideal of native americans as a single ethnic group.
the effort to both unite indians and celebrate individual tribal culture proved a difficult balancing act.
the niyc had substantial influence within tribal communities but two other organizations the militant indians of all tribes iat and the american indian movement aim attracted more attention in the larger society.
these groups embraced the concept of red power and beginning in 1968 they staged escalating protests to draw attention to indian concerns especially the concerns of urban indians many of whom had been encouraged or forced to leave reservations by the federal government in earlier decades.
in 1969 members of the iat occupied the deserted federal penitentiary on alcatraz island in san francisco bay and proclaimed we will purchase said alcatraz island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth a precedent set by the white mans purchase of a similar island manhattan about 300 years ago in 1972 aim members joined the trail of broken treaties a march sponsored by a number of indian groups.
when aim activists seized the headquarters of the hated bureau of indian affairs in washington d c and ransacked the building older tribal leaders denounced them.
to see a longer excerpt of the proclamation to the great white father and all his people along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
however aim managed to focus national media attention on native american issues with a siege at wounded knee south dakota in february 1973.
the site of the infamous 1890 massacre of the sioux wounded knee was situated on the pine ridge reservation where young aim activists had cultivated ties to sympathetic elders.
for more than two months aim members occupied a small collection of buildings surrounded by a cordon of fbi agents and u s marshals.
several gun battles left two dead and the siege was finally brought to a negotiated end.
although upsetting native american activism in november 1969 a group of native americans united under the name indians of all tribes occupied alcatraz island in san francisco bay.
they claimed the land under a nineteenth century treaty but their larger objective was to force the federal government which owned the island to address the longstanding grievances of native peoples including widespread poverty on reservations.
shown here is the view along the gunwale of the boat carrying tim williams a chief of the klamath river hurek tribe in full ceremonial regalia to the island.

chapter 27 to many white onlookers and indian elders alike aim protests attracted widespread mainstream media coverage and spurred government action on tribal issues.
summary african americans and others who fought for civil rights from world war ii through the early 1970s sought equal rights and economic opportunity.
that quest was also inspired by various forms of nationalism that called for self determination for minority groups.
for most of the first half of the twentieth century african americans faced a harsh jim crow system in the south and a segregated though more open society in the north.
segregation was maintained by a widespread belief in black inferiority and by a southern political system that denied african americans the vote.
in the southwest and west mexican americans native americans and americans of asian descent faced discriminatory laws and social practices that marginalized them.
the civil rights movement attacked racial inequality in three ways.
first the movement sought equality chapter review under the law for all americans regardless of race.
this required patient work through the judicial system and the more arduous task of winning congressional legislation such as the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965.
second grassroots activists using nonviolent protest pushed all levels of government from city to federal to abide by supreme court decisions such as brown v board of education and civil rights laws.
third the movement worked to open economic opportunity for minority populations.
this was embodied in the 1963 march on washington for jobs and freedom.
ultimately the civil rights movement successfully established the principle of legal equality but it faced more difficult problems in fighting poverty and creating widespread economic opportunity.
the limitations of the civil rights model led black activists along with mexican americans native americans and others to adopt a more nationalist stance after 1966.
nationalism stressed the creation of political and economic power in communities of color the celebration of racial heritage and the rejection of white cultural standards.

pick two or three events from this timeline and explain how their timing and the broader historical context contributed to the precise role each played in the movement as a whole.

that and how did debates over liberal progressive spirit inspired an even broader values contribute to conflict at home reform agenda that came to include and reflect tension abroad.
womens rights new social programs for the poor and the aged job training environmental laws and other educational and social benefits for the middle class.
all told congress passed more liberal legislation between 1964 and 1972 than in any period since the 1930s.
the great bulk of it came during the 1965 1966 legislative session one of the most active in american history.
liberalism was at high tide.
it did not stay there long.
liberals quickly came under assault from two directions.
first young activists became frustrated with slow progress on civil rights and rebelled against the vietnam war.
at the 1968 democratic national convention in chicago police teargassed and clubbed antiwar demonstrators who chanted as the tv cameras rolled the whole world is watching some of them had been among the young idealists inspired by kennedys inaugural address and the civil rights movement.
now they rejected everything that cold war liberalism stood for.
inside the convention hall the proceedings were chaotic the atmosphere poisonous the delegates bitterly divided over vietnam.
a second assault on liberalism came from conservatives who found their footing after being marginalized during the 1950s.
conservatives opposed the dramatic expansion of the federal government under president lyndon b johnson and disdained the permissive society they believed liberalism had unleashed.
advocating law and order belittling welfare and resisting key civil rights reforms conservatives leaped back to political life in the late sixties.
their champion was barry goldwater a republican senator from arizona who warned that a government big enough to give you everything you want is also big enough to take away everything you have the clashing of left right and center made the decade between the inauguration of president john f kennedy in 1961 and the 1972 landslide reelection of richard nixon one of the most contentious complicated and explosive eras in american history.
there were thousands of marches and demonstrations massive new federal programs aimed at achieving civil rights ending poverty and extending the welfare state and new voices among women african americans and latinos demanding to be heard.
with heated vitriolic rhetoric on all sides these developments overlapped with political assassinations and violence both overseas and at home.
in this chapter we undertake to explain how the rekindling of liberal reform under the twin auspices of the civil rights movement and the leadership of president johnson gave way to a profound liberal crisis and the resurgence of conservatism.
i want out protest movements of all kinds shook the foundations of american society and national politics in the 1960s.
no issue was more controversial and divisive than the war in vietnam.

part 8 the modern state and the age of liberalism 1945 1980 liberalism at high tide in may 1964 lyndon johnson president for barely six months delivered the commencement address at the university of michigan.
johnson offered his audience a grand and inspirational vision of a new liberal age.
we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society johnson continued but upward to the great society as the sun baked graduates listened johnson spelled out what he meant the great society rests on abundance and liberty for all.
it demands an end to poverty and racial injustice even this johnson declared was just the beginning.
he would push to renew american education rebuild the cities and restore the natural environment.
ambitious even audacious johnsons vision was a new deal for a new era.
from that day forward the president would harness his considerable political skills to make that vision a reality.
a tragic irony however was that he held the presidency at all.
to see a longer excerpt of johnsons commencement address along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
john f kennedys promise in 1961 three years before johnsons great society speech john f kennedy declared at his inauguration let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans he challenged his fellow citizens to ask what you can do for your country a call to service that inspired many americans.
the british journalist henry fairley called kennedys activism the politics of expectation over time the expectations kennedy embodied combined with his ability to inspire a younger generation laid the groundwork for an era of liberal reform.
kennedys legislative record did not live up to his promising image.
this was not entirely his fault congressional partisanship and resistance stymied many presidents in the twentieth century.
kennedys domestic advisors devised bold plans for health insurance for the aged a new antipoverty program and a tax cut.
after enormous pressure from martin luther king jr and other civil rights leaders and pushed by the demonstrations in birmingham alabama in 1963 they added a civil rights bill.
none of these initiatives went anywhere in the senate where powerful conservative interests practiced an old legislative art delay delay delay.
all kennedys bills were at a virtual standstill when tragedy struck.
on november 22 1963 kennedy was in dallas texas on a political trip.
as he and his wife jacqueline rode in an open car past the texas school book depository he was shot through the head and neck by a sniper.
he died within the hour.
the accused killer twenty four year old lee harvey oswald was himself killed while in custody a few days later by an assassin a dallas nightclub owner named jack ruby.
before air force one left dallas to take the presidents body back to washington a grim faced lyndon johnson was sworn in as kennedys successor.
kennedys youthful image the trauma of his assassination and the nations sense of loss contributed to a powerful kennedy mystique.
his canonization after death capped what had been an extraordinarily stagemanaged presidency.
an admiring country saw in jack and jackie kennedy an ideal american marriage though jfk was in fact an obsessive womanizer in kennedy the epitome of robust good health though he was actually afflicted by addisons disease and in the kennedy white house a glamorous world of high fashion and celebrity.
no other presidency ever matched the kennedy aura but every president after him embraced the idea that image mattered as much as reality in conducting a politically effective presidency.
lyndon b johnson and the great society in many ways lyndon johnson was the opposite of kennedy.
a seasoned texas politician and longtime senate leader johnson was most at home in the back rooms of power.
he was a rough edged character who had scrambled his way up with few scruples to wealth and political eminence.
but he never forgot his modest hill country origins or lost his sympathy for the downtrodden.
johnson lacked kennedys style but he rose to the political challenge after kennedys assassination applying his astonishing energy and negotiating skills to revive several of kennedys stalled programs and many more of his own in the ambitious great society.
on assuming the presidency johnson promptly pushed for civil rights legislation as a memorial to his slain predecessor chapter 27.
his motives were complex.
as a southerner who had previously opposed civil rights for african americans johnson wished to prove that he was more than a regional figure he would be the president of all the people.
he also wanted to make a mark on history telling martin luther king jr and other civil rights leaders to lace up their sneakers.
