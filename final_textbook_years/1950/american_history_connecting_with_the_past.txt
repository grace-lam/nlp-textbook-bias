784 chapter 29 l johnson was a man who believed in the active use of power.
between 1963 and 1966 he compiled the most impressive legislative record of any president since franklin roosevelt.
he was aided by the tidal wave of emotion that followed the death of president kennedy which helped win support for the great many new frontier proposals.
society fut jhnson also constructed a remarkable reform program of his own one that he ultimately labeled the great society and he won approval of much of it through the same sort of skillful lobbying in congress that had made him an effective majority leader.
johnson envisioned himself as a great coalition builder he wanted the support of everyone and for a time he nearly got it.
his first year in office was by necessity dominated by the campaign for reelection.
there was little doubt that he would win particularly after the republican party fell under the sway of its right wing and nominated the conservative senator barry goldwater of arizona.
in the november 1964 election the president received a larger plurality of the popular vote over 61 percent than any candidate before or since.
goldwater managed to carry only his home state of arizona and five states in the deep south.
record democratic majorities in both houses of congress many of whose members had been swept into office only because of the margin of johnsons victory ensured that the president would be able to fulfill many of his goals.
the assault on poverty for the first time since the 1930s the federal government took steps in the 1960s to create important new social welfare pro medicare and rams the most imporunt of these per medicaid haps was medicare a program to provide federal aid to the elderly for medical expenses.
its enactment in 1965 came at the end of a bitter twenty year debate between those who believed in the concept of national health assistance and those who denounced it as socialized medicine but the program as it went into effect pacified many critics.
for one thing it avoided the stigma of welfare by making medicare benefits available to all elderly americans regardless of need just as social security had done with pensions.
that created a large middle class constituency for the program.
the program also defused the opposition of the medical community by allowing doctors serving medicare patients to practice privately and to charge their normal fees medicare simply shifted responsibility for paying those fees from the patient to the government.
in 1966 johnson steered to passage the medicaid program which extended federal medical assistance to welfare recipients and other indigent people of all ages.
medicare and medicaid were early steps in a much larger assault on poverty one that kennedy had been planning in eternal flame the john f kennedy eternal flame memorializes the slain president.
it is located at kennedy s grave site in arlington national cemetery.
the site was designed by architect john carl warnecke a long time friend of the president.
getty images news getty images the last months of his life and that johnson launched only weeks after taking office.
the centerpiece of this war on poverty as johnson called it was the office of economic opportunity oeo which created an array of new educational employment housing and health care programs.
but the oeo was controversial from the start in part because of its commitment to the idea of community action community action was an effort to involve members of poor communities themselves in the planning and administration of the programs designed to help them.
the community action programs provided jobs for many poor people and gave them valuable experience in administrative and political work.
many men and women who went on to significant careers in community politics or community organizing includ action ing many black and hispanic politicians as program well as many indians got their start in community action programs.
but despite its achievements the community action approach proved impossible to sustain both because of administrative failures and because the apparent excesses of a few agencies damaged the popular image of the community action programs and indeed the war on poverty as a whole.
the oeo spent nearly 3 billion during its first two years of existence and it helped reduce poverty in some areas.
but it fell far short of eliminating poverty.
that was in part because of the weaknesses of the programs themselves and in part because funding for them inadequate from the beginning dwindled as the years passed and a costly war in southeast asia became the nations first priority.
cities schools and immigration closely tied to the antipoverty program were federal efforts to promote the revitalization of decaying cities and to strengthen civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 785 the nations schools.
the housing act of 1961 offered 4 9 billion in federal grants to cities for the preservation of open spaces the housing and development of mass transit systems and urban the subsidization of middle income housing.
development in 1966 johnson established a new cabinet agency the department of housing and urban development whose first secretary robert weaver was the first african american ever to serve in the cabinet.
johnson also inaugurated the model cities program which offered federal subsidies for urban redevelopment pilot programs.
kennedy had long fought for federal aid to public education but he had failed to overcome two important obstacles many americans feared that aid to education was the first step toward federal control of the schools and catholics insisted that federal assistance must extend to parochial as well as public schools.
johnson managed to circumvent both objections with the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 and a series of subsequent measures.
the bills extended aid to both private and parochial schools and based the aid on the economic conditions of the students not on the needs of the schools themselves.
total annual federal expenditures for education and technical training rose from 5 billion to 12 billion between 1964 and 1967.
the johnson administration also supported the immigration act of 1965 one of the most important pieces of legislation of t the 1960s.
the law maintained a strict immigration q act of 1965 limit on the number of newcomers admit ted to the country each year 170 000 but it eliminated the national origins system established in the 1920s which gave preference to immigrants from northern europe over those from other parts of the world.
it continued to restrict immigration from some parts of latin america but it allowed people from all parts of europe asia and africa to enter the united states on an equal basis.
by the early 1970s the character of american immigration had changed with members of new national groups and particularly large groups of asians entering the united states and changing the character of the american population.
legacies of the great society failures and achievements of the great society taken together the great society reforms meant a significant increase in federal spending.
for a time rising tax revenues from the growing economy nearly compensated for the new expenditures.
in 1964 johnson managed to win passage of the 11 5 billion tax cut that kennedy had first proposed in 1962.
the cut increased the federal deficit but substantial economic growth over the next several years made up for much of the revenue initially lost.
as great society programs began to multiply however and particularly as they began to compete with the escalating costs of americas military ventures federal spending rapidly outpaced increases in revenues.
in 1961 the federal government had spent 94 4 billion.
by 1970 that sum had risen to 196 6 billion.
the high costs of the great society programs the deficiencies and failures of many of them and the inability of the government to find the revenues to pay for them contributed to a growing disillusionment in later years with the idea of federal efforts to solve social problems.
by the 1980s many americans had become convinced that the great society experiments had not worked and that indeed government programs to solve social prob lems could not work.
but the great society despite many failures was also responsible for some significant achievements.
it substantially reduced hunger in america.
it made medical care available to millions of elderly and poor people who would otherwise have had great difficulty affording it.
it contributed to the greatest reduction in poverty in american history.
in 1959 according to the most widely accepted estimates 21 percent of the american people lived below the johnson treatment lyndon johnson was legendary for his powers of persuasion for a combination of charm and intimidation that often worked on even the most experienced politicians.
he is shown here in the oval office meeting with his old friend senator richard russell of georgia and demonstrating one of his most powerful and unsettling techniques of persuasion moving so close to the person with whom he was talking as to be almost touching him.
lbj library photo by yoichi okamoto 786 chapter 29 the official poverty line.
by 1969 only 12 percent remained below that line.
the improvements affected blacks and whites in about the same proportion 56 percent of the black population had lived in poverty in 1959 while only 32 percent did so ten years later a 42 percent reduction 18 percent of all whites had been poor in 1959 but only 10 percent were poor a decade later a 44 percent reduction.
much of that progress was a result of economic growth but some of it was a result of great society programs.
the battle for racial equality the nations most important domestic initiative in the 1960s was the effort to provide justice and equality to african americans.
it was the most difficult commitment the one that produced the severest strains on american society.
it was also the most urgent.
black americans were themselves ensuring that the nation would have to deal with the problem of race.
expanding protests john kennedy had long been sympathetic to the cause of racial justice but he was hardly a committed crusader.
his intervention during the 1960 campaign to help win the release of martin luther king jr from a georgia prison won him a large plurality of the black vote.
but like many presidents before him he feared alienating southern democratic voters and members of congress.
birmingham 1963 in one of the scenes that horrified many americans watching on television police in birmingham alabama turn fire hoses full force on civil rights demonstrators knocking many of them to the around ap images sncc his administration set out to contain the racial problem by expanding enforcement of existing laws and supporting litigation to overturn existing segregation statutes hoping to make modest progress without creating politically damaging divisions.
but the pressure for more fundamental change could not be contained.
in february i960 black college students in greensboro north carolina staged a sit in at a segregated woolworths lunch counter and in the following weeks similar demonstrations spread throughout much of the south forcing many merchants to integrate their facilities.
in the fall of 1960 some of those who had participated in the sit ins formed the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc which worked to keep the spirit of resistance alive.
in 1961 an interracial group of students working with the congress of racial equality core began what they called freedom freedom rides reviving a tactic core had rides tried without much success in the 1940s.
traveling by bus throughout the south the freedom riders tried to force the desegregation of bus stations.
in some places they met with such savage violence at the hands of enraged whites that the president finally dispatched federal marshals to help keep the peace.
kennedy also ordered the integration of all bus and train stations.
in the meantime sncc workers began fanning out through black communities and even into remote rural areas to encourage african americans to challenge the obstacles to voting that the jim crow laws had created.
the southern christian leadership conference sclc also created citizen education and other programs many of them organized by ella baker one of the most successful grassroots leaders of the movement to mobilize black workers farmers housewives and others to challenge segregation disenfranchisement and discrimination.
continuing judicial efforts to enforce the integration of public education increased the pressure on national leaders to respond to the civil rights movement.
in october 1962 a federal court ordered the university of mississippi to enroll its first black student james meredith governor ross barnett a strident segregationist refused to enforce the order.
when angry whites in oxford mississippi began rioting to protest the court decree president kennedy sent federal troops to the city to restore order and protect merediths right to attend the university.
events in alabama in 1963 helped bring the growing movement to something of a climax.
in april martin luther king r helped launch a series of nonviolent demonstrations in birmingham alabama a city perhaps unsurpassed in its commitment to segregation.
police commissioner eugene bull connor supervised a brutal effort to break up the peaceful marches arresting hundreds of civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 787 demonstrators and using attack dogs tear gas electric cattle prods and fire hoses at times even against small children as birmingham much of the nation watched televised reports in horror.
two months later governor george wallace who had won election in 1962 pledging staunch resistance to integration pledged to stand in the doorway of a building at the university of alabama to prevent the court ordered enrollment of several black students.
only after the arrival of federal marshals and a visit from attorney general robert kennedy did wallace give way.
his stand won him wide popularity among whites throughout the nation who were growing uncomfortable with the pace of integration.
that same night naacp official medgar evers was murdered in mississippi.
a national commitment the events in alabama and mississippi were a warning to the president that he could no longer contain or avoid the issue of race.
in an important television address the night of the university of alabama confrontation and the murder of evers president kennedy spoke eloquently of the moral issue facing the nation.
if an american he asked because his skin is dark.
cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place.
who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay days later he introduced a series of new legislative proposals prohibiting segregation in public accommodations stores restaurants theaters hotels barring discrimination in employment and increasing the power of the government to file suits on behalf of school integration.
to generate support for the legislation and to dramatize the power of the growing movement more than 200 000 demonstrators marched march on down the mall in washington d c washington z.
r in august 1963 and gathered before the lincoln memorial for the greatest civil rights demonstration in the nations history.
president kennedy who had at first opposed the idea of the march in the end gave it his open support after receiving pledges from organizers that speakers would not criticize the administration.
martin luther king jr in one of the greatest speeches of his distinguished oratorical career roused the crowd with a litany of images prefaced again and again by the phrase i have a dream the march was the high water mark of the peaceful interracial civil rights movement.
the assassination of president kennedy three months later gave new impetus to the battle for civil rights legislation.
the ambitious measure that kennedy had proposed in june 1963 had stalled in the senate after having passed through the house of representatives with relative ease.
early in 1964 after johnson applied both public and private pressure supporters of the measure finally mustered the two thirds majority necessary to close debate and end a filibuster by southern senators and the senate passed the most comprehensive civil rights bill in the nations history.
the battle for voting rights having won a significant victory in one area the civil rights movement shifted its focus to another voting rights.
during the summer of 1964 thousands of civil rights workers black and white northern and southern spread freedom.
summer out trough the south but primarily in mississippi to work on behalf of black voter registration and participation.
the campaign was known as freedom summer and it produced a violent response from some southern whites.

moments after completing his memorable speech during the august 1963 march on washington king waves to the vast and enthusiastic crowd that has gathered in front of the lincoln memorial to demand equality and jobs.
ap images debating the past the civil rights movement ini tt.
ear y histories of the civil rights movement rest on a heroic narrative of moral purpose 1 jtljcand personal courage by which great men and women inspired ordinary people to rise up and struggle for their rights.
this narrative generally begins with the brown decision of 1954 and the montgomery bus boycott of 1955 continues through the civil rights campaigns of the early 1960s and culminates in the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965.
central events in this narrative are the 1963 march on washington with martin luther king jr s famous i have a dream speech and king s assassination in 1968 which has often symbolized the end of the movement and the beginning of a different more complicated period of the black freedom struggle.
the key element of these narratives is the central importance to the movement of a few great leaders most notably king himself.
among the best examples of this kind of narrative are taylor branch s powerful studies of the life and struggles of king parting the waters 1988 pillar of fire 1998 and at canaan s edge 2006 as well as david garrow s important study bearing the cross 1986.
few historians would deny the importance of king and other leaders to the successes of the civil rights movement.
but a number of scholars have argued that the leader centered narrative obscures the vital contributions of ordinary people in communities throughout the south and the nation to the struggle.
john dittmer s local people the struggle for civil rights in mississippi 1994 and charles payne s i ve got the light of freedom 1995 both examine the day to day work of the movement s rank and file in the early 1960s and argue that their collective efforts were at least as important as those of king and other leaders.
only by understanding the local origins of the movement these and other scholars argue can we understand its true character.
scholars also disagree about the time frame of the movement.
rather than beginning the story in 1954 or 1955 as in robert weisbrot s excellent 1991 synthesis freedom bound or william chafe s important 1981 local study civilities and civil rights which examined the greensboro sit ins of 1961 a number of scholars have tried to move the story into both earlier periods and later ones.
robin kelley s race rebels 1994 emphasizes the important contributions of working class african americans who organized some of the earliest civil rights demonstrations sit ins marches and other efforts to challenge segregation long before the conventional dates for the beginning of the movement.
gail o brien s the color of the law 1999 examines a 1946 race riot in columbia tennessee citing it as a signal of the early growth of african american militancy.
other scholars have looked beyond the 1960s and beyond the south to incorporate events outside the orbit of the formal movement in the history of the civil rights struggle.
a growing literature on northern urban and relatively radical activists emphasizes the challenges facing northern african americans and the very different tactics and strategies that they often chose to pursue their goals.
the enormous attention historians have given to the life and legacy of malcolm x among them alex haley s influential autobiography of malcolm x 1965 and michael eric dyson s making malcolm 1996 is one example of this as is the increasing attention scholars have given to black radicalism in the late 1960s and beyond and to such militant groups as the black panthers.
arrive in the south two whites andrew goodman and michael schwerner and one african american james chaney were brutally murdered by ku klux kian members with the support of local police in neshoba county mississippi.
the freedom summed also produced the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp an integrated alternative to the regular state party organization.
under the leadership of fannie lou hamer and others the mfdp challenged the regular partys right to its seats at the democratic national convention that summer.
president johnson eager to avoid antagonizing anyone even southern white democrats who seemed likely to support his republican opponent enlisted kings help to broker a compromise.
it permitted the mfdp to be seated as observers with promises of party reforms later on while the regular state party retained its official standing.
both sides grudgingly accepted the agreement.
both were embittered by it.
a year later in march 1965 king helped organize a major demonstration in selma alabama to press the demand for the right of blacks to register to vote.
selma sheriff jim clark led local police in a brutal attack on the demonstrators which as in birmingham received graphic television coverage and horrified many viewers across the nation.
two northern whites participating in the selma march were murdered in the course of the effort there one a minister beaten to death in the streets of the town the other a detroit housewife shot as she drove along a highway at night with a black passenger in her voting car nationa outrage that followed the rights act events in alabama helped push lyndon johnson to propose and win passage of the civil rights act of 1965 better known as the voting rights act which provided federal protection to blacks attempting to exercise their right to vote.
but important as such gains were they failed to satisfy the rapidly rising expectations of african americans as the focus of the movement began to move from political to economic issues.
the changing movement for decades the nations african american population had been undergoing a major demographic shift and by the 1960s the problem of racial injustice was no longer primarily southern and rural as it had been earlier in the century.
by 1966 69 percent 788 brown v board of education this photograph taken for an atlanta newspaper illustrated the long and dangerous walk that linda brown one of the plaintiffs in the famous desegregation case that ultimately reached the supreme court had to travel each day on her way to a segregated school in topeka kansas.
an all white school was located close to her home but to reach the black school she had to attend required a long walk and a long bus ride each day.
not only does the picture illustrate the difficulties segregation created for linda brown it was also a part of a broad publicity campaign launched by the supporters of the case.
photo by carl iwasaki time life pictures getty images even brown v board of education 1954 the great landmark of the legal challenge to segregation has been subject to reexamination.
richard kluger s narrative history of the brown decision simple justice 1975 is a classic statement of the traditional view of brown as a triumph over injustice.
but critics have been less certain of the dramatic success of the ruling.
james t patterson s brown v board of education a civil rights milestone and its troubled legacy 2001 argues that the brown decision long preceded any national consensus on the need to end segregation and that its impact was far less decisive than earlier scholars have suggested.
michael klarman s from jim crow to civil rights 2004 examines the role of the supreme court in advancing civil rights and suggests among other things that the brown decision may actually have retarded racial progress in the south for a time because of the enormous backlash it created.
charles ogletree s all deliberate speed 2004 and derrick bell s silent covenants 2004 both argue that the court s decision did not provide an effective enforcement mechanism for desegregation and in many other ways failed to support measures that would have made school desegregation a reality.
they note as evidence for this view that american public schools are now more segregated even if not forcibly by law than they were at the time of the brown decision.
as the literature on the african american freedom struggles of the twentieth century has grown historians have begun to speak of civil rights movements rather than a single cohesive movement.
in this way scholars recognize that struggles of this kind take many more forms and endure through many more periods of history than the traditional accounts suggest.
understand analyze and evaluate 1.
the view of the civil rights movement established by the early histories accounts that focused on the moral purpose and courage of a few great leaders remains the most widely accepted view of the movement.
why is that.
if historians now speak of plural civil rights movements what are these movements.
why are the contributions of local grassroots workers so often overlooked in studies of the civil rights movement as well as in accounts of other great events in american history.
of american blacks were living in metropolitan areas and 45 percent outside the south.
although the economic condition of much of american society was improving in the poor urban communities in which the black population was concentrated things were getting significantly worse.
well over half of all american nonwhites lived in poverty at the beginning of the 1960s black unemployment was twice that of whites.
by the mid 1960s therefore the issue of race was moving out of the south and into the rest of the nation.
the battle n against school desegregation had moved deumcto beyond the initial assault on de jure segrega segregation tion segregation by law to an attack on de facto segregation segregation in practice as through residential patterns thus carrying the fight into northern cities.
many african american leaders and their white supporters were demanding similarly that the battle against job discrimination move to a new level employers not only should abandon negative measures to deny jobs to blacks they also should adopt positive measures to recruit minorities thus compensating for past injustices.
lyndon johnson gave his tentative support to the concept of affirmative action in 1965.
over the next decade affirmative action guidelines gradually extended to all institutions doing business with or receiving funds from the federal government including schools and universities and to many others as well.
a symbol of the movements new direction and of the problems it would cause was a major campaign in the summer of 1966 in chicago in which king played a prominent role.
organizers of the chicago campaign hoped to direct national attention to housing and employment discrimination in northern industrial cities in much the same way similar campaigns had exposed legal racism in the south.
but the chicago campaign not only evoked vicious and at times violent opposition from white residents of that city it also failed to arouse the national conscience in the way events in the south had.
urban violence well before the chicago campaign the problem of urban poverty was thrust into national attention when violence broke out in black neighborhoods in major cities.
there were a few scattered disturbances in the summer of 1964 most notably in 789 790 chapter 29 harlem.
the first large race riot since the end of world war ii occurred the following summer in the watts section of los angeles.
in the midst of a seemingly routine traffic arrest a watts riot white police officer struck a protesting black bystander with his club.
the incident triggered a storm of anger and a week of violence and revealed how deeply african americans in los angeles and in other cities resented their treatment at the hands of local police.
as many as 10 000 people were estimated to have participated in the violence in watts attacking white motorists burning buildings looting stores and sniping at policemen.
thirty four people died during the watts uprising which was eventually quelled by the national guard twenty eight of the dead were black.
in the summer of 1966 there were forty three additional outbreaks the most serious of them in chicago and cleveland.
and in the summer of 1967 there were eight major outbreaks including the largest of them all a racial clash in detroit in which forty three people thirty three of them black died.
televised reports of the violence alarmed millions of americans and created both a new sense of urgency and a growing sense of doubt among many of those whites who had embraced the cause of racial justice only a few years before.
a special commission on civil disorders created by the president in response to the disturbances issued a celebrated report in the spring of 1968 recommending massive spending to eliminate the abysmal conditions of the ghettos.
only a commitment to national action on an unprecedented scale the commission concluded can shape a future compatible with the historic ideals of american society.
to many white americans however the lesson of the riots was the need for stern measures to stop violence and lawlessness.
black power shift from integration to racial distinction disillusioned with the ideal of peaceful change in cooperation with whites an increasing number of african americans were turning to a new approach to the racial issue the philosophy of black power black power could mean many different things.
but in all its forms it suggested a move away from interracial cooperation and toward increased awareness of racial distinctiveness.
it was part of a long nationalist tradition among african americans that extended back into slavery and that had its most visible civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 791 twentieth century expression in the garvey movement of the 1920s.
perhaps the most enduring impact of the black power ideology was a social and psychological one instilling racial pride in african americans who lived in a society whose dominant culture generally portrayed african americans as inferior to whites.
it encouraged the growth of black studies in schools and universities.
it helped stimulate important black literary and artistic an increasingly divided civil rights movement movements.
it produced a new interest among many african americans in their african roots.
it led to a rejection by some blacks of certain cultural practices borrowed from white society afro hairstyles began to replace artificially straightened hair some blacks began to adopt african styles of dress and new african names.
but black power had political manifestations as well most notably in creating a deep schism within the civil rights movement.
traditional black organizations that had emphasized cooperation with sympathetic whites groups such as the naacp the urban league and king s southern christian leadership conference now faced competition from radical groups.
the student nonviolent coordinating committee and the congress of racial equality had both begun as relatively moderate interracial organizations sncc was originally a stu dent branch of the sclc.
by the mid 1960s however these and other groups were calling for radical and occasionally even violent action against the racism of white society and were openly rejecting the approaches of older more established black leaders.
particularly alarming to many whites and to some african americans as well were organizations that existed outside the mainstream civil rights movement.
in oakland california the black panther party founded by huey newton and bobby seale promised to defend black rights even if that required violence.
black panthers organized along semimilitary lines and wore weapons openly and proudly.
they were in fact more the victims of violence from the police than they were practitioners of violence themselves.
but they created an image quite deliberately of militant radicals willing to fight for justice in newtons words through the barrel of a gun malcolm x in detroit a once obscure black nationalist group the nation of islam gained new prominence.
founded in 1931 by elijah poole who converted to islam and renamed him nation of self elijah muhammad the movement slam taught african americans to take responsibil ity for their own lives to live by strict codes of behavior and to reject any dependence on whites.
the most celebrated of the black muslims as whites often termed them was malcolm little a former drug addict and pimp who had spent time in prison and had rebuilt his life after joining the movement.
he adopted the name malcolm x x to denote his lost african surname.
malcolm became one of the movements most influential spokesmen particularly among younger blacks as a result of his intelligence his oratorical skills and his harsh uncompromising opposition to all forms of racism and oppression.
he did not advocate violence as his critics often claimed but he insisted that black people had the right to defend themselves violently if necessary from those who assaulted them.
malcolm died in 1965 when black gunmen presumably under orders from rivals within the nation of islam assassinated him in new york.
but malcolms influence did not die with him.
a book he had been working on before his death with the writer alex haley the autobiography of malcolm x attracted wide attention after its publication in 1965 and spread his reputation broadly through the nation.
years after his death he was to many african americans as important and revered a symbol as martin luther king jr malcolm x malcolm x a leader of the militant nation of islam arrives in washington d c in may 1963 to set up a headquarters for the organization there.
malcolm was hated and feared by many whites during his lifetime.
after he was assassinated in 1965 he became a widely revered hero among african americans.
bettmann corbis 792 chapter 29 flexible response and the cold war in international affairs as much as in domestic reform the optimistic liberalism of the kennedy and johnson administrations dictated a more positive more active approach to dealing with the nations problems than in the past.
and just as the new activism in domestic reform proved more difficult and divisive than liberals had imagined so too it created frustrations and failures in foreign policy.
diversifying foreign policy the kennedy administration entered office convinced that the united states needed to be able to counter communist aggression in more flexible ways than the atomic weapons oriented flexible defense strategy of the eisenhower years response had permitted.
in particular kennedy was unsatisfied with the nations ability to meet communist threats in emerging areas of the third world the areas in which kennedy believed the real struggle against communism would be waged in the future.
he gave enthusiastic support to the expansion of the special forces or green berets as they were soon known soldiers trained specifically to fight guerrilla conflicts and other limited wars.
kennedy also favored expanding american influence through peaceful means.
to repair the badly deteriorating relationship with latin america he proposed an alliance for progress a series of projects for peaceful development and stabilization of the nations of that region.
kennedy also inaugurated the agency for international development aid to coordinate foreign aid.
and he established what became one of his most popular innovations the peace corps which sent young american volunteers abroad to work in developing areas.
among the first foreign policy ventures of the kennedy administration was a disastrous assault on the castro government in cuba.

khrushchev was particularly unhappy about the mass exodus of residents of east germany to the west through the easily traversed border in the center of berlin.
but he ultimately found a method short of war to stop it.
before dawn on august 13 1961 the east german government complying with directives from moscow began constructing a wall between east and west berlin.
guards fired on those who continued to try to escape from east to west.
for nearly thirty years the berlin wall served as the most potent physical symbol of the conflict between the communist and noncommunist worlds.
the rising tensions culminated the following october in the most dangerous and dramatic crisis of the cold war.
on october 14 aerial reconnaissance photos produced clear evidence that the soviets were constructing sites in cuba for ennedy in berlin 1963 president john f kennedy looks across the berlin wall from a platform built to allow 1 to see into east berlin.
shortly afterward he gave a powerful speech to a vast crowd of west berliners.
thet speech is well received in europe and america.
but it followed another important speech n which kennedy spoke easing nsions between the west and the communist world.
0 rue des archives the granger collection new york offensive nuclear weapons.
to the soviets placing missiles in cuba probably seemed a reasonable and relatively inexpensive way to counter the presence of american missiles in turkey and a way to deter any future crisis american invasion of cuba.
but to kennedy and most other americans the missile sites represented an act of aggression by the soviets toward the united states.
almost immediately the president decided that the weapons could not be allowed to remain.
on october 22 he ordered a naval and air blockade around cuba a quarantine against all offensive weapons.
preparations were under way for an american air attack on the missile sites when late in the evening of october 26 kennedy received a message from khrushchev implying that the soviet union would remove the missile bases in exchange for an american pledge not to invade cuba.
ignoring other tougher soviet messages the president agreed.
the crisis was over.
johnson and the world lyndon johnson entered the presidency lacking john kennedys prior albeit limited experience with international affairs.
he was eager therefore not only to continue the policies of his predecessor but also to prove quickly that he too was a strong and forceful leader.
an internal rebellion in the dominican republic gave him an early opportunity to do so.
a 1961 assassination had toppled the repressive dictatorship of general rafael trujillo and for the next four years various factions in the country had struggled for dominance.
in the spring of 1965 a conservative military regime began to collapse in the face of a revolt by a broad range of groups on behalf of the left wing nationalist juan bosch.
arguing without any evidence that bosch planned to establish a pro castro communist regime johnson dispatched 30 000 american troops to quell the disorder.
only after a conservative candidate defeated bosch in a 1966 election were the forces withdrawn.
from johnsons first moments in office however his foreign policy was almost totally dominated by the bitter civil war in vietnam and by the expanding involvement of the united states there.
intervention in the dominican republic the agony of vietnam george kennan who helped devise the containment doctrine that drew america into war in vietnam once called the conflict the most disastrous of all americas undertakings over er the vietnam commitment t wt1965 the department of defense released a film intended for american soldiers about to iim embark for service in vietnam and designed to explain why the united states had found it necessary to commit so many lives and resources to the defense of a small and distant land.
the film was titled why vietnam a question many americans have pondered and debated in the decades afp getty images since.
the debate has centered on two questions.
one is an effort to assess the broad objectives americans believed they were pursuing in vietnam.
the other is an effort to explain how and why policymakers made the specific decisions that led to the american commitment.
the defense department film offered one answer to the question of america s broad objectives the united states was fighting in vietnam to defend freedom and stop aggression and to prevent the spread of communism.
this explanation continued to attract support well after the war ended.
political scientist guenter lewy contended in america in vietnam 1978 that the united states entered vietnam to help an ally combat foreign aggression.
historian ernest r may stated the paradox is that the vietnam war so often condemned by its opponents as hideously immoral may well have been the most moral or at least the most selfless war in all of american history.
for the impulse guiding it was not to defeat an enemy or to serve a national interest it was simply not to abandon friends.
other scholars have taken a starkly different view.
they see america s intervention in vietnam as a form of imperialism part of a larger effort by the united states after world war ii to impose a particular political and economic order on the world.
the vietnam war historian gabriel kolko wrote in anatomy of a war 1985 was for the united states the culmination of its frustrating postwar effort to merge its arms and politics to halt and reverse the emergence of states and the whole 200 years of its history yet at first the vietnam war seemed simply one more third world struggle on the periphery of the cold war a struggle in which the united states would try to tip the balance against communism without becoming too deeply or directly engaged.
no single president really decided to go to war in vietnam.
rather the american involvement there emerged from years of gradually increasing commitments that slowly and almost imperceptibly expanded.
the first indochina war vietnam had a long history both as an independent kingdom and a major power in its region and as a subjugated province of china.
in the mid nineteenth century vietnam became a colony of france.
and like other european possessions in asia it fell under the control of japan during world war ii.
after the defeat of japan the question arose of what was to happen to vietnam in the postwar world.
there were two opposing forces attempting to answer that question both of them appealing to the united states for help.
the french wanted to reassert their colonial control over vietnam.
challenging them was a powerful nationalist the vietminh movement within vietnam committed to creating an independent country.
the nationalists were organized into a political party the vietminh which had been created in 1941 and led ever since by ho chi minh a communist educated in paris and moscow and a fervent vietnamese nationalist.
in the fall of 1945 after the collapse of japan and before the western powers had time to return the vietminh declared vietnam an independent nation and set up a nationalist government under ho chi minh in hanoi.
president truman was under heavy pressure from both the british and the french to support france in its effort to reassert its control over vietnam.
the french argued that without vietnam their domestic economy would collapse.
and since the economic revival of western europe was quickly becoming one of the truman administration s top priorities the 794 social systems opposed to the international order washington sought to establish marilyn younq in the vietnam wars 1945 1990 1991 argued that the united states intervened in vietnam as part of a broad and continuing effort to organize the post world war ii world along lines compati ble with american interests and ideals.
those who looked less at the nation s broad objectives than at the internal workings of the policymaking process likewise produced competing explanations.
journalist david halberstam s the best and the brightest 1972 argued that policymakers deluded themselves into thinking they could achieve their goals in vietnam by ignoring suppressing or dismissing the information that might have suggested otherwise.
the foreign policy leaders of the kennedy and johnson administrations were so committed to the idea of american activism and success that they refused to consider the possibility of failure the vietnam disaster was thus at least in part a result of the arrogance of the nation s leaders.
larry berman offered a somewhat different view in planning a tragedy 1982 and lyndon johnson s war 1989.
berman argued that johnson committed american troops to the war in vietnam in 1965 not because he expected to win in fact he never believed that a real victory was within sight but because he feared that allowing vietnam to fall would ruin him politically.
to do otherwise johnson feared would destroy his hopes for winning approval of his great society legislation at home.
leslie h gelb and richard k betts saw the roots of the involvement in the larger imperatives of the american foreign policy system.
in the irony of vietnam the system worked 1979 they argued that intervention in vietnam was the logical perhaps even inevitable result of a political and bureaucratic order shaped by the doctrine of containment.
american foreign policy operated in response to a single overriding imperative the need to prevent the expansion of communism.
only when the national and international political situation had shifted to the point where it was possible for american policymakers to reassess the costs of the commitment a shift that began to occur in the early 1970s was it possible for the united states to begin disengaging.
more recent studies have questioned the idea that intervention was inevitable or that there were no viable alternatives.
david kaiser in american tragedy 2000 argues that john kennedy was not a hawkish supporter of escalation.
rather his skepticism about the judgment of his military advisers had led him to believe that the united states should find a negotiated settlement to the war.
his successor lyndon johnson harbored no such skepticism and sided with those who favored a military solution.
the death of john kennedy therefore becomes a vital event in the history of america in vietnam.
fredrik logevall in choosing war the lost chance for peace and the escalation of the war in vietnam 1999 argues that there were significant opportunities for a negotiated settlement of the war in the early 1960s but that american leaders including both kennedy and johnson chose a military response instead in part to protect themselves politically from charges of weakness.
that the debate over the vietnam war has been so continuous over the past few decades is a reflection of the enormous role the u s failure there has played in shaping the way americans have thought about politics and policy ever since.
because the lessons of vietnam remain a subject of intense popular concern the debate over the history of vietnam is likely to continue.

some scholars offer explanations that differ significantly from the government view.
according to these scholars why was the united states fighting in vietnam.
what are the lessons of vietnam.
how have u s foreign affairs since vietnam observed or ignored these lessons.
united states did nothing to stop the french as they moved back into vietnam in 1946 and began a struggle with the vietminh to reestablish control over the country.
for the next four years during what has become known as the first indochina war truman and then eisenhower supported the french military campaign against the vietminh by 1954 by some calculations the united states was paying 80 percent of frances war costs.
but the war went badly for the french in spite of the american support.
finally late in 1953 vietminh forces engaged the french in a major battle in the far northwest corner of the country at dien bien phu an isolated and almost indefensible site.
the french were surrounded and the battle turned into a prolonged and horrible siege with the french position steadily deteriorating.
it was at this point that the eisenhower administration decided not to intervene to save the french see p 776.
the defense of dien bien phu collapsed and the french government decided the time had come to get out.
the first indochina war had come to an end.
geneva and the two vietnams geneva conference an international conference at geneva planned many months before to settle the korean dispute and other controversies now took up the fate of vietnam as well.
the geneva conference produced an agreement to end the vietnam conflict without american participation.
there would be an immediate cease fire in the war vietnam would be temporarily partitioned along the 17th parallel with the vietminh in control of north vietnam and a pro western regime in control of the south.
in 1956 elections would be held to reunite the country under a single government.
america and diem as soon as the geneva accords established the partition the french finally left vietnam.
the united states almost immediately stepped into the vacuum and became the principal 795 796 chapter 29 ngo dinh diem the nlf benefactor of the new government in the south led by ngo dinh diem.
diem was an aristocratic catholic from central vietnam an outsider in the south.
but he was also a nationalist uncontaminated by collaboration with the french.
and he was for a time successful.
with the help of the american cia diem waged an effective campaign against some of the powerful religious sects and the south vietnamese mafia which had challenged the authority of the central government.
as a result the united states came to regard diem as a powerful and impressive alternative to ho chi minh.
lyndon johnson once called him the churchill of southeast asia the u s government supported south vietnamese president diems refusal in 1956 to permit the elections called for by the geneva accords see above reasoning correctly that ho chi minh would easily win any such election.
ho could count on almost 100 percent of the vote in the north with its much larger population and at least some support in the south.
in the meantime the united states poured military and economic aid into south vietnam.
by 1956 it was the second largest recipient of american military aid in the world after korea.
diems early successes in suppressing the sects in vietnam led him in 1959 to begin a similar campaign to eliminate the vietminh supporters who had stayed behind in the south after the partition.
he was quite successful for a time so successful in fact that the north vietnamese found it necessary to respond.
ho chi minh resumed his armed struggle for national unification.
in 1959 the vietminh cadres in the south created the national liberation front nlf known to many americans as the viet cong an organization closely allied with the north vietnamese government.
it was committed to overthrowing the puppet regime of diem and reuniting the nation.
in 1960 under orders from hanoi and with both material and manpower support from north vietnam the nlf began military operations in the south.
by 1961 nlf forces were very successfully destabilizing the diem regime.
they were killing more than 4 000 government officials a year mostly village leaders and establishing effective control over many areas of the countryside.
diem was also by now losing the support of many other groups in south vietnam and he was even losing support within his own military.
in 1963 the diem regime precipitated a major crisis by trying to discipline and repress the south vietnamese buddhists in an effort to make catholicism the dominant religion of the country.
the buddhists began to stage enormous antigovernment demonstrations.
several buddhist monks doused themselves with gasoline sat cross legged in the streets of downtown saigon and set themselves on fire in view of photographers and television cameras.
the buddhist crisis caused the u s government to reconsider its commitment to diem although not to the survival of diem south vietnam.
american officials pressured overthrown diem to reform his government but diem made no significant concessions.
in the fall of 1963 kennedy gave his tacit approval to a plot by a group of south vietnamese generals to topple diem.
in early november 1963 the generals staged the coup assassinated diem and his brother and principal adviser ngo dinh nhu murders the united states had not wanted or expected and established the first of a series of new governments which were for over three years even less stable than the one they had overthrown.
a few weeks after the coup john kennedy too was dead.
from aid to intervention lyndon johnson thus inherited what was already a substantial american commitment to the survival of an anticommunist south vietnam.
during his first two years in office he expanded that commitment into a full scale american war.
why he did so has long been a subject of debate see debating the past pp.
many factors played a role in johnsons decision.
but the most obvious explanation is that the new president faced many pressures to expand the american involvement and very few to limit it.
as the untested successor to a revered and martyred president he felt obliged to prove his worthiness for the office by continuing the policies of his predeces pressure for j i american sor i nson a so necessaryt0 retain in intervention his administration many of the important figures of the kennedy years.
in doing so he surrounded himself with a group of foreign policy advisers secretary of state dean rusk secretary of defense robert mcnamara national security adviser mcgeorge bundy and others who firmly believed that the united states had an obligation to resist communism in vietnam.
congress raised little protest to and indeed at one point openly endorsed johnsons use of executive powers to lead the nation into war.
above all intervention in south vietnam was fully consistent with nearly twenty years of american foreign policy.
an anticommunist ally was appealing to the united states for assistance all the assumptions of the containment doctrine as it had come to be defined by the 1960s seemed to require the nation to intervene.
vietnam johnson believed was a test of american willingness to fight communist aggression a test he was determined not to fail.
during his first months in office johnson expanded the american involvement in vietnam only slightly sending an additional 5 000 military advisers there and preparing to send 5 000 more.
then early in august 1964 the president announced that american destroyers on patrol in international waters in the gulf gulf of tonkin had been attacked by north tonkin vietnamese torpedo boats.
later information resolution raised doubts as to whether the administration reported the attacks accurately.
at the time however virtually no one questioned johnsons portrayal of the incident as a serious act of aggression or his insistence that the united states must respond.
by a vote of 416 to 0 in the house and 88 to 2 in the senate congress hurriedly passed the gulf of tonkin resolution which authorized the president to take all necessary measures to protect american forces and prevent further aggression in southeast asia.
the resolution became in johnsons view at least an open ended legal authori zation for escalation of the conflict.

the red arrows in the middle of the map show the general path of the ho chi minh trail the main supply route by which north vietnam supplied its troops and allies in the south.
the blue arrow in southern south vietnam indicates the point at which american troops invaded cambodia in 1970.
what is there in the geography of indochina as presented on this map that helps to explain the great difficulty the american military had in securing south vietnam against communist attacks.
with the south vietnamese leadership still in disarray four months later the president finally admitted that the more and more of the burden of opposition to the viet cong character of the war had changed.

in 1961 14 i the folk music revival impulses of the 1960s the renewed interest among young people in the politics of the left and the search for an authentic alternative to what many considered the artificial consumerist culture of modern america helped produce the revived popularity of folk music in that turbulent era.
although the harder harsher and more sensual music of rock n roll was more visible and more popular in the 1960s folk music more clearly expressed many of the political ideas and aspirations that were welling up in the youth culture of the time.
the folk music tradition like most american musical traditions had many roots.
it drew from some of the black musical traditions of the south and from the white country music of appalachia.
and it drew most immediately from a style of music developed by musicians associated with the communist party s popular front in the 1930s.
woody guthrie pete seeger the weavers and others whose music would become popular again in the 1960s began their careers singing in popular front and union rallies during the great depression.
their music like the popular front itself set out to seem entirely american rooted in the nation s folk traditions.
folk music remained alive in the 1940s and 1950s but it had only a modest popular following.
pete seeger and the weavers continued to perform and to attract attention on college campuses.
harry belafonte and the kingston trio recorded slick pop versions of folk songs in an effort to bring them to mass audiences.
in 1952 folkway records released the anthology of american folk music a collection of eighty four performances recorded in the 1920s and 1930s that became an inspiration and an important source of material to many younger folk musicians.
folk music festivals at berkeley newport and chicago began to proliferate beginning in 1959.
and an important community of folk musicians lived and performed together in the 1950s and early 1960s in new york city s greenwich village.
as the politics of the 1960s became more heated and as young people in particular became politically aroused it was folk music that most directly reflected their new values and concerns.
peter paul and mary although only intermittently political became icons to much of the new left beginning with their 1962 recording of if i had a hammer a song first performed at communist party rallies in the 1940s by pete seeger and the weavers.

joan baez whose politics were no secret to anyone was actively engaged in the antiwar movement and was arrested several times for participating in militant protests.
rallying again the music of woody guthrie and other musicians of the 1930s 1940s and 1950s inspired a revival of popular music sympathetic to the protesting generation of the 1960s.
everett collection inc alamy but it was not just the overt political messages of folk musicians that made them so important to young americans in the 1960s.
in addition folk was a kind of music that seemed to reflect the authenticity the youth culture was attempting to find.
in truth neither the musicians themselves nor the young americans attracted to them had much real connection with the traditions they were trying to evoke.
the audiences for folk americans had died in vietnam.
by the spring of 1966 more than 4 000 americans had been killed.
the united states finally succeeded in 1965 in creating a reasonably stable government in the south under general nguyen van thieu.
but the new regime was hardly less corrupt or brutal than its predecessors and no more able than they to establish its authority in its own countryside.
the viet cong not the thieu regime controlled the majority of south vietnams villages and hamlets.
the quagmire strategy of attrition unable and unwilling to continue the struggle.
but the attrition strategy failed because the north vietnamese proved willing to commit many more soldiers to the conflict than the united states had expected.
the united states relied heavily on its bombing of the north to eliminate the communists war making capacity.
by the end of 1967 most of the identifiable targets of any strategic importance in north vietnam had been destroyed.
but the bombing had produced none of the effects that the united states had expected.
north vietnam was not a modern industrial society it had few of the sorts of targets against which bombing is effective.
the north vietnamese responded to the air raids with ingenuity they created a great network of underground tunnels shops and factories.
they also secured increased aid from the soviet union and china.
infiltration of the south was unaffected the north vietnamese kept moving the ho chi minh trail the routes by which north vietnam soldiers infiltrated the south.

but the message of folk music that there is a real america rooted in values of sharing and community hidden beneath the crass commercialism of modern culture resonated with the yearnings of many people in the 1960s and beyond for an alternative to their own troubled world.
when young audiences responded to woody guthrie s famous ballad this land is your land they were expressing a hope for a different america more democratic more honest and more natural than the land they knew.

another crucial part of the american strategy was the pacifi ation program which was intended to push the viet cong from hearts and minds areas chosen by the united states and then pacify those regions by winning the hearts and minds of the people.
but american ces were not adept at establishing the kind of rapport with jvincial vietnamese that the viet cong had created.
gradually the pacification program gave way to a heavy jded relocation strategy through which american troops rooted villagers from their homes sent them fleeing to ugee camps or into the cities producing by 1967 more than trillion refugees and then destroyed the vacated villages i surrounding countryside.
but the viet cong responded by iying to new sanctuaries elsewhere.
the futility of the ited statess effort was suggested by the statement of an ferican officer after flattening one such hamlet that it had n necessary to destroy the village in order to save it as the war dragged on and victory remained elusive some american officers and officials began to urge the president to expand the military efforts.
the johnson administration however resisted.
unwilling to abandon its commitment to south vietnam for fear of destroying american credibility in the world the government was also unwilling to expand the war too far for fear of provoking direct intervention by the chinese the soviets or both.
in the meantime the president began to encounter additional obstacles and frustrations at home.

opposition to the war became a central issue in left wing politics and in the culture of colleges and universities.
it had penetrated popular cultures as well most visibly in the rising popularity of folk musicians many of whom used their songs to express opposition to the war.
in the meantime a growing number of journalists particularly reporters who had spent time in vietnam helped sustain the antiwar movement with their frank revelations about the brutality and apparent futility of the war.
the growing chorus of popular protest soon began to stimulate opposition to the war from within the government.
senator j william fulbright of arkansas chairman of the powerful senate foreign relations committee turned against the war and in january 1966 began to stage highly publicized congressional hearings to air criticisms of it.
distinguished figures such as george f kennan and retired general james gavin testified against the conflict giving opposition to the war greater respectability.
other members of congress joined fulbright in opposing johnsons policies including in 1967 robert f kennedy brother of the slain president and now a senator from new york.
even within the administration the consensus seemed to be crumbling.
robert mcnamara who had done much to help extend the american involvement in vietnam quietly left the government disillusioned in 1968.
his successor as secretary of defense clark clifford became a quiet but powerful voice within the administration on behalf of a cautious scaling down of the commitment in troops and funding.
in the meantime the american economy was beginning to suffer.
johnsons commitment to fighting the war while continuing his great society reforms his promise of guns and war induced butter proved impossible to maintain.
inflation tbe in ation rate which had remained at 2 percent through most of the early 1960s rose to 3 percent in 1967 4 percent in 1968 and 6 percent in 1969.
in august 1967 johnson asked congress for a tax increase a 10 percent surcharge that was widely labeled a war tax which he knew was necessary if the nation was to avoid even more ruinous inflation.
in return congressional conservatives demanded and received a 6 billion reduction in the funding for great society programs.
civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 801 the traumas of 1968 by the end of 1967 the twin crises of the war in vietnam and the deteriorating racial situation at home crises that fed upon and inflamed each other had produced profound social and political tensions.
in the course of 1968 those tensions seemed suddenly to burst to the surface and to threaten the nation with genuine chaos.
the tet offensive on january 31 1968 the first day of the vietnamese new year tet communist forces launched an enormous concerted attack on american strongholds throughout south vietnam.
a few cities fell to the communists.
during their occupation of the provincial capital hue the communist forces rounded up supporters of the saigon regime and massacred them.
other cities suffered major disruptions.
americans saw vivid reports on television of communist forces in the heart of saigon setting off bombs shooting south vietnamese officials and troops and holding down fortified political and psychological defeat areas including briefly the grounds of the american embassy.
such images shocked many americans and proved devastating to popular support for the war.
the tet offensive also suggested to the american public something of the brutality of the struggle in vietnam.
in the midst of the fighting television cameras recorded the sight of a captured viet cong soldier being led up to a south vietnamese officer in the streets of saigon.
without a word the officer pulled out his pistol and shot the young man in the head leaving him lying dead in the street.
few single events did more to galvanize support for the war in the united states.
american forces soon dislodged the viet cong from most of the positions they had seized and the tet offensive in the end cost the communists such appalling casualties that they were significantly weakened for months to come.
the tet defeats permanently depleted the ranks of the nlf and forced north vietnamese troops to take on a much larger share of the subsequent fighting.

the postwar baby boom which occurred in many nations had created a very large age cohort that by the late 1960s was reaching adulthood.
the sheer size of the new generation produced a tripling of the number of people attending colleges and universities and a heightened sense of the power of youth.
the long period of postwar prosperity and relative peace in which this generation had grown up contributed to heightened expectations of what the world should offer them and a greater level of impatience than previous generations had demonstrated with the obstacles that stood in the way of their hopes.
a new global youth culture emerged that was in many ways at odds with the dominant culture of older generations.
it valued nonconformity personal freedom and even rebellion.
a second force contributing to the widespread turbulence of 1968 was the power of global media.
satellite technology introduced in the early 1960s made it in the following weeks opposition to the war grew substantially.
leading newspapers and magazines television commentators and mainstream politicians began taking public stands in favor of de escalation of the conflict.
within weeks of the tet offensive public opposition to the war had almost doubled.
and johnson s personal popularity rating had slid to 35 percent the lowest of any president since harry truman.
the political challenge beginning in the summer of 1967 dissident democrats led by the activist allard lowenstein tried to mobilize support 802 behind an antiwar candidate who would challenge lyndon johnson in the 1968 primaries.
when robert kennedy declined their invitation they turned to senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota.
a brilliantly orchestrated campaign by lowenstein and thousands of young volunteers in the new hampshire primary produced a startling showing by mccarthy in march he nearly defeated the president.
a few days later robert kennedy entered the campaign embittering many mccarthy supporters but bringing his own substantial strength among african americans the poor and workers to the antiwar cause.
polls showed the president trailing badly in the next scheduled primary in wisconsin.
indeed civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 803 possible to transmit live news instantly across the world.
videotape technology and the creation of lightweight portable television cameras enabled media organizations to respond to events much more quickly and flexibly than in the past.
and the audience for these televised images was by now global and enormous particularly in industrial nations but even in the poorest areas of the world.
protests in one country were suddenly capable of inspiring protests in others.
demonstrators in paris for example spoke openly of how campus protests in the united states in 1968 for example the student uprising at columbia university in new york city had helped motivate french students to rise up as well.
just as american students were protesting against what they considered the antiquated paternalistic features of their universities french students demanded an end to the rigid autocratic character of their own academic world.
in most parts of the world the 1968 uprisings came and went without fundamentally altering the institutions and systems they were attacking.
but many changes came in the wake of these protests.
universities around the globe undertook significant reforms.
religious observance in mainstream churches and synagogues in the west declined dramatically after 1968.
new concepts of personal freedom gained legitimacy helping to inspire new social movements in the years that followed among them the dramatic growth of feminism in many parts of the world.
the events of 1968 did not produce a revolution in the united states or in most of the rest of the world but they did help launch a period of dramatic social cultural and political change that affected the peoples of many nations.

has there been a year or period since 1968 in which similar worldwide protests and uprisings have occurred.
if so what events triggered these later demonstrations.
public animosity toward the president was now so intense that johnson did not even dare leave the white house to campaign.
on march 31 johnson went on television to announce a limited halt in the bombing of north robert vietnam his first major concession to the antiwar forces and more surprising his not by popular primaries but by state party organizations.
he soon appeared to be the front runner in the race.
the king and kennedy assassinations in the midst of this bitter political battle in which the war had been the dominant issue attention suddenly turned back to the nations bitter racial conflicts.
on april 4 martin luther king jr who had traveled to memphis tennessee to lend his support to striking black sanitation workers in the city was shot and killed while standing on the balcony of his motel.
the presumed assassin james earl ray who was captured days later in london and eventually convicted had no apparent motive.
later evidence suggested that he had been hired by others to do the killing but he never revealed the identity of his employers.
kings tragic death produced an outpouring of grief matched in recent memory only by the reaction to the death of john riots kennedy.
among african americans it also produced anger.
in the days after the assassination major riots broke out in more than sixty american cities.
forty three people died more than 3 000 suffered inju ries as many as 27 000 people were arrested.
for two months following the death of king robert kennedy continued his campaign for the presidential nomination.
late on the night of june 6 he appeared in the ballroom of a los angeles hotel to acknowledge his victory in that days california primary.
as he left the ballroom after his victory statement sirhan sirhan a young palestinian apparently enraged by pro israeli remarks kennedy had recently made emerged from a crowd and shot him in the head.
early the next morning kennedy died.
by the time of his death robert kennedy who earlier in his career had been widely considered a cold ruthless agent of his more appealing brother had emerged legacy as a rure 0 enormous popular appeal.
more than john kennedy robert identified his hopes with the american underclass with blacks hispanics native americans the poor.
indeed robert kennedy much more than john shaped what some would later call the kennedy legacy a set of ideas that would for a time become central to american liberalism the fervent commitment to using government to help the powerless.
the passions kennedy aroused made his violent death a particu larly shattering experience for many americans.
the presidential campaign continued gloomily during the last weeks before the convention.
hubert humphrey who had seemed likely to win the nomination even before robert kennedys death now faced only minor opposition.
the approaching democratic national convention therefore began to take on the appearance of an exercise in futility and antiwar activists despairing of winning any victories within the convention began to plan major demonstrations outside it.
when the democrats finally gathered in chicago in august even the most optimistic observers were predicting a turbulent convention.
inside the hall delegates bitterly debated an withdrawal from the presidential contest.
robert kennedy quickly established himself as the cham pion of the democratic primaries.
in the meantime however vice president hubert humphrey with the support of president johnson entered the contest and began to attract the support of party leaders and of the many delegations that were selected 804 chapter 29 democratic antiwar plank in the party platform that national both kennedy and mccarthy supporters convention favored.
miles away in a downtown park thousands of antiwar protesters were staging demonstrations.
on the third night of the convention as the delegates were beginning their balloting on the now inevitable nomination of hubert humphrey demonstrators and police clashed in a bloody riot in the streets of chicago.
hundreds of protesters were injured as police attempted to disperse them with tear gas and billy clubs.
aware that the violence was being televised the demonstrators taunted the authorities with the chant the whole world is watching and hubert humphrey who had spent years dreaming of becoming his partys candidate for president received a nomi nation that appeared at the time to be almost worthless.
the conservative response the turbulent events of 1968 persuaded many observers that american society was in the throes of revolutionary change.
in chicago 1968 demonstrators climb on a statue in a chicago park during the 1968 democratic national convention protesting both the vietnam war and the harsh treatment they had received from mayor richard daley s chicago police.
dennis brack black star fact however the response of most americans to the turmoil was a conservative one.
the most visible sign of the conservative backlash was the surprising success of the campaign of the segregationist alabama governor george wallace for the presidency.
in 1964 he had run in a few democratic presidential primaries and had done surprisingly well even in several states outside the south.
in 1968 he became a third party candidate for president basing his campaign on a host of conservative grievances not all of them connected to race.
he denounced the forced busing of students the proliferation of government regulations and social programs and the permissiveness of authorities toward race riots and antiwar demonstrations.
there was never any serious chance that wallace would win the election but his standing in the polls at times rose to over 20 percent.
a more effective effort to mobilize the silent majority in favor of order and stability was under way within the republican party.

nixon might have won a more su stantia victory had it not been for the independent candidacy of governor george c a ace w o attracted many of the same conservative voters to whom nixon appealed.
how does the distribution of democratic and republicanltrenqth7n this election compare to that in 1960.
civil rights vietnam and the ordeal of liberalism 805 reemerged as the preeminent spokesman for what he called middle america nixon recognized that many americans were tired of hearing about their obligations to the poor tired of hearing about the sacrifices necessary to achieve racial jus tice tired of judicial reforms that seemed designed to help criminals.
by offering a vision of stability law and order government retrenchment and peace with honor in vietnam he easily captured the republican presidential nomination.
and after the spectacle of the democratic national convention he enjoyed a commanding lead in the polls as the november election approached.
that lead diminished greatly in the last weeks before the voting.
old doubts about nixons character continued to haunt the republican candidate.
a skillful last minute surge by hubert humphrey who managed to restore a tenuous unity to the democratic party narrowed the gap further.
and the wallace campaign appeared to be hurting the republicans more than the democrats.
in the end however nixon eked out a victory almost as narrow as his defeat in 1960.
he received 43 4 percent of the popular vote to humphreys 42 3 percent a margin of only about 800 000 votes and 301 electoral votes to humphreys 191.
george wallace who like most third party xt candidates faded in the last weeks of the nixon victorious campaign still managed to poll 12 9 percent of the popular vote and to carry five southern states with a total of 46 electoral ballots the best showing by a third party candidate since the 1920s.
nixon had not won a decisive personal mandate.
but the election made clear that a majority of the american electorate was more inter ested in restoring stability than in promoting social change.
looking back no decade of the twentieth century created more powerful and enduring images than the 1960s.
it began with the election and then the traumatic assassination of an attractive and energetic young president john kennedy who captured the imagination of millions and seemed to symbolize the rising idealism of the time.
it produced a dramatic period of political innovation christened the great society by president lyndon johnson which greatly expanded the size and functions of the federal government and its responsibility for the welfare of the nations citizens.
it saw the emergence of a sustained and enormously powerful civil rights movement that won a series of important legal victories including two civil rights acts that dismantled the jim crow system constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
the very spirit of dynamism and optimism that shaped the early 1960s also helped bring to the surface problems and grievances that had no easy solutions.
the civil rights movement ended legalized segregation and disenfranchisement but it also awakened expectations of social and economic equality that laws alone could not provide.
the peaceful interracial crusade of the early 1960s gradually turned into a much more militant confrontational and increasingly separatist movement toward the decades end.
the idealism among white youths that began the 1960s and played an important role in the political success of john kennedy evolved into an angry rebellion against many aspects of american culture and politics.
it produced a large upsurge of student protest that rocked the nation at the decades end.
perhaps most of all a small and largely unnoticed cold war commitment to defend south vietnam against communist aggression from the north led to a large and disastrous american military commitment that destroyed the presidency of lyndon johnson shook the faith of millions in their leaders and their political system sent thousands of young american men to their deaths and showed no signs of producing a victory.
a decade that began with high hopes and soaring ideals ended with ugly and at times violent division and deep disillusionment.

new values and assumptions were emerging to challenge traditional patterns of thought and behavior.
some americans welcomed the changes.
but others feared them viewing the new movements as a dangerous assault on the foundations of their society and culture.
they looked for a restoration of stability and a relegitimization of traditional centers of authority.
in richard nixon they found a man who seemed to match their mood.
a product of a hardworking middle class family he projected an image of stern dedication to traditional values.
yet the presidency of richard nixon far from returning calm and stability to american politics coincided with and helped to produce more years of crisis.
several crises were not wholly of nixon s making.
he had inherited both an unpopular war in vietnam and an economy that was beginning to weaken.
by the beginning of his second term the economy was reeling under rapidly rising energy prices and growing inflation.
one crisis at least was directly attributable to nixon and the people in his administration.
an obscure break in at the democratic national committee headquarters in washington d c in june 1972 hardly noticed at the time gradually expanded to create one of the most serious crises in the history of the presidency and the first such crisis to drive a president from office.
having won election by railing against crises of authority that threatened social stability nixon left office having created a major crisis of authority himself.
the youth culture perhaps most alarming to conservative americans in the 1960s and 1970s was a pattern of social and cultural protest that was emerging from younger americans who were giving vent to two related impulses.
one was the impulse originating with the political left to create a great new community of the people which would rise up to break the power of elites and force the nation to end the war pursue racial and economic justice and transform its political life.
the other liberation equally powerful impulse was the vision of liberation it found expression through the efforts of particular groups african americans native americans hispanics women gays and lesbians and others to define and assert themselves and make demands on the larger society.
it also found expression through the efforts of individuals to create a new culture that would allow them to escape from what they considered the dehumanizing pressures of what some called the modern technocracy the new left in retrospect it seems unsurprising that young americans became so assertive and powerful in american culture and politics in the 1960s.
the postwar baby boom generation the unprecedented number of people born in a few years just after world war ii was growing up.
by 1970 more than half the american population was under thirty years old more than 8 million americans eight times the number in 1950 were attending college.
this was the largest generation of youth in american history and it was coming to maturity in a time of unprecedented affluence oppor tunity and for many frustration.
one of the most visible results of the increasingly assertive youth movement was a radicaliza tion of many american college and university students who in the 1960s formed what became known as the new left a large diverse group of men and women energized by the polarizing sources of developments f their time.
the new left embraced the cause of african the new left americans and other minorities but its own ranks consisted overwhelmingly r white peple blacks and minorities formed political movements of their own.
some members of the new left were the children of radical parents members of the so called old left of the 1930s and 1940s.

relatively few members of the new left were communists but many were drawn to the writings of karl marx and of contemporary marxist theorists.
some came to revere third world marxists such as che guevara the south american revolutionary and guerrilla leader mao zedong and ho chi minh.
but the new left drew its inspiration above all from the civil rights movement in which many idealistic young white americans had become involved in the early 1960s.
in 1962 a group of students most of them from prestigious universities gathered in michigan to form an organization to give voice t0 their demands students for a democratic society sds.
their declara tion of beliefs the port huron statement expressed their disillusionment with the society they had inherited and their determination to build a new politics.
some members of sds moved into inner city neighborhoods and tried for a time without great success to mobilize poor working class people politically.
but most members of the new left were students and their radicalism centered in part on issues related to the modern university.
a 1964 dispute at the university of california at berkeley over the rights of students to engage in political activities on campus gained national attention.
the free speech movement as it movement cailed itself created turmoil at berkeley as students challenged campus police occupied administrative offices and produced a strike in which nearly three quarters of the berkeley students participated.
the immediate issue was the right of students to pass out literature and recruit volunteers for political causes on campus.
but the protest quickly became as well an expression of a basic critique of the university and the society it seemed to represent.
the revolt at berkeley was the first outburst of what was to be nearly a decade of campus turmoil.
students at berkeley and elsewhere protested the impersonal character of the modern university and they denounced the role of educational institutions in sustaining what they considered corrupt or immoral public policies.
the antiwar movement greatly inflamed the challenge and expanded it to the universities and beginning in 1968 campus demonstrations riots and building seizures became almost commonplace.
at columbia university in new york city students seized several buildings including the offices of the president and occupied them for days until local police forcibly and violently ejected them.
harvard university had a similar and even more violent experience a year later.
also in 1969 berkeley became the scene of perhaps the most prolonged and traumatic conflict of any american college campus in the 1960s a battle over the efforts of a few students to build a peoples park on a vacant lot the university planned to use to build a parking garage.
this seemingly minor event precipitated weeks of impassioned and often violent conflicts between the university administration which sought to evict the intruders from the land and the students many of whom supported the advocates of the park and who saw the universitys efforts to close it as a symbol of the struggle between liberation and oppression.
by the end of the peoples park battle which lasted for over a week the berkeley campus was completely polarized even students who had not initially supported or even noticed the pfopi f park peoples park the great majority were by the end committed to its defense 85 per cent of the 15 000 students voted in a referendum to leave the park alone.
student radicals were for the first time winning large audiences for their extravagant rhetoric linking university administrators the police and the larger political and economic system describing them all as part of one united oppressive force.
most campus radicals were rarely if ever violent except at times in their rhetoric.

rock in the late 1960s seemed simultaneously subversive and liberating.
that was partly because of the behavior and lifestyles of rock musicians whose appearance and behavior were often deliberately outrageous.
rock musicians were connected at times to the drug culture of the 1960s especially through the so called psychedelic rock groups inspired by experiences with the hallucinogen lsd.
they had links to mystical eastern religions most notably the beatles who had spent time in india studying transcendental meditation and who beginning in 1967 with their album sergeant pepper s lonelg hearts club band incorporated those themes into their music.
and they often reveled in flouting social conventions beginning with the rolling stones and culminating perhaps in the extreme and self destructive behavior of jimi hendrix jim morrison and janis joplin all of whom died very young of drug related causes.

new york daily news getty images defenders the new rock with its emphasis on emotional release was a healthy rebuke to the repressive norms of mainstream culture.
to them its virtues were symbolized by the great rock festival at woodstock new york in august 1969 where over 400 000 young people gathered on a remote piece of farmland for several days to hear performances by such artists as the who jimi hendrix the grateful dead janis joplin joe cocker the jefferson airplane and many others.
the festival was radicalism in mainstream culture was one of chaos and disorder based in part on the disruptive actions of small groups of militants among them the weathermen a violent offshoot of sds.
the weathermen were responsible for several cases of arson and bombing that destroyed campus buildings and claimed several lives.
not many people not even many students ever accepted the most radical political views that lay at the heart of the new left.
but many supported the position of sds and other groups on particular issues and above all on the vietnam war.
student activists tried to drive out training programs for military officers rotc and bar military 810 recruiters from college campuses.
they attacked the laboratories and corporations that were producing weapons for the war.
and between 1967 and 1969 they organized some of the largest political demonstrations in american history.

but woodstock remained peaceful friendly and harmonious there was rhapsodic talk at the time of how woodstock represented the birth of a new youth culture the woodstock nation critics of the new rock and the counterculture were not impressed with the idea of the woodstock nation.
to them the essence of the counterculture was a kind of numbing hopelessness and despair with a menacing and violent underside.
to them the appropriate symbol was not woodstock but another great rock concert which more than 300 000 people attended only four months after woodstock at the altamont speedway east of san francisco.
the concert featured many of the groups that had been at woodstock but the rolling stones who had organized the event were the main attraction.
as at woodstock drugs were plentiful and sexual exhibitionism was frequent.
but unlike woodstock altamont was far from peaceful.
instead it became ugly brutal and violent and resulted in the deaths of four people.
several of them died accidentally one for example from a bad drug trip during which he fell into a stream and drowned but numerous people were brutally beaten by members of the hell s angels motorcycle gang who had been hired by the rolling stones as security guards.
one man was beaten and stabbed to death in front of the stage while the stones were playing sympathy for the devil.
woodstock and altamont then became symbols of two aspects of the counterculture of the late 1960s and early 1970s and of the rock music that created its anthems.

small all helped thrust the issue of the war into the center of american politics.
closely related to opposition to the war was opposition to the military draft.
the gradual abolition of many traditional deferments for graduate students teachers husbands fathers and others swelled the ranks of those faced with conscription and thus of those likely to oppose it.
some draft age americans simply refused induction accepting what occasionally were long terms in jail as a result.
others fled to canada sweden and elsewhere where they were joined by deserters from the armed forces to escape conscription.
not until 1977 when president jimmy carter issued a general pardon to draft resisters and a limited amnesty for deserters did the vietnam exiles begin to return to the country in substantial numbers.
the counterculture closely related to the new left was a new youth culture openly scornful of the values and conventions of middle class society.
as if to display their contempt for conventional standards young americans flaunted long hair shabby hippies or fiam oyant clothing and a rebellious 811.
jimmy carter made a strenuous effort to bring a sense of informality to the presidency in contrast to the imperial style many people had complained about during the nixon years.
he began on his inauguration day when he and his family walked down pennsylvania avenue from the capitol to the white house instead of riding in the traditional limousines.

ten days later he emerged to deliver a remarkable television address.
it included a series of proposals for resolving the energy crisis.
but it was most notable for carters bleak assessment of the national condition.
speaking with unusual fervor he complained of a crisis of confidence that had struck at the very heart and soul of our national will the address became known as the malaise speech although carter himself had never used that word and it helped fuel charges that the president was trying to blame his inability to deal with the nations problems on the american people.
human rights and national interests among carters most frequent campaign promises was a pledge to build a new basis for american foreign policy one in which the defense of human rights would replace the pursuit of selfish interests carter spoke out sharply and often about violations of human rights in many countries including most prominently the soviet union.
beyond that general commitment the carter administration focused on several more traditional concerns.
carter completed negotiations begun several years earlier on a pair of treaties to turn over control of the panama canal to the government of panama.
after an acrimonious debate the senate ratified the treaties by 68 to 32 only one vote more than the necessary two thirds majority.
carters greatest achievement was his success in arranging a peace treaty between egypt and israel.
middle east negotia tions between egyptian president anwar sadat and israeli prime minister menachem begin had begun in 1977.
when those talks stalled carter invited sadat and begin to a summit conference at camp david in september 1978 and persuaded them to remain there for two weeks while he and others helped camp david mediate the disputes between them.
on accords september 17 carter announced agreement on a framework for an egyptian israeli peace treaty.
on march 26 1979 begin and sadat returned together to the white house to sign a formal peace treaty known as the camp david accords between their two nations.
in the meantime carter tried to improve relations with china and the soviet union and to complete a new arms agreement.
he responded eagerly to the overtures of deng xiaoping the new chinese leader who was attempting to open his nation to the outside world.
on december 15 1978 washington and beijing announced the resumption of formal diplomatic relations.
a few months later carter traveled to vienna to meet with the aging brezhnev to finish drafting the new salt ii arms control agreement.
the treaty set limits on the number of long range missiles bombers and nuclear warheads for both the united states and the ussr.
almost immediately however salt ii met with fierce conservative opposition in the united states.
the year of the hostages ever since the early 1950s the united states had provided political support and military assistance to the government of the shah of iran hoping to make his nation a bulwark against soviet expansion in the middle east.
by 1979 however many iranians iranian come to resent his autocratic rule.
at the revolution same time islamic clergies and much of the fiercely religious populace opposed his efforts to modernize and westernize a fundamentalist society.
that produced a powerful revolutionary movement.
in january 1979 the shah fled the country.
from the age of limits to the age of reagan 841 waiting for khomeini iranian women dressed in traditional islamic garb stand in a crowd in teheran waiting for a glimpse of the ayatollah khomeini the spiritual and eventually also political leader of the iranian revolution.
alain dejean sygma corbis the united states made cautious efforts in the first months after the shahs abdication to establish cordial relations with the militant regimes that followed.
by late 1979 however revolutionary chaos in iran was making any normal relations impossible.
what power there was resided with a zealous religious leader the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.
in late october 1979 the deposed shah arrived in new york to be treated for cancer.
days later on november 4 an armed group of militants invaded the american embassy in teheran seized the diplomats and military personnel inside and demanded the return of the shah to iran in exchange for their freedom.
fifty three americans remained hostages in the embassy for over a year.
only weeks after the hostage seizure on december 27 1979 soviet troops invaded afghanistan the mountainous islamic nation lying between the ussr and iran.
the soviet union had in fact been a power in afghanistan for years and the dominant force since april 1978 when a coup had established a marxist government there with close ties to the kremlin.
carter called it the gravest threat to world peace since world war ii and angrily imposed a series of economic sanctions on the russians canceled american participation in the 1980 summer olympic games in moscow and announced the withdrawal of salt ii from senate consideration.
the soviet invasion of afghanistan became a military quagmire and seriously weakened the soviet regime.
the combination of domestic economic troubles and inter carters national crises created widespread anxiety falling frustration and anger in the united states popularity damaging president carters already low standing with the public and giving added strength to an alternative political force that had already made great strides.
the rise of the new american right much of the anxiety in the 1970s was a result of public events that left many men and women shaken and uncertain about their leaders and their government.
but much of it was also a result of significant changes in americas economy society and culture.
together these changes provided the right with its most important opportunity in generations to seize a posi tion of authority in american life.
the mall 0h1lj id mdern mall is the direct descendant of an earlier retail innovation the automobile 1 oe oriented shopping center which strove to combine a number of different shops in a single structure with parking for customers.
the first modern shopping center the country club plaza opened in kansas city in 1924.
by the mid 1950s shopping centers ranging from small strips to large integrated complexes had proliferated throughout the country and were challenging traditional downtown shopping districts which suffered from lack of parking and from the movement of middle class residents to the suburbs in 1956 the first enclosed climate controlled shopping mall the southdale shopping center opened in minneapolis followed quickly by similar ventures in new york new jersey illinois north carolina and tennessee as the malls spread they grew larger and more elaborate.
by the 1970s vast regional malls were emerging tyson s corner in fairfax virginia roosevelt field on long island the galleria in houston and many others that drew customers from great distances and dazzled them not only with acres of varied retail space but also with restaurants movie theaters skating rinks bowling alleys hotels video arcades and large public spaces with fountains benches trees gardens and concert spaces.
the more needs you fulfill the longer people stay one developer observed.
malls had become self contained imitations of cities but in a setting from which many of the troubling and abrasive features of downtowns had been eliminated.
malls were insulated from the elements.
they were policed by private security forces who unlike real police could and usually did keep undesirable customers off the premises.
they were purged of bars pornography shops and unsavory businesses.
they were off limits to beggars vagrants the homeless and anyone else the managers considered unattractive to their customers malls set out to perfect urban space recasting the city as a protected controlled and socially homogeneous site attractive to and in many cases dominated by white middle class people.
some malls also sought to become community centers in sprawling suburban areas that had few real community spaces of their own.
a few malls built explicitly civic spaces meeting halls and conference shopping center northern virginia this small shopping center near washington d c was characteristic of the new strip malls that were emerging in the 1950s to serve suburban customers who traveled almost entirely by automobile.

some published their own newspapers.
many staged concerts plays and dances.
but civic activities had a difficult time competing with the principal attraction of the malls consumption.
malls were designed with women the principal consumers in most families mainly in mind.
i wouldn t know how to design a center for a man one architect said of the the sunbelt and its politics the most widely discussed demographic phenomenon of the 1970s was the rise of what became known as the sunbelt a term coined by the political analyst sunbel kevin phillips.
the sunbelt included the southeast including florida the southwest particularly texas and above all california which became the nation s most populous state surpassing new york in 1964.
by 1980 the population of the sunbelt had risen to exceed that of the older industrial regions of the north and the east.
the rise of the sunbelt helped produce a change in the political climate.
the strong populist traditions in the south and the west were capable of producing progressive politics.
but more often in the late twentieth century they produced a strong opposition to the growth of government and a resentment of the proliferating regulations and restrictions that the liberal state was producing.
many of those regulations and restrictions environmental laws land use restrictions even the 55 mile per hour speed limit created during the energy crisis to force motorists to conserve fuel affected the west more than any other region.
the so called sagebrush rebellion which emerged in parts of the west in the late 1970s mobilized conservative opposition to environmental laws and restrictions on development.
it sought to portray the west which had probably benefited more than any other region from federal investment as sagebrush rebellion a victim of government control.
its members complained about the large amounts of land the federal government owned in many western states and demanded that the land be opened for development.
some of the most conservative communities in america among them orange county in southern california were in suburban suburbs.
many suburbs insulated their res conservatism idents from contact with diverse groups through the relative homogeneity of the population through the transferring of retail and even work space into suburban office parks and shopping malls.
the politics of religion in the 1960s many social critics had predicted the extinction of religious influence in american life.
time magazine had reported such assumptions in 1966 with a celebrated and con troversial cover emblazoned with the question is god dead.

how did the shopping mall change suburban life.
are malls a unifying influence on social life.
in what ways are malls divisive.
originally malls were designed to cater largely to women especially mothers.
has the target audience for malls changed.
if so to whom do malls principally cater today.
complexes he built.
they catered to the concerns of mothers about their own and their children s safety and they offered products of particular interest to them.
male oriented stores mens clothing sporting goods hardware stores were much less visible in most malls than shops marketing women s and children s clothing jewelry lingerie and household goods.
malls also became important to teenagers who flocked to them in the way that earlier generations had flocked to street corners and squares in traditional downtowns.
the malls were places for teenagers to meet friends go to movies avoid parents hang out.
they were places to buy records clothes or personal items.
and they were places to work.
low paying retail jobs plentiful in malls were typical first working experiences for many teens.
the proliferation of malls has dismayed many people who see in them a threat to the sense of community in america.
by insulating people from the diversity and conflict of urban life critics argue malls divide groups from one another and erode the bonds that make it possible for those groups to understand one another.
but malls like the suburbs they usually serve also create a kind of community.
they are homogeneous and protected to be sure but they are also social gathering places in many areas where the alternative is not the rich diverse life of the downtown but the even more isolated experience of shopping in distant strips or through catalogs telephone and the internet.
evangelical christianity had been the but religion in america was far from dead.
indeed in the 1970s the united states experienced the beginning of a major religious revival perhaps the most powerful since the second great awakening of the early nineteenth century.
it continued in various forms into the early twenty first century.
some of the new religious enthusiasm found expression in the rise of various cults and pseudo faiths the church of scientology the unification church of the reverend sun myung moon even the tragic peoples temple whose members committed mass suicide in their jungle retreat in guyana in 1978.
but the most important impulse of the religious revival was the growth of evangelical christianity.
evangelicalism is the basis of many forms of christian faith but evangelicals have in common a belief in personal conversion being wborn again through direct communication with god.
evangelical religion dominant form of christianity in america through much of its history and a substantial subculture since the late nineteenth century.
in its modern form it became increasingly visible during the early 1950s when evangelicals such as billy graham and pentecostals such as oral roberts began to attract huge national and international followings for their energetic revivalism.
by the 1970s more than 70 million americans described themselves as born again christians men and women who had established a direct personal relationship with jesus christian evangelicals owned their own newspapers magazines radio stations television networks and later internet based forms of communication.
they operated their own schools and universities.
for some evangelicals christianity formed the basis for a commitment to racial and economic justice and to world peace.
for many other evangelicals the message of the new religion was very different but no less political.
they were alarmed by what they considered the spread of immorality and disorder in american life.
they feared the growth of feminism and the threat they believed it posed to the traditional family.
particularly alarming to them were supreme court decisions eliminating religious observance from schools and later the decision guaranteeing women the right to an abortion.
despite the historic antagonism between many evangelical protestants and the catholic church the growing politicization of religion in the 1970s and beyond brought some former rivals together.
catholics were the first major opponents of the supreme courts decision legalizing abortion in roe v wade 843 844.
chapter 31 pacific ocean growth of the sunbelt 1970 1990 one of the most important demographic changes of the last decades of the twentieth century was the shift of population out of traditional population centers in the northeast and midwest and toward the states of the so called sunbelt most notably the southwest and the pacific coast.
this map gives a dramatic illustration of the changing concentration of population between 1970 and 1990.
the orange brown states are those that lost population while the purple and blue states are those that made very significant gains 30 percent or more.
what was the impact of this population shift on the politics of the 1980s.
but evangelical protestants soon joined them in the battle.
the rapidly growing mormon church long isolated from both catholics and traditional protestants also became increasingly engaged with the political struggles of other faiths.
mormons were instrumental in the 1982 defeat of the equal rights amendment to the constitution which would have guaranteed women the same rights as men.
and they too supported the evangelical agenda of opposition to abortion and homosexuality.
the new right conservative christians were an important part but only a part of what became known as the new right a diverse but powerful coalition that enjoyed rapid growth in the 1970s and early 1980s.
its origins lay in part in the 1964 presidential election.
after republican senator barry goldwater s shattering defeat richard viguerie a conservative activist and organizer took a list of 12 000 contributors to the goldwater campaign and used it to begin a formidable conservative communications and fund raising organization.
beginning in the 1970s largely because of these and other organizational advances conservatives usually found themselves better funded and organized than their opponents.
by the late 1970s there were right wing think tanks consulting firms lobbyists foundations and schools.
another factor in the revival of the right was the emergence of a credible right wing leadership to replace the defeated con ronald servative hero barry goldwater.
ronald reagan reagan a well known film actor turned political activist became the hope of the right.
as a young man he had been a liberal and a fervent admirer of franklin roosevelt.
but he moved decisively to the right after his second marriage to nancy davis a woman of strong conservative convictions and after he became embroiled as president of the screen actors guild in battles with communists in the union.
in the early 1950s reagan became a corporate spokesman for general electric and won a wide following on the right from the age of limits to the age of reagan 845 with powerful speeches in defense of individual freedom and private enterprise.
in 1964 reagan delivered a memorable television speech on behalf of goldwater.
after goldwaters defeat he worked quickly to seize the leadership of the conservative wing of the republican party.
in 1966 with the support of a group of wealthy conservatives reagan won the first of two terms as governor of california.
the presidency of gerald ford also played an important role in the rise of the right by destroying the fragile equilibrium that had enabled the right wing and the moderate wing of the republican party to coexist.
ford touched on some of the rights rawest nerves.
he appointed as vice president nelson rockefeller the liberal republican governor of new york and an heir to one of americas great fortunes.
this appointment was offensive to many conservatives.
ford proposed an amnesty program for draft resisters embraced and even extended the nixon kissinger policies of detente presided over the fall of vietnam and agreed to cede the panama canal to panama.
when reagan challenged ford in the 1976 republican primaries the president survived barely only by dropping nelson rockefeller from the ticket and agreeing to a platform largely written by one of reagans allies.
the tax revolt equally important to the success of the new right was a new and potent conservative issue the tax revolt.
it had its public beginnings in 1978 when howard jarvis a conservative activist in california launched the first successful major citizens r tax revolt in california with proposition 13 j j a referendum question on the state ballot rolling back property tax rates.
similar antitax movements soon began in other states and eventually spread to national politics.
the tax revolt helped the right solve one of its biggest problems.
for more than thirty years after the new deal republican conservatives had struggled to halt and even reverse the growth of the federal government.
but attacking government programs directly as right wing politicians from robert taft to barry goldwater discovered was not often the way to attract majority support.
every federal program had a political constituency.
the biggest and most expensive programs social security medicare medicaid and others had the broadest support.
in proposition 13 and similar initiatives members of the right separated the issue of taxes from the issue of what taxes attacking supported.
that helped them achieve some taxes f most controversial elements of the conservative agenda eroding the governments ability to expand and launch new programs without openly antagonizing the millions of voters who supported specific programs.
virtually no one liked to pay taxes and as the economy weakened that resentment naturally rose.
the right exploited that resentment and in the process greatly expanded its constituency.
the campaign of 1980 by the time of the crises in iran and afghanistan jimmy carter was in political trouble his standing in popularity polls lower than that of any president in history.
senator edward kennedy younger brother of john and robert kennedy challenged him in the primaries.
and while carter managed to withstand the confrontation with kennedy and win his partys nomination he entered the fall campaign badly weakened.
the republican party in the meantime rallied enthusiastically behind ronald reagan.
he linked his campaign to the spreading tax revolt by promising substantial tax cuts.
equally important he called for restoration of american strength and pride reagan clearly benefited from the frustration at carters inability to resolve the iranian hostage crisis.
he benefited even more from the accumulated frustrations of more than a decade of domestic and international disappointments.
on election day 1980 the one year anniversary of the seizure of the hostages in iran reagan swept to victory winning 51 percent of the vote to 41 percent for jimmy carter and 7 percent for john anderson a moderate republican congressman from illinois who had mounted an 1980 election.
independent campaign.
carter carried only candidate party 8 ronald reagan 1 republican jimmy carter v democrat john b anderson independent other candidates libertarian popular vote 43 901 812 50 7 35 483 820 41 0 5 719 722 6 6 921 299 1 1 52 6 of electorate voting the election of 1980 although ronald reagan won only slightly more than half of the popular vote in the 1980 presidential election his electoral majority was overwhelming a reflection to a large degree of the deep unpopularity of president jimmy carter in 1980.
l v jof had made carter so unpopular.
846 chapter 31 five states and the district of columbia for a total of 49 electoral votes to reagans 489.
the republican party won control of the senate for the first time since 1952 53 republicans versus 46 democrats and the democrats retained a majority in the house by 277 to 158.
on the day of reagans inauguration the american hostages in iran were released after their 444 day ordeal.
the government of iran desperate for funds to support its floundering war against neighboring iraq had ordered the hostages freed in return for a release of billions in iranian assets that the carter administration had frozen in american banks.
the reagan revolution ronald reagan assumed the presidency in january 1981 promising a change in government more fundamental than any since the new deal of fifty years before.
he had only moderate success in redefining public policy.
but he succeeded brilliantly in making his own engaging personality the face of american politics in the 1980s.
the reagan coalition reagan owed his election to the widespread disillusionment with carter and to the crises and disappointments that many voters associated with him.
but he owed it as well to the emergence of a powerful coalition of conservative groups.
the reagan coalition included an influential group of wealthy americans associated with the corporate and financial world.
what united this group was their firm com corporate 1 elites mitment to capitalism and unfettered eco nomic growth a belief that the market offers the best solutions to most problems a deep hostility to most government interference in markets.
central to this groups agenda in the 1980s was opposition to what it considered the redistributive politics of the federal government especially its highly progressive tax structure and hostility to the rise of what it believed were antibusiness government regulations.
reagan courted these free market conservatives carefully and effectively.
a second element of the reagan coalition was even smaller but also disproportionately influential a group of intellectuals commonly known as neo conservatives a firm base among neo opinion leaders some of these people conservatives had once been liberals and before that socialists.
but during the turmoil of the 1960s they had become alarmed by what they considered to be the dangerous and destructive radicalism that they believed was destabilizing american life.
neo conservatives were sympathetic to the demands of capitalists but their principal concern was to reaffirm western democratic anticommunist values and commitments.
some neo conservative intellectuals went on to become important figures in the battle against multiculturalism and political correctness within academia.
populist conservatives these two groups joined in an uneasy alliance in 1980 with the populist new right.
but several things differentiated the new right from the corporate conservatives and the neo conservatives.
perhaps the most important was the new rights fundamental distrust of the eastern establishment a suspicion of its motives and goals a sense that it exercised a dangerous secret power in american life a fear of the hidden influence of such establishment institutions and people as the council on foreign relations the trilateral commission henry kissinger and the rockefellers.
these populist conservatives expressed the kinds of concerns that outsiders non elites have traditionally voiced in american society an opposition to centralized power and influence a fear of living in a world where distant hostile forces are controlling society and threatening individual freedom and community autonomy.
it was a testament to ronald reagans political skills and personal charm that he was able to generate enthusiastic support from these populist conservatives while appealing to elite conservative groups whose concerns were in some ways antithetical to those of the new right.
reagan in the white house even many people who disagreed with reagans policies found themselves drawn to his attractive and carefully honed public image.
reagan was a master of television a gifted public speaker and in public at least rugged fearless and seemingly impervious to danger or misfortune.
he turned seventy weeks after taking office and was the oldest man ever to serve as u s president.
but through most of his presidency he appeared to be vigorous resilient even youthful.
he spent his many vacations on a california ranch where he chopped wood and rode horses.
when he was wounded in an assassination attempt in 1981 he joked with doctors on his way into surgery and appeared to bounce back from the ordeal with remarkable speed.
reagan was not much involved in the day to day affairs of running the government he surrounded himself with tough energetic administrators who insulated him from many of the pressures of the office.
at times the president revealed a startling ignorance about the nature of his own policies.
instead he used the actions of his subordinates.
but reagan made active use of his office to support his administrations programs by fusing his proposals with a highly nationalistic rhetoric.
supply side economics reagans 1980 campaign for the presidency had promised to restore the economy to health by a bold experiment that reaganomics became known as supply side economics or to some reaganomics supply side economics operated from the assumption that the woes of the american economy were in large part a result of excessive taxation which left inadequate capital available to investors to stimulate growth.
the solution therefore was to reduce taxes with particularly generous benefits to corporations and wealthy individuals in order to encourage new investments.
because a from the age of limits to the age of reagan 847 federal budget and surplus deficit 1940 2010 in trillions of current dollars 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 gross national product 1940 2010 in trillions of current dollars 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 budget and surplus deficit as percent of gnp 1940 2010 tax cut would reduce government revenues at least at first it would also be necessary to reduce government expenses.
a goal of the reagan economic program was a significant reduction of the federal budget.
men and women whom reagan appointed fanned out through the executive branch of government reducing the role deregulation of 8overnment secretary of the interior james watt previously a major figure in the sagebrush rebellion opened up public lands and water to development.
the environmental protection agency before its directors were indicted for corruption relaxed or entirely eliminated enforcement of many environmental laws and regulations.
the civil rights division of the justice department eased enforcement of civil rights laws.
the department of transportation slowed implementation of new rules limiting automobile emissions and imposing new safety standards on cars and trucks.
by getting government out of the way reagan officials promised they were ensuring economic revival.
by early 1982 the nation had sunk into a severe recession.
unemployment reached 11 percent its highest level in over forty years.
but the economy recovered relatively rapidly.
by late 1983 unemployment had fallen to 8 2 percent and it declined steadily for several years after that.
the gross national product had grown 3 6 percent in a year the largest one year increase since the mid 1970s.
inflation had fallen below 5 percent.
the economy continued to grow and both inflation and unemployment remained low through most of the decade.
the fiscal crisis the economic revival did little at first to reduce federal budget deficits or to slow the growth in the national debt the debt the nation accumulates over time as a result of its annual deficits.
by the mid 1980s the sense of a national debt growing fiscal crisis had become one of the central issues in american politics.
having entered office promising a balanced budget within four years reagan had record budget deficits and accumulated more debt in his eight years in office than the american government had accumulated in its entire previous history.
the enormous deficits had many causes some of them stretching back over decades of american welfare public policy decisions.
in particular the benefits cut budget suffered from enormous increases federal budget surplus deficit 1940 2010 these charts help illustrate why the pattern of federal deficits seemed so alarming to americans in the 1980s and also why those deficits proved much less damaging to the economy than many economists had predicted.
the upper chart shows a dramatic increase in the federal budget from the mid 1960s on.
it shows as well a corresponding and also dramatic increase in the size of federal deficits.
gross national product gnp also increased dramatically especially in the 1980s and 1990s as the middle chart shows.
when the federal budgets and deficits of these years shown in the bottom chart are calculated not in absolute numbers but as a percentage of gnp they seem much more stable and much less alarming.
after 2000 these deficits rose significantly and became a much larger percentage of gnp.
what factors contributed to the increasing deficits of the 1980s.
how were those deficits eliminated in the 1990s.
848 chapter 31 poverty in america the american poverty rate declined sharply beginning in the 1950s and reached a historic low in the late 1970s.
but the dramatic increase in income and wealth inequality that began in the mid 1970s gradually pushed the poverty rate upward again.
by the mid 1980s the poverty rate was approaching 15 percent the highest in twenty years.
in the image above a group of children huddle against a barrier at an emergency center for homeless families in new york city in 1987.
richard falco blackstar in the costs of entitlement programs especially social security medicare and medicaid a result of the aging of the population and dramatic increases in the cost of health care.
but some of the causes of the deficit lay in the policies of the reagan administration.
the 1981 tax cuts the largest in american history to that point contributed to the deficit.
the massive increase in military spending by the reagan administration added much more to the federal budget than its cuts in domestic spending removed.
reagan and the world reagan encountered a similar combination of triumphs and difficulties in international affairs.
determined to restore american pride and prestige in the world he argued that the united states should once again become active and assertive in opposing communism and in supporting friendly governments whatever their internal policies.
relations with the soviet union which had been steadily deteriorating in the last years of the carter administration grew still more chilly in the first years of the reagan presidency.
the president spoke harshly of the soviet regime which he once called the evil empire accusing it of sponsoring world terrorism and declaring that any armaments negotiations must be linked to negotiations on soviet behavior in other areas.
although the president had long denounced the salt ii arms control treaty as unfavorable to the united states he continued to honor its provisions.
but reagan remained skeptical about arms control.
in fact the president proposed the sdi most arr bitious new military program in many years the strategic defense initiative sdi known to some as star wars reagan claimed that sdi through lasers and satellites could provide an effective shield against incoming missiles and thus make nuclear war obsolete.
the soviet union claimed that the new program would elevate the arms race to new and more dangerous levels and insisted that any arms control agreement begin with an american abandonment of sdi.
the escalation of cold war tensions and the slowing of arms control initiatives helped produce an important popular movement in europe and the united states in the 1980s calling for an end to nuclear weapons buildups.
in america the principal goal from the age of limits to the age of reagan 849 contras on patrol the reagan administration s support for the nicaraguan contras who opposed the leftist sandinista regime was the source of some of its greatest problems.
here a small band of contras pause in the nicaraguan jungle to catch their breath.
the machine gunner carries an m 60 american weapon.
steven clevenger corbis reagan doctrine of the movement was a nuclear freeze an agreement between the two superpowers not to expand their atomic arsenals.
the reagan administration supported opponents of communism anywhere in the world whether or not they had any direct connection to the soviet union.
this new policy became known as the reagan doctrine and it meant a new american activism in the third world.
in october 1982 the administration sent american soldiers and marines into the tiny caribbean island of grenada to oust an anti american marxist regime that showed signs of a relationship with moscow.
in nicaragua a pro american dictatorship had fallen to the revolutionary sandinistas in 1979 the new government had grown increasingly anti american and increasingly marxist throughout the early 1980s.
the reagan administration supported the so called contras a guerrilla movement drawn from several antigovernment groups and trying to topple the sandinista regime.
in june 1982 the israeli army launched an invasion of lebanon in an effort to drive guerrillas of the palestinian liberation organization from the country.
an american peacekeeping force entered beirut to supervise the evacuation of plo forces from lebanon.
american marines then remained in the city to protect the fragile lebanese government.
as a result americans became the targets in 1983 of a terrorist bombing of a u s military barracks in beirut that left 241 marines dead.
rather than become more deeply involved in the lebanese struggle reagan withdrew american forces.
the tragedy in lebanon was an example of the changing character of third world struggles an increasing reliance on terrorism by otherwise powerless groups to advance their political aims.
a series of terrorist acts in the 1980s attacks on terrorism airplanes cruise ships commercial and diplomatic posts the seizing of american and other western hostages alarmed and frightened much of the western world.
the election of 1984 reagan approached the campaign of 1984 at the head of a united republican party firmly committed to his candidacy.
the democrats followed a more fractious course.
former vice president walter mondale the early front runner fought off challenges from senator gary hart of colorado and the magnetic jesse jackson who had established himself as the nations most prominent spokesman for minorities and the poor.
mondale brought excitement to the democratic campaign by selecting a woman representative geraldine ferraro of new york to be his running mate and the first female candidate to appear on a national ticket.
in the campaign that fall reagan spoke of what he claimed was the remarkable revival of american fortunes and spirits under his leadership.
his campaign emphasized such phrases as its morning in america and america is back reagans victory in 1984 was decisive.
he won approximately 59 percent of the vote and carried every state but mondales native minnesota and the district of columbia.
but reagan was stronger than his party.
democrats gained a seat in the senate and maintained only slightly reduced control of the house of representatives 850 chapter 31 53 3 of electorate voting the election of 1984 in 1984 ronald reagan repeated and slightly expanded his electoral landslide of 1980 and added to it the popular landslide that had eluded him four years earlier.
as this map shows mondale succeeded in carrying only his home state of minnesota and the staunchly democratic district of columbia.
what were some of the factors that made reagan so popular in 1984.
america and the waning of the cold war many factors contributed to the collapse of the soviet empire.
the long stalemated war in afghanistan proved at least as disastrous to the soviet union as the vietnam war had been to america.
the government in moscow had failed to address a long term economic decline in the soviet republics and the eastern bloc nations.
restiveness with the heavy handed policies of communist police states was growing throughout much of the soviet empire.
but the most visible factor at the time was the emergence of mikhail gorbachev who succeeded to the leadership of the soviet union in 1985 and to the surprise of almost everyone very quickly became the most revolutionary figure in world politics in several decades.
the fall of the soviet union tiananmen square rigid and unproductive soviet economy by introducing such elements of capitalism as private ownership and the profit motive.
the severe economic problems at home evidently convinced gorbachev that the soviet union could no longer sustain its extended commitments around the world.
as early as 1987 he began reducing soviet influence in eastern europe.
and in 1989 in the space of a few months every communist state in europe poland hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria romania east germany yugoslavia and albania either overthrew its government or forced it to transform itself into a noncommunist and in some cases actively anticommunist regime.

early in 1990 the government of south africa long an international pariah for its rigid enforcement of apartheid a system designed to protect white supremacy began a cautious retreat from its traditional policies.
it legalized the chief black party in the nation the african national congress anc which had been banned for decades.
on february 11 1990 it released from prison the leader of the anc and a revered hero to black south africans nelson mandela.
he had been in jail for twenty seven years.
over the next several years the south african government repealed its apartheid laws.
and in 1994 after national elections in which all south africans could participate nelson mandela became the first black president of south africa.
in 1991 communism began to collapse at the site of its birth the soviet union.
an unsuccessful coup by hard line soviet leaders on august 19 precipitated a dramatic unraveling of dissolution communist power.
within days the coup of the ussr itself collapsed in the face of resistance from the public and more important crucial elements within the military.
mikhail gorbachev returned to power but it soon became evident that the legitimacy of both the communist party and the central soviet government had been fatally injured.
by the end of august many of the republics of the soviet union had declared independence the soviet government was clearly powerless to stop the fragmentation.
gorbachev resigned as leader of the now virtually powerless communist party and soviet government and the soviet union ceased to exist.
reagan and gorbachev reagan was skeptical when gorbachev took power in 1985 but he gradually became convinced that the soviet leader was sincere in his desire for reform.
at a summit meeting with reagan in reykjavik iceland in 1986 gorbachev proposed gorbachev transformed soviet politics with two dramatic new initiatives.
the first he called glasnost openness the dismantling mikhail man t ie repressive mechanisms that gorbachev had been conspicuous features of soviet life for over half a century.
the other policy gorbachev called perestroika reform an effort to restructure the from the age of limits to the age of reagan 851 the fall of the berlin wall the berlin wall is widely considered to have fallen on november 9 1989.

at about the same time gorbachev ended the soviet unions long and frustrating military involvement in afghanistan.
the fading of the reagan revolution for a time the dramatic changes around the world and reagans personal popularity deflected attention from a series of political scandals.
there were revelations of illegality corruption and savings and ethical lapses in the environmental loan crisis protection agency the cia the department of defense the department of labor the department of justice and the department of housing and urban development.
a more serious scandal emerged within the savings and loan industry which the reagan administration had helped deregulate in the early 1980s.
but the most politically damaging scandal of the reagan years came to light in november 1986 when the white house conceded that it had sold weapons to the revolutionary government of iran as part of a largely unsuccessful effort to secure the release of several americans being held hostage by radical islamic groups in the middle east.
even more damaging was the revelation that some of the money from the arms deal with iran had been covertly and illegally funneled into a fund to aid the contras in nicaragua.
in the months that followed aggressive reporting and congressional hearings exposed a widespread pattern of illegal iran contra scandal covert activities orchestrated by the white house and dedicated to advancing the administrations foreign policy aims.
the iran contra scandal as it became known did serious damage to the reagan presidency.
the election of 1988 the fraying of the reagan administration helped the democrats regain control of the u s senate in 1986 and fueled hopes for a presidential victory in 1988.
even so several of the most popular figures in the democratic party refused to run and the nomination finally went to a previously little known figure michael dukakis a three term democratic governor of massachusetts.
dukakis was a flat and somewhat dull campaigner.
but democrats were optimistic about their prospects in 1988 largely because their opponent vice president george h w bush had failed to spark public enthusiasm.
beginning at the republican convention however bush staged a remarkable turnaround by making his campaign a long relentless attack on dukakis tying him to all the unpopular social and cultural stances americans had come to identify with liberals the campaign revealed the new political aggressiveness of the republican right.
bush won a substantial victory in november 54 percent of the popular vote to dukakiss 46 percent and 426 electoral votes to dukakiss 112.
but the democrats retained secure majorities in both houses of congress.
the first bush presidency the broad popularity george h w bush enjoyed during his first three years in office was partly a result of his subdued unthreatening public image.

what made it so difficult for a democrat to challenge the republicans in 1988 after eight years of a republican administration.
the wonder and excitement with which americans viewed the dramatic events in the rest of the world.
bush moved cautiously at first in dealing with the changes in the soviet union.
but like reagan he eventually cooperated with gorbachev and reached a series of significant agreements with the soviet union in its waning years.
the united states and the soviet union moved rapidly toward even more far reaching arms reduction agreements.
on domestic issues the bush administration was less successful.
his administration inherited a heavy burden of debt political an a e era deficit that had been growing gridlock for nearty a decade.
the president s pledges to reduce the deficit and simultaneously to promise no new taxes were in conflict with one another.
bush faced a democratic congress with an agenda very differ ent from his own.
the congress and the white house managed on occasion to agree on significant measures.
they cooperated in producing the plan to salvage the floundering savings and loan industry.
in 1990 the president bowed to congressional pressure and agreed to a significant tax increase as part of a multiyear budget package designed to reduce the deficit thus violating his own 1988 campaign pledge.
but the most serious domestic problem facing the bush administration was one for which neither the president nor congress had any answer a recession that began late in 1990 the bush campaign 1988 vice president george bush had never been an effective campaigner but in 1988 he revived his candidacy with an unabashed attack on his opponent s values and patriotism.
bush missed no chance to surround himself with patriotic symbols including this red white and blue hot air balloon in kentucky.
photo by cynthia johnson time life pictures getty images 1990 recession and slowly increased its grip on the national economy in 1991 and 1992.
because of the enormous level of debt that corporations and individuals had accumulated in the 1980s the recession caused an unusual number of bankruptcies.
it also increased fear and frustration among middle and working class americans and put pressure on the government to address such problems as the rising cost of health care.
the first gulf war the collapse of the soviet union in 1989 1991 had left the united states in the unanticipated position of being the only real superpower in the world.
one result was that the united states would reduce its military strength and concentrate its energies and resources on pressing domestic problems.
another was that america would continue to use its power actively not to fight communism but to defend its regional from the age of limits to the age of reagan.

on august 2 1990 the armed forces of iraq invaded and invasion of quickly overwhelmed their small oil rich kuwait neighbor the emirate of kuwait.
saddam hussein the militaristic leader of iraq soon announced that he was annexing kuwait and set out to entrench his forces there.
after some initial indecision the bush administration agreed to lead other nations in a campaign to force iraq out of kuwait through the pressure of economic sanctions if possible through military force if necessary.
within a few weeks bush had persuaded virtually every important government in the world including the soviet union and almost all the arab and islamic states to join in a united nations sanctioned trade embargo of iraq.
at the same time the united states and its allies including the british french egyptians and saudis began deploying a large military force along the border between kuwait and saudi arabia a force that ultimately reached 690 000 troops 425 000 of them american.
on november 29 the united nations at the request of the united states voted to authorize military action to expel iraq from kuwait if iraq did not leave by january 15 1991.
on january 12 both houses of congress voted to authorize the use of force against iraq.
and on january 16 american and allied air forces began a massive bombardment of iraqi forces in kuwait and of military and industrial installations in iraq itself.
the allied bombing continued for six weeks.
on february 23 allied primarily american forces under the command of general norman schwarzkopf began a major ground offensive not primarily against the heavily entrenched iraqi forces along the kuwait border as expected but to the north of them into iraq itself.
the allied armies encountered almost no resistance and suffered relatively few casualties 141 fatalities.
estimates of iraqi deaths in the war were 100 000 or more.
on february 28 iraq announced its acceptance of allied terms for a cease fire and the brief persian gulf war came to an end.
the quick and for america relatively painless victory over iraq was highly popular in the united states.
but the tyrannical regime of saddam hussein survived weakened but still ruthless.
the gulf war preserved an independent nation and kept an important source of oil from falling into the hands of iraq.
but many muslims watching americans attacking their fellow religionists became incensed by the u s presence in the region.
the most conservative and militant muslims were insulted by the presence of women in the united nations forces.
but even more moderate middle east muslims began to believe that america was a threat to their world.
even before the gulf war middle eastern terrorists had been targeting americans in the region.
their determination to threaten america grew significantly in its aftermath.
the election of 1992 president bush s popularity reached a record high in the immediate aftermath of the gulf war.
but the glow of that victory faded quickly as the recession worsened in late 1991 and as the administration declined to propose any policies for combating it.
because the early maneuvering for the 1992 presidential election occurred when president bush s popularity remained high many leading democrats declined to run.
that gave 854 chapter 31 the election of 1992 in the 1992 election for the first time since 1976 a democrat captured the white house.
and although the third party candidacy of ross perot deprived bill clinton of an absolute majority he nevertheless defeated george bush by a decisive margin in both the popular and electoral vote.
what factors had eroded president bush s once broad popularity by 1992.
what explained the strong showing of ross perot.

he went on to run a skillful campaign.
complicating the campaign was the emergence of ross perot a blunt forthright texas billionaire who became an inde ross perot pendent candidate by tapping popular resentment of the federal bureaucracy and by promising tough uncompromising leadership to deal with the fiscal crisis.
at several moments in the spring perot led both bush and clinton in public opinion polls.
in july as perot looking back america in the late 1970s and 1980s was by the standards of its own recent history an unusually troubled nation numbed by the watergate scandals the fall of vietnam and perhaps most of all the nations increasing economic difficulties.
the difficult presidencies of gerald ford and jimmy carter provided little relief from these accumulating problems and anxieties.
indeed in the last year of the carter presidency the nations prospects seemed particularly grim in light of severe economic problems a traumatic seizure of american hostages in iran and a soviet invasion of afghanistan.
reagans first term was a dramatic contrast to the trou bled presidencies that had preceded it.
he won substantial began to face hostile scrutiny from the media he abruptly withdrew from the race.
but early in october he reentered and soon regained much although never all of his early support.
clinton won a clear but hardly overwhelming victory over bush and perot.
he received 43 percent of the vote in the three way race to the presidents 38 percent and perots 19 percent the best showing for a third party or independent candidate since theodore roosevelt in 1912.
clinton won 370 electoral votes to bushs 168 perot won none.

perhaps equally important he made his own engaging personality one of the central political forces in national life.
easily reelected in 1984 he seemed to have solidified the conservative grip on national political life.
in his second term a series of scandals and misadventures and the presidents own declining energy limited the administrations effectiveness.
nevertheless reagans personal popularity remained high and the economy continued to prosper factors that helped his vice president george h w bush to succeed him in 1989.
from the age of limits to the age of reagan 855 bush s presidency was defined not by domestic initiatives as reagans had been but by international affairs.
the perception of bushs disengagement with the nations growing economic problems contributed to his defeat in 1992.
but a colossal historic event overshadowed domestic concerns during much of bushs term in office the collapse of the soviet union and the fall of communist regimes all over europe and in other parts of the world.
the united states was to some degree a dazzled observer of this process.
but the end of the cold war also propelled the united states into the possession of unchallenged global preeminence and drew it increasingly into the role of international arbiter and peacemaker.
the gulf war of 1991 was only the most dramatic example of the new global role the united states would now increasingly assume.

the collision created a huge explosion and an intense fire.
less than half an hour later as thousands of workers fled the burning building a commercial airliner crashed into the companion tower creating a second fireball.
within an hour after that the burning floors of both towers gave way and fell onto the floors below them pulling one of new yorks and america s most famous symbols to the ground.
at about the same time in washington d c another commercial airliner crashed into a side of the pentagon the headquarters of the nations military turning part of the building s facade into rubble.
and several hundred miles away still another airplane crashed in a field not far from pittsburgh these four almost simultaneous catastrophes caused the deaths of nearly 3 000 people.
the attacks of september 11 2001 seemed to many americans at the time to change everything to alter fundamentally how they thought about the world and to change decisively the way americans would have to live.
in fact most aspects of life in the united states quickly returned to their norma patterns.
and in many ways september 11 rather than being an aberration in american life was an example of one of the most important realities of the age.
the united states more than at any other time in its history was becoming deeply entwined in a new age of globalism an age that combined great promise with great peril.
a resurgence of partisanship bill clinton took the oath of office in january 1993 with a domestic agenda more ambitious than that of any other president in nearly thirty years.
but having won the votes of well under half the electorate he had no powerful mandate.
the republican leadership in congress was highly adversarial and opposed the president with unusual unanimity on many issues.
a tendency toward reckless personal behavior both before and during his presidency caused clinton continuing problems and gave his many enemies repeated opportunities to discredit him.
william jefferson clinton launching the clinton presidency the clinton administration encountered many missteps and misfortunes in its first months.
several of his early appointments became so controversial he had to withdraw them.
despite its many problems the clinton administration could boast of some major achievements in its first year.
the president narrowly won approval of a budget that marked a significant turn away from the policies of the reagan bush years.
it included a substantial tax increase on the wealthiest americans a large reduction in many areas of government spending and a major expansion of tax credits to low income working people.
clinton was a committed advocate of free trade and a proponent of many aspects of what came to be known as globalism.
he made that clear through his strong support of a series of new and con nafta troversial free trade agreements.
after a long and difficult battle he won approval nafta nofth american free trade agreement or nafta which eliminated most trade barriers among the united states canada and mexico.
later he won approval of other far reaching trade agreements negotiated in the general agreement on trade and tariffs or gatt.
the presidents most ambitious initiative was a major reform of the nation s health care system.
early in 1993 he appointed a task force chaired by his wife hillary rodham clinton.
he proposed a sweeping reform designed to guarantee coverage to every american and hold down the costs of medical care.
substantial opposition from the right doomed the plan in 1994.
the foreign policy of the clinton administration was not without some successes.

also central to the counterculture as it became known were drugs marijuana which after 1966 became almost as common a youthful diversion as beer and the less widespread but still substantial use of other more potent hallucinogens such as lsd.
there was also a new more permissive view of sexual behavior the beginnings of what came to be known as a sexual revolution to some degree the emergence of relaxed approaches to sexuality was a result less of the counterculture than of the new accessibility of effective contraceptives most notably the birth control pill and after 1973 legalized abortion.
but the new sexuality also reflected the counterculture s belief that individuals should strive for release from inhibitions and give vent to their instincts and desires.
the counterculture challenged the structure of modern american society attacking its banality hollowness artificiality materialism and isolation from nature.
the most committed haight adherents of the counterculture the hip ashbury pies wh came to dominate the haight ashbury neighborhood of san francisco and other places and the social dropouts some of whom retreated to rural communes rejected modern society and attempted to find refuge in a simpler more natural existence.

the use of marijuana the freer attitudes toward sex the iconoclastic and sometimes obscene language all spread far beyond the realm of the true devotees of the counterculture.
perhaps the most pervasive element of the new youth society was one that even the least radical members of the generation embraced rock music.
rock n roll drawn in part from african american music first achieved wide popularity in the 1950s on the strength of such early performers as buddy holly and above all elvis presley.
early in the 1960s its influence spread largely as a result of the phenomenal popularity of the growing beatles the english group whose first visit influence of the united states in 1964 created a rock n roll remarkable sensation beatlemania for a time most rock musicians like most popu lar musicians before them concentrated largely on uncontro versial romantic themes.
by the late 1960s however rock had begun to reflect many of the new iconoclastic values of its time.
the beatles for example abandoned their once simple and seemingly innocent style for a new experimental even mystical approach that reflected the growing popular fascination with drugs and eastern religions.
other groups such as the rolling stones turned even more openly to themes of anger frustration and rebelliousness.

the mobilization of minorities the growth of african american protest the new left and the counterculture encouraged other minorities to assert themselves and demand redress of their grievances.
for native americans hispanic americans gay men and women and minorities the late 1960s and the 1970s were a time of growing self expression and political activism.
seeds of indian militancy tew minorities had deeper or more justifiable grievances against the prevailing culture than american indians or native americans as some began to call themselves in the 1960s.
indians were the least prosperous least healthy and least stable group in the nation.
they were also one of the smallest native constituting less than 1 percent of the pop american ulation.
average annual family income for grievances indians was 1 000 less than that for blacks.
the native american unemployment rate was ten times the national rate.
joblessness was particularly high on the reservations where nearly half the indians lived.
but even most indians living in cities suffered from their limited education and training and could find only menial jobs.
life expectancy among indians was some twenty years less than the national average.
suicides among indian youths were a hundred times more frequent than among white youths.
and while black americans attracted the attention for good or for ill of many whites indians for many years remained largely ignored.
for much of the postwar era particularly after the resignation of john collier as commissioner of indian affairs in 1946 federal policy toward the tribes moved toward incorporating indians into mainstream american society.
this policy was similar to failed assimilation efforts in the late nineteenth century.
two laws passed in 1953 established what became known as termination through termination 814.
chapter 30 aboriginal territories and modern reservations of western indian tribes this map shows the rough distribution of the native american population in the western united states before the establishment of reservations by the federal government in the nineteenth century.
the large shaded regions in colors other than purple represent the areas in which the various tribes were dominant a century and more ago.
the purple shaded areas show the much smaller areas set aside for them as reservations after the indian wars of the late nineteenth century.
what impact did life on the reservations have on the rise of indian activism in the 1960s and 1970s.
the federal government withdrew all official recognition of the tribes as legal entities administratively separate from state governments and made them subject to the same local jurisdictions as white residents.
at the same time the government encouraged indians to assimilate into the larger society and worked to funnel native americans into cities where presumably they would adapt to the white world and lose their cultural distinctiveness.
to some degree the termination and assimilation policies achieved their objectives.
the tribes grew weaker and many native americans adapted to life in the cities became less able to fend off white influence.
on the whole however the new failure of policies were a disaster for the tribes and a termination failure for the reformers who had promoted them.
termination led to widespread corruption and abuse.
and indians fought so bitterly against it the crisis of authority 815 the occupation of alcatraz alcatraz an island in san francisco bay once housed a large federal prison that by the late 1960s had been abandoned.
in 1969 a group of indian activists occupied the island and claimed it as indian land precipitating a long standoff with authorities.
ap images that in 1958 the eisenhower administration barred further terminations without the consent of the affected tribes.
in the meantime the struggle against termination had mobilized a new generation of indian militants and had breathed life into the principal native american organization the national congress of american indians ncai created in 1944.
the new militancy also benefited from the rapid increase in the indian population which was growing much faster than that of the rest of the nation nearly doubling between 1950 and 1970 to a total of about 800 000.
the indian civil rights movement in 1961 more than 400 members of 67 tribes gathered in chicago to discuss ways of bringing all indians together in an effort to redress common wrongs.
the manifesto they issued the declaration of indian purpose stressed the right to choose our own way of life one result of the movement was a gradual change in the way popular culture depicted indians.
by the 1970s almost no films or television westerns any longer portrayed indians as brutal savages attacking peaceful white people.
and indian activists even persuaded some white institutions to abandon what they considered demeaning references to them dartmouth college for example ceased referring to its athletic teams as the indians in 1968 a group aim f yun8 militant indians established the american indian movement aim which drew its greatest support from those indians who lived in urban areas but soon established a significant presence on the reservations as well.
the new activism had some immediate political results.
in 1968 congress passed the indian civil rights act which recognized the legitimacy of tribal laws within the reserva tions.
but leaders of aim and other insurgent groups were not satisfied and turned increasingly to direct action.
in 1968 indian fishermen clashed with washington state officials on the columbia river and in puget sound where indians claimed that treaties gave them the exclusive right to fish.
the following year members of several tribes made a symbolic protest by occupying the abandoned federal prison on alcatraz island in san francisco bay and claiming the site by right of discovery in response to the growing pressure the nixon administration appointed a mohawk sioux to the position of commissioner of indian affairs in 1969 and in 1970 the president promised both increased tribal self determination and an increase in federal aid.
but the protests continued.
in november 1972 nearly a thousand demonstrators most of them sioux forcibly occupied the building of the bureau of indian affairs in washington d c for six days.
a more celebrated protest occurred in february 1973 at wounded knee south dakota the site of the 1890 massacre of sioux by federal troops.
members of aim seized and occupied the town of wounded knee for two months demanding radical changes in the administration of the reserva tion and insisting that the government honor its long forgotten treaty obligations.
a brief clash between the occupiers and federal forces left one indian dead and another wounded.
more immediately effective than these militant protests were the victories that various tribes were achieving in the federal courts.
in united states v wheeler 1978 the supreme court confirmed that tribes had independent legal standing and could not be terminated by congress.
other decisions ratified the authority of tribes to impose taxes on businesses within their reservations and to perform other sovereign functions.
in 1985 the u s supreme court in county of oneida v oneida indian nation supported indian claims to 100 000 acres in upstate new york that the oneida tribe claimed by virtue of treaty rights long forgotten by whites.
occupation of wounded knee 816 chapter 30 the indian civil rights movement like other civil rights movements of the same time fell far short of winning full justice and equality for its constituents.
to some indians the principal goal was to defend tribal autonomy to protect the right of indians and more to the point individual tribal groups to remain separate and distinct.
to others the goal was equality to win for indians a place in society equal to that of other groups of americans.
because there was no single indian culture or tradition in america the movement never united all indians.
important legal victories for all its limits however the indian civil rights movement helped the tribes win a series of new legal rights and protections that gave them a stronger position than they had enjoyed at any previous time in the twentieth century.
latino activism far more numerous than indians were latinos or hispanic americans the fastest growing minority group in the united states.
they were no more a single cohesive group than the indians were.
some including the descendants of early spanish settlers in new mexico had roots as deep in american history as those of any other group.
others were men and women who had immigrated since world war ii.
large numbers of puerto ricans had migrated to eastern cities particularly new york city.
south florida s substantial cuban population began with a wave of middle class refugees fleeing the castro regime in the early 1960s followed by a second much poorer wave of cuban immigrants in 1980 the so called marielitos named for the port from which they left cuba.
later in the 1980s large numbers of immigrants both legal and illegal began to arrive from the troubled nations of central and south america from guatemala nicaragua el salvador peru and others.
but the most numerous and important latino group in the united states was mexican americans.
during world war ii large numbers of mexican americans had entered the country in response to the labor shortage and many had remained in the cities of the southwest and the pacific coast.
after the war when the legal agreements that had allowed mexican contract workers to enter the country expired large numbers of immigrants continued to move to the united states illegally.
in 1953 the government launched what it called operation wetback to deport the illegals but the effort failed to stem the flow of new arrivals.
by 1960 there were substantial mexican american neighborhoods barrios in american cities from el paso to detroit.
the largest with more than 500 000 people according to census figures was in los angeles which had a bigger mexican population than any other place except mexico city.
but the greatest expansion in the mexican american popu lation was yet to come.
in 1960 the census reported slightly more than 3 million latinos living in the united states the surging latino immigration great majority of them mexican americans.
by 1970 that number had grown to 9 million and by 2009 to 48 million.
since there was also an uncounted but very large number of illegal immigrants in those years the real number was undoubtedly larger.
by the late 1960s mexican americans were one of the largest population groups in the west outnumbering african americans and had established communities in most other parts of the nation as well.
they were also among the most urbanized groups in the population almost 90 percent lived and worked in cities.
many of them particularly members of the older and more assimilated families of mexican descent were affluent and successful.
wealthy cubans in miami filled influential positions in the professions and local government in the southwest mexican americans elected their own leaders to seats in congress and to governorships.
but most newly arrived mexican americans and other hispanics were less well educated than either anglo or african americans and hence less well prepared for high paying jobs.
some of them found good industrial jobs in unionized industries and some mexican americans became important labor organizers in the afl cio.
but many more including most illegal immigrants worked in low paying service jobs with few if any benefits and no job security.
partly because of language barriers partly because the family centered culture of many latino communities discouraged effective organization and partly because of discriminate tion mexican americans and other chicano.
activism hispanics were slower to develop political 1 influence than other minorities.
but some did respond to the highly charged climate of the 1960s by strengthening their ethnic identification and organizing for political and economic power.
young mexican american activists began to call themselves chicanos once a term of derision used by whites as a way of emphasizing the shared culture of spanish speaking americans.
some chicanos advocated a form of nationalism not unlike the ideas of black power advocates.
the texas leaders of la raza unida a chicano political party in the southwest called for the creation of an autonomous mexican american state within a state it demonstrated significant strength at the polls in the 1970s.
one of the most visible efforts to organize mexican americans occurred in california where an arizona born latino farmworker cesar chavez created an effective union of itinerant farmworkers.
in 1965 his united farm workers ufw a largely mexican american organization launched cesar chavez a prolonged strike against growers to demand recognition of their union and increased wages and benefits.
when employers resisted chavez enlisted the cooperation of college students churches and civil rights groups including core and sncc and organized a nationwide boycott first of table grapes and then of lettuce.
in 1968 chavez campaigned openly for robert kennedy.
two years later he won a substantial victory when the growers of half of california s table grapes signed contracts with his union.
the crisis of authority 817 kennedy and chavez cesar chavez the magnetic leader of the largely mexican american united farm workers a union that represented mostly migrant workers staged a hunger strike in 1968 to demand that its members receive better treatment by growers.
robert f kennedy just beginning his campaign for the presidency paid him a visit in delano california to show his support.
chavez who had by then been fasting for many weeks looks visibly weak here.
kennedy s visit helped persuade him to end the fast.
photo by michael rougier time life pictures getty images latino americans were at the center of another controversy of the 1970s and beyond the issue of bilingualism.
it was a question that aroused the opposition not only of many whites but of some hispanics as well.
supporters of bilingualism in education argued that non english speaking americans were entitled to schooling in their own language that otherwise they would be at a grave disadvantage in comparison with native english speakers.
the u s supreme court confirmed the right of non english speaking students to schooling in their native language in 1974.
opponents cited not only the cost and difficulty of bilingualism but also the dangers it posed to students ability to assimilate into the mainstream of american culture.
gay liberation another important liberation movement that made gains in the 1960s was the effort by homosexuals to win political and economic rights and equally important social accep tance.
homosexuality and lesbianism had been unacknowl edged realities throughout american history not until many years after their deaths did many americans know for example that revered cultural figures such as walt whitman and horatio alger were homosexuals.
but by the late 1960s the liberating impulses that had affected other groups helped mobilize gay men and lesbians to fight for their own rights.
on june 27 1969 police officers raided the stonewall inn a gay bar in new york citys greenwich village and began arresting patrons simply for frequenting the place.
the raid was not unusual police had been harassing gay bars and homosexual men and women for years.
riot the accumulated resentment of this long history of assaults and humiliations caused the extraordinary response that summer night.
gay onlookers taunted the police then attacked them.
someone started a blaze in the stonewall inn almost trapping the policemen inside.
rioting continued throughout greenwich village a center of new yorks gay community through much of the night.
the stonewall riot helped make the gay liberation movement a movement that had been gaining strength since 818.
chapter 30 the quilt in the early years of gay liberation the movement focused mostly on ending discrimination and harassment.
by the 1990s however with the aids epidemic affecting large numbers of gay men activists shifted much of their attention to pressing for a cure and to remembering those who had died.
one of the most remarkable results of that effort was the aids quilt.
friends and relatives of victims of the disease made individual patches in memory of those they had lost.
then in many different cities thousands of quilters would join their pieces to create a vast testament to bereavement and memory.
the enormity of the project was most visible in october 1996 when hundreds of thousands of pieces of the quilt were laid out on the mall in washington stretching from the washington monument to the capitol.
ron edmunds ap images at least the 1950s a significant and highly public force.
new organizations sprang up around the country.
public discussion and media coverage of homosexuality long subject to an unofficial taboo quickly and dramatically increased.
gay and lesbian activists had some success in challenging the longstanding assumption that homosexuality was aberrant behavior.
they argued that no sexual preference was any more normal than another.
formed the outlook impact of the gay liberation movement most of all however the gay liberation movement trans of gay men and lesbians themselves.
it helped them to come out to express their preferences openly and unapolo getically and to demand from society a recognition that gay relationships could be as significant and worthy of respect as heterosexual ones.
even the ravages of the aids epidemic which affected the gay community more disastrously than it affected any other group failed to halt the growth of gay liberation.
in many ways it strengthened it.
by the early 1990s gay men and lesbians were achieving some of the same milestones that other oppressed minorities had attained in earlier decades.
some openly gay politicians won election to public office.
universities were establishing gay and lesbian studies programs.
and laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual preference were making slow halting progress at the local level.
but gay liberation also produced a powerful backlash.
this became especially evident in 1993 when president bill clinton s effort to lift the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the military met a storm of criticism from members of congress and from within the military itself.
the backlash proved so strong that the administration retreated from its position and settled for a weak compromise dont ask dont tell by which the military would not ask recruits about their sexual preferences while those who enlisted in the military were expected not to reveal them.
a decade later issues involving gays and lesbians reached a high level of intensity again sparked in part by the efforts of several cities and states to legalize same sex marriage.
president george w bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage and the issue became a major element of republican election campaigns.
many states put referenda on their ballots banning gay marriage and most such referenda were decisively approved by the voters.
by 2014 the federal government 17 states and the district of columbia authorized same sex marriage.
in 2013 the supreme court bolstered the rights of same sex couples when it ruled in united states v windsor that restricting the definition of marriage to include only heterosexual couples was unconstitutional.
the ruling extended on the federal level the same rights enjoyed by married heterosexuals to same sex couples.
the ruling left intact any state laws prohibiting same sex marriage.
also in 2013 congress passed the dont ask dont tell repeal act making it possible for gay people to serve openly in the military.
the new feminism american women constitute a slight majority of the population.
but during the 1960s and 1970s many women began to identify with minority groups and to demand a liberation of their own.
as a result the role of women in american life changed more dramatically than that of any other group in the nation.
the crisis of authority 819 the rebirth feminism had been a weak and often embattled force in american life for more than forty years after the adoption of the woman suffrage amendment in 1920.
yet in the 1960s and 1970s it evolved very quickly from relative obscurity to one of the most powerful social movements in american history.
the 1963 publication of betty friedans the feminine mystique is often cited as an important early event of con temporary womens liberation.
friedan a the feminine.
mystique magazine journalist had traveled around the country interviewing the women who had graduated with her from smith college in 1942.
most of these women were living out the dream that postwar american society had created for them they were affluent wives and mothers living in comfortable suburbs.
and yet many of them were deeply frustrated and unhappy.
the suburbs friedan claimed had become a comfortable concentration camp providing the women who inhabited them with no outlets for their intelligence talent and education.
the feminine mystique she wrote was responsible for burying millions of women alive by chronicling their unhappiness and frustration friedan did not so much cause workforce.
what role did this growing participation in the paid workforce have on the rise of feminism in the 1960s and beyond.
the revival of feminism as help give voice to a movement that was already stirring.
by the time the feminine mystique appeared john kennedy had established the presidents commission on the status of women it brought national attention to sexual discrimination and helped create important networks of feminist activists who would lobby for legislative redress.
also in 1963 the kennedy administration helped win passage of the equal pay act which barred the pervasive practice of paying women less than men for equal work.
a year later congress incorporated into the civil rights act of 1964 an amendment title vii that extended to women many of the same legal protections against discrimination that were being extended to african americans.
the events of the early 1960s helped expose a contradiction that had been developing for decades between the image of happy domesticity what friedan had called the feminine mystique and the reality of womens roles in america.
the reality was that increasing numbers of women including by 1963 over a third of all married women had already entered the workplace and were encountering widespread discrimination there and that many other women were finding their domestic lives suffocating and frustrating.
in 1966 friedan joined with other feminists to create the now national organization for women now founded which soon became the nations largest and most influential feminist organization.
like other movements for liberation feminism drew much of its inspiration from the black struggle for freedom.
the new organization responded to the complaints of the women friedans book had examined affluent suburbanites with no outlet for their interests by demanding greater educational opportunities for women and denouncing the domestic ideal and the traditional concept of marriage.
but the heart of the movement at least in the beginning was directed toward the needs of women already in the workplace.
now denounced the exclusion of women from professions from politics and from countless other areas of american life.
it decried legal and economic discrimination including the practice of paying women less than men for equal work a practice the equal pay act had not effectively eliminated.
the organization called for a fully equal partnership of the sexes as part of the worldwide revolution of human rights women s liberation by the late 1960s new and more radical feminist demands were also attracting a large following.
the new feminists were mostly younger the vanguard of the baby boom generation.
many of them drew inspiration new from the new left and the countercul directions in ture.
some were involved in the civil the womens rights movement others in the antiwar movement crusade.
many had found that even 820 chapter 30 within those movements they faced discrimination and exclusion or subordination to male leaders.
by the early 1970s a significant change was visible in the tone and direction of the womens movement.
new books by younger feminists expressed a harsher critique of american society than friedan had offered.
kate milletts sexual politics 1969 signaled the new direction by arguing that every avenue of power within the society is entirely within male hands the answer to womens problems in other words was not as friedan had suggested for individual women to search for greater personal fulfillment it was for women to band together to assault the male power structure.
shulamith firestones the dialectic of sex 1970 was subtitled the case for feminist revolution by the early 1970s large numbers of women were coming to see themselves as an exploited group organizing against oppression and developing a culture and communities of their own.
expanding achievements by the early 1970s the public and private achievements of the womens movement were already substantial.
in 1971 the political and economic success government extended its affirmative action guidelines to include women linking sexism with racism as an officially acknowledged social problem.
in the meantime women were making rapid progress in their efforts to move into the economic and political mainstream.
the nation s major all male educational institutions began to open their doors to women.
princeton and yale did so in 1969 and most other all male colleges and universities soon followed.
some womens colleges in the meantime began accepting male students.
women were also becoming an important force in business and the professions.
nearly half of all married women held jobs by the mid 1970s and almost 90 percent of all women with college degrees worked.
by 2010 women constituted half the total workforce.
the two career family in which both husband and wife maintained active professional lives was becoming a widely accepted norm many women were postponing marriage or motherhood for the sake of their careers.
there were also important symbolic changes such as the refusal of many women to adopt their husbands names when they married and the use of the term ms in place of marching for womens rights by the end of the 1960s the struggle for individual rights which the african american civil rinhto r na consciousness had inspired a broad range of movements.
perhaps the most important in the long run was the drive for womens riohts which9 push t0 h thousands of women joined this march through new york city.
werner wolff black star 9 w3s 3 ready formidable in the summer of 1970 when the crisis of authority 821 mrs or miss to denote the irrelevance of a womans marital status in the public world.
in politics women were beginning to compete effectively with men for both elected and appointive positions.
by 2010 considerable numbers of women were serving in both houses of congress including a speaker of the house nancy pelosi in numerous federal cabinet positions including three secretaries of state as governors and in many other positions.
ronald reagan appointed the first female supreme court justice sandra day o connor in 1981 in 1993 bill clinton appointed the second ruth bader ginsburg and barack obama appointed two women justices sonia sotomayor and elena kagan in 2009 and 2010 respectively.
in 1984 the democratic party chose representative geraldine ferraro of new york as its vice presidential candidate and in 2008 hillary clinton became a formidable candidate in the race for the democratic presidential nomination.
in academia women were expanding their presence in traditional scholarly fields they were also creating a field of their own womens studies which in the 1980s and early 1990s was among the fastest growing areas of american scholarship.
in professional athletics women were beginning to compete with men both for attention and for an equal share of prize money.
by the late 1970s the federal government was pressuring colleges and universities to provide women with athletic programs equal to those available to men.
in 1972 congress approved the equal rights amendment to the constitution which some feminists had been promoting failure of since the 1920s and sent it to the states.
for to a a while ratification seemed almost certain.
era by the late 1970s however the momentum behind the amendment had died.
the era was in trouble not because of indifference but because of a rising chorus of objections to it from people including many antifeminist women who feared it would disrupt traditional social patterns.
in 1982 the amendment died when the time allotted for its ratification expired.
the abortion controversy a vital element of american feminism since the 1920s has been womens effort to win greater control of their own sexual and reproductive lives.
in its least controversial form this impulse helped produce an increasing awareness in the 1960s and 1970s of the problems of rape sexual abuse and wife beating.
there continued to be some controversy over the dissemination of contraceptives and birth control information but that issue at least seemed to have lost much of the explosive character it had had in the 1920s.
a related issue however stimulated as much popular passion as any question of its time abortion.
abortion had once been legal in much of the united states but by the beginning of the twentieth century it was banned by statute in most of the country and remained so into the r.
1960s although many abortions continued v wade to be performed quietly and often danger ously out of sigh of the law.
but the womens movement created strong new pressures on behalf of legalizing abortion.
several states had abandoned restrictions on abortion by the end of the 1960s.
and in 1973 the supreme courts decision in roe v wade based on a relatively new theory of a constitutional right to privacy first recognized by the court only a few years earlier in griswold v connecticut 1965 invalidated all laws prohibiting abortion during the first trimester the first three months of pregnancy.
the decision would become the most controversial ruling of the century.
environmentalism in a turbulent society like feminism environmentalism entered the 1960s with a long history and little public support.
also like feminism environmentalism both profited from and transcended the turbulence of the era and emerged by the 1970s as a powerful and enduring force in american and global life.
the rise of this new movement was in part a result of the environmental degradation that had become increasingly evident in the advanced industrial society of the late twentieth century.
it was a result too of the growth of the science of ecology which provided environmentalists with new and powerful arguments.
and it was a product of some of the countercultural movements of the time movements that rejected aspects of the modern industrial consumer society and called for a return to a more natural existence.
the new science of ecology until the mid twentieth century most people who considered themselves environmentalists or to use the traditional term conservationists based their commitment on aesthetic or moral grounds they wanted to preserve nature because it was too beautiful to despoil or because it was a mark of divinity on the world.
in the course of the twentieth century however scientists in the united states and other nations drawing from earlier relatively obscure scientific writings began to create a new rationale for environmentalism.
they called it ecology.
ecology is the science of the interrelatedness of the natural world.
it rests on an assumption as the american zoologist stephen a forbes wrote as early as 1880 that primeval nature.
presents a settled harmony of interaction among organic groups and that this harmony is in strong contrast with the many serious maladjustments of plants and animals found in countries occupied by man.
such problems as air and water pollution the destruction of forests the extinction of species and toxic wastes are not ecology teaches separate isolated problems.
all elements of the earths environment are intimately and delicately linked.
damaging any one of those elements therefore risks damaging all the others.
a number of american scientists built on forbess ideas in the early twentieth century but perhaps the greatest early idea of an interrelated world 822 chapter 30 rachel carson rachel carson who began her career as a marine biologist wrote the world s best selling book about the ocean environment in the 1950s.
carson s abiding love for the creatures of shore and surf led to her concern about the harm pesticides might do them.
bettmann corbis contribution to popular knowledge of ecology came not from a scientist but from the writer and naturalist aldo leopold.
during a career in forest management leopold sought to apply the new scientific findings on ecology to his interactions with the natural world.
and in 1949 he published a classic of environmental literature the sand county almanac in which he argued that humans have a responsibility to understand and maintain the balance of nature that they should behave in the natural world according to a code that he called the land ethic by then the science of ecology was spreading widely in the scientific community.
among the findings of ecologists were such now common ideas as the food chain the ecosystem biodiversity and endangered species the influence of these emerging ideas of ecology could be seen especially clearly in the sensational 1962 book by rachel carson silent spring.
carson was a marine biologist who had become a successful science writer.
in 1957 she received a letter from a friend reporting the deaths of songbirds in her yard after the area had been sprayed with the insecticide ddt the chemical developed in the 1930s to kill mosquitoes.
carson began investigating the impact of ddt and discovered growing signs of danger.
ddt was slowly being absorbed into the food chain through water and plants and the animals who ate and drank them.
it was killing some animals especially birds and fish and inhibiting the ability of others to reproduce.
carson wrote eloquently about the growing danger of a silent spring in which birds would no longer sing and in which sickness and death would soon threaten large numbers of animals and perhaps people.
silent spring was an enormously influential book and had a direct if delayed influence on the decision to ban ddt in the united states in 1972.
it was evidence of the growing power of environmentalism and of the science of ecology on public policy and national culture.
but silent spring was also a very controversial book that enraged the chemical industry.
critics of carson attempted to suppress the book and when that effort failed to discredit its findings.
between 1945 and 1960 the number of ecologists in the united states grew rapidly and that number doubled again between 1960 and 1970.
funded by government agencies by universities by foundations and eventually even by some corporations ecological science gradually established itself as a significant field of its own.
by the early twenty first century there were programs in and departments of ecological science in major universities throughout the united states and in many other nations.
much more than other scientists however ecologists tend to fuse their commitment to research with a commitment to publicizing their work and promoting responsible public action to deal with environmental crises.
ecologys postwar growth environmental advocacy among the most important environmental organizations of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries were the wilderness society the sierra club the national audubon society the nature conservancy the national wildlife federation and the national parks and conservation association.
all of these organizations predated the rise of modern ecological science but all of them entered the twenty first century reenergized and committed to the new concepts of environmentalism.
they found allies among other not for profit organizations that had no previous experience with environmentalism but now chose to join the battle among them such groups as the american civil liberties union the league of women voters the national council of churches and even the afl cio.
out of these organizations emerged a new generation of professional environmental activists able to contribute to the new professional environmental activists legal and political battles of the movement.
scientists provided the necessary data.
lawyers fought battles with government agencies and in the courts.
lobbyists used traditional techniques of political persuasion with legislators and other officials knowing that many corporations and other opponents of environmental efforts would be doing the same in opposition to their goals.
perhaps most of all these organizations learned how to mobilize public opinion on their behalf.
environmental degradation perhaps the greatest force behind environmentalism was the condition of the environment itself.
by the 1960s the damage the crisis of authority 823 to the natural world from the dramatic economic growth of the postwar era was becoming impossible to ignore.
water pollution which had been a problem in some areas of the water and country for many decades was becoming air pollution so widespread that almost every major city was dealing with the unpleasant sight and odor as well as the very real health risks of polluted rivers and lakes.
in cleveland ohio for example the cuyahoga river burst into flame from time to time beginning in the 1950s from the petroleum waste being dumped into it.
perhaps more alarming was the growing awareness that the air itself was becoming unhealthy that toxic fumes from factories and power plants and most of all automobiles were poisoning the atmosphere.
weather forecasts and official atmospheric information began to refer to smog levels using a new word formed from a combination of smoke and fog in some large cities los angeles and denver among them smog became a perpetual fact of life rising steadily through the day blotting out the sun and creating respiratory difficulties for many citizens.
environmentalists also brought to public attention some longer term dangers of unchecked industrial development the rapid depletion of oil and other irreplaceable fossil fuels the destruction of lakes and forests as a result of acid rain rainfall polluted by chemical contaminants the rapid destruction of vast rain forests in brazil and elsewhere which limited the earths capacity to replenish its oxygen supply the depletion of the ozone layer as a result of the release of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere which threatened to limit the earths protection from dangerous ultraviolet rays from the sun and most alarming global warming which if unchecked would create dramatic changes in the earths climate and would threaten existing cities and settlements in coastal areas all over the world by causing a rise in ocean levels.
many of these claims became controversial with skeptics arguing that environmentalists had not conclusively proven their cases.
but most environmentalists and many scientists came to believe that the problems were real and deserving of immediate urgent attention.
earth day and beyond on april 22 1970 people all over the united states gathered in schools and universities in churches and clubs in parks and auditoriums for the first earth earth day day oriinally proposed by wisconsin senator gaylord nelson as a series of teach ins on college campuses earth day gradually took on a much larger life.
carefully managed by people who wanted to avoid associations with the radical left it had an unthreatening quality that appealed to many people for whom antiwar demonstrations and civil rights rallies seemed threatening.
according to some estimates over 20 million americans participated in some part of the earth day observances which may have made it the largest single demonstration in the nations history.
earth day 1970 the first earth day april 22 1970 was an important event in the development of the environmental movement.
conceived by wisconsin senator gaylord nelson earth day quickly gathered support in many areas of the united states and produced large demonstrations such as this one in new york city where crowds surround a large banner portraying the earth crying out for help.
hulton archive getty images the cautious centrist character of earth day and related efforts to popularize environmentalism helped create a movement that had little of the divisiveness of other more controversial causes.
gradually environmentalism became more than simply a series of demonstrations and protests.
it became part of the consciousness of the vast majority of americans absorbed into popular culture built into primary and secondary education endorsed by almost all politicians even if many of them opposed some environmental goals.
it also became part of the fabric of public policy.
in 1970 congress passed and president nixon signed the national environmental protection act which created a new agency the environmental protection agency to enforce antipollution standards on businesses and consumers.
the clean air act also passed in 1970 and the clean water act passed in 1972 added tools to the governments arsenal of weapons against environmental degradation.
epa established the end of colonialism wi 6 less than a year after the close of world war ii the united states volun lj in tarily ended its five decade old colonial control of the philippines which it had acquired as part of the spoils from the 1898 spanish american war.
philippine independence was only a small part of a dramatic change in the political structure of the world.
the close of world war ii marked not only the defeat of fascism in germany italy and japan but also the beginning of the end of the formal system of imperialism that european powers had maintained for centuries.
like most fundamental geopolitical changes the drive for colonial independence was turbulent and often violent.
although its divestiture of the philippines was relatively peaceful the united states was not quite as ready to cede its military and economic presence in the region as it was to give up political responsibility over the islands.
philippine independence came with important caveats the united states maintained control of its military bases there forbade the philippines to engage in any direct economic competition with the united states and required the new philippine government to revise its constitution to allow american interests free access to the nation s natural resources.
in fact many filipinos argue that their nation only achieved full independence in 1991 after the philippine senate refused to ratify a treaty that would have extended the american lease on the subic bay naval base.
a year later the united states closed the base and left marking the first time in 400 years that the philippines once a spanish possession were not home to a foreign military power.
britain whose imperial holdings were the vastest in the world withdrew from most of its colonies after world war ii beginning in 1947 with india its largest and most important colony.
as often happened when colonial rule ended suppressed conflicts in the native population quickly emerged in the case of india between hindus and muslims.
the price of indian independence was the partition of the country into india and pakistan and several decades later bangladesh.
a year later britain gave up its world war i mandate of palestine ceding the territory to the united nations and allowing for the creation of israel as well as many of its holdings in southeast asia.
in 1982 britain passed the canada act effectively severing canada from the united kingdom and culminating a move toward full canadian self government.
finally in 1997 britain returned hong kong to the control of china effectively bringing an end to the era of the british empire.
the dissolution of the british empire did not always proceed smoothly.
the suez crisis of 1956 dealt a decisive blow to britain s status as a major power in the middle east.
the efforts of britain france and israel to prevent egypt from seizing the british controlled suez canal which ran through egyptian territory ended in a humiliating defeat.
in 1982 a dispute over the tiny falkland islands just off the coast of argentina soon erupted into war between britain and argentina which claimed the islands as its own.
after the deaths of 258 british and 649 argentine soldiers britain maintained its control of the falklands although argentina continues to assert its right to the islands.
despite these controversies the dissolution of the british empire proceeded relatively smoothly compared to the experience of the french.
in late 1946 vietnamese nationalists rose up against the french colonial government that controlled the region.
the french effort to return to vietnam culminated ultimately in the french defeat at dien bien phu in 1954 and their subsequent withdrawal from indochina.
france also became embroiled in and tried to suppress by force other violent colonial uprisings in madagascar cameroon and most notably algeria.
the algerian war 1954 1962 was a particularly bloody and costly conflict involving guerrilla warfare torture acts of terrorism and eventually the collapse of the french fourth republic in 1958.
algeria ultimately won its independence but the scars created by the long and ugly war were slow to heal.
the end of the colonial system had its greatest impact on africa.
european powers had carved up almost all of sub saharan africa in the nineteenth century.
but in the decades after world war ii almost all the african colonies won their independence even if not always easily.
african nationalism however was troubled for decades by political instability and in some countries extreme poverty.
africa is currently home to 34 of the 48 poorest and 24 of the 32 least developed nixon kissinger and the war richard nixon assumed office in 1969 committed not only to restoring stability at home but also to creating a new and more stable order in the world.
central to his hopes was a resolution of the stalemate in vietnam.
yet the new president felt no freer than his predecessor to abandon the american commitment there.
he realized that the war was threatening both the nations domestic stability and its position in the world.
but he feared that a precipitous retreat would destroy american honor and credibility american involvement in indochina continued for four more years during which the war expanded in its geographic scope and its bloodiness.
vletnamization despite nixons own passionate interest in international affairs he brought with him into government a man who ultimately henry seemed to overshadow him in the conduct kissinger f diplomacy henry kissinger a harvard professor whom the president appointed as his national security adviser.
kissinger quickly established dominance over the secretary of state william rogers and the secretary of defense melvin laird who were both more experienced in public life than kissinger was.
that was in part a result of nixons passion for concentrating decision making in the white house.
but kissingers keen intelligence bureaucratic skills and success in handling the press were at least equally important.
together nixon and kissinger set out to find an acceptable solution to the stalemate in vietnam.
824 the crisis of authority 825 countries in the world in no small part a result of the lingering shadow cast by centuries of colonial exploitation of the continent.
the most recent epicenter of independence movements has been in the lands that used to comprise the former soviet union.
a long and costly war in afghanistan began in the 1970s as the soviet union struggled to retain control of the nation in the face of powerful local insurgencies.
the war was one of the principal factors in the unraveling of the soviet empire that began in 1991.
many of the former soviet republics which considered themselves colonies of russia soon separated from russia and became independent nations in their own right.
even after the dissolution of the soviet union russia continues to deal with the problems of empire.
a vicious conflict with chechnya an islamic area of russia insisting on independence has created terror and instability for years.
in 2014 russia reclaimed crimea which since the collapse of the soviet union had been a part of ukraine.
this action threatened to heighten tensions between russia and the west to levels not seen since the cold war.
the end of colonialism marked the end to an imperial system that was based on the assumption of european and american superiority over non western peoples.
but if formal colonialism came to an end in the post world war ii era other aspects of imperialism did not.

the new vietnam policy moved along several fronts.
one was an effort to limit domestic opposition to the war.
aware that the military draft was one of the most visible targets of dissent the administration devised a new lottery system hrough which only a limited group those nineteen year olds vith low lottery numbers would be subject to conscription ater the president urged the creation of an all volunteer rmy.
by 1973 the selective service system was on its way to t least temporary extinction.
more important in stifling dissent however was the new olicy of vietnamization of the war the training and equipping of the south vietnamese military to take over the burden of combat from american forces.
in the fall of 1969 consequences of vletnamization since the beginning of the war.
the reductions continued steadily for more than three years.
from a peak of more than 540 000 american troops in 1969 the number had dwindled to about 60 000 by 1972.
vietnamization helped quiet domestic opposition to the war.
but it did nothing to break the stalemate in the negotiations with the north vietnamese in paris.
the new administration quickly decided that new military pressures would be necessary to do that.
escalation by the end of their first year in office nixon and kissinger had concluded that the most effective way to tip the military balance in america s favor was to destroy the bases in cambodia from which the american military believed the north vietnamese were launching many of their attacks.
very early in his presidency nixon ordered the air force to begin bombing cambodian territory to destroy the enemy sanctuaries.
he kept the raids secret from congress and the public.
in the spring of 1970 possibly with u s encouragement and support conservative military leaders overthrew the neutral government of cambodia and established a new pro american regime under general lon nol.
lon nol quickly gave his approval to american incursions into his territory and on april 30 nixon went on television to announce that he was ordering american troops across the border into cambodia to clean out the bases that the enemy had been using for its increased military aggression almost overnight the cambodian invasion restored the dwindling antiwar movement to vigorous life.
the first days of may saw the most widespread and vocal antiwar demonstrations since the beginning of the war.
hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in washington d c to denounce the presidents policies.
millions perhaps participated in other demonstrations on campuses nationwide.
the mood of crisis intensified greatly on may 4 when four college students were killed and nine others injured when members of kent state national guard opened fire on antiwar demonstrators at kent state university in ohio.
ten days later police killed two black students at jackson state university in mississippi during a demonstration there.
the clamor against the war quickly spread into the government and the press.
congress angrily repealed the gulf of tonkin resolution in december stripping the president of what had long served as the legal basis for the war.
nixon ignored the action.
then in june 1971 first the new york times and later other newspapers began publishing excerpts from a secret study of the war prepared by the defense department during the johnson administration.
what came to be known as the pentagon papers leaked to the press by former defense department official daniel ellsberg provided evidence of what many critics of the war had long believed that the government had been dishonest both in reporting the military progress of the war and in explaining nixon announced reduction of american ground troops from vietnam by 60 000 the first reduction in u s troop strength 826 chapter 30 my lai massacre its own motives for american involvement.
the administra tion went to court to suppress the documents but the supreme court finally ruled that the press had the right to publish them.
morale and discipline were rapidly deteriorating among u s troops in vietnam who had been fighting a savage and inconclusive war for more than five years.
the trial and conviction in 1971 of lieutenant william calley who was charged with overseeing a massacre of more than 300 unarmed south vietnamese civilians attracted wide public attention.
many americans believed that the my lai tragedy was not an isolated incident.
less publicized were other more widespread problems among american troops in vietnam desertion drug addiction racial hostilities refusal to obey orders even the occasional killing of unpopular officers by enlisted men.
by 1971 nearly two thirds of those interviewed in public opinion polls were urging american withdrawal from vietnam including many conservatives who considered nixons policies as too timid.
if the war was not designed for victory they believed it should not be fought.
in march 1972 the north vietnamese mounted the biggest offensive since 1968 the so called easter offensive.
american and south vietnamese forces managed to halt the north vietnam advance but it was clear that without american support the offensive would have succeeded.
at the same time nixon ordered american planes to bomb targets near hanoi the capital of north vietnam and haiphong its principal port and called for the mining of seven north vietnamese harbors to stop the flow of supplies from china and the soviet union.
easter offensive peace with honor as the 1972 presidential election approached the administration stepped up its efforts to produce a breakthrough in negotiations with the north vietnamese.
in april 1972 the president dropped his longtime insistence on a removal of north vietnamese troops from the south before any american withdrawal.
meanwhile henry kissinger was meeting privately in paris with the north vietnamese foreign secretary le due tho to work out terms for a cease fire.
on october 26 only days before the presidential election kissinger announced that peace is at hand but several weeks later after the election negotiations broke down once again.
the american and the north vietnamese governments appeared ready to accept the kissinger tho plan for a cease fire but the regime of general nguyen van thieu balked still insisting on a full withdrawal of north vietnamese forces from the south.
kissinger tried to win additional concessions from the communists to meet thieus objections but on december 16 talks broke off.
the next day december 17 american b 52s began the heaviest and most destructive air raids of the entire war on christmas bombing hanoi haiphong and other north vietnamese targets.
civilian casualties were high and fifteen american b 52s were shot down by the north vietnamese in the entire war to that point the united states had lost only one of the giant bombers.
on december 30 nixon terminated the christmas bombing the united states and the north vietnamese soon returned to the conference table.
and on january 27 1973 they signed an agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in vietnam nixon claimed that the christmas bombing had forced the north vietnamese to relent.
at least equally important however was the enormous american pressure on thieu to accept the cease fire.
the terms of the paris accords were little different from those kissinger and tho had accepted in principle a few months before.
there would be an immediate cease fire.
the north vietnamese would release several hundred american prisoners of war.
the thieu regime would survive for the moment the principal north vietnamese concession to the united states but north vietnamese forces already in the south would remain there.
an undefined committee would work out a permanent settlement.
defeat in indochina american forces were hardly out of indochina before the paris accords collapsed.
during the first year after the ceasefire the contending vietnamese armies suffered greater battle losses than the americans had absorbed during ten years of fighting.
finally in march 1975 the north vietnamese launched a full scale offensive against the now greatly weakened forces of the south.
thieu appealed to fall of washington for assistance the president saigon now gerald ford nixon had resigned in 1974 appealed to congress for additional funding congress refused.
late in april 1975 communist forces marched into saigon shortly after officials of the thieu regime and the staff of the american embassy had fled the country in humiliating disarray.
communist forces quickly occupied the capital renamed it ho chi minh city and began the process of reuniting vietnam under the hanoi government.
at about the same time the lon nol regime in cambodia fell to the murderous communists of pol pot and the khmer rouge whose genocidal policies led to the deaths of more than a third of the countrys people over the next several years.
that was the grim end of over a decade of direct american military involvement in vietnam.
more than 1 2 million vietnamese soldiers had died in combat along with countless civilians throughout the region.
the united states paid a heavy price as well.
the war had cost the nation almost 150 billion in direct costs and much more indirectly.
it had resulted in the deaths of over 55 000 young americans and the injury of 300 000 more.
and the nation had suffered a heavy blow to its confidence and self esteem.
the crisis of authority 827 nixon kissinger and the world the continuing war in vietnam provided a dismal backdrop to what nixon considered his larger mission in world affairs the construction of a new international order.
the president had become convinced that old assumptions of a bipolar world in which the united states and the soviet union were the only truly great powers were now obsolete.
instead america must adapt to the new multipolar international structure in which china japan and western europe would become major independent forces.
it will be a safer world and a e evacuation of saigon a harried u s official struggles to keep panicking vietnamese from ding an already overburdened helicopter on the roof of the american embassy in saigon.

instead america recognized the regime in exile on the island of taiwan as the legitimate government of mainland china.
nixon and kissinger wanted to forge a new relationship with the chinese communists in part to strengthen them as a counterbalance to the soviet union.
the chinese for their part were eager to forestall what they feared was the possibility of a soviet american alliance against china and to end chinas own isolation from the international arena.
in july 1971 nixon sent henry kissinger on a secret mission to beijing.
when kissinger returned the president made the startling announcement that he would visit china within the next few months.
that fall with american approval the united nations admit ted the communist government of china and expelled the representatives of the taiwan regime.
finally in february 1972 nixon paid a formal visit to china which erased much of the deep american animosity toward the chinese communists.
the initiatives in china coincided with and probably assisted an effort by the nixon administration to improve relations with the soviet union.
in 1969 american and soviet diplomats met in helsinki finland to begin talks on limiting nuclear weapons.
in 1972 salt i they prduced the first strategic arms limitation treaty salt i which froze the nuclear missiles icbms of both sides at present levels.
nixons china visit the problems of multipolarity nixon and kissinger believed that great power relationships could not alone ensure international stability for the third world remained the most volatile and dangerous source of international tension.
central to the nixon kissinger policy toward the third world was the effort to maintain a stable status quo without involving the united states doctrine t0 deep y in local disputes.
in 1969 and 1970 the president described what became known as the nixon doctrine by which the united states would participate in the defense and development of allies and friends but would leave the basic 828 chapter 30 nixon in china president richard nixon s 1972 visit to china was an important step in normalizing relations between the us and the people s republic of china.

in the middle east conditions grew more volatile in the aftermath of the 1967 six day war in which israel routed egyptian syrian and jordanian forces gained control of the whole of the long divided city of jerusalem and occupied substantial new territories on the west bank of the jordan river the gaza strip the golan heights and elsewhere.
the war also increased the number of refugee palestinians arabs who claimed the lands now controlled by israel and who dislodged from their homes became a source of considerable instability in jordan lebanon and the other surrounding countries into which they now moved.
in october 1973 on the jewish high holy day of yorn kippur egyptian and syrian forces again attacked israel.
for ten days the israelis struggled to recover from the surprise attack finally they launched an effective counteroffensive against egyptian forces in the sinai.
at that point the united states intervened placing heavy pressure on israel to accept a cease fire rather than press its advantage.
the imposed settlement of the yorn kippur war demonstrated the growing dependence of the united states and its allies on arab oil.
permitting israel to continue its drive into egypt arab oil might have jeopardized the ability of the embargo united states to purchase needed petroleum from the arab states.
a brief but painful embargo by the arab governments on the sale of oil to supporters of israel including america in 1973 provided an ominous warning of the costs of losing access to the regions resources.
the federal government and the interests of states and local communities.
in the end however economic and political crises some beyond the administrations control some of its own making sharply limited nixons ability to fulfill his domestic goals.
domestic initiatives dismantling the great society many of nixons domestic policies were a response to what he believed to be the demands of his own constituency conservative middle class people whom he liked to call the silent majority and who wanted to reduce federal interference in local affairs.
nixon tried unsuccessfully to persuade congress to pass legislation prohib iting the use of forced busing to achieve school desegregation.
he blocked the department of health education and welfare from cutting off federal funds from school districts that had failed to comply with court orders to integrate.
at the same time he began to reduce or dismantle many of the social programs of the great society and the new frontier.
in 1973 for example he abolished the office of economic opportunity the centerpiece of the antipoverty program of the johnson years.
yet nixons domestic efforts were not entirely conservative.
one of the administrations boldest efforts was an attempt to overhaul the nations enormous welfare system.
nixon proposed replacing the existing system which almost everyone agreed was cumbersome expensive and inefficient with what he called the family assistance plan fap.
it would in effect have created a guaranteed annual income for all americans 1 600 in federal grants which could be supplemented by outside earnings up to 4 000.
even many liberals applauded the proposal as an important step toward expanding federal responsibility for the poor.
nixon however presented the plan in conservative terms as something that would reduce the role of government and transfer to welfare recipients themselves daily responsibility for their own lives.
although the fap won approval in the house in 1970 concerted attacks by welfare recipients who considered the benefits inadequate members of the welfare bureaucracy whose own influence stood to be sharply diminished by the bill and conservatives who opposed a guaranteed income on principle helped kill it in the senate.
from the warren court to the nixon court of all the liberal institutions that had aroused the enmity of the silent majority in the 1950s and 1960s none had evoked more anger and bitterness than the supreme court.
not only had its rulings on racial matters disrupted traditional social patterns but its staunch defense of civil liberties had in the opinions of many americans contributed to the increase in crime disorder and moral decay.
in engel v vitale 1962 the court ruled that prayers in public schools politics and economics under nixon the nixon administration described its policies as an attempt to restore balance between the needs of the poor and the desires of the middle class between the power of the crisis of authority 829 violated the constitutional separation of church and state sparking outrage among religious fundamentalists and others.
in roth v united states 1957 the court had sharply limited the authority of local governments to curb pornography.
in gideon v wainwright 1963 the court ruled that every felony defendant was entitled to a lawyer regardless of his or her ability to pay.
in escobedo v illinois 1964 it ruled that a defendant must be allowed access to a lawyer before questioning by police.
in miranda v arizona 1966 the court confirmed the obligation of authorities to inform a criminal suspect of his or her rights.
by 1968 the warren court had become the target of americans of all kinds who felt the balance of power in the united states had shifted too far toward the poor and dispossessed at the expense of the middle class and toward criminals at the expense of law abiding citizens.
one of the most important decisions of the warren court in the 1960s was baker v carr 1962 which required state baker v carr legislatures to apportion electoral districts so that all citizens votes would have equal weight.
in dozens of states systems of legislative districting had given disproportionate representation to sparsely populated rural areas hence diminishing the voting power of urban residents.
the reapportionment that the decision required greatly strengthened the voting power of african americans hispanics and other groups concentrated in cities.
nixon was determined to use his judicial appointments to give the court a more conservative cast.
his first opportunity came almost as soon as he entered office.
when chief justice earl warren resigned early in 1969 nixon replaced him with a federal appeals court judge of conservative leanings warren burger.
a few months later associate justice abe fortas resigned after allegations of financial improprieties.
to replace him nixon named clement f haynsworth a respected federal circuit court judge from south carolina.
but haynsworth came under fire from senate liberals black organizations and labor unions for his conservative record on civil rights and for what some critics claimed was a conflict of interest in several of the cases on which he had sat.
the senate rejected him.
nixons next choice was g harrold carswell a judge of the florida federal appeals court of little distinction and widely considered unfit for the supreme court.
the senate rejected his nomination too.
nixon was careful thereafter to choose justices of standing within the legal community to fill vacancies on the supreme court harry blackmun a moderate jurist from minnesota lewis f powell jr a respected judge from virginia and william rehnquist a member of the nixon justice department.
the new court however fell short of what many conservatives had expected.
rather than retreating from its commitment to social reform the court in many areas became more committed.
in swann v charlotte mecklenburg board of education 1971 it ruled in favor of the use of forced busing to achieve racial balance in schools.
in furman v georgia 1972 the court overturned existing capital punishment statutes and established strict new guidelines for such laws in the future.
in roe v wade 1973 it struck down laws forbidding abortions.
in other decisions however the burger n court was more moderate.
although bakke v board.
of regents of iustices approved busing as a tool california for achieving integration they rejected in milliken v bradleg 1974 a plan to transfer students across district lines in this case between detroit and its suburbs to achieve racial balance.
while the court upheld the principle of affirmative action in its celebrated 1978 decision bakke v board of regents of california it established restrictive new guidelines for such programs in the future.
the election of 1972 nixon entered the presidential race in 1972 with a substantial reserve of strength.
he had made significant achievements in foreign policy and in the de escalation of the vietnam war.
his energetic reelection committee collected enormous sums of money to support the campaign.
the president himself used the powers of incumbency with great effect refraining from campaigning and concentrating on highly publicized international decisions and state visits.
agencies of the federal government dispensed funds and favors to strengthen nixons political standing in critical areas.
nixon was most fortunate in 1972 however in his opposition.
the return of george wallace to the presidential fray caused some early concern.
nixon was delighted to see wallace run in the democratic primaries and quietly encouraged him to do so.
but he feared that wallace would again launch a third party campaign.
the possibility of such a campaign vanished in may when a would be assassin shot the alabama governor during a campaign rally in maryland.
paralyzed from the waist down wallace was unable to continue campaigning.
the democrats in the meantime were making their own george contributions to the nixon cause by nom mcgovern inating for president a representative of their most liberal wing senator george s mcgovern of south dakota.
an outspoken critic of the war a forceful advocate of advanced liberal positions on most social and economic issues mcgovern seemed to embody many aspects of the turbulent 1960s that middle class americans were most eager to reject.
mcgovern profited greatly from party reforms which he had helped to draft that reduced the power of party leaders and gave increased influence to inexperienced delegates in the selection of the democratic ticket.
but those same reforms helped make the democratic convention of 1972 an unappealing spectacle to much of the public.

debating the past mm watergate tl dpa tt t.
c a ter watergate one of the most famous political scandals in ij jd w tt o jd w american history historians and others continue to argue about its causes and significance.
their interpretations fall into several broad categories.
one argument emphasizes the evolution of the institution of the presidency over time and sees watergate as the result of a much larger pattern of presidential usurpations of power that stretched back at least several decades.
arthur schlesinger jr helped develop this argument in his 1973 book the imperial presidency which argues that ever since world war ii americans have believed that the nation was in a state of permanent crisis threatened from abroad by the menace of communism threatened from within by the danger of insufficient will.
the belief of a succession of presidents in the urgency of this crisis and in their duty to take whatever measures might be necessary to combat it led them gradually to usurp more and more power from congress the courts and the public.
initially this expansion of presidential power came in the realm of international affairs covert and at times illegal activities overseas.
but in the postwar world domestic politics began to seem inseparable from international politics.
gradually presidents began to look for ways to circumvent constraints in domestic matters as well.
nixon s actions in the watergate crisis were in other words a culmination of this long and steady expansion of covert presidential power.
jonathan schell in the time of illusion 1975 offers a variation of this argument tying the crisis of the presidency to the pressure that nuclear weapons place on presidents to protect the nation s and their own credibility.
other commentators but few serious historical studies go even further and argue that what happened to produce the watergate scandals was not substantively different from the normal patterns of presidential behavior that nixon simply got caught where other presidents had not and that a long standing liberal hostility toward nixon ensured that he would pay a higher price for his behavior than other presidents would.
a second explanation of watergate emphasizes the difficult social and political environment of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
nixon entered office according to this view facing an unprecedentedly radical opposition that would stop at nothing to discredit the war and destroy his authority.
he found himself therefore drawn into taking similarly desperate measures of his own to defend himself from these extraordinary challenges.
nixon made this argument in his own 1975 memoirs it was this epidemic of unprecedented domestic terrorism that prompted our efforts to discover the best means by which to deal with this new phenomenon of highly organized and highly skilled revolutionaries the troubled economy for three decades the american economy had been the envy of the world.
it had produced as much as a third of the worlds industrial goods and had dominated international trade.
the american dollar had been the strongest currency in the world and the american standard of living had risen steadily from its already substantial heights.
many americans assumed that this remarkable prosperity was the normal condition of their society.
in fact however it rested in part on several advantages that were rapidly disappearing by the late 1960s above all the absence of significant foreign competition and easy access to raw materials in the third world.
inflation which had been creeping upward for several years when richard nixon took office soon began to soar it would be the most disturbing economic problem of the 1970s.
its most visible cause was a significant increase in federal deficit spending that began in the 1960s when the inflation johnson administration tried to fund the war in vietnam and its ambitious social programs without raising taxes.
but there were other equally important causes.
no longer did the united states have exclusive access to cheap raw materials around the globe not only were other industrial nations now competing for increasingly 830 scarce raw materials but third world suppliers of those materials were beginning to realize their value and to demand higher prices for them.

dedicated to the violent destruction of our democratic system the historian herbert parmet echoes parts of this argument in richard nixon and his america 1990 stephen ambrose offers a more muted version of the same view in richard nixon 1989.
most of those who have written about watergate however search for the explanation not in institutional or social forces but in the personalities of the people involved and most notably in the personality of richard nixon.
even many of those who have developed structural explana tions schlesinger schell and ambrose for example return eventually to nixon himself as the most important explanation for watergate.
others begin there perhaps most notably stanley i kutler in the wars of watergate 1990 and later abuse of power 1997 in which he presents extensive excerpts from conversations about watergate taped in the nixon white house.
kutler emphasizes nixons lifelong resort to vicious political tactics and his long standing belief that he was a special target of unscrupulous enemies and had to get them before they got him.
watergate was rooted kutler argues in the personality and history of nixon himself.
a corrosive hatred he claims decisively shaped nixon s own behavior his career and eventually his historical standing.

the greatest immediate blow to the american economy was the increasing cost of energy.
more than any nation on earth the united states based its economy on the easy availability of cheap and plentiful fossil fuels.
domestic petroleum reserves were no longer sufficient to meet this demand and the nation was heavily dependent on imports from the middle east and africa.
for many years the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec had operated as an informal bargaining unit opec for the sale of oil by third world nations but had seldom managed to exercise any real strength.
but in the early 1970s opec began to use its oil as both an economic tool and a political weapon.
in 1973 in the midst of the yorn kippur war arab members of opec announced that they would no longer ship petroleum to nations supporting israel which meant the united states and its allies in western europe.
at about the same time the opec nations agreed to raise their prices by 400 percent.
these twin shocks produced momentary economic chaos in the west.
the united states suffered its first fuel shortage since world war ii.
and although the boycott ended a few months later the price of energy continued to skyrocket both because of opec s new militant policies and because of the weakening competi tive position of the dollar in world markets.
but inflation was only one of the new problems facing the u s economy.
another was the decline of the nations manufacturing sector.
american industry had flourished in the after math of world war ii.
by the 1970s however the climate for american manufacturing had changed significantly.
many of the great industrial plants were now many decades old much less efficient than the newer plants that japan and european industrial nations had constructed after the war.
in some industries notably steel and automobiles management had become complacent and bureaucratic.
most important american manufacturing now faced major competition from abroad not only in world trade which still constituted only a small part of the u s economy but also at home.
automobiles steel and many other manufactured goods from japan and europe established major footholds in the u s markets.
some of americas new competitors benefited from lower labor costs than their u s counterparts.
thus the 1970s marked the beginning of a long painful process of deindustrialization during which thousands of factories across the country closed deindustrialization j.
their gates and millions of workers lost their jobs.
new employment opportunities were becoming available in other growing areas of the economy technology information systems and many other knowledge based 832 chapter 30 industries that would ultimately drive an extraordinary if unbalanced economic revival in the 1980s and 1990s.
but many industrial workers were poorly equipped to move into those jobs.
the result was a growing pool of unemployed and underemployed workers the virtual disappearance of industrial jobs from many inner cities where large numbers of minorities lived and the impoverishment of communities dependent on particular industries.
some of the nation s manufacturing sectors ultimately revived but few regained the size and dominance they had enjoyed in the 1950s and 1960s.
inequality inequality in income and wealth is a characteristic of every nation but in the last four decades that inequality has become dramatically more unequal in the united states.
from the end of world war ii to the middle of the 1970s increases in incomes and to a lesser extent increases in total wealth grew at about the same rate across the range of incomes.
people in the bottom 20 percent of the income scale saw their incomes increase at about the same rate that people in the top 20 percent of the income scale did.
but beginning in about 1973 that pattern began to change dramatically.
the top 20 percent of earners saw their incomes rise at a much higher rate than did the earners below them.
the top 5 percent did even better.
and the top 1 percent did far better still earning 24 percent of total income.
at the same time people in the bottom 20 percent saw their incomes slowly decrease while the middle class earners saw their earnings remain relatively stagnant with incomes rising at about the same rate as inflation.
there are many explanations for this growing inequality.
the decline of industry in the united states has pushed many once well paid workers into much lower paid nonunion jobs.
income tax reductions have increased the incomes of the wealthiest americans much more rapidly than they have increased the incomes of lower income people.
the growth of the financial sector and the extraordinary wealth that many financiers have accumulated in recent decades has helped concentrate income and wealth at the top in unprecedented ways.
whether this inequality is a danger to american democracy as many people believe or a product of economic success that has improved or will improve the lot of everyone as many others believe it is nevertheless the case that the incomes in the united states are far more unequal today than they were a generation or more ago.
the nixon response the nixon administration responded to these mounting economic problems by focusing on the one thing it thought it could control inflation.
placing conservative economists at the head of the federal reserve board he ensured sharply higher interest rates and a contraction of the money supply.
but the tight money policy did little to curb inflation the cost of living rose a cumulative 15 percent during nixons first two and a half years in office.
economic growth in the mean time declined.
the united states was stagflation encountering a new and puzzling dilemma stagflation a combination of rising prices and general economic stagnation.
in the summer of 1971 nixon imposed a ninety day freeze on all wages and prices at their existing levels.
then in november he launched what he called phase ii of his economic plan mandatory guidelines for wage and price increases to be administered by a federal agency.
inflation subsided temporarily but the recession continued.
fearful that the recession would be more damaging than inflation in an election year the administration reversed itself late in 1971 interest rates were allowed to drop sharply and government spending grew.
the new tactics helped revive the economy in the short term but inflation rose substantially particularly after the administration abandoned the strict phase ii controls.
in 1973 prices rose 9 percent in 1974 after the arab oil embargo and the opec price increases they rose 12 percent the highest rate since the relaxation of price controls shortly after world war ii.
the value of the dollar continued to slide and the nations international trade continued to decline.
the watergate crisis although economic problems greatly concerned the american people in the 1970s another stunning development almost entirely preoccupied the nation beginning early in 1973 the fall of richard nixon.
the scandals nixons crisis was in part a result of long term changes in the presidency.
public expectations of the president had increased yhe dramatically in the years since world war changing vet t ie constraints placed on the author presidency ity f the office had grown as well.
in response a succession of presidents had sought new methods for the exercise of power often stretching the law occasionally breaking it.
nixon greatly accelerated these trends.
facing a democratic congress hostile to his goals he attempted to find ways to circumvent the legislature whenever possible.
saddled with a federal bureaucracy unresponsive to his wishes he constructed a hierarchy in which virtually all executive power became concentrated in the white house.
operating within a rigid even autocratic staff structure the president became a solitary at times brooding figure.
unknown to all but a few intimates he also became mired in a pattern of illegalities and abuses of power that in late 1972 began to break through to the surface.
early on the morning of june 17 1972 police arrested five men who had broken into the offices of the democratic national committee in the watergate office building in the crisis of authority.
833 the washington d c two others were seized bre hc in15 a shrt time later and charged with super vising the break in.
when reporters for the washington post began researching the backgrounds of the culprits they discovered that among those involved in the burglary were former employees of the committee for the re election of the president.
one of them had worked in the white house.
moreover they had been paid to execute the break in from a secret fund of the reelection committee a fund controlled by members of the white house staff.
public interest in the disclosures grew slowly in the last months of 1972.
early in 1973 however the watergate burglars went on trial and under relentless prodding from federal judge john j sirica one of the defendants james w mccord agreed to cooperate both with the grand jury and with a special senate investigating committee.
mccords testimony opened a floodgate of confessions and for months a parade of white house and campaign officials exposed one illegality after another.
foremost among them was a member of the inner circle of the white house counsel to the president john dean who leveled allegations against nixon himself.
two different sets of scandals emerged from the investigations.
one was a general pattern of abuses of power involving both the white house and the nixon campaign committee which included but was not limited to the watergate break in.
the other scandal and the one that became the major focus of public attention for nearly two years was the way in which the administration tried to manage the investigations of the watergate break in and other abuses a pattern of behavior that became known as the cover up there was never any conclusive evidence that the president had planned or approved the watergate burglary in advance.
but there was evidence that he had been involved in illegal efforts to obstruct investigations and withhold information.
testimony before the senate provided evidence of the complicity of dean attorney general john mitchell top white house assistants h r haldeman and john ehrlichman and others.
as interest in the case grew to some cover up thing approaching a national obsession the investigation focused increasingly on a single question in the words of senator howard baker of tennessee what did the president know and when did he know it nixon accepted the departure of those members of his administration implicated in the scandals.
but he continued to insist that he himself was innocent.
there the matter might have rested had it not been for the disclosure during the senate hearings of a white house taping system that had recorded virtually every conversation in the president s office during the period in question.
all the groups investigating the scandals sought access to the tapes nixon pleading executive privilege refused to release them.
a special prosecutor appointed by the president to handle the watergate cases harvard law professor archibald cox took nixon to court in october 1973 in an effort to force him to relinquish the recordings.
nixon fired cox and suffered the humiliation of watching saturday night massacre both attorney general elliot richardson and his deputy resign in protest.
this saturday night massacre made the presidents predicament infinitely worse.
not only did public pressure force him to appoint a new special prosecutor texas attorney leon jaworski who proved just as determined as cox to subpoena the tapes but the episode also pre cipitated an investigation by the house of representatives into the possibility of impeachment.
the fall of richard nixon nixons situation deteriorated further in the following months.
late in 1973 vice president spiro agnew became embroiled in a scandal of his own when evidence surfaced that he had accepted bribes and kickbacks while serving as governor of maryland and even as vice president.
in return for a justice department agreement not to press the case agnew pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of income tax evasion and resigned from the government.
with the controversial agnew no longer in line to succeed to the presidency the prospect of removing nixon from the white house became less worrisome to his opponents.
the new vice president the first appointed under the terms of the twenty fifth amendment which had been adopted in 1967 was house minority leader gerald ford an amiable and popular michigan congressman.
in april 1974 in an effort to head off further subpoenas of the tapes the president released transcripts of a number of relevant conversations claiming that they proved his innocence.
but even these edited tapes seemed to suggest nixons complicity in the cover up.
in july the crisis reached a climax.
first the supreme court ruled unanimously in united states v richard m nixon that the president must relinquish the tapes to special prosecutor jaworski.
days later the house judiciary committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment charging that nixon had first obstructed justice in the watergate cover up second misused federal agencies to violate the rights of citizens and third defied the authority of congress by refusing to deliver tapes and other materials subpoenaed by the committee.
even without additional evidence nixon might well have been impeached by the full house and convicted by the senate.
early in august however he provided at last what many wavering members of congress had begun to call the smoking gun among the tapes that the supreme court compelled nixon to relinquish were several that offered apparently incontrovertible evidence of his involvement in the watergate cover up.
only days after the burglary the recordings disclosed the president had ordered the fbi to stop investigating the break in.
impeachment and conviction now seemed inevitable.
for several days nixon brooded in the white house.
finally on august 8 1974 he announced his resignation the first president in american history ever to nixon resigns do sq at noon the next while nixon u s v richard m nixon 834 chapter 30 i i nixons farewell only moments before nixon had been in tears saying good bye to his staff in the east room of the white house.
but as he boarded a helicopter to begin his trip home to california shortly after resigning as president he flashed his trademark victory sign to the crowd on the white house lawn.
bettmann corbis and his family were flying west to their home in california gerald ford took the oath of office as president.
many americans expressed relief and exhilaration that as the new president put it wour long national nightmare is over but the wave of good feeling could not obscure the deeper and more lasting damage of the watergate crisis.
in a society in which distrust of leaders and institutions of authority was already widespread the fall of richard nixon seemed to confirm the most cynical assumptions about the character of american public life.
looking back the victory of richard nixon in the 1968 presidential election represented a popular repudiation of turbulence and radicalism.
it was a call for a restoration of order and stability.
but order and stability were not the dominant characteristics of nixons troubled years in office.
he entered office rather when the forces of the left and the counterculture were approaching the peak of their influence.
american culture and society in the late 1960s and early 1970s were shaped decisively by and were deeply divided over the challenges of young people to the norms by which most americans had lived.
also in those years a host of new liberation movements joined the drive for racial equality and women mobilized effectively and powerfully to demand changes in the way their society treated gender differences.
nixon had run for office attacking the failure of his predecessor to end the war in vietnam.
but during the first four years of his presidency the war and the protests against it continued and even in some respects escalated.
the division of opinion over the war was as deep as any of the many other divisions in national life.
it continued to poison the nations politics and social fabric until the american role in the conflict finally shuddered to a close in 1973.
the crisis of authority 835 but much of the controversy and division in the 1970s was a product of the nixon presidency itself nixon was in many ways a dynamic and even visionary leader who proposed but rarely succeeded in enacting some important domestic reforms and who made important changes in american foreign policy most notably making overtures to communist china and forging detente with the soviet union.
he was also however a devious and secretive man whose white house staff became engaged in a series of covert activities many of them connected with the presidents reelection campaign in 1972 that produced the most dramatic political scandal in american history.
watergate as it was called preoccupied much of the nation for nearly two years beginning in 1972 and ultimately in the summer of 1974 the scandal forced richard nixon who had been reelected to office only two years before by one of the largest majorities in modern history to become the first president in american history to resign.
he was a victim in part of the passions and divisions of his time and of the vietnam war which he had inherited but had not been able to end quickly.
he was a victim as well of his own insecurities and resentments.
whatever the causes of his fall however the greatest cost of watergate was not what it did to nixon himself but how it damaged the faith of the american people in their leaders and their government.
that faith would remain weak through the remainder of the century and beyond.

what economic and energy problems plagued the presidencies of gerald ford and jimmy carter.
how did ford and carter attempt to deal with these problems.
what was the new right and what effect did its rise have on american politics.
what was reaganomics and how did this policy affect the national economy.
setting the stage the frustrations of the early 1970s the defeat in vietnam the watergate crisis economic difficulties seriously damaged the confident nationalism and liberalism that had characterized so much of the postwar era.
many americans began to wonder whether the age of a growing economy and growing expectations was giving way to a new age of limits in which america would have to learn to survive with less of everything money energy opportunities global power and thus would have to accept constricted expectations.
at the end of the decade however the idea of an age of limits met a powerful and ultimately decisive challenge that combined a conservative rejection of some of the heady visions of the 1960s with a reinforced commitment to economic growth international power and american virtue.
throughout the 1970s a powerful grassroots conservative movement grew rapidly in many parts of the united states bringing together those who wanted a more conservative economic policy and those who were concerned about such cultural questions as religion and sexuality.
the most potent symbol of this growing movement was ronald reagan who was elected president in 1980 and who for the next eight years became a symbol of a new kind of confident conservatism that would soon have enormous influence in the united states and in many other parts of the world.
reagan s personal popularity was an important part of his success but so was an impressive economic revival that helped win support for his ideas.
politics and diplomacy after watergate in the aftermath of richard nixons departure from office many americans wondered whether trust in the presidency and in the government as a whole could easily be restored.
the administrations of the two presidents who succeeded nixon tried to answer those questions.
the ford custodianship gerald ford inherited the presidency under unenviable circumstances.
he had to try to rebuild confidence in government after the watergate scandals and to restore economic prosperity in the midst of difficult domestic and international conditions.
the new presidents effort to establish himself as a symbol of political integrity suffered a set nixon back only a month after he took office when he granted richard nixon a full pardoned free and absolute pardon for any crimes he may have committed during his presidency.
much of the public suspected a secret deal with the former president.
the pardon caused a decline in fords popularity from which he never fully recovered.
the ford administration enjoyed less success in its effort to solve the problems of the american economy.
in his efforts to curb inflation the president rejected the idea of wage and price controls and called instead for largely ineffective voluntary efforts.
ford had to deal with a serious recession in 1974 and 1975 a task made more difficult by the continuing energy crisis.
in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo of 1973 the opec cartel began to raise the price of oil by 400 percent in 1974 alone one of the principal reasons why inflation reached 11 percent in 1976.
ford retained henry kissinger as secretary of state and continued the policies of the nixon fords years late in 1974 ford met with soviet premier leonid brezhnev at vladivostok diplomatic in siberia and signed an arms control accord that was to serve as the basis for successes salt ii thus achieving a goal the nixon administration had long sought.
meanwhile in the middle east henry kissinger helped produce a new accord by which israel agreed to return large portions of the occupied sinai to egypt.
fords policies came under attack from both the right and the left.
in the 1976 republican primary campaign ford faced a powerful challenge from former california governor ronald reagan leader of the partys conservative wing.
he spoke for many on the right who were unhappy with any conciliation of communists.

his showing indicated the importance to the democratic party of having a candidate capable of attracting support in the south which was becoming increasingly republican by the 1970s.
what drove so many southerners into the republican party.
nomination.
the democrats in the meantime were gradually uniting behind a new and before 1976 little known candidate jimmy carter a former governor of georgia who organized a brilliant primary campaign by offering honesty piety and an outsiders skepticism of the federal government.
and while carters mammoth lead in opinion polls dwindled by election day unhappiness with the economy and a general disenchantment with ford enabled the democrat to hold on for a narrow victory.
carter emerged with 50 percent of the popular vote to fords 47 9 percent and 297 electoral votes to fords 240.
the trials of jimmy carter like ford jimmy carter assumed the presidency at a moment when the nation faced problems of staggering complexity and difficulty.
carter had campaigned for the presidency as an outsider representing americans suspicious of entrenched bureaucracies and complacent public officials.
he sur carters lack rounded himself in the white house with a of direction group of close knit associates from georgia.
carter was exceptionally intelligent but his critics charged that he provided no overall vision or direction to his government.
his ambitious legislative agenda included major reforms of the tax and welfare systems congress passed virtually none of it.
carter devoted much of his time to the problems of energy and the economy.
entering office in the midst of a recession he moved first to reduce unemployment by raising public spending and cutting federal taxes.
unemployment declined but inflation soared largely because of the continuing increases in energy prices imposed on the west by opec.
during carters high interest ast two years in ffice oil prices rose at well rates over a 10 percent annual rate.
like nixon and ford before him carter responded with a combination of tight money and calls for voluntary restraint.
by 1980 interest rates had risen to the highest levels in american history at times they exceeded 20 percent.

the american negotiator richard holbrooke finally brought the warring parties together in 1995 and crafted an agreement to partition bosnia.
the republican resurgence in 1994 for the first time in forty years republicans gained control of both houses of congress.
throughout 1995 the republican congress worked at a sometimes feverish pace to construct an ambitious and even radical legislative program.
the republicans proposed a series of measures to transfer important powers from the federal government to the states.
they proposed dramatic reductions in federal spending including a major restructuring of the medicare program.
in all these efforts they could count on a disciplined republican majority in the house and an only slightly less united republican majority in the senate.
president clinton responded to the 1994 election results by proclaiming that the era of big government is over and shifting his own agenda conspicuously to the center.
he announced his own plan to cut taxes and balance the budget.
but compromise between the president and the republicans in congress became difficult.
in november 1995 and again in january 1996 the federal government shut down for several days because the president and congress could not agree on a budget.
that proved to be an epic political blunder.
public opinion turned quickly and powerfully against the republican leadership and much of its agenda.
house speaker newt gingrich quickly became discredited while president clinton slowly improved his standing in the polls.
the election of 1996 by 1996 president clinton was in a commanding position to win reelection.
unopposed for the democratic nomination he faced a republican opponent senator robert dole of kansas who inspired little enthusiasm even within his own party.
clintons revival was a result of his adroitness in taking centrist positions that under clinton versus dole mined the republicans and in championing traditional democratic issues that were broadly popular.
but his greatest strength came from the remarkable success of the american economy.
like reagan in 1984 he could campaign as the champion of peace prosperity and national well being.
as the election approached congress passed several important bills.
it raised the legal minimum wage for the first time in more than a decade.
and it passed a welfare reform bill which president clinton somewhat reluctantly signed that marked the most important change in aid to the poor since the social security act of 1935.
the bill ended the fifty year federal guarantee of assistance to families with dependent children and turned most of the responsibility for allocating federal welfare funds now greatly reduced to the states.
most important it shifted the bulk of welfare benefits away from those without jobs and toward support for low wage workers.
clintons buoyant campaign flagged slightly in the last weeks but the president nevertheless received just over 49 percent of the popular vote.
clinton won 379 electoral votes to doles 159 ross perot received 0 electoral votes.
but other democrats made only modest gains and failed to regain either house of congress.
clinton triumphant and embattled bill clinton was the first democratic president to win two terms as president since franklin roosevelt.
he still faced a hostile republican congress.
he proposed a modest domestic agenda consisting of tax cuts and tax credits targeted at middle class clinton and gingrich for a time after republicans won control of both houses of congress in 1994 some observers suggested that newt gingrich was now the most powerful figure in government and that president clinton was as some journalists suggested irrelevant.
but clinton surprised everyone by working cordially with gingrich and in the process rebuilding his own popularity.

after the 1994 republican landslide in the congressional elections bill clinton had seemed permanently weakened.
what explains clinton s political revival.
budget americans to help them educate their chil surpluses dren.
he also negotiated effectively with the republican leadership on a plan for a balanced budget which passed late in 1997.
by the end of 1998 the federal budget was generating its first surplus in thirty years.
clinton needed the popularity he had gained from the budget surplus when the most serious crisis of his presidency emerged.
clinton had been bedeviled by scandals from his first weeks in office.
in early 1998 the president was charged with having had a sexual relationship with a young white house intern monica lewinsky and lying about it in a deposition.
those revelations produced a new investigation by the independent counsel in the whitewater case kenneth starr a former judge and official in the reagan justice department.
clinton forcefully denied the charges and the public strongly backed him.
his popularity soared to record levels and remained high throughout the year that followed.
the lewinsky scandal revived again in august 1998 when lewinsky struck a deal with the independent counsel and testified about her relationship with clinton.
starr then subpoe naed clinton himself who finally admitted that he and lewinsky monica lewinsky had what he called an improper relationship a few weeks later starr recommended that congress impeach the president.
the house judiciary committee and then on december 19 1998 the full house approved two counts of impeachment lying to the grand jury and obstructing justice.
the matter impeachment r en moveclt0 he senate where a trial of the president the first since the trial of andrew johnson in 1868 began in early january.
the trial ended with a decisive acquittal of the president.
in 1999 the president faced the most serious foreign policy crisis of his presidency once again in the balkans.
a long simmering kosovo conflict between the serbian government of yugoslavia and kosovo separatists erupted into a savage civil war in 1998.
in may 1999 nato forces dominated and led by the united states began a bombing campaign against the serbians which after little more than a week led the leader of yugoslavia slobodan milosevic to agree to a cease fire.
serbian troops withdrew from kosovo.
they were replaced by nato peacekeeping forces.
a precarious peace returned to the region.
clinton finished his eight years in office with his popularity higher than it had been when he had taken office.
indeed public approval of clintons presidency a presidency marked by astonishing prosperity and general world stability was consistently among the highest of any postwar president despite the many scandals and setbacks he suffered in the white house.
the election of 2000 george w bush versus al gore the 2000 presidential election was one of the most extraordinary in american history not because of the campaign that preceded it but because of the sensational controversy over its results.
george w bush a republican a son of the former president and a second term governor of texas and vice president al gore a democrat easily won the nominations of their parties.
both men ran cautious centrist campaigns.
polls showed an exceptionally tight race right up to the end.
in the congressional races republicans maintained control of the house of florida representatives by five seats while the senate split evenly between democrats and republicans.
in the presidential race gore won the national popular vote by about 540 000 votes out of about 100 million cast or.
but on election night both candidates remained short of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory because no one could determine who had won the electoral votes of florida.
after a mandatory recount over the next two days bush led gore in the state by fewer than 300 votes.
when a court ordered deadline arrived the recount was not yet complete.
the florida secretary of state a republican then certified bush the winner in florida by a little more than 500 votes.
the gore campaign contested the results.
the supreme courts decision 860 chapter 32 election night 2000 the electronic billboard in new york citys times square showing network coverage of the presidential contest reports george bush the winner of the 2000 presidential race late on election night.
a few hours later the networks retracted their projections because of continuing uncertainty over the results in florida.
five weeks later and then only because of the controversial intervention of the supreme court bush finally emerged the victor.
chris hondros getty images late on december 12 the u s supreme court issued a controversial 5 4 decision for bush and the long election ended.
the second bush presidency george w bush assumed the presidency in january 2001 burdened by both the controversies surrounding his election and the perception that he was ill prepared for the office.
bushs principal campaign promise had been that he would bush tax cuts use pre ictec budget surplus to finance a massive tax reduction.
he narrowly won passage of the largest tax cut in american history 1 35 tril lion over several years.
having campaigned as a moderate adept at building coalitions across party lines bush governed as a staunch 51 of electorate voting the election of 2000 the 2000 presidential election was one of the closest and most controversial in american history.
it also starkly revealed a new pattern of party strength which had been developing over the previous decade.
democrats swept the northeast and most of the industrial midwest and carried all the states of the pacific coast.
republicans swept the south the plains states and the mountain states with the exception of new mexico and held on to a few traditional republican strongholds in the midwest.
compare this map to those of earlier elections in particular the election of 1896 and ask how the pattern of party support changed over the course of the twentieth century.
conservative relying on one of the most orthodox members of his own party for support.
the presidents political adviser karl rove encouraged the administration to take increasingly conservative positions.
bush appealed to the gun lobby by refusing to support a renewal of the assault weapons ban that clinton had enacted.
he proposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.
the bush administration was part of a broad and successful effort to mobilize evangelical christians as an active part of the republican coalition.
but almost from the beginning the aftermath of the september 11 attacks dominated both bushs presidency and the nations politics.
the election of 2004 the 2004 election pitted president bush who was unopposed within his party against john kerry a democratic senator from massachusetts.
throughout the months before the election voters were almost evenly divided again.
the election itself although very close was more decisive than the election of 2000.
bush won 51 percent of the popular vote to kerrys 48.

but most of these changes were at least in part a product of the dramatic transformation of the american economy.
from stagflation to growth the roots of the economic growth of the 1980s 1990s and 2000s lay in part in the troubled years of the 1970s when the united states seemed for a time to be losing its ability to produce long term prosperity.
in the face of the sluggish growth and persistent inflation of those years however many american corporations began making important changes in the way they ran their businesses changes that contributed to both the prosperity of the last decades of the twentieth century and the growing inequality that pra tkzes accompanied it.
businesses invested heavily in new technology to make themselves more efficient and productive.
corporations began to consider mergers to provide themselves with a more diversified basis for growth.
many enterprises created more energy efficient plants and offices.
perhaps most important of all american businesses sought to reduce their labor costs which were among the highest in the world and which many economists and business leaders believed had made the united states the election of 2004 the 2004 election repeated the pattern established in 2000.
the democrats led this time by massachusetts senator john f kerry swept the northeast most of the industrial midwest and the pacific coast.
the republicans led by president bush carried almost everything else.
although bush s popular and electoral margins were both larger than they had been in 2000 the election remained extremely close.
uncompetitive against the many emerging economies that relied on low wage workers.
businesses cut labor costs in many ways.
they took a much harder line against unions.
nonunion companies became more successful in staving off unionization drives.
some companies moved their operations to areas of the country where unions were weak and wages low the american south and midwest in particular.
and many companies moved much of their production out of the united states to such nations as mexico and china where there were large available pools of cheaper labor.
digital technology made possible an enormous range of new products computers the internet cellular phones digital music video and cameras personal wustries digital assistants and many other products.
the technology industries created many new jobs and produced new consumer needs and appetites.
but they did not create as many jobs as older industrial sectors had.
the american economy experienced rapid growth in the last decades of the twentieth century and into the twenty first.
the gross national product the total of goods and services produced by the united states almost quadrupled in twenty years from 2 7 trillion in 1980 to over 9 8 trillion in 2000 to 15 7 trillion by 2013.
inflation was low throughout these decades never rising above 3 percent in any year.
stock prices 862 chapter 32 soared to unprecedented levels and with few interruptions from the mid 1980s to the end of the century.
the dow jones industrial average the most common index of stock performance stood at 1 000 in late 1980.
late in 1999 it passed 11 000 and in november 2013 it peaked at 16 000 for the first time ever.
economic growth was particularly robust in the last years of the 1990s.
in 1997 and 1998 annual growth rates reached 5 percent for the first time since the 1960s.
most impressive of all was the longevity of the boom.
from 1994 to 2000 the economy recorded growth at times very substantial growth in every year indeed in every quarter something that had never before happened so continuously in peacetime.
the two tiered economy although the american economy revived from the sluggishness of the 1970s and early 1980s the benefits of the new economy were less widely shared than those of earlier boom times.
the increasing abundance of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries created enormous new wealth that enriched those talented or lucky enough to profit from the areas of booming growth.
the rewards for education particularly in such areas as science and engineering increased substantially.
the gross domestic product was more than 15 trillion at the end of 2013.
even so incomes remained flat for most americans.
poverty in the country had steadily declined sometimes dramatically in the years after world war ii so that by the end of the 1970s the percentage of people living in poverty had fallen to 12 percent from 20 percent in preceding decades.
but the decline in poverty did not continue and in 2013 it reached 15 percent of the population which means that 46 million americans were living in poverty.
globalization perhaps the most important economic change was what became known as the globalization of the economy.
the great prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s had rested on the relative insulation of the united states from the pressures of international competition.
as late as 1970 international trade still played a relatively small role in the american economy which thrived on the basis of the huge domestic market in north america.
by the end of the 1970s however the world had intruded on the american economy in profound ways and that intrusion increased unabated into the twenty first century.
exports rose from just under 43 billion in 1970 to over 1 trillion in 2006.
but imports rose even more dramatically from just over 40 billion in 1970 to over 1 8 trillion in 2006.
most american products in other words now faced foreign competition inside the united states.

reed saxon ap images science and technology in the new economy the new economy that emerged in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries was driven by dramatic new scientific and technological discoveries that had profound effects on the way americans and peoples throughout the world lived.
the digital revolution the most visible element of the technological revolution to most americans was the dramatic growth in the use of computers and other digital electronic devices in almost every area of life.
among the most significant innovations that contributed to the digital revolution was the development of the microprocessor first introduced in 1971 by intel which represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry.
a microprocessor miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer making it possible for a small machine to perform calculations the age of globalization 863 that in the past only very large machines could do.
considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was at first known as a minicomputer and then a personal computer but in 1977 apple launched its apple ii personal computer the first such machine to be widely available to the public.
several years later development ibm entered the personal computer market of the pc widl tde drst had engaged a small software development company microsoft to design an operating system for its new computer.
microsoft produced a program known as ms dos dos for disk operating system.
no pc could operate without it.
the pc and its software made its debut in august 1981 and immediately became enormously successful.
the computer revolution created thousands of new lucrative businesses computer manufacturers new companies quickly began to rival ibm in the pc market makers of the tiny silicon chips that ran the computers and allowed smaller and smaller machines to become more and more powerful and manufacturers of accessories and software.
the internet out of the computer revolution emerged another dramatic source of information and communication the internet.
it had arpa its beginning in 1963 in the u s govern ments advanced research projects agency arpa which funneled federal funds into scientific research projects many of them defense related.
by 1971 twenty three computers were linked together in arpas network which served mostly research labs and universities.
gradually interest in the system began to spread and with it the number of computers connected to it.
the network soon renamed the internet was then free to develop independently.
it did so rapidly especially after the invention of technologies that made possible digital mail e mail and the emergence of the personal computer which vastly increased the number of potential users of the internet.
as late as 1984 there remained fewer than a thousand host computers connected to the internet.
a decade later there were over 6 million.
and by 2013 over two billion computers were in use around the world.
as the amount of information on the internet proliferated without any central direction new forms of software emerged to make it possible for individual users to navigate through the vast number of internet sites.
in 1989 tim world wide web berners lee a british scientist working at a laboratory in geneva introduced the world wide web through which individual users could publish information for the internet.
it helped establish an orderly system for both the distribution and retrieval of electronic information.
breakthroughs in genetics computer technology helped fuel explosive growth in all areas of scientific research particularly genetics.
early discoveries in genetics by gregor mendel thomas hunt morgan and others had laid the groundwork for more dramatic breakthroughs the discovery of dna by the british scientists oswald avery colin macleod and maclyn mccarty in 1944 and in 1953 the discovery by the american biochemist james watson and the british biophysicist francis crick of its double helix structure and thus of the key to identifying genetic codes.
from these discoveries emerged the new science and ultimately the new industry of genetic engineering through which new medical treatments and new techniques for hybridization of plants and animals became possible.
little by little scientists began to identify specific genes in humans and other living things that determine particular traits and to learn how to alter or reproduce them.
but the identification of genes was painfully slow.
in 1989 the federal government appropriated 3 billion to fund the national center for the human genome to accelerate the mapping of human genes.
the human genome project identified 3 billion genes by 2013.
in the meantime dna research had already attracted considerable public attention.
the dna structure of an individual scientists have discovered is as unique and as identifiable as a fingerprint.
dna testing therefore makes it possible to identify individuals through their blood semen skin or even hair.
it plays a major role in criminal investigations among other things.
human genome project a changing society the american population changed dramatically in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries.
it grew larger older and more racially and ethnically diverse.
a shifting population decreasing birth rates and growing life spans contributed to one of the most important characteristics of the american twenty four hour news cycle with the vast popularity of digital communication news events are reported every hour of every day rather than during scheduled television programs or from reading the newspaper.
with a portable tablets or smart phones a person can keep up with what is new at any time or any place.
politicians now have much less control over how their messages are transmitted and received.
ian dagnall alamy 864 chapter 32 the human genome this computerized image is a digital representation of part of the human genome the constellation of genetic material that makes up the human body.
the human genome project one of the most ambitious in the history of science set out in the late 1990s to chart the human genetic structure.
each color in this image represents one of the four chemical components of dna the principal material of genes.
mario tama getty images population in the twenty first century its increasing agedness.
the enormous baby boom generation people born in the first ten years after world war ii drove the median age steadily upward from 34 in 1996 to 37 in 2010 to a projected 39 by 2035.
this growing population of aging americans contributed to stresses on the social security and medicare systems including the provisions of the affordable care act introduced by president obama.
it also had important implications for the workforce.
in the last twenty years of the twentieth century the number of people aged 25 54 known statistically as the prime workforce grew by over 26 million.
in the first ten years of the twenty first century the number of workers in that age group did not grow at all.
the slowing growth of the native born population and the workforce shortages it has helped to create is one reason for the rapid growth of immigration.
in 2010 the number of foreign born residents of the united states was the highest in american history more than 36 million people over 12 percent of the total population.
these immigrants came from a wider variety of backgrounds than ever before as a result of the 1965 immigration reform act which eliminated national origins as a criterion for admission.
the growing presence of the foreign born contributed to a significant drop in the percentage of white residents in the united states from 90 percent in 1965 the year of the immigration reform act to 74 in 2014.

population 1 m decl n n9 b rth rate have on the a9e structure of the the age of globalization 865 the largest groups of immigrants in these years.
but others came in significant numbers from africa the middle east russia and eastern europe.
african americans in the post civil rights era the civil rights movement and the other liberal efforts of the 1960s had two very different effects on african americans.
on the one hand there were increased opportunities for advancement available to those in a position to take advantage of them.
on the other hand as the industrial economy declined and government services dwindled there was a growing sense of helplessness and despair among large groups of nonwhites who continued to find themselves barred from upward mobility.
economic progress for african americans the underclass for the black middle class which in the first decade of the twenty first century constituted over half of the african american population of america progress was remarkable in the decades after the high point of the civil rights movement.
african american families moved into more affluent urban and suburban communities.
the percentage of black high school graduates going on to college was virtually the same as that of white high school graduates by the early twenty first century although a smaller proportion of blacks than whites completed high school.
just over 20 percent of african americans over the age of twenty four held bachelors degrees or higher in 2010 compared to 30 percent of whites a significant advance from twenty years earlier.
and african americans were making rapid strides in many professions in which only a generation earlier they had been barred or segregated.
over half of all employed blacks in the united states had skilled white collar jobs in 2010.
there were few areas of american life from which blacks were any longer entirely excluded.
but there were still many other african americans whom the economic growth and the liberal programs of the 1960s and beyond had never reached.
these impoverished people sometimes described as the underclass made up as much as a third of the nations black population.
many of them lived in isolated decaying and desperately poor inner city neighborhoods.
as more successful blacks moved out of the inner cities the poor were left behind in their decaying neighborhoods.
less than half of young inner city african americans finished high school in 2006 more than 60 percent were unemployed.
the black family structure suffered as well from the dislocations of urban poverty.
there was a radical increase in the number of single parent femaleheaded black households.
in 1970 only 59 percent of all black children under 18 lived with both their parents already down from 70 percent a decade earlier.
in 2010 only 35 percent of black children lived in such households while 74 percent of white children did.

the immigration of the 1980s and 1990s was the highest since the late nineteenth century.
comstock what role did the 1965 act have in increasing immigration levels.
sources of immigration 1995 2010 the immigration reform act of 1965 lifted the national quotas imposed on immigration policy in 1924 and opened immigration to large areas of the world that had previously been restricted.
in 1965 90 percent of the immigrants to the united states came from europe.
as this chart shows by 2010 almost the reverse was true.
well over 80 percent of all immigrants came from non european sources.
the most important countries of origin in this period were in order mexico china the philippines india vietnam and cuba.
what impact did this new immigration have on american politics.
866 chapter 32 occupational sector manufacturing white collar comparison of black and white occupational distribution 2005 by the early twenty first century as this chart makes clear the african american middle class had grown dramatically.
over half of all employed black workers in the united states worked in white collar jobs.
perhaps even more striking given the distribution of the black population a half century earlier is that almost no african americans about one third of 1 percent were working in agriculture by the early 2000s.
but the gap between black and white workers remained wide in several areas particularly in the percentage of each group employed in low wage service jobs.
what factors contributed to the increase of the black middle class in the years after 1960.
modern plagues drugs and aids two new and deadly epidemics ravaged many american communities beginning in the 1980s.
one was a dramatic increase in drug use which penetrated nearly every community in the nation.
the enormous demand for drugs particularly for crack cocaine in the late 1980s and early 1990s spawned what was in effect a multibillion dollar industry.
drug use declined significantly among middle class people beginning in the late 1980s but the epidemic declined much more slowly in the poor urban neighborhoods where it was doing the most severe damage.
the drug epidemic was related to another scourge of the late twentieth century the epidemic spread of a new and often lethal disease first documented in 1981 and soon named aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
aids is the product of the hiv virus which is transmitted by the exchange of bodily fluids blood or semen.
the first american victims of aids and for many years the group among whom cases remained the most numerous were gay men.
but by the late 1980s as the gay community began to take preventive measures the most rapid increase in the spread of the disease occurred among heterosexuals many of them intravenous drug users who spread the virus by sharing contaminated hypodermic needles.
aids epidemic in the mid 1990s aids researchers after years of frustration began discovering effective treatments for the disease.
by taking a combination of powerful drugs on a rigorous schedule even people with advanced cases of aids experienced dramatic improvement so much so that in many cases there were no measurable quantities of the virus left in their bloodstreams.
the new drugs gave promise for the first time of dramatically extending the lives of people with aids perhaps to normal life spans.
but the drugs were very expensive and difficult to administer poor aids patients often could not obtain access to them.
and the drugs remained scarce in africa and other less affluent parts of the world where the epidemic was rampant.
the united nations many philanthropic organizations and a number of governments including the united states committed significant funds to fight the aids crisis in africa in the 2000s but progress remained slow.
a contested culture american culture changed dramatically in the years after world war ii.
by the 1960s the roles of women began to change profoundly.
the sexual revolution changed traditional american values.
american culture also became more diverse open and contentious than it had been in the past.
as a result new controversies and issues emerged.
battles over feminism and abortion among the goals of what was known as the new right were challenges to feminism and its achievements.
conservatives had campaigned successfully against the proposed equal rights amendment to the constitution.
they also played a central role in the most divisive issue of the last thirty years the controversy over abortion rights.
for those who favored allowing women to choose to terminate unwanted pregnancies the supreme courts decision in roe v wade 1973 had seemed to settle the question.
by the 1980s abortion was the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the country.
but at the r ight to life movement jciiiiv.
nmc creating a powerful grassroots movement.
the right to life movement as it called itself found its most fervent supporters among catholics and indeed the catholic church itself lent its institutional authority to the battle against legalized abortion.
religious doctrine also motivated the anti abortion stance of many mormons evangelical christians and other groups.
the opposition of some other anti abortion activists had less to do with religion than with their commitment to traditional notions of family and gender relations.
to them abortion was part of a much larger assault by feminists on the role of women as wives and mothers.
it was also many foes contended a form of murder.
fetuses they claimed were human beings who had a right to life from the moment of conception.
the age of globalization 867 although the right to life movement was persistent in its demand for a reversal of roe v wade or barring that a constitutional amendment banning abortion it also attacked abortion in more limited ways at its most vulnerable points.
starting in the late 1970s congress and many state legislatures began barring the use of public funds to pay for abortions thus making them almost inaccessible for many poor women in some states.
the reagan and the two bush administrations imposed further restrictions on federal funding and even on the right of doctors in federally funded clinics to give patients any information on abortion.
extremists in the right to life movement began picketing occupying and at times bombing abortion clinics.
several anti abortion activists murdered doctors who performed abortions other physicians were subject to campaigns of terrorism and harassment.
the changing composition of the supreme court between 1981 and 2010 during which time new conservative justices were appointed to the court renewed the right to life movements hopes for a reversal of roe v wade.
the changing judicial climate of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries mobilized defenders of abortion as never before.
they called themselves the pro choice move pro choice ment because they were defending not so movement much abortion itself as every womans right to choose whether and when to bear a child.
the pro choice movement was in many parts of the country at least as strong as and in some areas much stronger than the right to life movement.
with the election of president clinton in 1992 a supporter of choice the immediate threat to roe v wade seemed to fade.
clintons reelection in 1996 was evidence that the pro choice movement maintained considerable political strength.
but abortion rights remained highly vulnerable.
clintons successor george w bush openly opposed abortion.
barack obama supported the right to abor tion when he became president.
the growth of environmentalism the environmental movement grew dramatically in the early 1970s and continues to develop in the present.
an early milestone was earth day held on april 22 1970 a day that generated wide scale interest in the environment.
the federal government displayed only light interest in the subject but many people became invested in studying the effects of global warming a steady rise in the earths temperature resulting from emissions from burned fossil fuels most notably coal and oil.
many other people either ignored or disavowed the impact of such industrial waste on the environment.
in 1997 representatives of the major industrial nations met in kyoto japan and agreed to a broad treaty to reduce carbon emissions to slow or reverse global warming.
republicans in congress prevented the ratification of this treaty in the united states.
the united states again refused to participate in this global initiative during the presidency of george w bush who argued that doing so would place too great of an economic burden on the country.
barack obama too has done little about global warming.
without the participation of the united states and china another country that has not signed the kyoto protocol most environmentalists consider the treaty to be dead.
the perils of globalization the celebration of the beginning of a new millennium on january 1 2000 was a notable moment not just because of the change in the calendar.
it was notable above all as a global event a shared and for the most part joyous experience that united the world in its exuberance.
but if the millennium celebrations suggested the bright promise of globalization other events at the dawn of the new century suggested its dark perils.

julie dermansky corbis long musical lineage of rap includes elements of the disco and street funk of the 1970s of the fast talking jive of black radio djs in the 1950s of the onstage patter of cab calloway and other african american stars of the first half of the twentieth century.
it contains reminders of tap and break dancing even of the boxing ring poetry of muhammad ali.
rap s most important element is its words.
rap is as much a form of language as a form of music.
it bears a distant resemblance to some traditions of african american pulpit oratory which also included forms of spoken song.
it draws from some of the verbal traditions of urban black street life including the dozens a ritualized trading of insults particularly popular among young black men.
but rap is also the product of a distinctive place and time the south bronx in the 1970s and 1980s and the hip hop culture that was born there and that soon dominated the appearance and public behavior of many young black males.
hip hop is how you walk talk live see act feel said one bronx hip hopper.
some elements of hip hop culture faded and by the 1990s the most popular element of hip hop culture was rap which had by then been developing for nearly twenty years.
beginning in the early 1970s bronx djs began setting up their equipment on neighborhood streets and staging block parties where they not only played records but also put on shows of their own performances that featured spoken rhymes jazzy phrases and pointed comments about the audience the neighborhood and themselves.
gradually the djs began to bring rappers into shows young men who developed the dj style into a much more elaborate form of performance usually accompanied by dancing.
as rap grew more popular in the inner city record promoters began signing some of its new stars.
in 1979 the sugarhill gang s rappers delight became the first rap single to be played on mainstream commercial radio and the first to become a major hit.
in the early 1980s run dmc became the first national rap superstars.
from there rap moved quickly to become one of the most popular and commercially successful forms of popular music in the 1990s and early 2000s rap recordings routinely sold millions of copies.
rap has taken many forms.
there have been white rappers eminem house of pain female rappers missy elliot queen latifah even religious rappers and children s rappers.
but it has always been primarily a product of the young male culture of the inner city and some of the most successful rap has conveyed the frustration and anger that these men have felt about their lives a voice for the oppressed people one rap artist said that in many other ways dont have a voice.

in the late 1980s the compton and watts neighborhoods of los angeles two of the most distressed minority communities in the city produced their own style known as west coast rap with such groups as ice cube ice t tupac shakur and snoop doggy dog.
west coast rap often had a harsh angry character and at its extremes the so called gangsta rap it could be strikingly violent and highly provocative.
scandals erupted over controversial lyrics ice t s cop killer which some critics believed advocated murdering opposing the new world order in the united states and other industrial nations opposition to globalization or to what president george h w bush once called the new world order took several forms.
many americans on both the left and the right intervention pposed the nations increasingly interven tionist foreign policy.
critics on the left charged that the united states was using military action to advance its economic interests in the 1991 gulf war and above all in the iraq war that began in 2003.
critics on the right claimed that the nation was allowing itself to be swayed by the interests of other nations as in the humanitarian interventions in somalia in 1993 and the balkans in the late 1990s and was ceding its sovereignty to international organizations.
but the most impassioned opposition to globalization in the west came from an array of groups that saw it as an economic threat.
labor unions insisted that the rapid expansion of free trade agreements led to the export of jobs from advanced nations to less developed ones.
other groups attacked working conditions in new manufacturing countries on humanitarian grounds arguing that the global economy was creating new classes of slave laborers working in conditions that few western nations would tolerate.
environmentalists argued that globalization in exporting industry to low wage countries also exported industrial pollution and toxic waste to nations that had no effective laws to control them and contributed significantly to global warming.
and still others opposed global economic arrangements on the grounds that they enriched and empowered large multinational corporations and threatened the freedom and autonomy of individuals and communities.
the opponents of globalization were mostly agreed on the targets of their discontent not just free trade agreements but also the multinational institutions that policed and advanced globalization the glbal economy among them were the protested world trade organization which monitored the enforcement of the gatt treaties of the 1990s the international monetary fund which controlled international credit and exchange rates and the world bank which made money available for development projects m many countries.

he is a rapper songwriter record producer film director entrepreneur and fashion designer.
getty images entertainment getty images police and the sexually explicit lyrics of 2 live crew and other groups which critics accused of advocating violence against women.
but it was not just the lyrics that caused the furor.
rap artists were almost all products of tough inner city neighborhoods and the rough edged styles many took with them into the public eye made many people uncomfortable.
some rappers got caught up in highly publicized trouble with the law.
several including two of rap s biggest stars tupac shakur and notorious b i g were murdered.
the business of rap particularly the confrontational business style of death row records founded by dr dre a veteran of the first major west coast rap group nwa was a source of public controversy as well.
these controversies at times unfairly dominated the image of rap as a whole.
some rap is angry and cruel as are many of the realities of the world from which it comes but much of it is explicitly positive some of it deliberately gentle.
chuck d and other successful rappers use their music to exhort young black men to avoid drugs and crime to take responsibility for their children to get an education.
and the form if not the content of the original rappers has spread widely through american culture.
rap came to dominate the music charts in america and its styles made their way onto sesame street and other children s shows into television commercials hollywood films and the everyday language of millions of people young and old black and white.
it became another of the arresting innovative african american musical traditions that have shaped american culture for more than a century.

protests in seattle 1999 when the world trade organization held its annual meeting in seattle washington in late 1999 thousands of demonstrators crowded into the city to protest the wtos role in the globalization of the economy and they believed the exploitation of working people in the united states and around the world.
their rowdy and at times violent demonstrations postponed the opening of the conference.
in this photograph a protester faces seattle police in a cloud of tear gas waiting to be arrested.

women s history challenged them to consider as well the role of gender.
throughout history many scholars now argue societies have created distinctive roles for men and women.
how those roles have been defined and the ways in which the roles affect how people and cultures behave should be central to our understanding of both the past and the present.
in the nineteenth century women s history generally stressed the unrecognized contributions of women to history for example sarah hale s 1853 record of all distinguished women from the beginning till a d 1850.
work of the same sort continued into the twentieth century and indeed continues today.
but after 1900 people committed to progressive reform movements began to produce a different kind of women s scholarship focusing primarily on the ways in which women were victimized by industrialism.
feminist scholars such as edith abbott margaret byington and katherine anthony examined the impact of economic change on working class families with a special focus on women and they looked at the often deplorable conditions in which women worked in factories mills and other people s homes.
their goal was less to celebrate women s contributions than to direct attention to the oppression of women by harsh working conditions and arouse sentiment for reform.
after the victory of the suffrage movement in 1920 women s history entered a half century of relative inactivity.
women continued to write important histories in many fields and some for example eleanor flexner whose century of struggle 1959 became a classic history of the suffrage crusade wrote explicitly about women.
mary beard best known for her sweeping historical narratives written in collaboration with her husband charles beard published women as a force in history 1964 in which she argued for the historical importance of ordinary women as shapers of society but such work at first had little impact on the writing of history as a whole.
seven leading industrial nations and the leader of russia gathered for their annual meeting in seattle washington they were confronted with tens of thousands of protesters.
most of the protesters were peaceful but some were violent clashing with police smashing store windows and all but paralyzing the city.
a few months later a smaller but still substantial demonstration disrupted meetings of the imf and the world bank in washington d c and in july 2001 at a meeting of the same leaders in genoa italy an estimated 50 000 demonstrators clashed violently with police in a melee that left one protester dead and several hundred injured.
the participants in the meeting responded to the demonstrations by pledging 1 2 billion to fight the aids epidemic in developing countries and also by deciding to hold future meetings in remote locations far from major cities.
defending orthodoxy outside the industrialized west the impact of globalization created other concerns.
many citizens of nonindustrialized nations resented the way the world economy had left them in poverty and in their view exploited and oppressed.
in some parts of the nonindustrialized world particularly in some of the islamic nations of the middle east the increasing reach of globalization created additional grievances rooted not just in economics but also in religion and culture.
the iranian revolution of 1979 in which orthodox muslims ousted a despotic government whose leaders had embraced many aspects of modern western culture was one of the first large and visible manifestations of a phenomenon that would rise of islamic eventually reach across much of the fundamentalism islamic world and threaten the stability of the globe.
in one islamic nation after another waves of fundamentalist orthodoxy emerged to defend traditional culture against incursions from the west.
one product of these resentments was a growing resort to violence as a way to fight the influence of the west.
militants in various parts of the world used isolated incidents of violence and mayhem designed to disrupt western societies and governments and to create fear among their peoples.
such tactics are known to the world as terrorism.
the rise of terrorism the term terrorism was used first during the french revolution in the 1790s to describe the actions of the radical jacobins against the french government.
the word continued to be used intermittently throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to describe the use of violence as a form of intimidation against peoples and governments.
but the wide spread understanding of terrorism as an important fact of modern life is largely a product of the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty first.
acts of what we have come to call terrorism have occurred in many parts of the world.
irish revolutionaries engaged in terrorism regularly against the english through much of the twentieth century.
jews used it in palestine against the british before the creation of israel and palestinians used it frequently against jews in israel over several decades.
revolutionary origins of terrorism 870 along with the rise in modern feminism in the 1960s and 1970s interest in women s history revived as well.
gerda lerner one of the pioneers of the new women s history once wrote of the impact of feminism on historical studies the recognition that we had been denied our history came to many of us as a staggering insight which altered our consciousness irretrievably.
much of the early work was in the contributionist tradition stressing the way in which women had played more notable roles in major historical events than historians had usually acknowledged.
other work stressed ways in which women had been victimized by their subordination to men and by their powerlessness within the industrial economy.
increasingly however women s history began to question the nature of gender itself.
some scholars began to emphasize the artificiality of gender distinctions arguing that the difference between women and men was socially constructed superficial and in the public world at least unimportant.
the history of women was therefore the history of how men with the unwitting help of many women had created and maintained a set of fictions about women s capacities that modern women were now attempting to shatter.
by the early 1980s some feminists had begun to make a very different argument that there were basic differences between women and men not just biological differences but differences in values sensibilities and culture.
the feminists of the 1970s and 1980s did not see these differences as evidence of women s incapacities.
they saw them rather as evidence of an alternative female culture capable of challenging and improving the male dominated world.
by the twenty first century some historians of women therefore began exploring areas of female experience that revealed the special character of women s culture and values family housework motherhood women s clubs and organizations female literature the social lives of working class women women s sexuality and many other subjects that suggested difference more than contributions or victimization.
partly in response some historians began to make the same argument about men that understanding masculinity and its role in shaping men s lives was as important as understanding notions of femininity in explaining the history of women.
the notion of gender as a source of social and cultural difference raised a powerful challenge to the way in which scholars view the past.
many historians continue to believe that other categories race and class in particular have in fact been more important than gender in shaping the lives of men and women.
but as joan scott a theorist of gender studies contends it is not enough simply to expand the existing story to make room for women.
rather recognizing gender as a central force in the lives of societies calls for a reconceptualization of the past.

these included the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 the explosion that brought down an american airliner over lockerbie scotland in 1988 the bombing of american embassies in 1998 the assault on the u s naval vessel cole in 2000 and other events around the world.
terrorist incidents were relatively rare but not unknown within the united states itself prior to september 11 2001.
militants on the american left performed various acts of terror in the 1960s and early 1970s.
in february 1993 a bomb exploded in the parking garage of the world trade center in new york city killing six people and causing serious but not irreparable structural damage to the towers.
several men connected with militant islamic organizations were convicted of the crime.
in april 1995 a van containing explosives blew up in front of a federal building in oklahoma city killing 168 people.
timothy mcveigh a former marine who had become part of a militant antigovernment movement of the american right was convicted of the crime in 1997 and executed in 2001.
most americans however considered terrorism a problem that mainly plagued other nations.
one of the many results of the terrible events of september 11 2001 was to jolt the american people out of complacency and alert them to the presence of continuing danger.
that awareness increased in the years following september 11.
new security measures changed the way in which americans traveled.
new government regulations altered immigration policies and affected the character of international banking.
warnings of possible new terrorist attacks created widespread tension and uneasiness.
the war on terrorism in the aftermath of september 2001 the united states government launched what president bush called a war against terrorism the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon government intelligence indicated had been planned and orchestrated by middle eastern agents of a pow al oaeda er u terrorist network known as al qaeda.
its leader osama bin laden until 2001 little known outside the arab world quickly became one of the most notorious figures in the world.
convinced that the militant taliban government of afghanistan had sheltered and supported bin laden and his organization the united states began a sustained campaign of bombing against the regime and sent in ground troops to help a resistance organization overthrow the afghan government.
afghanistans taliban regime quickly collapsed and its leaders along with the al qaeda fighters allied with them fled the capital kabul.
american and anti taliban afghan troops pursued them into the mountains but failed to capture bin laden and the other leaders of his organization.
american forces in afghanistan rounded up several hun dred people suspected of connections to the taliban and al qaeda in the aftermath of the fighting and eventually moved these prisoners to a facility at the american base in guantanamo cuba.
they were among the first suspected terrorists to be handled under the new laws created by the federal government to deal with terrorism after september 11 2001.
the patriot act of 2001 was the most important of these new laws.
the post september 11 laws and policies made it possible for suspected terrorists to be held for months and in many cases years without access to lawyers without facing formal charges subjected to intensive interrogation and torture.
they became examples to many critics of the dangers to basic civil liberties they believed the war on terrorism had created.
several supreme court rulings including one in 2008 dismissed the bush administrations argument that detainees in guantanamo were outside the reach of american law.
but the administration was slow to comply.
before his election in 2008 barack obama promised to close the guantanamo prison which had become a symbol to many people of unfair treatment.
but once in office obama found it difficult to keep this promise because of popular opposition to moving prisoners into facilities in the united states.
the iraq war in his state of the union address to congress in january 2002 president bush spoke of an axis of evil which included the nations of iraq iran and north korea all nations with anti american regimes all nations that either possessed or were thought to be trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
although president bush did not say so at the time many people around the world interpreted these words to mean that the united states would soon try to topple the government of saddam hussein in iraq.
saddam hussein on december 14 2003 american forces captured hussein at a farmhouse near tikrit iraq.
he was tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity for the death of 148 iraqi shi ites.
hussein was hanged on december 30 2006.

a f ol r a crises in the middle east in the 1970s and beyond the middle east became one of the most turbulent regions of the world and one of the regions most vital to and difficult for the united states.
the united states intervened in the middle east frequently during the cold war and beyond in ways both large and small as this map reveals.
after the events of september 2001 those interventions increased.
why did the united states have so much at stake in the middle east.
developing what came to be known as weapons of mass destruction which included nuclear weapons and agents of chemical and biological warfare.
less central to these arguments at least in the united states was the charge that the hussein government was responsible for major violations of for over a year after that the bush administration slowly built a public case for invading iraq.
much of that case rested on two claims.
one was that iraq was supporting terrorist groups that were hostile to the united states.
the other and eventually the more important was that iraq either had or was america in the world the global environmental movement o international movement for well over a century environmentalism has grown rapidly throughout the world in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries.
what began as a series of efforts to preserve wilderness sites and to clean up air and water in particular nations has evolved into a broad effort to deal with problems that affect and threaten the entire globe.
organizations both in the united states and elsewhere have sought to create an international environmental movement.
the world wildlife fund wwf was created in switzerland in 1961.
it eventually attracted more than 5 million supporters in over 90 countries and now claims to be the world s largest independent conservation organization.
greenpeace was founded in canada in 1971 in opposition to u s nuclear testing in alaska.
it too has grown into an international organization with 2 9 million financial supporters worldwide and a presence in 42 nations.
leading american environmental associations include the wilderness society the sierra club and the national audubon society.
nongovernmental organizations ngos such as greenpeace and wwf were not the only institutions to recognize environmental concerns.
in june 1972 the united nations held its first conference on the human environment.
representatives of 113 countries attended the conference to discuss issues of global environmental importance including the role of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs a chemical compound used in refrigerants and aerosol sprays in depleting the ozone layer.
after the conference the un created the united nations environment programme unep to help coordinate international efforts for environmentalism and encourage sustainable development in poorer nations around the world.
the world s first green parties political parties explicitly devoted to environmental concerns and often also to other issues of social justice appeared in 1972 beginning in new zealand the values party and tasmania the united tasmania group.
since then green parties have proliferated throughout the world including in the united states.
the most powerful green party to date has been die grune in germany founded in 1980.
large scale ecological catastrophes have often helped galvanize the global environmental movement.
among the more significant of these events was the bhopal disaster of 1984 in which a gas leak at a union carbide pesticide plant in bhopal india resulted in the deaths of an estimated 3 000 to 15 000 people.
two years later a nuclear reactor accident in the soviet city of chernobyl in ukraine caused 56 direct deaths with predictions of many thousands more deaths to follow as a result of exposure.
the area around chernobyl is expected to be partially contaminated for 24 000 years the radioactive half life of plutonium 239.
a less catastrophic nuclear accident at three mile island pennsylvania in 1979 heightened antinuclear sentiment in the united states.
in 1989 the oil tanker exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef in prince william sound alaska and spilled approximately 10 9 million gallons of crude oil.
eventually covering thousands of square miles of ocean water and 1 300 miles of alaska shoreline in oil the spill killed hundreds of thousands of animals instantly and devastated the fragile ecosystem of the sound.
an even greater oil spill occurred in the gulf of mexico in 2010 from an explosion in a deep well established by bp.
eleven people died in the explosion and almost 5 million barrels of petroleum were released into the water.
in developed industrialized nations environmental advocacy has largely focused on energy policy conservation clean technologies and changing individual and social attitudes about consumption as in the recycling movement in the developing world however the growth of environmentalism is often linked to issues of human and democratic rights and freedom from first world exploitation.
for example the green belt movement in kenya begun in 1977 by wangari maathai encouraged kenyan women to plant over 30 million trees across the nation to address the challenges of deforestation soil erosion and lack of water.
the green belt movement human rights.
except for the last none of these claims turned out to be accurate.
in march 2003 american and british troops with scant support from other countries and partial authorization from the united nations invaded iraq and quickly toppled the hussein regime.
hussein went into hiding but was eventually captured in december 2003 and executed in 2006.
in may 2003 shortly after the american capture of baghdad president bush made a dramatic appearance on an aircraft carrier off the coast of california where standing in front of a large sign reading mission accomplished he declared victory in the iraq war.
in fact the war in iraq continued for six more years during which 3 600 soldiers were killed out of just over 4 200 in total.
support for the war in the united states steadily declined in the first months of the war especially when it became clear that the weapons of mass destruction in iraq turned out not to exist.
reports of torture of iraqi prisoners by american soldiers increased the unpopularity of the war.
the invasion of iraq was the most visible evidence of a basic change in the structure of american foreign policy under the presidency of george w bush.
ever since the late 1940s when the containment policy became the cornerstone of americas role in the world the united states had worked to maintain stability in the world by containing but not often directly threatening or attacking its adversaries.
even after the cold war ended the united states continued to demonstrate a reasonable level of constraint despite its unchallenged military preeminence.
in the administrations of george h w bush and bill clinton for example american leaders worked closely with the united nations and nato to achieve u s international goals and usually resisted taking unilateral military action.
there had always been those who criticized these con straints.
they believed that america should do more than maintain stability and should move actively to topple undemocratic regimes and destroy potential enemies of the united states.
in the administration of george w bush 874 the age of globalization 875 became an important human rights and women s rights organization focused on reducing poverty and promoting peaceful democratic change through environmental conservation and protection.
maathai winner of the 2004 nobel peace prize has since served as kenyas assistant minister for environment and natural resources.
in the past two decades the environmental movement has grown even more global in scope with multilateral environmental treaties and worldwide summits becoming principal strategies of advocates.
in 1997 an international effort to reduce global warming by mandating the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions culminated in the kyoto protocols which as of late 2010 had been ratified by 183 nations with the united states a conspicuous exception.
a leading figure in bringing the issue of global warming to wide attention both in the united states and around the world has been former vice president al gore whose 2006 film an inconvenient truth may have done more to raise awareness of the threat of global warming than any other recent event.
the film won an academy award as best documentary feature and gore won the 2007 nobel peace prize for his efforts on behalf of the movement he has championed.
his co winner was the international panel on climate change launched in switzerland in 1988 and affiliated with the united nations.
understand analyze and evaluate 1.
why are environmental movements in developing nations often linked to issues of human rights and protection from exploitation by developed nations.
how do developed nations threaten the environment of developing nations.
how did the 2010 bp explosion and oil spill in the gulf of mexico affect the environment.
what was the effect on the environmental movement.
environmental organizations include grassroots associations worldwide ngos and national political parties.
how do these groups focus attention on environmental issues.
which type of organization do you think would be most successful at reaching its goals.
these critics took control of american foreign policy and began to reshape it.
the legacy of containment was repudiated.
instead the public stance of the american government was bush foreign policy that the united states had the right and the responsibility to spread freedom throughout the world not just by exhortation and example but also when necessary by military force.
in latvia in may 2005 president bush spoke of the decision at the end of world war ii not challenge soviet domination of eastern europe a decision it had rested on the belief that such a challenge would d the united states into another war.
the controversial eement negotiated at yalta in 1945 by roosevelt urchill and stalin which failed to end the soviet occupa n of poland and other eastern european nations was the sident said part of an unjust tradition by which power governments sacrificed the interests of small nations.
this empt to sacrifice freedom for the sake of stability the sident continued left a continent divided and unstable.
mission accomplished 2003 president george w bush chose the uss abraham lincoln an aircraft carrier moored just off the coast of san diego for his first major address after the end of formal hostilities in the iraq war on may 1 2003.
to strengthen his own identification with the military he flew in on an s 3 viking that landed on the carrier s deck and appeared before cameras wearing a flight suit and carrying a helmet.
later dressed in a conventional business suit he addressed a crowd of service men and women on the deck standing beneath a large banner reading mission accomplished.
later as fighting in iraq continued with no clear end in sight and as the war became increasingly unpopular bush received much criticism and ridicule for what many americans considered a premature celebration of victory f reuters corbis the lesson bush suggested was that the united states and other great powers should value stability less and freedom more and should be willing to take greater risks in the world to end tyranny and oppression.
turbulent politics the last years of the george w bush administration and those of barack obamas presidency were difficult for each man.
bush suffered from the growing unpopularity of the iraq war the weak federal response to hurricane katrina that devastated new orleans and the gulf coast and the loss of 876.
chapter 32 i republican majorities in both houses of congress.
president obama struggled to maintain support in light of the flagging support for the war in afghanistan a hostile congress and difficulties in rolling out his affordable care act the administrations comprehensive health care plan.
the unraveling of the bush presidency for most of the first three years of his presidency george w bush enjoyed broad popularity because of his resolute stance against terrorism.
indeed his firm position even buoyed his approval ratings during the controversial iraq war at least for a while.
bushs domestic policies did little to strengthen him politically however.
the presidents tax cuts of 2001 disproportionately benefitted wealthy americans reflecting the view of white house economists that the best way to ensure growth was to put money into the hands of people most likely to invest.
the tax cuts also contributed to the nearly 10 trillion increase in the national debt during the bush presidency.
also controversial was one of bushs most significant domestic accomplishments an education bill known as no child left behind which tied federal funding in schools to the success of students in taking standardized tests.
some educators and parents favored no child left behind but many others felt that students spent too many hours in the classroom learning how to take tests rather than think for themselves.
by 2004 when the president faced reelection it seemed by no means certain that he would be returned to office.
senator john kerry of massachusetts a vietnam veteran who opposed the war in iraq mounted a strong attack against the president by criticizing the his policies.
but harsh assaults on kerry in return combined with the mobilization of large numbers of conservatives helped bush win a narrow victory.
bushs second term was a difficult one.
the war in iraq was going badly and its growing unpopularity added to the rapidly declining approval ratings of the president himself ratings that by mid 2008 had reached the lowest level of presidential approval in the history of polling.
perhaps even more damaging to president bush was the gov hurricane katrina ernments response to a disastrous hurricane katrina that devastated a massive swath of the coastline of the gulf of mexico in august 2005 and gravely damaged the city of new orleans.
the federal governments slow response aroused anger throughout the nation contributing to the loss of the republican majorities in both houses and leaving bush with little support.
at the same time there were scandals in the justice department revelations of illegal violations of civil liberties and declining economic prospects that would culminate in the financial crisis of 2008.
the election of 2008 and the financial crisis both parties began the 2008 campaign with large fields of candidates but by spring the contest had narrowed considerably.
senator john mccain of arizona emerged from the early primaries with the republican nomination assured.
senator hillary rodham clinton of new york the former first lady and senator barack obama of illinois campaigned aggressively against each other for months.
clinton might have been the first female u s president.
but obamas organizational power among young voters and his inspirational messages of hope and change helped him secure primary votes and win the democratic nomination.
he entered the general election with a chance to become the nations first african american president.
mccain and obama entered the campaign with very different programs.
mccain supported the iraq war and obama did not.
obama wanted national health insurance and mccain did not.
mccain wanted additional tax cuts to spur investment while obama urged tax increases on the wealthiest americans.
obama went with experience and name recognition in picking obamania posters of and about barack obama were widely visible during the 2008 presidential campaign.
in this photograph a new yorker walks past one example of the obama street art that spread through many american cities and indeed through cities around the world.
among the depictions of obama during the campaign were the work of leading artists who saw in him a figure of possibly historic significance.
chris mcgrath getty images the age of globalization 877 barack obama 365 69 297 997 democrat 53 7 john mccain republican 173 59 597 520 46 2 the election of 2008 the election of 2008 broke the pattern of very close divisions between the two parties and instead produced a decisive victory for barack obama.
for the first time since 1996 democrats won states in the south and carried most of the swing states.
the election also carried large majorities for the democrats in both the house and the senate only to see the republicans carry a majority of the house in 2010 his vice presidential running mate senator joe biden of delaware.
mccain chose an almost unknown figure to share his ticket governor sarah palin of alaska.
palin soon became the hero of many conservatives in the republican convention.
but her inexperience seemed to damage the republican campaign.
before the conventions obama was already leading strongly in the polls.
as the nomination campaigns were heating up a series of financial problems had arisen in mid 2007.
by 2008 the nation was facing its worst financial crisis since the great depression.
for years financial institutions had been developing new credit instruments intended to make borrowing easier and cheaper which lured millions of people into taking on large and risky mortgages.
one such instrument called an adjustable rate mortgage arm offered homebuyers mortgages with initially low interest rates that would increase in later years.
other loans called jumbo loans extended credit to people who lacked the financial means needed to pay them back.
for a while the sale of houses many of which were based on these risky mortgages increased causing a housing bubble a rapid rise in housing prices fueled by high demand.
these business practices were made possible with the repeal of the glass steagall act in 1999.
glass steagall had been passed in 1933 to prevent irresponsible banking practices by mandating layers of government oversight designed to catch fraud or risky investment strategies.
with more and more purchases the price of homes fell.
in time however many people with the reset higher mortgage rates or jumbo loans could not sell the homes that they could no longer afford.
in many cases the market value of the home sank below the value of the mortgages held causing some homeowners to walk away from their property and default on their loans.
foreclosures were numerous across the country.
many of the nations largest banks had invested heavily in the securities that backed these risky loans now with the collapse of the housing market they lost vast sums of money.
the so called great recession of 2008 influenced by the loan crisis also pushed down wages and triggered widespread job layoffs making it impossible for the additional owners of 2008 arms and jumbo loans to make payments financial t ius increasing the number of home fore crisis closures.
many americans could not meet their other financial obligations such as the repayment of school loans or credit card debt.
there was also less money available for investing or economic growth.
the increased unemployment rate further accelerated the down ward economic spiral.
by mid september 2008 the financial crisis suggested an economy falling out of control.
secretary of the treasury henry paulson supported by other economic leaders proposed the massive use of federal funds to help the government bail out banks that were failing.
both the bush administration and eventually the obama administration won congressional support for 750 billion in the form of the troubled asset relief program tarp to shore up the tottering financial institutions.
the bailout kept the economy from collapsing but it remained very weak for several years with exceptionally high unemployment rates.
during this crisis mccain and obama fought out the last two months of their campaign.
obama benefited from george w bushs unpopularity.
with the incoming president facing another powerful downturn in the economy mccains response seemed to associate him with bushs policies increasingly viewed by many americans as causing the financial meltdown whereas obama conveyed a message that seemed to signal new and more hopeful possibilities.
what had been at times a close race ended in a strong showing for obama and on november 4 2008 he won the popular vote 53 percent to 46 percent and the electoral vote by an even larger margin.
the obama presidency few modern presidents have entered the white house with higher expectations from the nation and even the world so it was inevitable that many of obamas supporters would eventually be disappointed.
the enormity of the tasks obama faced managing the worst economy since the 1930s one war in iraq and another in afghanistan and a polarized political climate made his presidency extraordinarily difficult.
at the time of obamas inauguration millions of americans were unemployed.
major companies especially in the 878 chapter 32 automobile industry faced bankruptcy.
the home mortgage and other financial industries were still on the verge of collapse despite bush s intervention.
obamas initial aspirations had to be put aside to confront the very dangerous reality that the country was on the verge of an economic depression possibly greater in scope and impact than the one of the 1930s.
to shore up the faltering economy obama engineered the largest economic stimulus in history.
the obama stimulus package announced in 2009 included tax cuts expanded unemployment benefits and increased stimulus.
r package spending on education infrastructure police health care and job creation.
the total funding for all of these programs reached 787 billion.
though controversial and passed by only a slight margin in congress in 2014 most economists agree that the stimulus measures saved the economy from catastrophe.
still a large number of critics believe that obamas stimulus package was a significant waste of money that added considerably to the national debt.
even in such a precarious economic environment obama pressed for the passage of his patient protection and affordable care act to realize the dream of many liberals since the 1930s universal health care.
the act urged all americans to purchase health insurance making provisions to help those of limited financial means to acquire it.
though the bill finally passed congress in march 2010 despite threats of filibustering the republicans condemned this reform as socialized medicine and vowed to repeal it or defeat it through judicial action.
most of the benefits of the affordable care act as it is more commonly known did not go into effect until 2014 that is until obamas second term.
to the embarrassment of the administration and delight of critics the rollout of the plan in october 2013 experienced significant technical problems when the federal website designed to process new insurance applications failed to work properly.
there were many opponents of obamacare as many derisively called the affordable care act.
some of obamas political adversaries were a group of evangelical conservative and libertarian republicans who came to be known as the tea party an early leader of the tea party was senator ted cruz of texas.
although the tea party could not stop passage of the affordable care act they used their opposition to it to spearhead their overall conservative agenda deficit reduction tax reduction and smaller government.
the tea partys appeal to wealthy conservatives brought large financial contributions that gave this group a disproportionate political influence that belied its relatively small numbers.
with the help of the conservative media the tea party exerted increasing pressure on the republican party as a whole.
in the 2010 midterm elections 130 tea party endorsed candidates were sworn in as members of congress.
the tea party contributed to the strong polarization of the federal government that resulted in a great deal of legislative gridlock including a tea party shutdown of many federal services and operations from october 1 to 16 2013 when congress did not vote to provide the necessary funds.
obama came into office with an ambitious plan for reshaping americas role in the world.
the american combat role in iraq was diminishing in the last year of international the buspl administration but obama relations brought it to an end in august 2010.
at the same time he committed significant additional troops to the war in afghanistan where americans had been fighting since 2001.
with former rival hillary clinton as his secretary of state obama sought peace between israel and palestine an effort that like all previous ones was extraordinarily difficult.
they sought to improve relations with many nations that the iraq war had damaged and built new international trade opportunities.
in 2009 obama was awarded the nobel peace prize for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples in the fall of 2010 president obama visited india china and south korea hoping for progress on trade but china and south korea failed to reach agreements with the united states.
the tea party wasnt obamas only critic during his first term he also faced opposition from the political left.
some democrats felt that he had moved too far to the right and had unnecessarily compromised core democratic goals.
many people believed that obama had failed to do many of the things he had promised to do in the campaign such as closing the guantanamo prison.
disgruntled critics protested that the president did not punish those financiers whom they held responsible for the global economic crisis.
the so called occupy wall street movement arose as a populist response to the perception of increasing economic inequality.
protesters gathering in new yorks zuccotti park near wall street and in other cities across the coun occupy wall street try use tir e f an article by econo mist joseph stiglitz of the 1 by the 1 for the 1 to animate their position.
in his article stiglitz argued that the wealthiest 1 percent of americans owned over 40 percent of the nations wealth.
the crowd roared back we are the 99 percent to heighten the disparity between the fabulously wealthy and everyone else.
economic inequality became an important theme in the presidential election of 2012.
the impact of money on politics became mainstream news in 2010 with the supreme court decision in citizens united v federal election commission.
in this case the conservative leaning court ruled that government couldnt limit campaign related expenditures from corporations or unions.
critics of the decision including people sympathetic to the occupy movement felt that it favored the republicans because wealthy donors tended to donate to that party.
the ability of corporations to donate freely to individual campaigns would change the financing associated with the coming 2012 presidential election indeed more money was spent on that election than on any other in history.
the age of globalization 879 while barack obama and joe biden once again occupied the democratic ticket the republican primaries were tough contests involving a large field of candidates.
businessman and former massachusetts governor mitt romney finally prevailed to win the republican nomination with his vice presidential running mate representative paul ryan of wisconsin.
originally a moderate republican romney changed his position on a range of issues including abortion and health care apparently to appeal to the increasingly conservative nature of his party.
democrats would make his changed positions a focus of their campaign.
the key issues of the 2012 election included health care reform immigration reform the federal budget deficit and taxation and spending.
the strained economy kept the focus more on domestic than international concerns.
perhaps the most pressing issue though was the high rate of unemployment a problem that president obama had struggled to remedy throughout most of his first term.
despite this lingering problem obama outlined his successes and pointed to them as the justification for a second term.
he had withdrawn most of the troops from iraq as promised.
most dramatically he had succeeded in overseeing the tracking down and on may 2 2011 the killing of al qaeda leader osama bin laden the mastermind of the 9 11 attacks.
one of obama s greatest legislative achievements the affordable care act also survived a challenge to its constitutionality in the supreme courts 2012 decision in national federation of independent business v sebelius.
the head to head contest between romney and obama at times seemed close but a generally improving economy the death of bin laden and several political missteps by romney helped obama.
when voters finally cast their ballots obama won 51 percent of the popular vote to romneys 47 percent translating into 332 electoral votes for the president and 206 for his rival.
president obamas second term posed many challenges on both the domestic and international fronts.
one event that extended to both realms was the disclosure of a large number of classified documents by computer spe controversy cialist edward snowden.
on june 5 2013 snowden a former contractor for the national security agency nsa released a vast number of classified documents to several media outlets.
this action was viewed by many observers as the most serious leak since daniel ellsworth released the pentagon papers in 1971.
the released documents showed extensive governmental surveillance of private internet and telephone data including the monitoring of the personal phone lines of such foreign leaders as germanys chancellor angela merkel.
snowden fled the united states first to china and then to russia to avoid criminal charges.
some called showden a traitor others a heroic champion of civil liberties.
one of the most serious international events during president obamas second term took place in syria a country locked in violent civil war since 2011.
opponents of the baath government sought the ouster of president bashar al assad and his repressive regime.
assad unleashed the army in response killing an estimated 120 000 of his own people by september 2013.
the displacement of hundreds of thousands of syrians into neighboring countries threatened to further destabilize the region.
assads use of chemical weapons triggered a strong condemnation by the united states and its european allies.
working with russia a traditional ally of the assad regime the united states and europe brokered a deal to remove the stockpile of chemical weapons from the country.
obama aware of the national unwillingness for the united states to become involved in another ground war resisted calls for sending troops to dislodge assad.
the violent struggle continued through 2014 with no solution in sight.
the political gridlock of obamas presidency continued into his second term.
many of his initiatives either encoun ered serious obstacles or did not come to pass.
after his sec nd inaugural obama and his strategists hoped to cement heir gains among the latino population revealed in the general election.
many republicans as well political believed that their party should reach out gridlock f to this growing sector of the population by rushing through an immigration reform bill.
on june 27 2013 he senate passed the border security economic opportunity md immigration modernization act of 2013 as a comprehen iive package of provisions including a path to us citizenship or illegal immigrants already in the country.
as of spring 2014 he house had not passed the bill owing to powerful conserva ive republican opposition.
