710 chapter 29 the crime.
later that day he was mysteriously murdered by a dallas nightclub owner jack ruby as he was being moved from one jail to another.
most americans at the time accepted the conclusions of a federal commission appointed by president johnson to investigate the assassination.
the commission chaired by chief justice earl warren found that both oswald and ruby had acted alone that there was no larger conspiracy.
warren commission in later years however many americans came to believe that the warren commission report had ignored evidence of a wider conspiracy behind the murders.
controversy over the assassination continues still.
lyndon johnson the kennedy assassination was a national trauma a defining event for almost everyone old enough to be aware of it.
at the time however much of the nation took comfort in the personality and performance of kennedys successor in the white house lyndon baines johnson.
johnson was a native of the poor hill country of west texas and had risen to become majority leader of the u s senate by dint of extraordinary even obsessive effort and ambition.
having failed to win the democratic nomination for president in 1960 he surprised many who knew him by agreeing to accept the vice presidential nomination on the ticket with kennedy.
the events in dallas thrust him into the white house.
johnsons rough edged even crude personality could hardly have been more different from kennedys.
but like kennedy johnson was a man who believed in the active use of power.
between 1963 and 1966 he compiled the most impressive legislative record of any president since franklin roosevelt.
he was aided by the tidal wave of emotion that the johnson treatment lyndon johnson was legendary for his powers of persuasion for a combination of charm and intimidation that often worked on even the most experienced politicians.
he is shown here in the oval office meeting with his old friend senator richard russell of georgia and demonstrating one of his most powerful and unsettling techniques moving so close to the person with whom he was talking as to be almost touching him.
lyndon baines johnson library the turbulent sixties 711 followed the death of kennedy which helped win support for many new frontier proposals.
but johnson also constructed a greater and more far reaching reform program of his own one that he ultimately labeled the great society and he won great society approval of much of it through the same sort of skillful lobbying in congress that had made him an effective majority leader.
johnsons first year in office was by necessity dominated by the campaign for reelection.
there was little doubt that he would win particularly after the republican party nominated the very conservative senator barry goldwater of arizona.
in the november 1964 election the president received a larger plurality over 61 percent than any candidate before or since.
goldwater with his hard line stance against communism and government expansion managed to carry only his home state of arizona and five states in the deep south.
nevertheless the failed goldwater campaign mobilized many right wing activists who would propel the growth of conservative political strength for decades to come.
record democratic majorities in both houses of congress many of whose members had been swept into office only because of the margin of johnsons victory ensured that the president would be able to fulfill many of his goals.
the assault on poverty for the first time since the new deal the federal government took steps in the 1960s to create important new social welfare programs.
the most important of these was medicare which provides federal aid to elderly individuals for medical expenses.
medicare and medicaid its enactment in 1965 came at the end of a bitter twenty year debate between those who believed in the concept of national health assistance and those who denounced it as socialized medicine but medicare pacified many critics.
for one thing it avoided the stigma of welfare by making medicare benefits available to all elderly americans regardless of need just as social security had done with pensions.
that created a large middle class constituency for the program.
it also defused the opposition of the medical community by allowing doctors serving medicare patients to practice privately and at first to charge their normal fees medicare simply shifted responsibility for paying those fees from the patient to the government.
in 1966 johnson steered to passage the medicaid program which extended federal medical assistance to welfare recipients and other indigent people of all ages.
medicare and medicaid were early steps in a much larger assault on poverty one that kennedy had been planning in the last months of his life and that johnson launched only weeks after taking office.
the centerpiece of this war on poverty as johnson called it was the office of economic opportunity oeo which created an array of new educational employment housing and health care programs.
but the oeo was controversial from the start in part because of its commitment to the idea of community action community action was an effort to involve members of poor communities themselves in the planning and administration of the programs designed to help community action programs them.
the community action programs provided jobs for many poor people and gave them valuable experience in administrative and political work.
but despite its achievements the community action approach proved impossible to sustain.
administrative failures damaged the program.
so did the apparent excesses of a few agencies which damaged the popular image of the community action programs and indeed the war on poverty as a whole.
the oeo spent nearly 3 billion during its first two years of existence and it helped reduce poverty in some areas.
but it fell far short of eliminating poverty altogether.
that 712 chapter 29 was in part because of the weaknesses of the programs themselves and in part because funding for them inadequate from the beginning dwindled as the years passed and a costly war in southeast asia became the nations first priority.
cities schools and immigration closely tied to the antipoverty program were federal efforts to promote the revitalization of decaying cities and to strengthen the nations schools.
the housing act of 1961 offered 4 9 billion in federal grants to cities for the preservation of open spaces the development of mass transit systems and the subsidization of middle income housing.
in 1966 johnson established a new cabinet agency the department of housing and urban development whose first secretary robert weaver was the first african american ever to serve in the cabinet.
johnson also inaugurated the model cities program which offered federal subsidies for urban redevelopment pilot programs.
kennedy had fought for federal aid to public education but he had failed to overcome two important obstacles.
many americans feared that aid to education was the first step federal aid to education toward federal control of the schools and catholics insisted that federal assistance must extend to parochial as well as public schools.
johnson managed to circumvent both objections with the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 and a series of subsequent measures.
the bills extended aid to all types of schools and based the aid on the economic conditions of the students not on the needs of the schools themselves.
the johnson administration also supported the immigration act of 1965 one of the most important pieces of legislation of the 1960s.
for decades since the 1920s immigration act of 1965 the law maintained a strict limit on the number of newcomers admitted to the country each year 170 000.
but the 1965 act eliminated the national origins system established in the 1920s which gave preference to immigrants from northern europe over those from other parts of the world.
it continued to restrict immigration from some parts of latin america but it allowed people from all parts of europe asia and africa to enter the united states on an equal basis.
by the early 1970s the character of american immigration had changed dramatically.
the numbers of immigrants grew significantly with members of new national groups and particularly large groups of asians entering the united states and transforming the character of the american population.
legacies of the great society taken together the great society reforms significantly increased federal spending.
for a time rising tax revenues from the growing economy nearly compensated for the new expenditures.
in 1964 johnson managed to win passage of the 11 5 billion tax cut that kennedy had first proposed in 1962.
the cut increased the federal deficit but substantial economic growth over the next several years made up for much of the revenue initially lost.
as great society programs began to multiply however particularly as they began to compete with the escalating costs of americas military ventures the federal budget rapidly outpaced increases in revenues.
in 1961 the federal government had spent 94 4 billion.
by 1970 that sum had risen to 196 6 billion.
the high costs of the great society and the failures of some of it weakened the popularity of the federal efforts to solve social problems.
but the great society was also the turbulent sixties 713 responsible for some remarkable achievements.
it significantly reduced hunger in america.
it made medical care available to millions of elderly and poor people who would otherwise have had great difficulty affording it.
it contributed to the greatest reduction in poverty in american history.
in 1959 according to the most widely accepted estimates 21 percent of the american people lived below the officially established poverty line a level that did not survive for very long.
in 1969 only 12 percent remained below that line.
much of that progress was a result of economic growth but some of it was a direct result of great society programs.
the battle for racial equality by the early 1960s african americans forced issues of racial justice and equality to the forefront of american politics.
while scholars debate the origins and legacies of the modern civil rights movement none challenge how deeply it influenced the nations history in the late twentieth century.
see debating the past the civil rights movement expanding protests john kennedy was sympathetic to the cause of racial justice but he was far from a committed crusader.
like presidents before him he feared alienating southern voters and powerful southern democrats in congress.
his administration hoped to contain the racial problem by enforcing existing laws and using executive orders not proposing new legislation.
but the pressure for change was growing uncontainable even before kennedy took office.
throughout the 1950s african americans in northern cities had grown increasingly active in opposing discrimination.
they demanded progress in housing jobs and education.
protests grew in the 1960s especially in the south.
this restiveness soon spread.
in february 1960 black college students in greensboro north carolina staged a sit in at a segregated woolworths lunch counter and in the following months such demonstrations spread throughout the south forcing many merchants to integrate their facilities.
in the fall of 1960 some of those who had participated in the sit ins formed the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc a student branch of martin luther king jr s southern christian leadership conference sncc worked to keep the spirit of resistance alive.
in 1961 an interracial group of students working with the congress of racial equality core began what they called freedom rides traveling by bus freedom rides throughout the south they tried to force the desegregation of bus stations.
they were met in some places with such savage violence on the part of some white southerners that attorney general robert kennedy finally dispatched federal marshals to help keep the peace and ordered the integration of all bus and train stations.
events in the deep south in 1963 helped bring the growing movement to something of a climax.
in april martin luther king jr helped launch a series of nonviolent demonstrations in birmingham alabama.
police commissioner eugene bull connor personally supervised a brutal effort to break up the peaceful marches arresting hundreds of demonstrators and using attack dogs tear gas electric cattle prods and fire hoses at times even against small children in full view of television cameras.
two months later debating the past the civil rights movement the civil rights movement was one of the most important events in the modern history of the united states.
it helped force the dismantling of legalized segregation and disenfranchisement of african americans and also served as a model for other groups mobilizing to demand dignity and rights.
and like all important events in history it has produced scholarship that examines the movement in a number of different ways.
the early histories of the civil rights movement remain widely accepted.
they rest on a heroic narrative of moral purpose and personal courage by which great men and women inspired ordinary people to rise up and struggle for their rights.
this narrative generally begins with the brown decision of 1954 and the montgomery bus boycott of 1955 continues through the civil rights campaigns of the early 1960s and culminates in the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965.
among the central events in this narrative are the march on washington of 1963 with martin luther king jr s famous i have a dream speech and the assassination of king in 1968 which has often symbolized the end of the movement and the beginning of a different more complicated period of the black freedom struggle.
the key element of these narratives is the central importance to the movement of a few great leaders most notably king himself.
among the best examples of this narrative are taylor branchs powerful studies of the life and struggles of king parting the waters 1988 pillar of fire 1998 and at canaans edge 2006 as well as david garrows important study bearing the cross 1986.
few historians would deny the importance of king and other leaders to the successes of the civil rights movement.
but a number of scholars have argued that the leader centered narrative obscures the vital contributions of ordinary people in communities throughout the south and the nation to the struggle.
john dittmers local people the struggle for civil rights in mississippi 1994 and charles paynes ive got the light of freedom 1995 both examine the day to day work of the movements rank and file in the early 1960s and argue that their efforts were at least as important as those of king and other leaders.
the national leadership helped bring visibility to these struggles but king and his circle were usually present only briefly if at all for the actual work of communities in challenging segregation.
only by understanding the local origins of the movement these and other scholars argue can we understand its true character.
scholars also disagree about the time frame of the movement.
rather than beginning the story in 1954 or 1955 as in robert weisbrots excellent 1991 synthesis freedom bound or in william chafes remarkable 1981 local study civilities and civil rights which examined the greensboro sit ins of 1961 a number of scholars have tried to move the story into both earlier periods and later ones.
robin kellys race rebels 1994 emphasizes the important contributions of working class african americans some of them allied for a time with the communist party to the undermining of racist assumptions starting in the 1930s.
these activists organized some of the earliest civil rights demonstrations sit ins marches and other efforts to challenge segregation well before the conventional dates for the beginning of the movement.
gail obriens the color of the law 1999 examines a 1946 race riot in columbia tennessee arguing for its importance as a signal of the early growth of african american militancy and the m ovement of that militancy from the streets into the legal system.
other scholars have looked beyond the 1960s and have incorporated events outside the orbit of the formal movement to explain brown v board of education this photograph taken for an atlanta newspaper illustrated the long and dangerous walk that linda brown one of the plaintiffs in the famous desegregation case that ultimately reached the supreme court had to travel each day on her way to a segregated school in topeka kansas.
an allwhite school was located close to her home but to reach the black school she had to attend required a long walk and a long bus ride each day.
not only does the picture illustrate the difficulties segregation created for linda brown it was also part of a broad publicity campaign launched by the supporters of the case.

a growing literature on northern urban and relatively radical activists has suggested that focusing too much on mainstream leaders and the celebrated efforts in the south in the 1960s diverts our view from the equally important challenges facing northern african americans and the very different tactics and strategies that they often chose to pursue their goals.
the enormous attention historians have given to the life and legacy of malcolm x among them alex haleys influential autobiography of malcolm x 1965 michael eric dysons making malcolm 1996 and manning marables important biography malcolm x a life of reinvention 2012 is an example of this as is the increasing attention scholars have given to black radicalism in the late 1960s and beyond and to such militant groups as the black panthers.
other literature has extended the civil rights struggle even further into the 1980s and beyond and has brought into focus such issues as the highly disproportionate number of african americans sentenced to death within the criminal justice system.
randall kennedys race crime and the law 1997 is a particularly important study of this issue.
even brown v board of education 1954 the great landmark of the legal challenge to segregation has been subject to reexamination.
richard klugers narrative history of the brown decision simple justice 1975 is a classic statement of the traditional view of brown as a triumph over injustice.
but others have been less certain of the dramatic success of the ruling.
james t pattersons brown v board of education a civil rights milestone and its troubled legacy 2001 argues that the brown decision long preceded any national consensus on the need to end segregation and that its impact was far less decisive than earlier scholars have suggested.
michael klarmans from jim crow to civil rights 2004 examines the role of the supreme court in advancing civil rights and suggests among other things that the brown decision may actually have retarded racial progress in the south for a time because of the enormous backlash it created.
charles ogletrees all deliberate speed 2004 and derrick bells silent covenants 2004 both argue that the courts decision did not provide an effective enforcement mechanism for desegregation and in many other ways failed to support measures that would have made school desegregation a reality.
stephen tucks we aint what we ought to be the black freedom struggle from emancipation to obama 2011 concludes his broad narrative of the road to racial equality by focusing on the continued activism of african americans into the present.
as the literature on the african american freedom struggles of the twentieth century has grown historians have begun to speak of civil rights movements rather than a single cohesive movement.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
if historians now speak of plural civil rights movements what are these movements.
why are the contributions of local grassroots workers so often overlooked in studies of the civil rights movement as well as in accounts of other great events in american history.
716 chapter 29 governor george wallace stood in the doorway of the foster auditorium at the university of alabama to prevent the court ordered enrollment of several black students.
only after the arrival of federal marshals did he give way.
the same night naacp official medgar evers was murdered in mississippi.
and in september the bombing of the sixteenth street baptist church in birmingham killed four african american children.
a national commitment the events in alabama and mississippi were a warning to the president that he could no longer avoid the issue of race.
in an important television address the night of the university of alabama confrontation kennedy spoke eloquently of the moral issue facing the nation.
days later he introduced new legislative proposals prohibiting segregation in public accommodations stores restaurants theaters hotels barring discrimination in employment and increasing the power of the government to file suits on behalf of school integration.
to generate support for the legislation and to dramatize the power of the growing movement more than 200 000 demonstrators marched down the mall in march on washington washington d c in august 1963 and gathered before the lincoln memorial for the largest civil rights demonstration in the nations history to that point.

in washington moments after completing his memorable speech during the august 1963 march on washington king waves to the vast and enthusiastic crowd that had gathered in front of the lincoln memorial to demand equality and jobs ap images the turbulent sixties 717 martin luther king jr in one of the greatest speeches of american politics aroused the crowd with a litany of resonant american images prefaced again and again by the phrase i have a dream the assassination of president kennedy three months later gave new impetus to civil rights legislation.
the ambitious measure that kennedy had proposed in june 1963 was stalled in the senate after having passed through the house of representatives with relative ease.
early in 1964 after lyndon johnson had applied both public civil rights act of 1964 and private pressure supporters of the measure finally mustered the two thirds majority necessary to end a filibuster by southern senators and the senate passed the most important civil rights bill of the twentieth century.
the battle for voting rights having won a significant victory in one area the civil rights movement shifted its focus to another voting rights.
during the summer of 1964 thousands of civil rights workers black and white northern and southern spread throughout the south but primarily into mississippi to work on behalf of black voter registration and participation.
the campaign was known as freedom summer and it produced a violent freedom summer response from many southern whites.
three of the first freedom workers to arrive in the south two whites andrew goodman and michael schwerner and one african american james chaney were murdered.
local law enforcement officials were involved in the crime.
the freedom summer also produced the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp an integrated alternative to the regular state democratic party organization.
under the leadership of fannie lou hamer and others the mfdp challenged the regular partys right to its seats at the democratic national convention that summer.
see consider the source fannie lou hamer on the struggle for voting rights president johnson with kings help managed to broker a compromise by which members of the mfdp could be seated as observers with promises of party reforms later on while the regular party retained its official standing.
many mfdp members rejected the agreement and left the convention embittered.
a year later in march 1965 king helped organize a major demonstration in selma alabama to press for the right of blacks to register to vote.
selma sheriff jim clark led local police in a vicious attack on the demonstrators which was televised nationally.
two northern whites participating in the selma march were murdered in the course of the effort there.
the widespread national outrage that followed the events in alabama helped push lyndon johnson to win passage of the voting rights act of 1965 which provided federal protection to african americans attempting to exercise their selma and the voting rights act right to vote.
but important as such gains were they failed to satisfy the rapidly rising expectations of civil rights activists as the focus of the movement began to move from political to economic issues.
the changing movement by 1966 of african americans 69 percent lived in metropolitan areas and 45 percent lived outside the south.
although the economic condition of most americans was improving in many poor urban black communities things were getting significantly worse.
indeed more than half of all nonwhite americans lived in poverty at the beginning of the 1960s.
co ns ider t he s o urc e fannie lou hamer on the struggle for voting rights fanny lou hamer shone a harsh spotlight on racial terror in her native state of mississippi during her speech before the credentials committee of the democratic national convention in atlantic city new jersey in august 1964.
with this testimony hamer tried unsuccessfully to unseat the all white mississippi delegation and seat members of the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp.
four years later the mfdp succeeded in winning seats at the convention.
mr chairman and to the credentials committee my name is mrs fannie lou hamer and i live at 626 east lafayette street ruleville mississippi sunflower county the home of senator james o eastland and senator stennis.
it was the 31st of august in 1962 that eighteen of us traveled twenty six miles to the county courthouse in indianola to try to register to become first class citizens.
we was met in indianola by policemen highway patrolmen and they only allowed two of us in to take the literacy test at the time.
after we had taken this test and started back to ruleville we was held up by the city police and the state highway patrolmen and carried back to indianola where the bus driver was charged that day with driving a bus the wrong color.
after we paid the fine among us we continued on to ruleville and reverend jeff sunny carried me four miles in the rural area where i had worked as a timekeeper and sharecropper for eighteen years.
i was met there by my children who told me that the plantation owner was angry because i had gone down to try to register.
after they told me my husband came and said the plantation owner was raising cain because i had tried to register.
before he 718 quit talking the plantation owner came and said fannie lou do you know did pap tell you what i said and i said yes sir he said well i mean that he said if you dont go down and withdraw your registration you will have to leave said then if you go down and withdraw said you still might have to go because we are not ready for that in mississippi and i addressed him and told him and said i didnt try to register for you.
i tried to register for myself i had to leave that same night.
on the 10th of september 1962 sixteen bullets was fired into the home of mr and mrs robert tucker for me.
that same night two girls were shot in ruleville mississippi.
also mr joe mcdonalds house was shot in.
and june the 9th 1963 i had attended a voter registration workshop was returning back to mississippi.
ten of us was traveling by the continental trailway bus.
when we got to winona mississippi which is montgomery county four of the people got off to use the washroom and two of the people to use the restaurant two of the people wanted to use the washroom.
the four people that had gone in to use the restaurant was ordered out.
during this time i was on the bus.
but when i looked through the window and saw they had rushed out i got off of the bus to see what had happened.
and one of the ladies said it was a state highway patrolman and a chief of police ordered us out i got back on the bus and one of the persons had used the washroom got back on the bus too.
as soon as i was seated on the bus i saw when they began to get the five people in a highway patrolmans car.
i stepped off of the bus to see what was happening and somebody screamed from the car that the five workers was in and said get that one there when i went to get in the car when the man told me i was under arrest he kicked me.
i was carried to the county jail and put in the booking room.
they left some of the people in the booking room and began to place us in cells.
i was placed in a cell with a young woman called miss ivesta simpson.
after i was placed in the cell i began to hear sounds of licks and screams i could hear the sounds of licks and horrible screams.
and i could hear somebody say can you say yes sir nigger.
can you say yes sir and they would say other horrible names.
she would say yes i can say yes sir so well say it she said i dont know you well enough they beat her i dont know how long.
and after a while she began to pray and asked god to have mercy on those people.
and it wasnt too long before three white men came to my cell.
one of these men was a state highway patrolman and he asked me where i was from.
i told him ruleville and he said we are going to check this they left my cell and it wasnt too long before they came back.
he said you are from ruleville all right and he used a curse word.
and he said we are going to make you wish you was dead i was carried out of that cell into another cell where they had two negro prisoners.
the state highway patrolmen ordered the first negro to take the blackjack.
the first negro prisoner ordered me by orders from the state highway patrolman for me to lay down on a bunk bed on my face.
i laid on my face and the first negro began to beat.
i was beat by the first negro until he was exhausted.
i was holding my hands behind me at that time on my left side because i suffered from polio when i was six years old.
after the first negro had beat until he was exhausted the state highway patrolman ordered the second negro to take the blackjack.
the second negro began to beat and i began to work my feet and the state highway patrolman ordered the first negro who had beat me to sit on my feet to keep me from working my feet.
i began to scream and one white man got up and b egan to beat me in my head and tell me to hush.
one white man my dress had worked up high he walked over and pulled my dress i pulled my dress down and he pulled my dress back up.
i was in jail when medgar evers was murdered.
all of this is on account of we want to register to become first class citizens.
and if the freedom democratic party is not seated now i question america.
is this america the land of the free and the home of the brave where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily because we want to live as decent h uman beings in america.

719 720 chapter 29 the great publicity of the civil rights movement in the south intensified antidiscrimination efforts in northern cities.
those cities had no jim crow laws but much segregation.
many african american leaders and their white supporters having struggled in relative obscurity in the 1940s and 1950s began to move the battle against job discrimination to a new level.
they argued that the only way for employers to prove they were not discriminating against african americans was to demonstrate that they were hiring minorities.
if necessary they should adopt positive measures to recruit minorities.
lyndon johnson gave his support to the concept of affirmative action in 1965.
over the next decade affirmative action guidelines gradually extended to virtually all institutions doing business with or receiving funds from the federal government including schools and universities and to many others as well.
discrimination based on gender also began to receive federal interest.
when sex was added at the last minute to title vii of the 1964 civil rights act many thought it was an attempt to kill the bill.
regardless the result added federal authority to begin dismantling the entrenched discrimination of women in the workplace and higher education.
a symbol of the movements new direction and of the problems it would cause was a major campaign in the summer of 1966 in chicago in which king played a prominent role.
organizers of the chicago campaign hoped to direct national attention to housing and employment discrimination in northern industrial cities.
but the chicago campaign evoked vicious and at times violent opposition from white residents and failed to attract wide attention or support in the way events in the south had done.
urban violence well before the chicago campaign the problem of urban poverty had thrust itself into national prominence when riots broke out in african american neighborhoods in major cities.
there were disturbances in the summer of 1964 most notably in new york citys harlem.
the most serious race riot since the end of world war ii occurred the following summer in the watts section of los angeles.
in the midst of a traffic arrest a white police officer struck a protesting black bystander with his club.
the incident triggered a storm of anger and a week of violence.
thirty four people died during the uprising which was eventually quelled by the national guard.
in the summer of 1966 forty three additional outbreaks occurred the most serious in chicago and cleveland.
and in the summer of 1967 eight major disorders took place including the largest of them all a racial clash in detroit in which forty three people died.
televised images of the violence alarmed millions of americans and created both a new sense of urgency and a growing sense of doubt among some whites who had embraced the cause of racial justice only a few years before.
a special commission on civil disorders ordered by the president in response to the riots issued a celebrated report in the spring of 1968 recommending massive spending to eliminate the abysmal conditions of the ghettoes.
to many white americans however the riots exposed the need for stern measures to stop violence and lawlessness.
black power disillusioned with the ideal of peaceful change through cooperation with whites an increasing number of african americans turned to a new approach to the racial issue the philosophy of black power.
black power meant many different things.
but in all its forms the turbulent sixties 721 it suggested a shift away from the goals of assimilation and toward increased awareness of racial distinctiveness.
perhaps the most enduring impact of the black power ideology was a social and psychological one instilling racial pride in african americans.
but black power took political forms as well and it created a deep schism within the civil rights movement.
traditional black organizations that emphasized cooperation with sympathetic whites groups such as the naacp the urban league and kings southern christian leadership conference now faced competition from more radical groups.
the student nonviolent coordinating committee and the congress of racial equality had both begun as relatively moderate interracial organizations.
by the mid 1960s however these and other groups were calling for more radical and occasionally even violent action against white racism and were openly rejecting the approaches of older more established black leaders.
the most radical expressions of the black power idea came from such revolutionary organizations as the black panthers based in oakland california and the separatist group the nation of islam which denounced whites as devils and appealed to african americans to embrace the islamic faith and work for complete racial separation.
the most celebrated of the black muslims as whites often termed them was malcolm little who adopted the name malcolm x x to denote his lost african malcolm x surname.
malcolm x left the nation of islam in 1964 and founded the muslim mosque inc which he hoped would allow him to work with other civil rights leaders.
after a pilgrimage to mecca he returned with a new hope that racial problems could be overcome.
he died in 1965 when gunmen presumably under orders from rivals within the nation of islam assassinated him.
but he remained a major figure in many african american communities long after his death attaining a stature comparable to that of martin luther king jr response and the cold war in international affairs as much as in domestic reform the optimistic liberalism of the kennedy and johnson administrations dictated a more active and aggressive approach to dealing with the nations problems than that of the 1950s.
diversifying foreign policy the kennedy administration entered office convinced that the united states needed to be able to counter communist aggression in more flexible ways than the atomic weaponsoriented defense strategy of the eisenhower years.
in particular kennedy was unsatisfied with the nations ability to meet communist threats in emerging areas of the third world the areas in which kennedy believed the real struggle against communism would be waged in the future.
he gave enthusiastic support to the expansion of the special forces or green berets as they were soon known soldiers trained specifically to fight guerrilla conflicts and other limited wars.
kennedy also favored expanding american influence through peaceful means.
to repair the badly deteriorating relationship with latin america he proposed an alliance for progress a series of projects for peaceful development and stabilization of the nations of that region.
kennedy also inaugurated the agency for international development 722 chapter 29 aid to coordinate foreign aid.
and he established what became one of his most popular innovations the peace corps which sent young american volunteers abroad to work in developing areas.
among the first foreign policy ventures of the kennedy administration was a disastrous assault on the castro government in cuba.
the eisenhower administration had started the project and by the time kennedy took office the cia had been working for months to bay of pigs train a small army of anti castro cuban exiles.
on april 17 1961 with the approval of the new president 2 000 of the armed exiles landed at the bay of pigs in cuba expecting first american air support and then a spontaneous uprising by the cuban people on their behalf.
they received neither.
at the last minute as it became clear that things were going badly kennedy withdrew the air support fearful of involving the united states too directly in the invasion.
nor did the expected uprising occur.
instead well armed castro forces easily crushed the invaders and within two days the entire mission had collapsed.
peace corps confrontations with the soviet union in the grim aftermath of the bay of pigs kennedy traveled to vienna in june 1961 for his first meeting with soviet premier nikita khrushchev.
their frosty exchange of views did little to reduce strains between the two nations nor did khrushchevs veiled threat of war unless the united states ceased to support a noncommunist west berlin in the heart of east germany.
khrushchev was particularly unhappy about the mass exodus of residents of east germany to the west through the easily traversed border in the center of berlin.
but he ultimately found a method short of war to stop it.
just before dawn on august 13 1961 the east german government complying with directives from moscow constructed a wall between east and west berlin.
guards fired on those who continued to try to escape.
for nearly thirty years the berlin wall served as the most potent physical symbol of the conflict between the communist and noncommunist worlds.
the rising tensions culminated the following october in the most dangerous and dramatic crisis of the cold war.
during the summer of 1962 american intelligence agencies became aware of the arrival of a new wave of soviet technicians and equipcuban missile crisis ment in cuba and of military construction in progress.
on october 14 aerial reconnaissance photos produced clear evidence that the soviets were constructing sites on the island for offensive nuclear weapons.
to the soviets placing missiles in cuba probably seemed a reasonable and relatively inexpensive way to counter the presence of american missiles in turkey and a way to deter any future american invasion of cuba.
but to kennedy and most other americans the missile sites represented an act of naked aggression by the soviets toward the united states.
almost immediately the president working with a special executive committee assembled to deal with the crisis decided that the weapons must go.
on october 22 he ordered a naval and air blockade around cuba a quarantine against all offensive weapons.
preparations were under way for an american air attack on the missile sites when late in the evening of october 26 kennedy received a message from khrushchev implying that the soviet union would remove the missile bases in exchange for an american pledge not to invade cuba.
the president agreed.
and in secret kennedy agreed to withdraw the kennedy khrushchev pact missiles from turkey in what is now called the kennedy khrushchev pact.
the resolution of the conflict was a political victory for kennedy the turbulent sixties 723 and in an effort to avoid the threat of war again the two leaders established a moscow washington hotline that created a direct link between the nuclear nations.
the improved dialogue between the nuclear superpowers also paved the way for the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 which banned atmospheric tests.
johnson and the world lyndon johnson entered the presidency with little prior experience in international affairs.
he was eager therefore not only to continue the policies of his predecessor but also to prove quickly that he too was a strong and forceful leader.
an internal rebellion in the dominican republic gave him an opportunity to do so.
a 1961 assassination had toppled the repressive dictatorship of general rafael trujillo and for the next four years various factions in the country had struggled for dominance.
in the spring of 1965 a conservative regime began to collapse in the face of a revolt by a broad range of groups on behalf of the left wing nationalist juan bosch.
arguing without any evidence that bosch planned to establish a pro castro communist regime johnson dispatched 30 000 american troops to quell the disorder.
only after a conservative candidate defeated bosch in a 1966 election were the forces withdrawn.
from johnsons first moments in office however his foreign policy was almost totally dominated by the bitter civil war in vietnam and by the expanding involvement of the united states there.

troops ensure ouster of noriega bogot the cold war greatly increased the readiness of the united states to intervene in the affairs of its latin american neighbors.
this map presents the many times and ways in which washington ordered interventions in central america the caribbean and the northern nations of south america.
during much of this period the interventions were driven by cold war concerns by fears that communists might take over nations near the united states as they had taken over cuba in the early 1960s.
what other interests motivated the united states to exert influence in latin america even after the end of the cold war.
the united states in latin america 1954 2006 724 chapter 29 the agony of vietnam george kennan who helped devise the containment doctrine in the name of which america went to war in vietnam once called the conflict the most disastrous of all americas undertakings over the whole 200 years of its history yet at first the conflict in vietnam seemed simply one more third world struggle on the periphery of the cold war.
america and diem having thrown its support to the new leader of south vietnam ngo dinh diem in the aftermath of the 1954 geneva accords and having supported diem in his blatant refusal to hold the elections in 1956 that the accords had required the united states found itself drawn steadily deeper into the unstable politics of this fractious new nation.
diem an aristocratic catholic from central vietnam and an outsider in the south was also a hard line nationalist uncontaminated by any collaboration with the french and bent on shoring up the authority of his regime.
and he was for a time apparently successful.
with the help of the american cia diem waged an effective campaign against some of the powerful religious sects and the south vietnamese organized crime syndicate which had challenged the authority of the central government.
as a result the united states came to regard diem as a powerful and impressive alternative to ho chi minh his communist rival in north vietnam.
america threw military and economic aid at diems feet.
diems early successes in suppressing sects led him in 1959 to begin a similar campaign to eliminate the supporters of ho chi minh who had stayed behind in the south after the partition.
that effort persuaded the vietminh or supporters of ho chi minh and the communist north to resume the armed struggle for national unification.
in 1959 the vietminh cadres in the south created the national liberation front nlf known to viet cong many americans as the viet cong an organization closely allied with the north vietnamese government.
in 1960 under orders from hanoi and with both material and manpower support from north vietnam the nlf began military operations in the south.
this marked the beginning of what americans know as the vietnam war.
by 1961 nlf forces had established effective control over many areas of the countryside and were threatening diems power.
by then diem was also losing the support of many other groups in south vietnam including his own military.
in 1963 a desperate diem regime precipitated a major crisis by trying to repress the south vietnamese buddhists in an effort to make catholicism the dominant religion of the country and limit political dissent.
the buddhists staged enormous antigovernment demonstrations during which a monk doused himself with gasoline sat cross legged in downtown saigon and set himself on fire in view of photographers and television cameras.
later other buddhists burned themselves in other areas.
alarmed american officials pressured diem to reform his now tottering government but the president made no significant concessions.
as a result in the fall of 1963 kennedy gave his approval to a plot by a group of south vietnamese generals to topple diem.
in diem assassinated early november 1963 the generals staged the coup assassinated diem along with his brother ngo dinh nhu killings the united states had not wanted or expected and established the first of a series of new governments which were for over ngo dinh diem the turbulent sixties 725 three years even less stable than the one they had overthrown.
a few weeks after the coup john kennedy was assassinated.
from aid to intervention lyndon johnson inherited what was already a substantial american commitment to the survival of an anticommunist south vietnam.
during his first months in office he expanded the american involvement in vietnam only slightly sending an additional 5 000 military advisers there and preparing to send 5 000 more.
then early in august 1964 the president announced that american destroyers on patrol in international waters in the gulf of tonkin had been attacked by north vietnamese torpedo boats.
later information raised serious doubts as to whether the administration reported the attacks accurately.
at the time however virtually no one questioned johnsons portrayal of the incident as a serious act of aggression.
by a vote of 416 to 0 in the house and 88 to 2 in the senate congress hurriedly passed the gulf of tonkin resolution which authorized gulf of tonkin resolution the president to take all necessary measures to protect american forces and prevent further aggression in southeast asia.
the resolution became in johnsons view at least an open ended legal authorization for escalation of the conflict.
with the south vietnamese leadership still in disarray and the communist military pressure growing stronger more and more of the burden of opposition to the viet cong fell on the united states.
in february 1965 after communist forces attacked an american military base at pleiku johnson ordered american bombings of the north in an attempt to destroy the depots and transportation lines responsible for the flow of north vietnamese soldiers and supplies into south vietnam.
the bombing continued intermittently until 1972.
a month later in march 1965 two battalions of american marines landed at da nang in south vietnam bringing the total american troop strength to over 100 000.
four months later the president announced that american soldiers would now begin playing an active role in the conflict.
by the end of the year there were more than 180 000 american combat troops in vietnam in 1966 that number doubled and by the end of 1967 over 500 000 american soldiers fought there.
in the meantime the air war intensified.
by the spring of 1966 more than 4 000 americans and an unknown number of vietnamese had been killed.
the quagmire central to the american war effort in vietnam was a strategy known as attrition a strategy premised on the belief that the united states could inflict more attrition strategy damage on the enemy than the enemy could absorb.
but the attrition strategy failed because the north vietnamese believing that they were fighting a war for national independence were willing to commit many more soldiers and resources to the conflict than the united states had predicted.
the united states also failed in expecting its bombing of the north to eliminate the communists war making capacity.
north vietnam was not a modern industrial society and it had relatively few of the sorts of targets against which bombing is effective.
the north vietnamese also responded to the bombing with great ingenuity.
they created a network of underground tunnels shops and factories.
the north vietnamese also were provided substantial aid from the soviet union and china.

but as this map shows there were traditional battles and invasions and supply routes as well.
the red arrows in the middle of the map show the general path of the ho chi minh trail the main supply route by which north vietnam supplied its troops and allies in the south.
the blue arrow in southern south vietnam indicates the point at which american troops invaded cambodia in 1970.
what is there in the geography of indochina as presented on this map that helps explain the great difficulty the american military had in securing south vietnam against communist attacks.
the turbulent sixties 727 moved the ho chi minh trail to make it elusive to american bombers.
far from breaking the norths resolve the bombing seemed actually to strengthen popular commitment to the war.
another important part of the american strategy was the pacification program whose purpose was to push the viet cong from particular regions and then pacification program pacify those regions by winning the hearts and minds of the people.
routing the viet cong was often possible but the subsequent pacification was more difficult.
gradually the pacification program gave way to a more heavy handed relocation strategy through which american troops uprooted villagers from their homes sent them fleeing to refugee camps or into the cities producing by 1967 more than 3 million refugees and then destroyed the vacated villages and surrounding countryside.
it became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it an american military official famously said of one such action thus revealing the flawed assumptions of the pacification program.
as the war dragged on and victory remained elusive some american officers and officials urged the president to expand the military efforts.
but johnson resisted in part because he remembered the korean war.
he feared drawing china directly into the vietnam war and he was beginning to encounter obstacles and frustrations at home.
the war at home few americans and even fewer influential ones had protested the american involvement in vietnam as late as the end of 1965.
but as the war dragged on inconclusively political support for it began to erode.
by the end of 1967 american students opposed to the war and to the military draft had become a significant political force.
enormous peace marches in new york washington d c and other cities drew broad public attention to the antiwar movement.
music also raised awareness see patterns of popular culture the folk music revival in the meantime a growing number of journalists particularly reporters who had spent time in vietnam helped sustain the movement with their frank revelations about the brutality and apparent futility of the war.
senator j william fulbright of arkansas chair of the senate foreign relations committee also turned against the war and in january 1966 began to stage highly publicized and occasionally televised congressional hearings to air criticisms of it.
other members of congress joined fulbright in opposing johnsons policies including in 1967 robert f kennedy brother of the slain president now a senator from new york.
even within the administration the consensus seemed to be crumbling.
robert mcnamara who had done much to help extend the initial american involvement in vietnam quietly left the government disillusioned in 1968.
his successor as secretary of defense clark clifford became a quiet but powerful voice within the administration on behalf of a cautious scaling down of the commitment.
in the meantime johnsons commitment to fighting the war while continuing his great society reforms helped cause a rise in inflation from the 2 percent level it had occupied through most of the early 1960s to 3 percent in 1967 4 percent in 1968 and 6 percent in 1969.
in august 1967 johnson asked congress for a tax increase to avoid even more ruinous inflation.
in return congressional conservatives demanded a 6 billion reduction in the funding for great society programs.
the president accepted the reduction as a way to mollify congressional conservatives unnerved by economic troubles and critical of social welfare programs.
patterns of popular culture the folk music revival two impulses of the 1960s the renewed interest among young people in the politics of the left and the search for an authentic alternative to what many considered the artificial consumerist culture of modern america helped produce the revived popularity of folk music in that turbulent era.
although the harder harsher and more sensual music of rock n roll was more visible and more popular in the 1960s folk music more clearly expressed many of the political ideas and aspirations that were welling up in the youth culture of the time.
the folk music tradition like most american musical traditions had many roots.
it drew from some of the black musical traditions of the south and from the white country music of appalachia.
and it drew most immediately from a style of music developed by musicians associated with the communist partys popular front in the 1930s.
woody guthrie pete seeger the weavers and others whose music would become popular again in the 1960s began their careers singing in popular front and union rallies during the great depression.
their music like the popular front itself set out to seem entirely american rooted in the nations folk traditions.
folk music remained alive in the 1940s and 1950s but it had only a modest popular following.
pete seeger and the weavers continued to perform and to attract attention on college campuses.
harry belafonte and the kingston trio recorded slick pop versions of folk songs in an effort to bring them to mass audiences.
in 1952 folkway records released the anthology of american folk music a collection of eighty four performances recorded in the 1920s and 1930s that b ecame an inspiration and an important source of 728 material to many younger folk musicians.
folk music festivals at berkeley newport and chicago began to proliferate beginning in 1959.
and an important community of folk musicians lived and performed together in the 1950s and early 1960s in new york citys greenwich village.
as the politics of the 1960s became more heated and as young people in particular became politically aroused it was folk music that most directly reflected their new values and concerns.
peter paul and mary although only intermittently political became icons to much of the new left beginning with their 1962 recording of if i had a hammer a song first performed at communist party rallies in the 1940s by pete seeger and the weavers.
bob dylan whose own politics were never wholly clear to the public had a large impact on the 1960s left even inadvertently providing a name to the most radical offshoot of students for a democratic society sds the weathermen who named themselves after a line from one of his songs you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows joan baez whose politics were no secret to anyone was actively engaged in the antiwar movement and was arrested several times for participating in militant protests.
but it was not just the overt political messages of folk musicians that made them so important to young americans in the 1960s.
in addition folk was a kind of music that seemed to reflect the authenticity the youth culture was attempting to find.
in truth neither the musicians themselves nor the young americans attracted to them had much real connection with the traditions they were trying to evoke.
the audiences the feejon coffee house in manhattan was popular among young writers poets and others in the late 1950s in part because it was a gathering place for folk musicians two of whom are shown here performing at right.
john orris getty images coffeehouse music for folk music a product of rural and working class traditions were overwhelmingly urban middle class people.
but the message of folk music that there is a real america rooted in values of sharing and community hidden beneath the crass commercialism of modern culture resonated with the yearnings of many people in the 1960s and beyond for an alternative to their own troubled world.
when young audiences responded to woody guthries famous ballad this land is your land they were expressing a hope for a different america more democratic more honest and more natural than the land they knew.

the traumas of 1968 by the end of 1967 the twin crises of the war in vietnam and the deteriorating racial situation at home had produced great social and political tensions.
in the course of 1968 those tensions burst to the surface and seemed to threaten national chaos.
the year 1968 was turbulent elsewhere in the world as well see america in the world 1968 729 america in the world the year 1968 was one of the most turbulent in the postwar history of the united states.
much of what made it so traumatic were specifically american events the growing controversy over the war in vietnam the assassinations of martin luther king jr and robert kennedy racial unrest across the nations cities student protests on campuses throughout america.
but the turmoil of 1968 was not confined to the united states.
there were tremendous upheavals in many parts of the globe that year.
the most common form of turbulence around the world in 1968 was student unrest.
in france a student uprising in may far exceeded in size and ferocity anything that occurred in the united states.
it attracted the support of french workers and briefly paralyzed paris and other cities.
it contributed to the downfall of the government of charles de gaulle a year later.
in england ireland germany italy the netherlands mexico canada japan and south korea students and other young people demonstrated in great numbers and at times with violence against governments universities and other structures of authority.
elsewhere there was more widespread protest as in czechoslovakia where hundreds of thousands of citizens took to the streets in support of what became known as prague spring it caused a demand for greater democracy and a repudiation of many of the oppressive rules and structures imposed on the nation by its soviet dominated communist regimes.
russian tanks rolled into the city to crush the uprising.
many people have tried to explain why so much instability emerged in so many nations at the same time.
one factor that 730 contributed to the worldwide turbulence of 1968 was simple numbers.
the postwar baby boom had created a very large age cohort in many nations and by the late 1960s it was coming of age.
in the industrial west the sheer size of the new generation produced a tripling of the number of people attending colleges and universities.
in fewer than twenty years it also created a heightened sense of the power of youth.
the long period of postwar prosperity and relative peace in which this generation had grown up contributed to heightened expectations of what the world should offer them and a greater level of impatience than previous generations had demonstrated with the obstacles that stood in the way of their hopes.
a new global youth culture emerged that was in many ways at odds with the dominant culture of older generations.
it valued nonconformity personal freedom and even rebellion.
a second force contributing to the widespread turbulence of 1968 was the power of global media.
satellite communication introduced in the early 1960s made it possible to transmit live news across the world.
videotape technology and the creation of lightweight portable television cameras enabled media organizations to respond to events much more quickly and flexibly than in the past.
the audience for these televised images was by now global and enormous particularly in industrial nations but even in the poorest areas of the world.
protests in one country were suddenly capable of inspiring protests in others.
demonstrators in paris for example spoke openly of how campus protests in the united states in 1968 for example the student uprising at columbia university in new york the previous month had helped motivate french students to rise up as well.
just as american students were protesting against what they considered antiquated paternalistic features of their universities french students demanded an end to the rigid autocratic character of their own academic world.
in most parts of the world the 1968 uprisings came and went without fundamentally altering institutions and systems.
but many changes came in the wake of these protests.
universities around the globe undertook significant reforms.
religious observance in mainstream churches and synagogues in the west declined dramatically after 1968.
new concepts of personal freedom gained legitimacy helping to inspire social movements in the years that followed among them the dramatic growth of feminism in many parts of the world and the emergence of the gay and lesbian rights movement.
the events of 1968 did not produce a revolution in the united states or in most of the rest of the world but it did help launch a period of dramatic social cultural and political changes that affected the peoples of many nations.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
what factors combined to produce the turbulence that resulted in the uprisings of 1968.
did the demonstrators of 1968 succeed or fail to achieve their objectives.
what were the long term effects of the 1968 uprisings.
the tet offensive on january 31 1968 the first day of the vietnamese new year tet communist forces launched an enormous concerted attack on american strongholds throughout south vietnam.
a few cities most notably hue fell temporarily to the communists.
but what made the tet offensive so shocking to the american people who saw vivid reports of it on television was the sight of communist forces in the heart of saigon setting off bombs shooting down south vietnamese officials and troops and holding down fortified areas including briefly the american embassy.
the tet offensive also suggested to the american public something of the brutality of the fighting in vietnam.
in the midst of the fighting television cameras recorded the sight of a south vietnamese officer shooting a captured and defenseless young viet cong soldier in the head in the streets of saigon.
american forces soon dislodged the viet cong from most of the positions they had seized.
and during the battle they had inflicted enormous casualties on the communists and permanently depleted the ranks of the nlf forcing north vietnamese troops to take on a much larger share of the subsequent fighting but such accomplishments registered little with the american public who felt betrayed by an administration that had sworn the war was nearly over.
tet may have been a military victory for the united states but it was a political defeat for the administration.
in the following weeks opposition to the war grew substantially.
leading newspapers and magazines television commentators and mainstream politicians began taking public stands against the conflict.
public opposition to the war almost doubled and johnsons personal popularity rating had slid to 35 percent the lowest of any president since harry truman.
the political challenge beginning in the summer of 1967 dissident democrats tried to mobilize support behind an antiwar candidate who would challenge lyndon johnson in the 1968 primaries.
731 732 chapter 29 when robert kennedy turned them down they recruited senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota.
a brilliantly orchestrated campaign by young volunteers in the new hampshire primary produced a startling showing by mccarthy in march he nearly defeated the president.
a few days later robert kennedy entered the campaign embittering many mccarthy supporters but bringing his own substantial strength among minorities poor people and workers to the antiwar cause.
polls showed the president trailing badly in the next scheduled primary in wisconsin.
on march 31 1968 johnson went on television to announce a limited halt in the bombing of north vietnam his first major concession to the antiwar forces.
and then stunningly he declared that he was withdrawing from the presidential contest.
robert kennedy quickly established himself as the champion of the democratic primaries winning one election after another.
in the meantime however vice president hubert humphrey with the support of president johnson entered the contest and began to attract the support of party leaders and of the many delegations that were selected not by popular primaries but by state party organizations.
he soon overtook kennedy as the front runner in the race.
assassinations and politics on april 4 martin luther king jr who had traveled to memphis tennessee to lend his support to striking black sanitation workers in the city was shot and killed while standing on the balcony of his motel.
the assassin james earl ray who was captured two months later in london had no apparent motive.
subsequent evidence suggested that he had been hired by others to do the killing but he himself never revealed the identity of his employers.
kings tragic death produced a great outpouring of grief.
among some african americans it also produced anger.
in the days after the assassination major riots broke out in more than sixty american cities.
forty three people died.
late in the night of june 6 robert kennedy appeared in the ballroom of a los angeles hotel to acknowledge his victory in that days california primary.
as he left the ballroom after his victory statement sirhan sirhan a young palestinian apparently enraged by proisraeli remarks kennedy had recently made emerged from a crowd and shot him in the head.
early the next morning kennedy died.
the shock of this second tragedy in two assassination of robert kennedy months and only five years after the assassination of john kennedy cast a pall over the remainder of the presidential campaign.
when the democrats finally gathered in chicago in august for a convention in which hubert humphrey was now the only real contender even the most optimistic observers predicted turbulence.
inside the hall delegates bitterly debated an antiwar plank in the party platform that both kennedy and mccarthy supporters favored.
miles away in a downtown park thousands of antiwar protesters staged demonstrations.
on the third night of the convention as the delegates began their balloting on the now virtually inevitable nomination of hubert humphrey demonstrators and police clashed in a bloody riot in the streets of chicago.
hundreds of protesters were injured as police attempted to disperse them with tear gas and billy clubs.
aware that the violence was being televised to the nation the demonstrators taunted the authorities with the chant the whole world is watching and hubert humphrey who had spent years dreaming of becoming his partys candidate for president finally got the nomination but from a badly fractured party that would make it difficult for him to manage his campaign.
assassination of dr king the turbulent sixties 733 the conservative response the turbulent events of 1968 persuaded some observers that american society was in the throes of revolutionary change.
in fact however the response of many americans to the turmoil was to question the social changes of the prior decade and take a conservative political turn.
the most visible sign of the conservative backlash was the surprising success of the campaign of george wallace for the presidency.
wallace had been one of the leading spokesmen for the defense of segregation when as governor of alabama he had attempted to block the admission of black students to the university of alabama in george wallace 1963.
in 1968 he became a third party candidate for president basing his campaign on a host of c onservative grievances.
he denounced the forced busing of students to achieve racial integration in public schools the proliferation of government regulations and social programs and what he called the permissiveness of authorities toward crime race riots and antiwar demonstrations.
there was never any serious chance that wallace would win the election but his standing in the polls rose at times to over 20 percent.
at the same time a more effective effort to mobilize the conservative middle in favor of order and stability was under way within the republican party.
richard nixon whose 26 13 26 7 12 candidate party richard m nixon republican hubert h humphrey democratic george c wallace american independent other candidates prohibition socialist labor d gregory socialist workers peace and freedom mccarthy electoral vote popular vote 31 770 237 43 4 31 270 533 42 3 9 906 141 12 9 218 347 60 6 of electorate voting the election of 1968 the 1968 presidential election which richard nixon won was almost as close as the election of 1960 which he lost.
nixon might have won a more substantial victory had it not been for the independent candidacy of governor george c wallace who attracted many of the same conservative voters to whom nixon appealed.
how does the distribution of democratic and republican strength in this election compare to that in 1960.
734 chapter 29 political career had seemed at an end after his losses in the presidential race of 1960 and a california gubernatorial campaign two years later reemerged as the spokesperson for what he called the silent majority by offering a vision of stability law and order government retrenchment and peace with honor in vietnam he easily captured the nomination of his party for the presidency.
and despite a last minute surge by humphrey nixon hung on to eke out a victory almost as narrow as his defeat in 1960.
he received 43 4 percent of the popular vote to humphreys 42 3 percent a margin of only about 500 000 votes and 301 electoral votes to humphreys 191.
george wallace who like most third party candidates faded in the last weeks of the campaign still managed to poll 12 9 percent of the popular vote and to carry five southern states with a total of 46 electoral ballots.
nixon had hardly won a decisive personal mandate.
but the election made clear that a majority of the american electorate was more interested in restoring stability than in promoting social change.
nixon elected conclusion perhaps no decade of the twentieth century created more powerful and enduring images in america than the 1960s.
it began with the election and then the traumatic assassination of an attractive and energetic young president john kennedy who captured the imagination of millions and seemed to symbolize the rising idealism of the time.
it produced a dramatic period of political innovation led by president lyndon johnson who greatly expanded the size and functions of the federal government and its responsibility for the welfare of the nations citizens.
he called it the great society.
this time also saw the emergence of a sustained and enormously powerful civil rights movement that won a series of crucial legal victories including two major civil rights acts that dismantled the jim crow system constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
the spirit of dynamism and optimism that made the early 1960s so productive also helped bring to the surface problems and grievances that had no easy solutions.
the civil rights movement awakened expectations of social and economic equality that laws alone could not provide.
the peaceful interracial crusade of the early 1960s gradually turned into a much more militant confrontational and increasingly separatist movement toward the decades end.
the idealism among white youths that began the 1960s and played an important role in the political success of john kennedy evolved into an angry rebellion against many aspects of american culture and politics and produced a large upsurge of student protest that rocked the nation at the decades end.
perhaps most of all a small and largely unnoticed cold war commitment to defend south vietnam against communist aggression from the north led to a large and disastrous war that destroyed the presidency of lyndon johnson sent thousands of young men and women to their deaths and showed no signs of producing a victory.
a decade that began with high hopes and soaring ideals ended with division and deep disillusionment.

how did the u s strategy in vietnam change under nixon.
what was the result of the change in strategy.
what was the watergate scandal and how did it affect the presidency.
the election of richard nixon in 1968 was the result of more than the unpopularity of lyndon johnson and the vietnam war.
it was the result too of a broad popular reaction against what many americans considered an assault on the foundations of their society and culture.
in richard nixon such americans found a man who seemed to match their mood.
a product of a hardworking middle class family nixon projected an image of stern dedication to traditional values.
yet the presidency of richard nixon far from returning calm and stability to american politics coincided with and helped produce more years of crisis.
736 the youth culture many conservatives in the 1960s and 1970s were alarmed by what they saw as a pattern of social and cultural anger by younger americans.
the protesters gave vent to two related impulses.
one emerging from the political left was to create a great new community of the people which would rise up to break the traditional power of elites and force the nation to end the war pursue racial and economic justice and transform its political life.
the other at least equally powerful impulse was the vision of personal liberation it found expression in part through the efforts of many groups african americans indians hispanics women gay people and o thers to define and assert themselves and make demands on the larger society.
it also found expression through the efforts of individuals to create a new culture one that would allow them to escape from what some considered the dehumanizing pressures of the modern technocracy time line friedans the feminine mystique free speech movement begins national organization for women formed turmoil in universities rock concert in woodstock ny cambodian incursion kent state and jackson state shootings pentagon papers published nixon imposes wage price controls the new left among the products of the racial crisis and the war in vietnam was a radicalization of many american students.
in the course of the 1960s they formed what became known as the new left.
in 1962 a group of students most of them white and many of them from the university of michigan gathered in michigan to form students for a democratic society sds which became the most prominent organization of the new left.
their declaration of beliefs the port huron statement expressed their disillusionment with the society they had inherited and their determination to build a new politics.
in the following years sds became the leading organization of student radicalism.
since most members of the new left were students much of their radicalism centered for a time on issues related to the modern university.

8 reprinted in john birmingham our time is now notes from the high school underground new york praeger 1970 p 178 of california at berkeley over the rights of students to engage in political activities on campus the free speech movement was the first major outburst of what was to be nearly a decade of campus turmoil.
the antiwar movement greatly inflamed and expanded the challenge to the universities and beginning in 1968 campus demonstrations riots and building seizures became almost commonplace.
at columbia university in new york students seized the offices of the president and others and occupied them for several days until local police forcibly ejected them.
over the next several years hardly any major university was immune to some level of disruption.
small groups of especially dogmatic free speech movement 738 the crisis of authority 739 radicals among them the weathermen an offshoot of sds were responsible for a few cases of arson and bombing that destroyed campus buildings and claimed several lives.
protests also erupted in high schools where students voiced similar demands for greater control over the curriculum on the subjects taught to them and over disciplinary policy.
see consider the source demands of the new york high school union not many people accepted the radical political philosophy of the new left.
but many supported the position of sds and other groups on particular issues and above all on the vietnam war.
between 1967 and 1969 student activists organized some of the largest political demonstrations in american history to protest the war.
a related issue that helped fuel the antiwar movement was opposition to the military draft.
the gradual abolition of many traditional deferments for opposition to the draft graduate students teachers husbands fathers and others swelled the ranks of those faced with conscription and thus likely to oppose it.
of the almost 2 million drafted about 7 000 draft age americans simply refused induction accepting what were occasionally long terms in jail as a result.
thousands of others fled to canada sweden and elsewhere where they were joined by deserters from the armed forces to escape conscription.
the counterculture closely related to the new left was a new youth culture openly scornful of the values and conventions of middle class society.
the most visible characteristic of the counterculture as it became known was a change in personal styles.
as if to display their contempt for conventional standards young americans flaunted long hair shabby or flamboyant clothing and a rebellious disdain for traditional speech and decorum.
also important to the counterculture was a new more permissive view of sex and drugs.
like the new left the counterculture challenged modern american society attacking what it claimed were its banality its hollowness its artificiality its isolation from nature.
the most committed adherents of the counterculture the hippies who came to dominate the haight ashbury neighborhood of san francisco and other places and the social dropouts many of whom retreated to rural communes rejected modern society altogether and attempted to find refuge in a simpler more natural existence.
but even those whose commitment to the counterculture was less intense shared the idea of personal fulfillment through rejecting the inhibitions and conventions of middle class culture and giving fuller expression to personal instinct and desire.
the counterculture was only an exaggerated expression of impulses coursing through the larger society.
long hair and outlandish clothing became the badge not only of hippies and radicals but of an entire generation.
the widespread use of marijuana the freer attitudes toward sex the iconoclastic and often obscene language all spread far beyond the true devotees of the counterculture.
one of the most powerful elements of the new youth society was rock music.
its growing influence in the 1960s was a result in part of the phenomenal popularity of the beatles the english group whose first visit to the united states in 1964 created a remarkable sensation.
for a time most rock musicians like most popular musicians before them concentrated largely on uncontroversial romantic themes.
by the late 1960s however rock had begun to reflect many of the new iconoclastic values of its time.
the beatles for example abandoned their once simple and seemingly innocent style for a new experimental even mystical approach that reflected the growing popular fascination with drugs and eastern religions.
other groups such as the rolling stones turned even more openly.
680 chapter 28 the national birthrate reversed a long pattern of decline with what is commonly called the baby boom which began during world war ii and peaked in 1957.
the nations population rose almost 20 percent in the decade from 150 million in 1950 to 179 million in 1960 which meant increased consumer demand and expanding economic growth.
rapid suburban expansion a 47 percent increase in the 1950s helped stimulate growth in several important sectors of the economy.
the number of privately owned cars more than doubled in a decade.
demand for new homes helped sustain a vigorous housing industry.
the construction of roads stimulated the economy as well.
the combination of post wwii economic growth new standards of support from government spending and a booming population led to a renewed american vitality for the next thirty years.
and while that growth was far from equally distributed the average american in 1960 had over 20 percent more purchasing power than in 1945 and more than twice as much as during the prosperous 1920s.
the american people had achieved the highest standard of living of any society in the history of the world.
the rise of the modern west births per thousand women 15 44 years old no region experienced more dramatic changes than the american west.
its population expanded dramatically its cities boomed its industrial economy flourished.
by the 1960s some parts of the west were among the most important and populous industrial and cultural centers of the nation.
as during world war ii much of the growth of the west was a result of federal spending and investment on the dams power stations highways and other infrastructure projects that made additional economic development possible.
military contracts continued the american birthrate 1940 1960 this chart shows how the american birthrate grew rapidly during and after world war ii following a long period of decline in the 1930s to produce what became known as the baby boom at the peak of the baby boom during the 1950s the nations population grew by 20 percent.
what impact did the baby boom have on the nations economy.
the affluent society 681 to flow disproportionately to factories in california and texas many built with government funds during the war.
the growing number of automobiles created new demands for petroleum and contributed to the rapid growth of oil fields in texas and colorado and of the metropolitan centers among them houston dallas and denver.
state governments in the west invested heavily in their universities.
the university of texas and university of california systems in particular became among the nations largest and created important centers of research.
they helped attract technology intensive industries to the region.
climate also contributed to growth in the west.
southern california nevada and arizona in particular attracted many migrants from the east because of their warm dry climates.
the growth of los angeles after world war ii was a remarkable phenomenon more than 10 percent of all new businesses in the united states between 1945 and 1950 began in los angeles.
its population rose by over 50 percent between 1940 and 1960.
capital and labor total represented by unions in millions booming corporations were reluctant to allow strikes to interfere with their operations and since the most important labor unions were now so large and entrenched that they could not easily be suppressed or intimidated leaders of large businesses made important concessions to them.
by the mid 1950s factory wages in most industries had risen substantially to an average of 80 per week.
in december 1955 the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations ended their twenty year rivalry afl and cio merge and merged to create the afl cio under the leadership of george meany.
but success also bred stagnation and corruption in some union bureaucracies.
in 1957 the powerful teamsters union became the subject of a congressional investigation and its president david beck was charged with the misappropriation of union funds.
afl cio tinted area represents total number of union employees cio independent unions afl workers represented by unions 1920 2001 this chart shows the number of workers represented by unions over an eighty year period.
note the dramatic rise in the unionized workforce during the 1930s and 1940s the slower but still significant rise in the 1960s and 1970s and the steady decline that began in the 1980s.
the chart in fact understates the decline of unionized labor in the postwar era since it shows union membership in absolute numbers and not as a percentage of the rapidly growing workforce.
why did unions cease recruiting new members successfully in the 1970s and why did they begin actually losing members in the 1980s.
682 chapter 28 beck ultimately stepped down to be replaced by jimmy hoffa whom government investigators pursued for nearly a decade before finally winning a conviction against him in 1964 for jury tampering.
the united mine workers similarly became tainted by violence and charges of corruption.
the explosion of science and technology in 1961 time magazine selected as its man of the year not a specific person but the american scientist the choice was an indication of the widespread fascination with which americans in the age of atomic power viewed science and technology.
medical breakthroughs the twentieth century saw greater progress in the development of medical science than had occurred in all the centuries before it.
a very large proportion of that progress occurred during and after world war ii.
particularly important was the development of new antibacterial drugs capable of fighting infections that had once been all but untreatable.
to be sure the development of antibiotics originated in the discoveries of louis pasteur and jules francois joubert.
working in france in the 1870s they produced the first conclusive evidence that virulent bacterial infections could be defeated by other more ordinary bacteria.
using their discoveries the english physician joseph lister revealed the value of antiseptic solutions in preventing infection during surgery several years later.
but the practical use of antibacterial agents to combat disease did not begin until many decades later.
in the 1930s scientists in germany france and england demonstrated the power of so called sulfa drugs drugs derived from an antibacterial agent known as sulfanilamide which could be used effectively to treat streptococcal blood infections.
new sulfa drugs were soon being developed at an astonishing rate and were frequently improved they were enormously successful in treating what had once been a major cause of death.
in 1928 in the meantime alexander fleming an english medical researcher accidentally discovered the antibacterial properties of an organism that he named penicillin.
there was little progress in using penicillin to treat human illness however until a group of researchers at oxford university directed by howard florey and ernest chain learned how to produce stable potent penicillin in sizable enough quantities to make it a practical weapon against bacterial disease.
the first human trials of the new drug in 1941 were dramatically successful but progress toward the mass availability of penicillin was stalled in england because of world war ii.
american laboratories further developed methods for the mass treatments for bacterial infections production and commercial distribution of penicillin which became widely available to doctors and hospitals around the world by 1948.
since then a wide range of new antibiotics of highly specific character have been developed so that bacterial infections are now among the most successfully treated of all human illnesses.
immunization the development of vaccines that can protect humans from contracting both bacterial and viral diseases also progressed dramatically.
the first great immunological triumph was the development of the smallpox vaccine by the english researcher edward jenner in the late eighteenth century.
a vaccine effective against typhoid was the affluent society 683 developed by an english bacteriologist almroth wright in 1897 and was in wide use by world war i vaccination against tetanus became widespread just before and during world war ii.
medical scientists also developed a vaccine against another major killer tuberculosis in the 1920s but controversy over its safety stalled its adoption especially in the united states for many years.
it was not widely used in the united states until after world war ii when it largely eliminated tuberculosis until a limited recurrence began in the 1990s.
viruses are much more difficult to prevent and treat than bacterial infections and progress toward vaccines against viral infections except for smallpox was relatively slow.
not until the 1930s when scientists discovered how to grow viruses in tissue cultures could researchers study them with any real effectiveness.
gradually they discovered how to produce forms of a virus capable of triggering antibodies that would protect vaccinated people from contracting disease.
an effective vaccine against yellow fever was developed in the late 1930s and one against influenza one of the great killers of the early twentieth century appeared in 1945.
a particularly dramatic postwar triumph was the development of a vaccine against polio.
in 1954 the american scientist jonas salk introduced an effective polio vaccine vaccine against the disease that had killed or crippled thousands of children and adults among them franklin roosevelt.
it was provided free to the public by the federal government beginning in 1955.
after 1960 an oral vaccine developed by albert sabin usually administered in a sugar cube made widespread vaccination even easier.
by the early 1960s these vaccines had virtually eliminated polio from american life and from much of the rest of the world.
advancements made in mass production and administration of resources expanded the use and availability of the previous decades discoveries.
as a result both infant mortality and the death rate among young children declined significantly in the first twenty five years after the war although not by as much as in western europe.
average life expectancy in that same period rose by five years to seventy one.
these medical advances have saved millions but overuse of antibacterial agents and time has led to genetic mutations in once controlled diseases.
these super bugs resist traditional medical solutions and their defeat represents the next great challenge of the medical field.
pesticides scientists also developed new kinds of chemical pesticides to protect crops from destruction by insects and to protect humans from such insect carried diseases as typhus and ddt malaria.
perhaps the most famous of the new pesticides was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane generally known as ddt a compound discovered in 1939 by the swiss chemist paul muller.
he had discovered that although ddt seemed harmless to human beings and other mammals it was extremely toxic to insects.
american scientists learned of mullers discovery in 1942 just as the army was grappling with the insect borne tropical diseases especially malaria and typhus that threatened american soldiers.
ddt was first used on a large scale in italy in 1943 1944 during a typhus outbreak which it quickly helped end.
soon ddt was being sprayed in mosquito infested areas of pacific islands where american troops were fighting the japanese.
the incidence of malaria dropped precipitously.
ddt quickly gained a reputation as a miraculous tool for controlling insects and it undoubtedly saved thousands of lives.
only later did it become evident that ddt had long term toxic effects on animals and humans.
684 chapter 28 postwar electronic research the 1940s and 1950s saw dramatic new developments in electronic technology.
researchers in the 1940s produced the first commercially viable televisions and created a technology that made it possible to broadcast programming over large areas.
in the late 1950s scientists at radio corporation of america better known as rca developed color television which first became widely available in the early 1960s.
in 1948 bell labs the research arm of at t produced the first transistor a solid state device capable of amplifying electrical signals that was much smaller and more efficient than the cumbersome vacuum tubes that had powered most electronic equipment in the past.
transistors made possible the miniaturization of many devices radios televisions audio equipment hearing aids and were also important in aviation weaponry and satellites.
they contributed as well to another major breakthrough in electronics the development of integrated circuitry in the late 1950s.
integrated circuits combined a number of once separate electronic elements transistors resistors diodes and others and embedded them into a single microscopically small device.
they made it possible to create increasingly complex electronic devices requiring complicated circuitry that would have been impractical to produce through other means.
most of all integrated circuits helped advance the development of the computer.
television postwar computer technology prior to the 1950s computers had been constructed mainly to perform complicated mathematical tasks such as breaking military codes.
in the 1950s they began to perform commercial functions for the first time.
the first significant computer of the 1950s was the universal automatic computer or univac which was developed initially for the u s bureau of the census by the remington rand company.
it was able to handle both alphabetical and numerical information easily.
it used tape storage and could perform calculations and other functions much faster than its predecessor the electronic numerical integrator and computer.
searching for a larger market for its very expensive new device remington rand arranged univac to use a univac to predict the results of the 1952 election for cbs television news.
analyzing early voting results the univac accurately predicted an enormous landslide victory for eisenhower over stevenson.
few americans had ever heard of a computer before that night and the univacs television debut became a critical breakthrough in public awareness of computer technology.
remington rand had limited success in marketing the univac but in the mid 1950s the international business machines company ibm introduced its first major data processing computers and marketed them among businesses in the united states and abroad.
these early successes combined with the enormous amount of money ibm invested in research and development made the company the worldwide leader in computers for many years.
bombs rockets and missiles in 1952 the united states successfully detonated the first hydrogen bomb.
the soviet union tested its first h bomb a year later.
unlike the plutonium and uranium bombs developed during world war ii the hydrogen bomb derives its vastly greater power not nuclear fusion from fission the splitting of atoms but fusion the joining together of lighter atomic elements with heavier ones.
the affluent society 685 the hydrogen bomb gave considerable impetus to a stalled scientific project in both the united states and the soviet union the effort to develop unmanned rockets and missiles capable of carrying the new weapons not suitable for delivery by airplanes to their targets.
both nations began to put tremendous resources into their development.
the united states benefited from the emigration to america of some of the german scientists who had helped develop rocketry for germany during world war ii.
in the united states early missile research conducted almost entirely by the air force produced significant early successes in developing rockets capable of traveling several hundred miles.
but american and soviet leaders struggled to build longer range missiles that were capable of traveling through space and across oceans and continents to reach distant targets intercontinental ballistic missiles or icbms.
american scientists experimented icbms in the 1950s first with the atlas and then the titan icbm.
despite some early successes the difficulty of massing sufficient stable fuel to provide the tremendous power needed to launch missiles beyond the atmosphere stymied progress.
by 1958 however scientists had created a solid fuel to replace the volatile liquid fuels of the early missiles.
they had also produced miniaturized guidance systems capable of ensuring that missiles could travel to reasonably precise destinations.
within a few years a new generation of missile capable of traveling several thousand miles known as the minuteman became the basis of the american atomic weapons arsenal.
american scientists also developed a nuclear missile capable of being carried and fired by submarines the polaris which is launched from below the surface of the ocean by compressed air and fires its engines only once it is above the surface.
a polaris was first successfully fired from underwater in 1960.
the space program in the beginning the american space program was a by product of the rivalry with the soviet union.
its origins can be traced most directly to a dramatic event in 1957 when the soviet union announced that it had launched an earth orbiting satellite sputnik into outer space.
the united states had yet to perform any similar feats and the sputnik american government and much of american society reacted with alarm.
federal policy began encouraging and funding strenuous efforts to improve scientific education in the schools to create more research laboratories and above all to speed the development of americas own exploration of outer space.
the united states launched its own first satellite explorer i in january 1958.
the centerpiece of space exploration however soon became the manned space program established in 1958 along with a new agency the national aeronautics and space administration nasa.
the first american space pilots or astronauts quickly became revered heroes.
on may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american launched into space.
but his short suborbital flight came several months after a soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin had made a flight in which he had actually orbited the earth.
on february 2 1962 john glenn later a united states senator became the first american to orbit the globe.
nasa later introduced the gemini program whose spacecraft could carry two astronauts at once.
these early successes led to the creation of the apollo program whose purpose was to land astronauts on the moon.
it suffered some catastrophic setbacks most apollo program notably a fire in january 1967 that killed three astronauts during a training session.
but on july 20 1969 neil armstrong edwin buzz aldrin and michael collins successfully traveled in a space capsule into orbit around the moon.
armstrong and aldrin then 686 chapter 28 edwin buzz aldrin is photographed by his fellow astronaut neil armstrong in july 1969 when they became the first humans to set foot on the surface of the moon.
nasa moon walk detached a smaller craft from the capsule landed on the surface of the moon and became the first humans to walk on a celestial body other than earth.
six more lunar missions followed the last in 1972.
eventually the space program became a relatively modest effort to make travel in near space easier and more practical through the development of the space shuttle an airplanelike device launched by a missile but capable of both navigating in space and landing on earth much like a conventional aircraft.
the first space shuttle was successfully launched in 1982.
the explosion of one shuttle challenger in january 1986 shortly after takeoff killing all seven astronauts stalled the program for two years.
missions resumed in the late 1980s but problems remained as illustrated by the explosion of the space shuttle columbia during reentry in 2003.
the space shuttle was used to launch and repair communications satellites and to insert the hubble space telescope into orbit in 1990 and to repair its flawed lens on several occasions including in 2009.
the space shuttle program officially ended in 2011.
people of plenty among the most striking social developments of the postwar era was the rapid extension of a middle class lifestyle and outlook to an expanding portion of the population.
the historian david potter published an influential examination of economic abundance and american character in 1954.
he called it people of plenty.
for the american middle class in the 1950s at least it seemed an appropriate label.
the affluent society 687 the consumer culture at the center of middle class culture in the 1950s was a growing preoccupation with consumer goods a result of increased prosperity greater variety and availability of products and the adeptness of advertisers in creating demand.
it was also a result of the growth of consumer credit which increased by 800 percent between 1945 and 1957 through the development of credit cards revolving charge accounts and easy payment plans.
prosperity fueled a greater desire for such longtime consumer goods as the automobile and detroit responded to the boom with ever flashier styling and accessories.
consumers also responded eagerly to such new products as dishwashers garbage disposals television and stereos.
because consumer goods were so often marketed and advertised nationally the 1950s were notable for the rapid spread of great national consumer crazes.
for example children adolescents and even some adults became entranced in the late 1950s with the hula hoop a large plastic ring kept spinning around the waist.
the popularity of the walt disney produced childrens television show the mickey mouse club created a national demand for mickey mouse watches and hats and also contributed to the stunning success of disneyland an amusement park near los angeles that re created many of the characters and events of disney entertainment programs.
the suburban nation a third of the nations population lived in suburbs by 1960 a result not only of increased affluence but of important innovations in home building which made single family houses affordable to millions of new people.
the most famous of the suburban developers william levitt built low cost mass produced houses in large suburban developments known as levittowns these types of relatively inexpensive developments levittowns popped up in new york new jersey and pennsylvania but also soon appeared throughout the country.
why did so many americans want to move to the suburbs.
one reason was the enormous importance postwar americans placed on family life after five years of war.
suburbs provided families with larger homes than they could find or afford in the cities and thus made it easier to raise larger numbers of children.
the suburbs provided privacy and a sense of security from the noise and dangers of urban living.
they offered space for new consumer goods the appliances cars boats outdoor furniture and other products that many middleclass americans craved.
another factor motivating white americans to move to the suburbs was race.
most suburbs were restricted to white inhabitants both because relatively few african americans could afford to live in them and because formal and informal barriers kept even prosperous blacks out of all but a few.
in an era when the black population of most cities was rapidly growing many white families fled to the suburbs to escape the integration of urban neighborhoods and schools.
the suburban family for professional men who tended to work in the city at some distance from their homes suburban life generally meant a rigid division between their working and personal worlds.
for many middle class women it meant an increased isolation from the workplace.
many middle class husbands considered it demeaning for their wives to be employed.
and many 688 chapter 28 women themselves shied away from the workplace when they could afford to in part because of prevailing ideas about motherhood popularized by such widely consulted books as dr benjamin spocks baby and child care first published in 1946 that advised women to stay at home with their children.
stay at home mothers supposedly raised healthier more disciplined children.
some women however had to balance these pressures against other contradictory ones.
as expectations of material comfort rose many middle class families needed a second income to maintain the standard of living they desired.
as a result the number of married women working outside the home actually increased in the postwar years.
by 1960 nearly a third of all married women were part of the paid workforce.
the birth of television television was the result of a series of scientific and technological discoveries but its impact was largely social and cultural.
it quickly became perhaps the most powerful medium of mass communication in history.
experiments in broadcasting pictures along with sound had begun as early as the 1920s but commercial television began only shortly after world war ii.
its growth was phenomenally rapid.
in 1946 there were only 17 000 sets in the country by 1957 there were 40 million almost as many television sets as there were families.
more people had television sets according to one report than had refrigerators.
the television industry emerged directly out of the radio industry and all three of the major networks the national broadcasting company the columbia broadcasting system and the american broadcasting company had started as radio companies.
advertising drove the television business.
the need to attract advertisers determined most programming decisions and in the early days of television corporate sponsors often played a direct role in determining the content of programs.
many early television shows bore the names of the corporations that were paying for them the general electric theater the chrysler theatre the camel news caravan and others.
some daytime serials known as soap operas because their sponsors were almost always companies making household goods targeted at women were actually written and produced by procter gamble and other companies.
by the late 1950s television news had replaced newspapers magazines and radios as the nations most important vehicle of information.
television advertising helped create a vast market for new fashions and products.
televised athletic events made college and professional sports one of the most important sources of entertainment and one of the biggest businesses in america by the 1970s.
television entertainment programming almost all of it controlled by the three national networks and their corporate sponsors replaced movies and radio as the principal source of diversion for american families.
much of the programming of the 1950s and early 1960s created a common image of american life an image that was predominantly white middle class and suburban.
television was epitomized by the popular situation comedies featuring families in which as the title of one of the most popular shows put it father knows best and women were mothers and housewives striving to serve their children and please their husbands.
another top comedy i love lucy featured women in conventional roles but also tried to expand them often in hilarious ways.
i love lucy both idealized and poked fun at conventional domestic life.
the affluent society 689 although the network worried that american viewers would not accept an ethnically mixed marriage desi was cuban born lucy was anglo american i love lucy was a huge hit for cbs in the 1950s.
people identified with the ricardos lucille ball once said because we had the same problems they had.
we just took ordinary situations and exaggerated them cbs photofest lucy and desi yet television also could create conditions that could accentuate social conflict.
even those unable to share in the affluence of the era could through television acquire a vivid picture of how the rest of their society lived.
while television was celebrating the white middle class it was also showing glimpses of the alienation and powerlessness of groups who felt excluded from the world it portrayed.
and television news conveyed with unprecedented power the social upheavals that gradually spread beginning in the late 1950s.
travel outdoor recreation and environmentalism although the idea of a paid vacation for american workers and the connection of that idea with travel had entered american culture beginning in the 1920s it was not until the postwar years that vacation travel became truly widespread among middleincome americans.
the construction of the interstate highway system contributed dramatically to the growth of travel.
see patterns of popular culture on the road so did the increasing affluence of workers.
even in the 1950s there was a healthy market for vacation vehicles trailers and small vans.
that market grew steadily larger in subsequent decades.
but the urge to travel was also an expression of some of the same impulses that produced suburbs a desire to escape the crowding and stress of densely populated areas and find a place where it was possible to experience the natural world.
patterns of popular culture on the road people have traveled across the americas for thousands of years often with considerable difficulty.
indians had to make paths over rough terrain.
immigrants from england scotland mexico and many other places began to move from town to town often on log roads.
later they used stones and pebbles to create new byways.
wagons and carriages often rode on bumpy or muddy surfaces.
of course many years later more efficient comfortable roads were built across the american continent a development that changed american life dramatically.
in the mid twentieth century automobiles traveled more slowly than they do today.
but cars allowed travelers to discover interesting places and meet new people as they moved from town to town.
jack kerouac in his famous book on the road 1957 was one of the first to capture in writing the new spirit of automobile travel.
it was drizzling and mysterious at the beginning of our journey kerouac wrote as he got his battered car ready.
i could see that it was all going to be one big saga of the mist.
we were all delighted when we all realized we were leaving confusion and nonsense behind and performing our one and noble function of the time move.
and we moved in the 1950s route 66 was one of the first highways to cross most of the united states from the west coast to chicago.
but route 66 became more than a road it became a popular symbol of a country on the move.
travelers could drive along the famous highway while listening to the hit song get your kicks on route 66 on the radio.
a television series called route 66 690 depicted characters becoming involved in all sorts of drama as they traveled the storied route.
people traveling long distances perhaps even across the continent needed restaurants motels and shops a development that encouraged the creation of fastfood chains many of which began with drive in restaurants where customers could be served and eat in their cars.
the first drive in restaurant royce haileys pig stand opened in dallas in 1921 followed later in the decade by the white tower.
ray krocs mcdonalds opened its first the television show route 66 starring george maharis and martin milner conveyed in popular culture the optimistic energy of a driving nation.
cbs photofest route 66 outlets in des plaines illinois and southern california in 1955.
five years later there were 228 outlets.
in time with thousands of restaurants mcdonalds became the most recognizable symbol of food in the world.
large supermarket chains catering to customers with automobiles replaced smaller family owned markets in town centers.
large centers and shopping malls moved the center of retailing out of cities and into separate sprawling c omplexes surrounded by large parking lots.
eventually with president eisenhowers encouragement the federal highway act of 1956 provided money to build the interstate highway system.
this network of highways made it possible for people to travel long distances quickly and efficiently.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
how did television programs like route 66 of the mid 1950s reflect much older american myths about the american west.
in what other ways than those described in this feature did the interstate highway system help the american economy.
what military advantages did the highway system provide.
nowhere was this surge in travel and recreation more visible than in national parks which underwent a long term surge in attendance in the 1950s.
people who traveled to national parks did so for many reasons some to hike and camp others to fish and hunt and still others simply to see the extraordinary landscape.
but whatever their motives most visitors came in search of an experience in the wilderness.
the importance of that search became clear in the early 1950s with the fight to preserve echo park.
echo park is a spectacular valley in the dinosaur national monument on the border between utah and colorado and near the southern border of wyoming.
in the early 1950s the federal governments bureau of reclamation which encouraged irrigation electric power and water supplies proposed building a dam across the green river which runs through echo valley to create a lake for recreation and a source of echo park controversy hydroelectric power.
the american environmental movement had been relatively quiet since its searing defeat early in the century in its effort to stop a similar dam in the hetch hetchy valley at yosemite national park.
but the echo park proposal helped rouse it from its slumber.
in 1950 bernard devoto a well known writer and a great champion of the american west published an essay in the saturday evening post titled shall we let them ruin our national parks it had a sensational impact arousing opposition to the echo valley dam from many areas of the country.
the sierra club relatively obscure in previous decades sprang into action.
the controversy helped elevate a new and aggressive leader david brower who eventually transformed the club into one of the nations leading environmental organizations.
by the mid 1950s a large coalition of environmentalists naturalists and wilderness vacationers had mobilized in opposition to the dam and in 1956 congress bowing to public pressure blocked the project and preserved echo park in its natural state.
the controversy was a major victory for those who wished to preserve the sanctity of the national parks and it was an important spur to the dawning environmental consciousness.
691 692 chapter 28 organized society and its detractors large scale organizations and bureaucracies increased their influence over american life in the postwar era as they had been doing for many decades before.
white collar workers came to outnumber blue collar laborers for the first time and an increasing proportion of them worked in corporate settings with rigid hierarchical structures.
industrial workers also confronted large bureaucracies both in the workplace and in their own unions.
the debilitating impact of bureaucratic life on the individual became one of the central themes of popular and scholarly debate.
william h whyte jr produced one of the most the organization man widely discussed books of the decade the organization man 1956 which attempted to describe the special mentality of the worker in a large bureaucratic setting.
self reliance whyte claimed was losing place to conformity and the ability to get along and work as a team the sociologist david riesman made similar observations in the lonely crowd 1950 in which he argued that the traditional inner directed man who judged himself on the basis of his own values and the esteem of his family was giving way to a new other directed man more concerned with winning the approval of the larger organization or community.
novelists too expressed misgivings in their work about the impersonality of modern society.
saul bellow produced a series of novels the adventures of augie march 1953 seize the day 1956 herzog 1964 and many others that chronicled the difficulties of american jewish men in finding fulfillment in modern urban america.
j d salinger wrote in the catcher in the rye 1951 of a prep school student holden caulfield who is unable to find any area of society school family friends city in which he can feel secure or committed.
the beats and the restless culture of youth the most derisive critics of bureaucracy and middle class society were a group of young poets writers and artists known as the beats and often called beatniks by disapproving critics.
they wrote harsh critiques of what they considered the sterility and conformity of american life the meaninglessness of american politics and the banality of popular culture.
jack kerouac produced the most popular document of the beat generation in his novel on the road 1957 an account of a cross country automobile trip that depicts the rootless iconoclastic lifestyle of kerouac and his friends.
the beats were the most visible evidence of a widespread restiveness among young juvenile delinquency americans in the 1950s.
the phenomenon of juvenile delinquency attracted tremendous public attention and in both politics and popular culture dire warnings surfaced about the growing criminality of american youth.
the 1955 film blackboard jungle for example was a frightening depiction of crime and violence in city schools.
scholarly studies presidential commissions and journalistic exposs all contributed to the sense of alarm about the spread of delinquency although in fact youth crime did not dramatically increase in the 1950s.
the culture of alienation that the beats so vividly represented had counterparts even in ordinary middle class behavior teenage rebelliousness toward parents youthful fascination with fast cars and motorcycles and increasing sexual activity assisted by the greater availability of birth control devices.
the popularity of james dean who starred in rebel without a cause 1955 east of eden 1955 and giant 1956 was a particularly vivid sign of youth culture in the 1950s.
both in the roles he played moody alienated teenagers and young men with a streak of self destructive violence and in the way he lived beat writers the affluent society 693 his own life he died in 1955 at the age of 24 in an automobile accident dean became an icon of the unfocused rebelliousness of american youth in his time.
rock n roll one of the most important cultural developments of the 1950s was the birth of rock n roll and the enormous popularity of the greatest early rock star elvis presley.
elvis presley presley became a symbol of a youthful determination to push at the borders of the conventional and the acceptable.
his sultry good looks his self conscious effort to dress in the vaguely rebellious style of urban gangs motorcycle jackets and slicked back hair even though presley himself was a product of the conservative rural south and most of all the open sexuality of his music and his public performances all made him wildly popular among young americans in the 1950s.
his first great hit heartbreak hotel established him as a national phenomenon in 1956 and he remained a powerful figure in american popular culture well after his death in 1977.
presleys music like that of many early white rock musicians drew heavily from black rhythm and blues traditions.
sam phillips a record promoter who had recorded some of the important black r b musicians of his time reportedly said in the early 1950s if i could find a white man with a negro sound i could make a billion dollars soon after that he found presley.
but there were others as well among them buddy holly and bill haley whose 1955 song rock around the clock used in the film blackboard jungle announced the arrival of rock n roll to millions of young people who were closely connected to african american musical traditions.
rock drew from other sources too from country western music another strong influence on presley from gospel music even from jazz.
elvis this photograph of the musician in performance is from very early in his career.
photo by hulton archive getty images 694 chapter 28 the 1950s also saw african american bands and singers grow in popularity among both black and white audiences.
chuck berry little richard b.
king chubby checker the temptations the miracles the supremes and others many of them recorded by the motown records black producer berry gordy the founder and president of motown records in detroit never rivaled presley in their popularity among white youths but did develop significant multiracial audiences of their own.
the rapid rise of rock owed a great deal to innovations in radio and television programming.
by the 1950s radio stations no longer felt obliged to present mostly live programming especially once television took over many of the entertainment functions radio had once performed.
instead many radio stations devoted themselves almost entirely to playing recorded music.
early in the 1950s a new breed of radio announcers known as disk jockeys or djs for the records they played began to create programming aimed specifically at young fans of rock music and when those programs became wildly successful other stations followed suit.
american bandstand which began airing in 1957 was a televised showcase for rock n roll hits in which a live audience danced to recorded music.
the program helped spread the popularity of rock and made its host dick clark one of the best known figures among young americans.
radio and television were important to the recording industry of course because they encouraged the rapidly increasing sale of records in the mid and late 1950s especially in the inexpensive and popular 45 rpm format small disks that contained one song on each side.
also important were jukeboxes which played individual songs on 45s and which proliferated in soda fountains diners bars and other places where young people congregated.
sales of records increased from 182 million to 521 million between 1954 and 1960.
so eager were record promoters to get their songs on the air that they routinely made secret payments to station owners and disk jockeys to encourpayola scandals age them to showcase their artists.
these payments which became known as payola produced a briefly sensational series of scandals when they were exposed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
the other america it was relatively easy for white middle class americans in the 1950s to believe that the world of economic growth personal affluence and cultural homogeneity was universal and that their values and assumptions were ones that most other americans shared.
but such beliefs were false.
large groups of americans remained outside the circle of abundance and shared neither in the affluence of the middle class nor in many of its values.
on the margins of the affluent society in 1962 the socialist writer michael harrington published a celebrated book called the other america which chronicled the continuing existence of poverty in the united states.
the great economic expansion of the postwar years reduced poverty dramatically but the other america did not eliminate it.
in 1960 at any given moment more than a fifth of all american families over 30 million people continued to live below what the government defined as the poverty line down from a third of all families fifteen years before.
many millions more lived just above the official poverty line but with incomes that gave them little comfort and no security.
the affluent society 695 most of the poor up to 80 percent experienced poverty intermittently and temporarily.
but approximately 20 percent were people for whom poverty was a continuous often inescapable reality.
that included approximately half the nations elderly population and a significant proportion of african americans and hispanics.
native americans constituted the single poorest group in the country.
this hard core poverty rebuked the popular assumption that a rising tide lifts all boats it was a poverty that the growing prosperity of the postwar era seemed to affect hardly at all a poverty as harrington observed that appeared impervious to hope rural poverty among those on the margins of the affluent society were many rural americans.
in 1948 farmers had received 8 9 percent of the national income in 1956 they received only 4 1 percent.
in part this decline reflected the steadily shrinking farm population in 1956 alone nearly 10 percent of the rural population moved into or was absorbed by cities.
but it also reflected declining farm prices.
because of enormous surpluses in basic staples prices fell 33 percent in those years even though national income as a whole rose 50 percent at the same time.
the surpluses were the result of higher yields per acre as well as increases in the amount of acreage under production a function of the widespread use of tractors.
sharecroppers and tenant farmers most of them african american continued to live at or below subsistence levels throughout the rural south in part because of the mechanization of cotton picking after 1944 in part because of the development of synthetic fibers that reduced demand for cotton.
two thirds of the cotton acreage went out of production between 1930 and 1960.
migrant farmworkers a group concentrated especially in the west and southwest and containing many mexican american and asian american workers lived in similarly dire circumstances.
in rural areas without much commercial agriculture such as the appalachian region in the east where the decline of the coal economy reduced the one significant source of support for the region whole communities lived in desperate poverty increasingly cut off from the market economy.
all these groups were vulnerable to malnutrition and even starvation.
the inner cities as prospering white families moved from cities to suburbs in vast numbers more and more inner city neighborhoods became repositories for the poor ghettoes growth of ghettoes from which there was no easy escape.
the growth of these neighborhoods owed much to a vast migration of african americans out of the countryside and into industrial cities.
not all these black migrants were poor and many found in the city routes to economic progress similar to those of whites.
but african americans were substantially more likely to live in poverty than most other groups in part because of the persistent patterns of discrimination that denied them any real opportunities.
more than 3 million black men and women moved from the south to northern cities between 1940 and 1960.
chicago detroit cleveland new york and other eastern and midwestern industrial cities experienced a major expansion of their black populations while many whites were leaving cities at the same time.
similar migrations from mexico and puerto rico expanded poor hispanic neighborhoods in many american cities.
between 1940 and 1960 nearly a million puerto ricans moved into american cities especially new york.
mexican workers crossed the borders 696 chapter 28 into texas and california and swelled the already substantial latino communities of such cities as san antonio houston san diego and los angeles which by 1960 had the largest mexican american population of any city approximately 500 000 people.
inner cities filled up with poor minority residents at the same time that the unskilled industrial jobs they sought diminished.
employers were moving factories and mills from old industrial cities to new locations in suburban and rural areas smaller cities and even abroad places where the costs of labor were lower.
even in the factories that remained shrinking job opportunities automation reduced the number of unskilled jobs.
the economic opportunities that had helped earlier immigrant groups to rise up from poverty were unavailable to many of the postwar migrants.
racial discrimination in hiring education and housing doomed many members of these communities to continuing poverty.
the rise of the civil rights movement after decades of skirmishes an open battle began in the 1950s against racial segregation and discrimination a battle that would prove to be one of the longest and most difficult social struggles of the twentieth century.
white americans ultimately played an important role in the civil rights movement.
but pressure from african americans themselves was the crucial element in raising the issue of race to prominence.
the brown decision and massive resistance on may 17 1954 the supreme court announced its decision in the case of brown v board of education of topeka.
in considering the legal segregation of a kansas public school system the court rejected its own 1896 plessy v ferguson decision which had ruled that communities could provide african americans with separate facilities as long separate but equal rejected as the facilities were equal to those of whites.
the brown decision declared that segregating public schools on the basis of race was unconstitutional.
the justices argued that school segregation inflicted unacceptable damage on those it affected regardless of the relative quality of the separate schools.
chief justice earl warren explained the unanimous opinion of his colleagues we conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.
separate educational facilities are inherently unequal the following year the court issued another decision known as brown ii to provide rules for implementing the 1954 order.
it ruled that communities must work to desegregate their schools with all deliberate speed but it set no timetable and left specific decisions up to lower courts.
some communities such as washington d c complied relatively quickly and quietly.
more often however strong local opposition what came to be known in the south as massive resistance produced long delays and bitter conflicts.
more than 100 southern members of congress signed a 1956 manifesto denouncing the brown decision and urging their constituents to defy it.
southern governors mayors local school boards and nongovernmental pressure groups including hundreds of white citizens councils all worked to obstruct desegregation.
by the fall of 1957 only 684 of 3 000 affected school districts in the south had even begun to desegregate their schools.
the eisenhower administration was not eager to join the battle over desegregation.
but in september 1957 it faced a case of direct state defiance of federal authority and felt compelled to act.
federal courts had ordered the desegregation of central high the affluent society 697 african american student elizabeth eckford passes by jeering whites on her way to little rock central high school newly integrated by federal court order.
everett collection superstock little rock 1957 school in little rock arkansas.
an angry white mob tried to stop implementation of the order by blockading the entrances to the school.
governor little rocks central high school orval faubus refused to do anything to stop the obstruction.
president eisenhower finally responded by sending federal troops to little rock to keep the peace and ensure that the court orders would be obeyed.
only then did central high school admit its first black students.
the expanding movement the brown decision helped spark a growing number of popular challenges to other forms of segregation in the south.
on december 1 1955 rosa parks an african rosa parks american woman was arrested in montgomery alabama when she refused to give up her seat on a montgomery bus to a white passenger as required by the jim crow laws throughout most of the south.
the arrest of this admired woman and local civil rights leader produced outrage in the citys african american community which organized a boycott of the bus system to demand an end to segregated seating.
the boycott was almost completely effective.
it put economic pressure not only on the bus company but on many montgomery merchants because the boycotters found it difficult to get to downtown stores and shopped instead in their own neighborhoods.
even so the boycott might well have failed had it not been for a supreme court decision late in 1956 browder v gayle that declared segregation in public transportation to be illegal.
the buses in montgomery abandoned their discriminatory seating policies and the boycott came to a close.
698 chapter 28 among the most important accomplishments of the montgomery boycott were the legitimization of a new form of racial protest and the elevation to prominence of a new figure in the civil rights movement.
the man chosen to lead the boycott movement once it was launched martin luther king jr was a local baptist pastor martin luther king jr the son of a prominent atlanta minister a powerful orator and a gifted leader.
kings approach to black protest was based on the doctrine of nonviolent resistance to injustice even in the face of direct attack.
and he produced an approach to racial struggle that captured the moral high ground for his supporters.
for the next thirteen years as leader of the southern christian leadership conference sclc an interracial group he founded shortly after the boycott he was the most influential and most widely admired black leader in the country.
the popular movement he came to represent soon spread throughout the south and the country.
causes of the civil rights movement several factors contributed to the rise of african american protest in these years.
the legacy of world war ii was one of the most important.
millions of black women and men had served in the military or worked in war plants during the war.
they had fought to end totalitarianism and the suppression of freedom abroad and now demanded basic civil liberties at home.
another factor was the growth of an urban black middle class which had been developing for decades but which began to flourish after the war.
much of the impetus for the civil rights movement came from the leaders of urban black communities ministers educators professionals.
much of it came as well from students at black colleges and universities which had expanded significantly in the previous decades.
men and women with education were often more aware of the obstacles to their advancement than poorer and more oppressed people.
television and other forms of popular culture also played a role in the rising consciousness of racism.
more than any previous generation postwar blacks had constant vivid reminders of how the white majority lived of the world from which they were effectively excluded.
television also conveyed the activities of demonstrators to a national audience ensuring that activism in one community would inspire similar protests in others.
other forces mobilized many white americans to support the movement once it began.
the cold war made racial injustice an embarrassment to americans trying to present their nation as a model to the world.
political mobilization of northern blacks created a substantial voting bloc within the democratic party.
politicians from northern industrial states could not ignore their views.
labor unions with substantial black memberships also played an important part in supporting and funding the civil rights movement.
this great social movement emerged as one of the most powerful forces for racial change in america.
eisenhower republicanism dwight d eisenhower was the least experienced politician to serve in the white house in the twentieth century.
he was also among the most popular and politically successful presidents of the postwar era.
at home he pursued essentially moderate policies avoiding most new initiatives but accepting the work of earlier reformers.
abroad he continued and even intensified american commitments to oppose communism but also brought a measure of restraint that his successors did not always match.
the affluent society 699 what was good for.
general motors the first republican administration in twenty years staffed itself with men drawn from the same quarter as those who had staffed republican administrations in the 1920s the business community.
but by the 1950s many business leaders had acquired a social and political outlook very different from that of their predecessors.
above all many of the nations leading business executives and financiers had reconciled themselves to at least the broad outlines of the keynesian welfare state named after the famed great depression economist john maynard keynes and launched during the new deal.
indeed some corporate leaders had come to see it as something that actually benefited them by helping maintain social order by increasing mass purchasing power and by stabilizing labor relations.
to his cabinet eisenhower appointed wealthy corporate lawyers and business executives who were unapologetic about their backgrounds.
charles wilson president of general motors assured senators considering his nomination for secretary of defense that what was good for our country was good for general motors and vice versa eisenhower encouraged private enterprise.
he supported the private rather than public development of natural resources.
to the chagrin of farmers he lowered federal support for farm prices.
he also removed the last limited wage and price controls maintained by the truman administration opposed the creation of new social service programs such as national health insurance and strove constantly to reduce federal expenditures even during the recession of 1958 and balance the budget.
he ended 1960 his last full year in office with a 1 billion budget surplus.
the survival of the welfare state while the president took few new initiatives in domestic policy he steadily resisted conservative pressure to dismantle the welfare policies of the new deal.
indeed during his term he agreed to extend the social security system to an additional 10 million people and unemployment compensation to an additional 4 million and he approved an increase to the minimum hourly wage from 75 cents to 1.
one of the most significant legislative accomplishments of the eisenhower administration was the federal federal highway act of 1956 highway act of 1956 which authorized 25 billion for a ten year project that built over 40 000 miles of interstate highways the largest public works project in american history to that point.
the program was funded through a highway trust fund whose revenues would come from new taxes on the purchase of fuel automobiles trucks and tires.
in 1956 eisenhower ran for a second term even though he had suffered a serious heart attack the previous year.
with adlai stevenson opposing him once again he won by another even greater landslide receiving 57 6 percent of the popular vote and 457 electoral votes to stevensons 73.
democrats retained control of both houses of congress they had won back in 1954.
in 1958 even during a serious recession they increased that control by substantial margins.
the decline of mccarthyism the eisenhower administration did little in its first years in office to discourage the anticommunist furor that had gripped the nation.
by 1954 however what came to be known as mccarthyism began to become increasingly unpopular.
during the first year of the eisenhower administration mccarthy continued to operate with impunity.
but in january 1954 he attacked secretary of the army robert stevens 700 chapter 28 and the armed services in general claiming that communists had intruded into the military.
at that point the administration and influential members of congress organized a special army mccarthy hearings investigation of the charges the army mccarthy hearings which were among the first congressional hearings to be nationally televised.
watching mccarthy in action bullying witnesses hurling groundless and often cruel accusations evading issues much of the public began to see him as a villain and even a buffoon.
in december 1954 the senate voted 67 to 22 to condemn him for conduct unbecoming a senator three years later he died a victim apparently of complications arising from alcoholism.
the red scare did not die with mccarthy but its intensity soon began to decline.
eisenhower dulles and the cold war the threat of nuclear war created a sense of high anxiety in international relations in the 1950s.
but the nuclear threat also encouraged both superpowers to edge away from direct confrontations.
indeed the attention of both the united states and the soviet union began to turn instead to the rapidly growing instability in the third world.
dulles and massive retaliation secretary of state john foster dulles was the most important figure in the eisenhower administration next to the president himself.
he was an aristocratic corporate lawyer with a stern moral revulsion to communism.
he entered office denouncing the containment policies of the truman years as excessively passive arguing that the united states should pursue an active program of liberation which would lead to a rollback of communist expansion.
once in power however he had to defer to the more moderate views of the president himself.
the most prominent of dulless innovations was the policy of massive retaliation which he announced early in 1954.
the united states would he explained respond to communist threats to its allies not by using conventional forces in local conflicts a policy that he claimed had led to so much frustration in korea but by relying on the deterrent of massive retaliatory power by which he clearly meant nuclear weapons.
in part the new doctrines reflected dulless inclination for tense confrontations an approach he once defined as brinksmanship pushing the soviet union to the brink of war in order to exact concessions.
but the real force behind the massive retaliation policy was economics.
with pressure growing both in and out of government for a reduction in american military expenditures an increasing reliance on atomic weapons seemed to promise as some advocates put it more bang for the buck france america and vietnam on july 27 1953 negotiators at panmunjom finally signed an agreement ending the hostilities in korea.
each antagonist was to withdraw its troops a mile and a half from the existing battle line which ran roughly along the 38th parallel ironically the prewar border between north and south korea.
a conference in geneva was to consider means by which to reunite the nation peacefully although in fact that 1954 meeting produced no agreement and left the cease fire line in place as the apparently permanent border between the two countries into the twenty first century.
the affluent society 701 almost simultaneously however the united states was being drawn into a long bitter struggle in southeast asia.
ever since 1945 france had been attempting to restore its authority over vietnam its one time colony which it had been forced to abandon to the japanese toward the end of world war ii.
opposing the french however were the powerful nationalist forces of ho chi minh determined to win independence ho chi minh for their nation.
ho had hoped for american support in 1945 on the basis of the anticolonial rhetoric of the atlantic charter and franklin roosevelts speeches and also because he had received support from american intelligence forces during world war ii while fighting the japanese.
he was however not only a committed nationalist but a committed communist as well.
the truman administration ignored him and supported the french one of americas most important cold war allies.
by 1954 ho was receiving aid from communist china and the soviet union.
america in the meantime had been paying most of the costs of frances ineffective military campaign in vietnam since 1950.
early in 1954 12 000 french troops became surrounded in a disastrous siege at the village of dien bien phu.
only american intervention it was clear could prevent the total collapse of the french military effort.
yet despite the urgings of secretary of state dulles vice president nixon and others eisenhower refused to permit direct american military intervention in vietnam claiming that neither congress nor americas other allies would support such action.
without american aid the french defense of dien bien phu finally collapsed on may 7 1954 and france quickly abandoned vietnam.
they agreed to a settlement of the conflict at the same international conference in geneva that was considering the korean settlement.
the geneva accords on vietnam of july 1954 to a participant established a supposedly temporary division of vietnam along the 17th parallel.
the north would be governed by ho chi minh the south by a pro western regime.
democratic elections would be the basis for uniting the nation in 1956.
the agreement marked the end of the french commitment to vietnam and the beginning of an expanded american presence there.
the united u s involvement in vietnam states helped establish a pro american government in the south headed by ngo dinh diem a member of his countrys roman catholic minority.
because he enjoyed the full military backing of the american government diem acted ruthlessly at times refusing for example to permit the 1956 popular elections when he realized he would lose.
cold war crises american foreign policy in the 1950s was challenged by both real and imagined crises in far flung areas of the world.
among them were a series of crises in the middle east a region in which the united states had been little involved until after world war ii.
on may 14 1948 after years of zionist efforts and a decision by the new united nations the nation of israel proclaimed its independence.
president truman recognized the new jewish homeland the next day.
but the creation of israel while resolving some conflicts created others.
palestinian arabs unwilling to accept being displaced israel recognized from what they considered their own country joined with israels arab neighbors and fought determinedly against the new state in 1948 the first of several arab israeli wars.
committed as the american government was to israel it was also concerned about the stability and friendliness of the arab regimes in the oil rich middle east where american petroleum companies had major investments.
thus the united states reacted with alarm as it watched mohammed mossadegh the nationalist prime minister of iran begin to resist the presence of western corporations in his nation in the early 1950s.
in 1953 the 702 chapter 28 american cia joined forces with conservative iranian military leaders to engineer a coup that drove mossadegh from office.
to replace him the cia helped elevate the young shah of iran mohammed reza pahlevi from his position as token constitutional monarch to that of virtually absolute ruler.
the shah remained closely tied to the united states for the next twenty five years.
the u s state department was less effective in influencing the nationalist government of egypt under the leadership of general gamal abdel nasser.
he began to develop a trade relationship with the soviet union in the early 1950s.
in 1956 to punish nasser for his friendliness toward the communists dulles withdrew american offers to assist in building the great aswan dam across the nile.
a week later nasser retaliated by seizing control of the suez canal from the british saying that he would use the income from it to build the dam himself.
on october 29 1956 israeli forces attacked egypt.
the next day the british and french landed troops in the suez to drive the egyptians from the canal.
dulles and eisenhower suez crisis feared that the suez crisis would drive the arab states toward the soviet union and precipitate a new world war.
by refusing to support the invasion and by joining in a united nations denunciation of it the united states helped pressure the french and british to withdraw and persuaded israel to agree to a truce with egypt.
cold war concerns affected american relations in latin america as well.
in 1954 the cia in guatemala eisenhower administration ordered the cia to help topple the new leftist government of jacobo arbenz guzmn in guatemala a regime that dulles responding in part to the requests of the united fruit company a major investor in guatemala argued was potentially communist.
no nation in the region had been more closely tied to america than cuba.
its leader fulgencio batista had ruled as a military dictator since 1952 when american assistance castro in cuba helped him topple a more moderate government.
cubas relatively prosperous economy had become a virtual colony of american corporations which controlled almost all the islands natural resources and had cornered over half the vital sugar crop.
american organized crime syndicates controlled much of havanas lucrative hotel and nightlife business.
in 1957 a popular movement of resistance to the batista regime began to gather strength under the leadership of fidel castro.
on january 1 1959 as batista fled to exile in spain castro marched into havana and established a new government.
castro soon began implementing drastic policies of land reform and expropriating foreign owned businesses and resources.
he established himself as a dictator by canceling promised elections and jailing or killing political rivals and critics.
when castro began accepting assistance from the soviet union in 1960 the united states cut back the quota by which cuba could export sugar to america at a favored price.
early in 1961 as one of its last acts the eisenhower administration severed diplomatic relations with castro.
isolated by the united states castro soon cemented an alliance with the soviet union.
cia backed coup in iran the u 2 crisis although the problems of the third world were moving slowly toward the center of american foreign policy the direct relationship with the soviet union and the effort to resist communist expansion in europe remained the principal foreign policy concerns of the eisenhower administration.
relations between the soviet union and the west soured further in 1956 in response to the hungarian revolution.
hungarian dissidents had launched a popular uprising in november to demand democratic reforms.
before the month was out soviet tanks and troops rolled into budapest to crush the uprising and restore an orthodox pro soviet regime.
the affluent society 703 the cuban revolution fidel castro standing at center is shown here in the cuban jungle in 1957 with a small group of his staff and soldiers.
two years later castros forces toppled the u s backed batista government and elevated castro to the nations leadership where he remained for almost fifty years.
bettmann corbis in november 1958 nikita khrushchev who had become soviet premier and communist party chief earlier that year renewed the demands of his predecessors that the nato powers abandon west berlin.
when the united states and its allies predictably refused khrushchev suggested that he and eisenhower discuss the issue personally both in visits to each others countries and at a summit meeting in paris in 1960.
the united states agreed.
khrushchevs 1959 visit to america produced a cool but polite public response.
plans proceeded for the summit conference and for eisenhowers visit to moscow shortly thereafter.
only days before the paris meeting however the soviet union announced that it had shot down an american u 2 a high altitude spy plane over russian territory.
its pilot francis gary powers was in captivity.
khrushchev lashed out angrily at the american incursion into soviet airspace breaking up the paris summit almost before it could begin and withdrawing his invitation to eisenhower to visit the soviet union.
after eight years in office eisenhower had failed to eliminate and in some respects had actually increased the tensions between the united states and the soviet union.
yet eisenhower had also brought to the cold war his own sense of the limits of american power.
he had resisted military intervention in vietnam but he could not find a solution to vietnams likely slide into communism.
and he had placed a measure of restraint on those who urged the creation of an enormous american military establishment.
in military industrial complex his farewell address in january 1961 he warned of the unwarranted influence of a vast military industrial complex see consider the source eisenhower warns of the militaryindustrial complex his caution in both domestic and international affairs stood in marked contrast to the attitudes of his successors who argued that the united states must act more boldly and aggressively on behalf of its goals at home and abroad.
co ns ider t he s o urc e eisenhower warns of the military industrial complex in the tradition of outgoing presidents eisenhower delivered a farewell address that offered a summary of his accomplishments and vision for the future of the country.
he warned of a growing military industrial complex that if left unchecked would drive the nations economy and politics.
good evening my fellow americans.
this evening i come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you my countrymen.
like every other citizen i wish the new president and all who will labor with him godspeed.
i pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.
america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world.
understandably proud of this pre eminence we yet realize that americas leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.
a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment.
our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.
our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii or korea.
now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience.
the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every statehouse every office of the federal government.
we recognize the imperative need for this development.
yet we must not fail to comprehend its 704 grave implications.
our toil resources and livelihood are all involved.
so is the very structure of our society.
in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex.
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
we should take nothing for granted.
only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.
akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial military posture has been the technological revolution during recent decades.
in this revolution research has become central it also becomes more formalized complex and costly.
a steadily increasing share is conducted for by or at the direction of the federal government.
today the solitary inventor tinkering in his shop has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields.
in the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.
partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.
for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.
the prospect of domination of the nations scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
it is the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other forces new and old within the principles of our democratic system ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.
as we peer into societys future we you and i and our government must avoid the impulse to live only for today plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow.
we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage.
we want democracy to survive for all generations to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.
disarmament with mutual honor and confidence is a continuing imperative.
together we must learn how to compose differences not with arms but with intellect and decent purpose.
because this need is so sharp and apparent i confess that i lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment.
as one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years i wish i could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight.
you and i my fellow citizens need to be strong in our faith that all nations under god will reach the goal of peace with justice.
may we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle confident but humble with power diligent in pursuit of the nations great goals.
now on friday noon i am to become a private citizen.
i am proud to do so.
i look forward to it.
thank you and good night.

what specifically was the military industrial complex and how did it support american postwar prosperity.
how did it change the relationship between knowledge industrial production and defense.
what dangers for american political traditions did eisenhower foresee.

conclusion the booming economic growth of the 1950s and the anxiety over the cold war that formed a backdrop to it shaped the politics and the culture of the decade.
for most americans the 1950s were years of increasing personal prosperity.
sales of private homes increased dramatically suburbs grew precipitously young families had children at an astounding rate creating what came to be known as the postwar baby boom after the end of the divisive korean war the nations politics entered a period of relative calm symbolized by the genial presence in the white house of dwight d eisenhower who provided moderate and undemanding leadership through most of the decade.
705 706 chapter 28 the nations culture too helped create a broad sense of stability and calm.
television which emerged in the 1950s as the most powerful medium of mass culture presented largely uncontroversial programming dominated by middle class images and traditional values.
movies theater popular magazines and newspapers all contributed to a broad sense of well being.
but the 1950s were not in the end as calm and contented as the politics and popular culture of the time suggested.
a powerful youth culture emerged in these years displaying a considerable level of restiveness and even disillusionment.
african americans began to escalate their protests against segregation and inequality.
the continuing existence of widespread poverty among large groups of americans attracted increasing attention as the decade progressed.
these pulsing anxieties combined with frustration over the continuing tensions of the cold war produced by the late 1950s a growing sense of impatience with the calm placid public culture of the time.
that was one reason for the growing desire for action and innovation as the 1960s began.

why did the civil rights movement become increasingly assertive and militant over the course of the 1960s.
how did u s involvement in vietnam escalate through the 1960s.
what were the political and social consequences of that escalation in both vietnam and the united states.
by the late 1950s a growing restlessness was bubbling beneath the apparently placid surface of american society.
ultimately that restlessness would make the 1960s one of the most turbulent and divisive eras of the twentieth century.
but at first it contributed to a bold and confident effort by political leaders to attack social and international problems within the framework of conventional liberalism.

the two men who served in the white house through most of the 1960s john kennedy and lyndon johnson seemed for a time to embody these liberal hopes.
john kennedy the campaign of 1960 produced two young candidates who claimed to offer the nation active leadership.
the republican nomination went almost uncontested to vice president richard nixon who promised moderate reform.
the democrats in the meantime emerged from a spirited primary campaign united although somewhat uneasily behind john fitzgerald kennedy an attractive and articulate senator from massachusetts who had narrowly missed being the partys vice presidential candidate in 1956.
john kennedy was the young son of the wealthy powerful and highly controversial joseph p kennedy former american ambassador to britain.
he premised his campaign he said on the single assumption that the american people are uneasy at the present drift in our national course but his appealing public image was at least as important as his political positions in attracting popular support.
kennedy regularly appeared on television talk shows before and during his run for president and his appearances helped comfort the american people despite his perceived weaknesses as a presidential candidate.
he overcame doubts about his youth he turned forty three in 1960 and religion he was catholic to win with a tiny plurality of the popular vote 49 7 percent to nixons 49 6 percent and only a slightly more comfortable electoral majority 303 to 219.

john kennedys margin over richard nixon was less than one third of 1 percent of the total national vote but greater in the electoral college.
note the distribution of electoral strength of the two candidates.
kennedy was strong in the industrial northeast and the largest industrial states of the midwest and he retained at least a portion of his partys traditional strength in the south and southwest.
but nixon made significant inroads into the upper south carried florida and swept most of the plains and mountain states.
what was the significance of this distribution of strength to the future of the two parties.
kennedy had campaigned promising a set of domestic reforms he described as the new frontier but his thin popular mandate and a congress dominated by a coalition of republicans and conservative democrats frustrated many of his hopes.
kennedy did manage to win approval of tariff reductions his administration had negotiated and he began to build a legislative agenda including a call for a significant tax cut to promote economic growth.
more than any other president of the century except perhaps the two roosevelts and later ronald reagan kennedy made his own personality an integral kennedy assassination part of his presidency and a central focus of national attention.
nothing illustrated that more clearly than the popular reaction to the tragedy of november 22 1963.
in texas with his wife and vice president lyndon johnson for a series of political appearances as the presidential motorcade rode slowly through the streets of dallas shots rang out.
two bullets struck the president one in the throat the other in the head.
he was sped to a nearby hospital where minutes later he was pronounced dead.
lee harvey oswald a young man who had spent time in the soviet union and later in cuba was arrested for.
768 chapter 31 central to the economic problems was the continuing energy crisis.
in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo of 1973 the opec cartel raised the price of oil by 400 percent in 1974 alone one of the principal reasons why inflation reached 11 percent in 1976.
ford retained henry kissinger as secretary of state and generally continued the foreign policies of the nixon years.
late in 1974 ford met with leonid brezhnev at vladivostok in siberia and signed an arms control accord.
meanwhile in the middle east henry kissinger helped produce a new accord by which israel agreed to return large portions of the occupied sinai to egypt.
the two nations pledged not to resolve future differences by force.
as the 1976 presidential election approached fords policies were coming under increasing 1976 election attack from both the right and the left.
in the republican primary campaign ford faced a powerful challenge from former california governor ronald reagan leader of the partys conservative wing who spoke for many americans on the right who opposed any agreements with communists.
the president barely survived the assault to win his partys nomination.
the democrats in the meantime were gradually uniting behind a new and until recently almost entirely unknown candidate jimmy carter a former governor of georgia who appealed to the general unhappiness with washington by offering honesty piety and an outsiders skepticism of the federal government.

his showing indicated the importance to the democratic party of having a candidate capable of attracting support in the south which was becoming increasingly republican by the 1970s.
what drove so many southerners into the republican party.
from the age of limits to the age of reagan 769 disenchantment with ford enabled the democrat to win a narrow victory.
carter received 50 percent of the popular vote to fords 47 9 percent and 297 electoral votes to fords 240.
the trials of jimmy carter like ford jimmy carter assumed the presidency at a moment when the nation faced problems of staggering complexity and difficulty.
but carter seemed at times to make his predicament worse by a style of leadership that many americans considered self righteous and inflexible.
carter devoted much of his time to the problems of energy and the economy.
entering office in the midst of a recession he moved first to reduce unemployment by raising public spending and cutting federal taxes.
unemployment declined but inflation soared mostly because of the continuing sharp increases in energy prices by opec.
during carters last two years in office retail prices rose at over a 10 percent annual rate.
like nixon and ford before him carter responded with a combination of tight money and calls for voluntary restraint.
determined to stop inflation he appointed conservative economists to head the federal reserve board which helped push interest rates to the highest levels in american history at times they exceeded 20 percent.
in the summer of 1979 instability in the middle east produced a second major fuel shortage in the united states.
in the midst of the crisis opec announced another major price increase.
faced with increasing pressure to act carter went to camp david the presidential retreat in the maryland mountains.
ten days later he emerged to deliver a remarkable television address.
it included a series of proposals for resolving the energy crisis.
but it was most notable for carters bleak assessment of the national condition and his claim that there was a crisis of confidence that had struck at the very heart and soul of our national will the address became known as the malaise speech although carter himself had never used that word and it helped fuel charges that the president was trying to blame his own problems on the american people.
carters sudden firing of several members of his cabinet a few days later deepened his political dilemma.
human rights and national interests among jimmy carters most frequent campaign promises was a new american foreign policy based on the defense of human rights carter spoke out sharply about human rights violations in many countries including most prominently the soviet union.
but the administration also focused on more traditional concerns.
carter completed negotiations begun several years earlier on a pair of treaties to turn over control of the panama canal to the government of panama.
after an acrimonious debate the senate panama canal treaties ratified the treaties by 68 to 32 only one vote more than the necessary two thirds majority.
carters greatest success was in arranging a peace treaty between egypt and israel.
middle east negotiations had seemed hopelessly stalled until egyptian president anwar sadat accepted an invitation in november 1977 from prime minister menachem begin to visit israel.
in tel aviv he announced that egypt was now willing to accept the state of israel as a legitimate political entity.
when talks between israeli and egyptian negotiators stalled carter invited sadat and begin to a summit conference at camp david in september 1978 and persuaded them to remain there for two weeks.
on september 17 carter escorted the two leaders into the white house to announce an agreement on a framework for an egyptian israeli peace treaty known as the camp david accords.
on march 26 1979 begin and sadat camp david accords returned together to the white house to sign a formal peace treaty between their two nations.
770 chapter 31 jimmy carter experienced many frustrations during his presidency but his successful efforts in 1978 to negotiate a peace treaty between israel and egypt were undoubtedly his finest hour.
egyptian president anwar sadat and israeli prime minister menachem begin join carter here in the east room of the white house in september 1978 to sign the accords.
owen black star signing the camp david accords in the meantime carter continued trying to improve relations with china and the soviet union.
he responded eagerly to the overtures of deng xiaoping the new chinese leader attempting to open his nation to the outside world.
on december 15 1978 washington and beijing announced the resumption of formal diplomatic relations.
a few months later carter traveled to vienna to meet with the aging and ailing brezhnev to finish drafting the new strategic arms limitations treaty ii salt ii arms control agreement which set limits on the number of long range missiles bombers and nuclear warheads on each side.
almost immediately however salt ii met with fierce conservative opposition in the united states senate.
the agreement was never ratified.
the year of the hostages since the early 1950s the united states had provided political support and more recently massive military assistance to the government of the shah of iran hoping to make his nation a bulwark against soviet expansion in the middle east.
by 1979 however the shah was in deep trouble with his own people.
many iranians resented the repressive authoritarian tactics through which the shah had maintained his autocratic rule.
at the same time islamic clergy and much of the fiercely religious populace opposed his efforts to modernize and westernize iranian society.
the combination of resentments fueled a powerful revolutionary movement which forced the shah to flee the country in january 1979.
by late 1979 power in iran resided with a zealous religious leader the ayatollah ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ruhollah khomeini who was fiercely anti western and antiamerican.
in late october 1979 the deposed shah arrived in new york to be treated for cancer.
days later on november 4 an armed crowd stormed the american embassy in from the age of limits to the age of reagan 771 tehran seized the diplomats and military personnel inside and demanded the return of the shah to iran in exchange for their freedom.
fifty three americans remained hostages in the embassy for over a year.
only weeks after the hostage seizure on december 27 1979 soviet troops invaded afghanistan the mountainous islamic nation lying between the ussr and iran.
the soviet union had been a power in afghanistan for years and the dominant force since april 1978 a rebellion by radical islamic guerrilla groups threatened the new soviet invasion of afghanistan soviet backed government.
but while some observers claimed that the soviet invasion was a russian attempt to secure the status quo carter claimed it was a russian stepping stone to their possible control over much of the worlds oil supplies and the gravest threat to world peace since world war ii carter angrily imposed a series of economic sanctions on the russians canceled american participation in the 1980 summer olympic games in moscow and announced the withdrawal of salt ii from senate consideration.
the rise of the new conservative movement the jarring social and economic changes in american life in the 1960s and 1970s disillusioned many liberals caught the left off guard and without effective responses and provided the right with its most important opportunity in generations to recapture a dominant position of political authority in american life.
the sunbelt and its politics one of the most widely discussed demographic phenomena of the 1970s was the rise of what became known as the sunbelt the states of the southeast and the southwest.
by 1980 the population of the sunbelt had risen to exceed that of the older industrial regions of the north and the east.
it directly contributed to the explosive growth of the modern conservative movement.
the strong populist traditions in the south and the west helped produce opposition to the growth of government and resentment of the proliferating regulations and restrictions of the liberal state.
many of those regulations and restrictions environmental laws landuse restrictions and other laws affected the west more than any other region.
the so called sagebrush rebellion which emerged in parts of the west in the late 1970s mobilized conservative opposition to burgeoning environmental sagebrush rebellion laws and restrictions on development.
it also sought to portray the west as a victim of government control.
its members demanded that the very large amounts of land the federal government owned in western states be opened for development.
suburbanization also fueled the rise of the right.
not all suburbs bred conservative politics of course but the most militantly conservative communities in america among them orange county in southern california were mostly suburbs.
the seemingly tranquil life of the suburb contributed to a conservative view of the world.
religious revivalism in the 1960s traditional mainstream religion experienced a conspicuous decline.
but in its place began a powerful religious revival.
some of the new religious enthusiasm found expression in the rise of various popular movements and unorthodox faiths the church 772 chapter 31 washington montana north dakota oregon wyoming utah san diego 6 colorado arizona phoenix 9 new mexico me.

this map gives a dramatic illustration of the changing concentration of population between 1970 and 1990.
the orange states are those that lost population while the purple and blue states are those that made significant gains 30 percent or more.
what was the impact of this population shift on the politics of the 1980s.
of scientology the unification church of the reverend sun myung moon even the tragic peoples temple whose members committed mass suicide in their jungle retreat in guyana in 1978.
but the most important impulse of the religious revival was the growth of evangelical christianity.
evangelicals have in common a belief in personal conversion being born again surging evangelicalism through direct communication with jesus.
evangelical religion had been the dominant form of christianity in america through much of its history.
in its modern form it became increasingly visible during the early 1950s when evangelicals such as billy graham and pentecostals such as oral roberts began to attract huge national and international followings for their energetic revivalism.
by the late 1970s evangelical christians had become more visible and more politically assertive.
more than 70 million americans now described themselves as born again christians.
christian evangelicals owned newspapers magazines radio stations and television networks.
they operated their own schools and universities.
three modern presidents jimmy carter bill clinton and george w bush have identified themselves as evangelicals.
some evangelical christians supported racial and economic justice and world peace of the type espoused by civil rights leaders like rev.
martin luther king.
but many others had a different political focus.
alarmed by what they considered the spread of immorality and disorder in american life they were concerned about the way a secular culture was intruding into their communities schools and families.
many evangelical men and women for example feared that the growth of feminism posed a threat to the traditional family and from the age of limits to the age of reagan 773 they resented the way in which government policies advanced the goals of the womens movement.
particularly alarming to them were supreme court decisions eliminating all religious observance from schools and later the decision guaranteeing women the right to an abortion.
by the late 1970s the christian right had become a powerful political force.
jerry falwell a fundamentalist minister in virginia with a substantial television audience launched a highly visible movement he called the moral majority.
he founded liberty university in lynchburg virginia to train men and women according to conservative christian principles.
the pentecostal minister pat robertson began a political movement of his own and in the 1990s launched an organization known as the christian coalition christian coalition.
these and other organizations of the christian right opposed federal interference in local affairs denounced abortion divorce feminism and homosexuality defended unrestricted free enterprise and supported a strong american posture in the world.
some denied the scientific doctrine of evolution and instead urged the teaching in schools of the biblical story of the creation or beginning in the early twenty first century the idea of intelligent design their goal was a new era in which christian values once again dominated american life.
the role of religion in the growth of conservatism was not limited to evangelical christians.
in the 1970s the catholic church began to make a strong case for tradition as well.
the church fought most aggressively against abortion thus joining the evangelical right in one of the most controversial issues of the time.
not all catholics were or are conservatives many priests and parishioners took strong liberal positions.
but in the political world catholics became strong allies of the right joining evangelicals in fighting for many conservative issues.
mormons too began to emerge as an important element of the right.
for many years mormons did not publicize their conservatism.
but like catholics many mormons began to take openly conservative stances in the 1970s on some of the controversial battles of the time.
some of these mormons wealthy and successful businesspeople became conservative political politicians in various parts of the country.
in 2012 two wealthy mormons mitt romney and jon huntsman both former governors were candidates for the presidency.
the emergence of the new right religious issues were only a part although an important part of what became known as the new right a diverse but powerful movement that enjoyed rapid growth in the 1970s and early 1980s.
it had begun to take shape after the 1964 election in which barry goldwater had suffered his shattering defeat.
energetic organizers responded to that disaster by building a new and powerful set of right wing institutions to help conservatives campaign more effectively in the future.
beginning in the 1970s largely because of these organizational advances conservatives found themselves almost always better funded and organized than their opponents.
by the late 1970s there were right wing think tanks consulting firms lobbyists foundations and colleges and universities.
conservatives also succeeded in building mechanisms to raise money mobilize activists and project their ideas to a broad audience.
building from a list compiled by richard viguerie after the 1964 goldwater campaign the right built a direct mail operation that ultimately reached millions of conservative voters.
evangelicals such as pat robertson used cable television to reach the conservative faithful.
conservative radio hosts such as rush limbaugh created shows that attracted a vast national audience.
774 chapter 31 another factor in the revival of the right was the emergence in the late 1960s and early 1970s of ronald reagan.
once a moderately successful actor he had moved into politics in the early 1960s and in 1964 delivered a memorable television speech on behalf of goldwater.
after goldwaters defeat reagan worked quickly to seize the leadership of the conservative wing of the party.
in 1966 with the support of a group of wealthy conservatives he won the first of two terms as governor of california.
the presidency of gerald ford also played an important role in the rise of conservatism.
ford probably without realizing it touched on some of the rights rawest nerves.
he appointed as vice president nelson rockefeller the liberal republican governor of new york and an heir to one of americas great fortunes many conservatives had been demonizing rockefeller and his family for more than twenty years.
ford proposed an amnesty program for draft resisters embraced the hated nixon kissinger policies of dtente presided over the fall of vietnam and agreed to cede the panama canal to panama.
when reagan challenged ford in the 1976 republican primaries the president survived barely only by dumping nelson rockefeller from the ticket and replacing him with kansas senator robert dole a steadfast conservative.
he also agreed to a platform largely written by conservatives.
ronald reagan the tax revolt at least equally important to the success of the new right was a new and potent conservative issue the tax revolt.
it had its public beginnings in 1978 when howard jarvis a conservative activist in california launched the first successful major citizens tax revolt with proposition 13 proposition 13 a referendum question on the state ballot rolling back property tax rates.
because property taxes were the most important source of funding for schools proposition 13 began the slow deterioration of much of the great california education system.
similar antitax movements soon began in other states and eventually spread to national politics.
in proposition 13 and similar initiatives members of the right succeeded in separating the issue of taxes from the issue of what taxes supported.
instead of attacking popular programs such as social security they attacked taxes themselves and argued that much of the money government raised through taxes was wasted.
virtually no one liked to pay taxes and as the economy grew weaker and the relative burden of paying taxes grew heavier that resentment naturally rose.
the campaign of 1980 by the time of the crises in iran and afghanistan jimmy carter was in desperate political trouble his standing in popularity polls lower than that of any president in history.
senator edward kennedy younger brother of john and robert kennedy challenged him in the primaries.
and while carter managed to withstand the confrontation and win his partys nomination his campaign aroused little popular enthusiasm.
the stage was set for sweeping political change.
the republican party in the meantime rallied enthusiastically behind the man who four years earlier had nearly stolen the nomination from gerald ford.
ronald reagan was a sharp critic of the excesses of the federal government.
he linked his campaign to the spreading tax revolt by promising substantial tax cuts.
he also championed a restoration of american strength and pride in the world.
on election day 1980 the anniversary of the seizure of the hostages in iran reagan swept to victory winning 51 percent of the vote to 41 percent for jimmy carter and from the age of limits to the age of reagan 775 candidate party ronald reagan republican jimmy carter democratic john b anderson independent other candidates libertarian electoral vote popular vote 43 901 812 50 7 35 483 820 41 0 5 719 722 6 6 921 299 1 1 52 6 of electorate voting the election of 1980 although ronald reagan won only slightly more than half of the popular vote in the 1980 presidential election his electoral majority was overwhelming a reflection to a large degree of the deep unpopularity of president jimmy carter in 1980.
what had made carter so unpopular.
7 percent for john anderson a moderate republican congressman from illinois who had mounted an independent campaign.
the republican party won control of the senate for the first time since 1952 and although the democrats retained a modest majority in the house the lower chamber too seemed firmly in the hands of conservatives.
on the day of reagans inauguration the american hostages in iran were released after their 444 day ordeal.
the government of iran desperate for funds to support its floundering war against neighboring iraq had ordered the hostages freed in return for a release of billions in iranian assets that the carter administration had frozen in american banks.
americans welcomed the hostages home with demonstrations of joy and patriotism seldom seen since the end of world war ii.
but while the celebration in 1945 had marked a great american triumph the euphoria in 1981 marked something quite different a troubled nation grasping for reassurance.
ronald reagan set out to provide it.
the reagan revolution ronald reagan assumed the presidency in january 1981 promising a revolution in government more fundamental than any since the new deal of fifty years before.
see consider the source excerpts from reagans first inaugural address while his eight years in office produced a significant shift in public policy they brought nothing so co ns ider t he s o urc e ronald reagan on the role of government in this excerpt from his first inaugural a ddress on january 20 1981 ronald reagan laid out his central vision for the role of government in society.
questioning the ability of government to solve societys social and economic ills reagan argued that the key to the nations future lay in reducing the role of government in everyday life.
the economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
they will not go away in days weeks or months but they will go away.
they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now as weve had in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem.
from time to time weve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self rule that government by an elite group is superior to government for by and of the people.
well if no one among us is capable of governing himself then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else.
all of us together in and out of government must bear the burden.
the solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.
we hear much of special interest groups.
well our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.
it knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions and it crosses political party lines.
it is made up of men and women who raise our food patrol our streets man our mines and factories teach our children keep our homes and heal us when were sick professionals industrialists shopkeepers clerks cabbies and truck drivers.
776 they are in short we the people this breed called americans.
well this administrations objective will be a healthy vigorous growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination.
putting america back to work means putting all americans back to work.
ending inflation means freeing all americans from the terror of runaway living costs.
all must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.
with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world.
so as we begin let us take inventory.
we are a nation that has a government not the other way around.
and this makes us special among the nations of the earth.
our government has no power except that granted it by the people.
it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.
it is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people.
all of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states the states created the federal government.
now so there will be no misunderstanding its not my intention to do away with government.
it is rather to make it work work with us not over us to stand by our side not ride on our back.
government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it.
if we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much prospered as no other people on earth it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.
freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth.
the price for this freedom at times has been high but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.
it is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government.
it is time for us to realize that were too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams.
were not as some would have us believe doomed to an inevitable decline.
i do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do.
i do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.
so with all the creative energy at our command let us begin an era of national renewal.
let us renew our determination our courage and our strength.
and let us renew our faith and our hope.

what does reagan mean when he says in the opening lines of the second paragraph that government is the problem.
why did reagans call for a curb on the governments role in society and the economy strike such a popular chord in the 1980s.
according to reagan who has been treated unfairly under the previous administration.
whom are the disadvantaged.

fundamental as many of his supporters had hoped or his opponents had feared.
but reagan succeeded brilliantly in making his own engaging personality the central fact of american politics in the 1980s.
he also benefited from the power of the diverse coalition that had united behind him.
the reagan coalition the reagan coalition included a relatively small but highly influential group of wealthy americans firmly committed to unfettered capitalism.
they believed that the market offered the best solutions to most problems and they shared a deep hostility to most although not all government interference in markets.
central to this groups agenda in the 1980s was opposition to what it scorned as the redistributive economic politics of the government especially its highly progressive tax structure and hostility to the rise of what they believed were antibusiness government r egulations.
reagan courted these free market conservatives carefully and effectively and in the end free market conservatives it was their interests his administration most effectively served.
a second element of the reagan coalition consisted of a small but influential group of intellectuals commonly known as neoconservatives who gave to the neoconservatives right something it had not had in many years a firm base among opinion leaders people with access to the most influential public forums of ideas.
many of these people had once been liberals and before that socialists.
but during the turmoil of the 1960s they had become alarmed by what they considered a dangerous and destructive radicalism.
777 778 chapter 31 ronald and nancy reagan the president and the first lady greet guests at a white house social event.
nancy reagan was committed to making the white house and her husbands presidency seem more glamorous than those of most recent administrations.
but she also played an important if usually quiet policy role in the administration.
photo by dirck halstead time life pictures getty images neoconservatives were sympathetic to the complaints and demands of capitalists but their principal concern was to reassert legitimate authority and reaffirm western democratic anticommunist values and commitments.
they considered themselves soldiers in a battle to win back the culture from the crass radical ideas that had polluted it.
neoconservatives also strongly dissented from the new foreign policy orthodoxies of liberals and the left in the aftermath of the vietnam war.
they utterly rejected the idea that america should be a less interventionist nation that it should work to ease tensions with the soviet union and that it should tolerate radical regimes.
instead they argued for an escalation of the cold war as part of an effort to destabilize the soviet union.
they insisted that the vietnam war was an appropriate american commitment and that its abandonment was a terrible mistake.
they believed that the united states had a special role to play in the world and should be willing to use military intervention to secure its vision.
these ideas strongly influenced the foreign policy of the reagan administration.
the same ideas and some of the same people resurfaced in the early twenty first century to help shape the international policies of the george w bush administration.
these groups formed an uneasy alliance with the broad grassroots conservative movement but collectively formed the new right.
it shared a fundamental distrust of the eastern establishment a suspicion of its motives and goals and a sense that it exercised from the age of limits to the age of reagan 779 a dangerous secret power in american life.
these populist conservatives expressed the kinds of concerns that outsiders non elites have traditionally voiced in american society an opposition to centralized power and influence and a fear of living in a world where distant hostile forces are controlling society and threatening individual freedom and community autonomy.
it was a testament to ronald reagans political skills and personal charm that he was able to generate enthusiastic support from these populist conservatives while at the same time appealing to more elite conservative groups whose concerns were in many ways antithetical to those of the new right.
reagan in the white house even many people who disagreed with reagans policies found themselves drawn to his attractive and carefully honed public image.
he turned seventy years old a few weeks after taking office and was the oldest man ever to serve as president.
but through most of his presidency he appeared to be vigorous resilient even youthful.
when wounded in an assassination attempt in 1981 he joked with doctors on his way into surgery and appeared to bounce back from the ordeal with remarkable speed.
even when things went wrong as they often did the blame seldom seemed to attach to reagan himself inspiring some democrats to refer to him as the teflon president.
reagan was not much involved in the day to day affairs of running the government he surrounded himself with tough energetic administrators who insulated him from many of the pressures of the office and who apparently relied on him largely for general guidance not specific decisions.
at times the president revealed a startling ignorance about the nature of his own policies or the actions of his subordinates.
but reagan did make active use of his office to generate public support for his administrations programs.
supply side economics reagans 1980 campaign for the presidency had promised to restore the economy to health by a bold experiment that became known as supply side or to its critics trickle down economics.
eventually it was called reaganomics supply side economics reaganomics operated from the assumption that the woes of the american economy were in large part a result of excessive taxation which left inadequate capital available to investors to stimulate growth.
the solution therefore was to reduce taxes with particularly generous benefits to corporations and wealthy individuals in order to encourage new investments.
in its first months in office the new administration hastily assembled a legislative program based on the supply side idea.
it proposed 40 billion in budget reductions and managed to win congressional approval of almost all of them.
in addition the president proposed a bold three year 30 percent reduction on both individual and corporate tax cuts tax rates.
in the summer of 1981 congress passed it too after lowering the reductions to 25 percent.
reagan suceeded thanks to a disciplined republican majority in the senate and a democratic majority in the house that was weak and riddled with defectors.
reagan appointees in the executive branch of government aimed to reduce the role of government in american economic life.
deregulation an idea many democrats had begun to embrace in the carter years became almost a religion in the reagan administration.
secretary of the interior james watt a major figure in the antienvironmental sagebrush rebellion opened up public lands and water to development and led a charge to reverse older 780 chapter 31 conservationist policies.
the environmental protection agency before some of its directors were indicted for corruption relaxed or entirely eliminated enforcement of major environmental laws and regulations.
by early 1982 the nation had sunk into a severe recession.
the reagan economic program was not directly to blame for the problems but neither did it offer a quick solution.
during 1982 unemployment reached 11 percent one of the highest levels since the 1930s.
but before the recession could do great damage to reagan the economy recovered more rapidly and impressively than almost anyone had expected.
by late 1983 unemployment had fallen to 8 2 percent and it declined steadily for several years after that.
the gross national product gnp grew 3 6 percent in a year the largest increase since the mid 1970s.
inflation fell below 5 percent.
the economy continued to grow and both inflation and unemployment remained low through most of the decade.
the recovery was a result of many things.
prior years of tight money policies by the federal reserve board had helped lower inflation perhaps equally important the fed had lowered interest rates early in 1983 in response to the recession.
a worldwide energy glut and the virtual collapse of the opec cartel had produced at least a temporary end to the inflationary pressures of spiraling fuel costs.
and staggering federal budget deficits were pumping billions of dollars into the flagging economy.
as a result consumer spending and business investment both increased.
the stock market rose up from its doldrums of the 1970s and began a sustained and historic boom.
in august 1982 the dow jones industrial average stood at 777.
five years later it had passed 2 000.
despite a frightening crash in the fall of 1987 the market continued to grow for more than another decade.
the dow jones average passed 18 000 in 2015.
the fiscal crisis the economic revival did little at first to reduce the staggering and to many americans alarming federal budget deficits the gap between revenue and spending in a single year or to slow the growth in the national debt the debt the nation accumulates over time as a result of its annual deficits.
by the mid 1980s this growing fiscal crisis had become one of the central issues in american politics.
having entered office promising a balanced record budget deficits budget within four years reagan presided over record budget deficits and accumulated more debt in his eight years in office than the american government had accumulated in its entire previous history.
before the 1980s the highest single year budget deficit in american history had been 66 billion in 1976.
throughout the 1980s the annual budget deficit consistently exceeded 100 billion and in 1991 peaked at 268 billion.
the national debt rose from 907 billion in 1980 to nearly 3 5 trillion by 1991.
much larger deficits and debt were soon to come.
the enormous deficits had many causes.
the budget suffered from enormous increases in the costs of entitlement programs especially both social security and medicare a result of the aging of the population and dramatic increases in the cost of health care.
the 1981 tax cuts the largest in american history also contributed to the deficit.
the massive increase in military spending on which the reagan administration insisted added much more to the federal budget than its cuts in domestic spending removed.
in the face of these deficits the administration proposed further cuts in discretionary domestic spending which included many programs aimed at the poorest and politically weakest americans.
by the end of reagans third year in office funding for domestic programs had been cut nearly as far as congress and apparently the public was willing to tolerate from the age of limits to the age of reagan 781 and still no end to the rising deficit was in sight.
by the late 1980s many fiscal conservatives were calling for a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget a provision the president himself claimed to support.
but congress never approved the amendment.
reagan and the world relations with the soviet union which had been steadily deteriorating in the last years of the carter administration grew still chillier in the first years of the reagan presidency.
the president spoke harshly of the soviet regime which he once called the evil empire accusing it of sponsoring world terrorism and declaring that any armaments negotiations must be linked to negotiations on soviet behavior in other areas.
although the president had long denounced the salt ii arms control treaty as unfavorable to the united states he continued to honor its provisions.
but the president proposed the most ambitious and potentially most expensive new military program in many years the strategic defense initiative sdi strategic defense initiative widely known as star wars after the popular movie of that name.
reagan claimed that sdi through the use of lasers and satellites could provide an effective shield against incoming missiles and thus make nuclear war obsolete.
the soviet union claimed that the new program would elevate the arms race to new and more dangerous levels and insisted that any arms control agreement should begin with an american abandonment of sdi.
the escalation of cold war tensions and the slowing of arms control initiatives helped produce an important popular movement in europe and the united states calling for a nuclear freeze an agreement between the two superpowers not to expand their atomic arsenals.
in what many believed was the largest mass demonstration in american history nearly a million people rallied in new york citys central park in 1982 to support the freeze.
perhaps partly in response to this growing pressure the administration began tentative efforts to revive arms control negotiations in 1983.
the administration created a new policy known as the reagan doctrine designed to help resist communism and anti americanism in the third world.
reagan doctrine the united states sent soldiers and money to aid guerrillas and resistance movements in countries with anti american governments among them grenada el salvador and nicaragua.
but reagan generally backed away from more serious warfare.
in 1982 when the israeli army invaded lebanon american peacekeeping forces entered beirut to stabilize the nation.
but when a terrorist bombing of a u s military barracks in beirut led to the death of 241 marines reagan quickly withdrew the american forces.
there were other terrorist events against america and other nations by attacking bombs ships and diplomatic buildings the beginning of what would become a long battle against terrorism.
reagan approached the campaign of 1984 at the head of a united republican party firmly committed to his candidacy.
the democrats nominated former vice president walter mondale.
mondale brought momentary excitement to the democratic campaign by selecting a woman representative geraldine ferraro of new york to be his running mate and the first female candidate ever to appear on a national ticket.
but reagans triumphant campaign scarcely took note of his opponents and spoke instead of what he claimed was the remarkable revival of american fortunes and spirits under his leadership reagan reelected or what he sometimes called morning in america he won 59 percent of the vote and carried every state but mondales native minnesota and the district of columbia.
782 chapter 31 america and the waning of the cold war many factors contributed to the collapse of the soviet empire.
the long stalemated war in afghanistan proved at least as disastrous to the soviet union as the vietnam war had been to america.
the government in moscow failed to address a long term economic decline in the soviet republics and the eastern bloc nations.
restiveness with the heavyhanded policies of communist police states was growing throughout much of the soviet mikhail gorbachev empire.
but the most visible factor at the time was the emergence of mikhail gorbachev who succeeded to the leadership of the soviet union in 1985 and to the surprise of almost everyone probably including himself very quickly became the most revolutionary figure in world politics in decades.
the fall of the soviet union gorbachev transformed soviet politics with two dramatic new initiatives glasnost openness the dismantling of many of the repressive mechanisms that had been conspicuous glasnost and perestroika features of soviet life for over half a century and perestroika reform an effort to restructure the rigid and unproductive soviet economy by introducing among other things such elements of capitalism as private ownership and the profit motive.
he also began to transform soviet foreign policy.
the severe economic problems at home evidently convinced gorbachev that the soviet union could no longer sustain its extended commitments around the world.
as early as the fall of the berlin wall the berlin wall is widely considered to have fallen on november 9 1989.
starting on that date and in the days and weeks that followed people used sledgehammers and picks to tear down the wall often keeping the broken pieces as souvenirs of this symbolic conclusion of the cold war.
diz mnchen gmbh alamy from the age of limits to the age of reagan 783 1987 he began reducing the soviet presence in eastern europe.
and in 1989 in the space of a few months every communist state in europe poland hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria romania east germany yugoslavia and albania either overthrew its government or forced it to transform itself into an essentially noncommunist and in some cases actively anticommunist regime.
perhaps the most dramatic event of this extraordinary revolution was the tearing down of the infamous berlin wall.
not all international protests against communism were so successful.
in may 1989 students in china launched a mass movement calling for greater democratization.
but in june hard line leaders seized control of the government and sent military forces to crush the uprising.
the result was a bloody massacre on june 3 1989 in tiananmen square in beijing in which an unknown number of demonstrators died.
the assault tiananmen square crushed the democracy movement and restored hard liners to power.
it did not however stop chinas efforts to modernize and even westernize its economy.
but china was an exception to the widespread movement toward democratization.
early in 1990 the government of south africa long an international pariah for its rigid enforcement of apartheid a system designed to protect white supremacy much like the jim crow system had done in the american south legalized the chief black party in the nation the african national congress anc which had been banned for decades.
the government also released from prison the leader of the anc nelson mandela who had been in jail for twenty seven years.
over the next several years the south african government repealed its apartheid laws.
and in 1994 there were national elections in which all south africans could participate.
as a result nelson mandela became the first black president of south africa.
in 1991 communism began to collapse in the soviet union itself.
an unsuccessful coup by hard line soviet leaders on august 19 precipitated a dramatic unraveling of communist power.
within days the coup itself collapsed in the face of resistance from the collapse of the ussr public and crucial elements within the military.
by the end of august many of the republics of the soviet union had declared independence the soviet government was clearly powerless to stop the fragmentation.
gorbachev himself finally resigned as leader of the now virtually powerless communist party and soviet government and the soviet union ceased to exist.
the last years of the reagan administration coincided with the first years of the gorbachev regime and while reagan was skeptical of gorbachev at first he gradually became convinced that the soviet leader was sincere in his desire for reform.
in 1988 the two superpowers signed a treaty eliminating american and soviet intermediate range nuclear forces inf from europe the most significant arms control agreement of the nuclear age.
at about the same time gorbachev ended the soviet unions long and frustrating military involvement in afghanistan.
the fading of the reagan revolution for a time the dramatic changes around the world and reagans personal popularity deflected attention from a series of scandals that might well have destroyed another administration including revelations of illegal and ethical lapses in the environmental protection agency the cia the department of defense the department of labor the department of justice and the department of housing and urban development.
a more serious scandal emerged within the savings and loan industry which the reagan administration had helped deregulate in the early 1980s.
by the end of the decade the industry was in chaos and the government was forced to step in to prevent a complete collapse.
the cost of the debacle to the public eventually ran to more than half a trillion dollars.
784 chapter 31 but the most politically damaging scandal of the reagan years came to light in november 1986 when the white house conceded that it had sold weapons to the revolutionary government of iran as part of a largely unsuccessful effort to secure the release of several americans being held hostage.
even more damaging was the revelation that some of the money from the arms deal with iran had been covertly and illegally funneled into a fund to aid the contras a loose group of commandos who fought against the anti american government after the 1979 revolution in nicaragua.
in the months that followed aggressive reporting and a series of congressional hearings exposed a widespread pattern of covert activities orchestrated by the white house and dedicated to advancing the administrations foreign policy aims through secret and at times illegal means.
the iran contra scandal as it became known did serious damage to the reagan presidency even though the investigations never tied the president himself to the most serious violations of the law.
iran contra scandal the presidency of george h w bush the fraying of the reagan administration helped the democrats regain control of the united states senate in 1986 and fueled hopes in the party for a presidential victory in 1988.
michael dukakis a three term governor of massachusetts eventually captured the nomination.
vice president george h w bush was the largely unopposed republican candidate.
neither candidate succeeded in creating public enthusiasm.
24 12 23 6 12 candidate party george h w bush republican michael dukakis democratic electoral vote popular vote 47 946 422 54 0 41 016 429 46 0 50 of electorate voting the election of 1988 democrats had high hopes going into the election of 1988 but vice president george h w bush won a decisive victory over michael dukakis who did only slightly better than walter mondale had done four years earlier.
what made it so difficult for a democrat to challenge the republicans in 1988 after eight years of a republican administration.
from the age of limits to the age of reagan 785 beginning at the republican national convention bush made his campaign a long relentless attack on dukakis tying him to all the unpopular social and cultural stances americans had come to identify with liberals bush won a substantial victory in november 54 percent of the popular vote to dukakiss 46 percent and 426 electoral votes to dukakiss 112.
but bush carried few republicans into office with him the democrats retained secure majorities in both houses of congress.
the broad popularity bush enjoyed during much of his first three years in office was partly a result of his subdued unthreatening public image.
but it was primarily due to the wonder and excitement with which americans viewed the dramatic events in the rest of the world.
bush moved cautiously at first in dealing with the changes in the soviet union.
but like reagan he eventually cooperated with gorbachev and reached a series of significant arms control agreements with the soviet union in its waning years.
on domestic issues the bush administration was less successful.
his administration inherited a staggering burden of debt and a federal deficit that had been growing dramatically for nearly a decade.
constantly concerned about the right wing of his own party bush aggressively opposed current laws governing abortion and affirmative action that damaged his ability to work with the democratic congress.
despite this political stalemate congress and the white house managed on occasion to agree on significant measures.
in 1990 the president agreed to a significant tax increase as part of a multiyear budget package designed to reduce the deficit thus violating his own 1988 campaign pledge of no new taxes but the most serious domestic problem facing the bush administration was one for which neither the president nor congress had any answer a recession that began late in 1990 and became more serious in 1991 and 1992.
the gulf war the fall of the soviet union left the united states in the unanticipated position of being the only real superpower in the world.
it forced the bush administration to consider what to do with americas formidable political and military power.
the events of 1989 1991 suggested two possible answers.
one was that the united states would reduce its military strength dramatically and concentrate its energies and resources on pressing domestic problems.
the other was that america would continue to use its power actively not to fight communism but to defend its regional and economic interests.
the answer came quickly.
in 1989 the administration ordered an invasion of panama which overthrew the unpopular military leader manuel noriega under indictment in the united states for drug trafficking and replaced him with an elected pro american regime.
and in 1990 that same impulse drew the united states into the turbulent politics of the middle east.
on august 2 1990 the armed forces of iraq invaded and quickly overwhelmed the emirate of kuwait the small oil rich neighbor of iraq.
saddam hussein saddam hussein the militaristic leader of iraq soon announced that he was annexing kuwait.
the bush administration soon agreed to lead other nations in a campaign to force iraq out of kuwait through the pressure of economic sanctions if possible through military force if necessary.
within a few weeks bush had persuaded virtually every important government in the world including the soviet union and almost all the arab and islamic states to join in a united nations sanctioned trade embargo of iraq.
786 chapter 31 at the same time the united states and its allies including the british french egyptians and saudis began deploying a large military force along the border between kuwait and saudi arabia a force that ultimately reached 690 000 troops 425 000 of them american.
and on january 16 american and allied air forces began a massive bombardment of iraqi troops in kuwait and of military and industrial installations in iraq itself.
the allied bombing continued for six weeks.
on february 23 allied primarily american forces under the command of general norman schwarzkopf began a major ground offensive to the north of the iraqi forces.
the allied armies encountered almost no resistance and suffered only light casualties 141 fatalities.
estimates of iraqi deaths in the war were 100 000 or more.
on february 28 iraq announced its acceptance of allied terms for a cease fire and the brief persian gulf war was over.
the election of 1992 president bushs popularity reached a record high in the immediate aftermath of the gulf war.
but the glow of that victory faded quickly as the recession worsened in late 1991.
that gave bill clinton the young five term democratic governor of arkansas an opportunity to emerge as the early front runner.
clinton survived a bruising primary campaign and a series of damaging personal controversies to win his partys nomination.
candidate party electoral vote popular vote 44 909 889 43 0 39 104 545 37 5 19 742 267 18 9 bill clinton democratic george bush republican ross perot independent other candidates 669 958 0 6 55 2 of electorate voting the election of 1992 in the 1992 election for the first time since 1976 a democrat captured the white house.
and although the third party candidacy of ross perot deprived bill clinton of an absolute majority he nevertheless defeated george bush by a decisive margin in both the popular and electoral votes.
what factors had eroded president bushs once broad popularity by 1992.
what explained the strong showing of ross perot.
from the age of limits to the age of reagan 787 complicating the campaign was the emergence of ross perot a blunt forthright texas billionaire who became an independent candidate by tapping popular resentment of the federal bureaucracy and by promising tough uncompromising leadership to deal with the fiscal crisis.
at several moments in the spring perot led both bush and clinton in public opinion polls.
but in july as he began to face hostile scrutiny from the media he abruptly withdrew from the race.
early in october he reentered and soon regained much although never all of his early support.
after a campaign in which the economy was the principal issue clinton won a clear but hardly overwhelming victory over bush and perot.
he received 43 percent clinton elected of the vote in the three way race to the presidents 38 percent and perots 19 percent the best showing for a third party or independent candidate since theodore roosevelt in 1912.
clinton won 370 electoral votes to bushs 168 perot won none.
democrats also retained control of both houses of congress.
conclusion america in the late 1970s was by the standards of its own recent history an unusually troubled nation numbed by the watergate scandals the fall of vietnam and perhaps most of all the nations increasing economic difficulties.
the unhappy presidencies of gerald ford and jimmy carter provided little relief from these accumulating problems and anxieties.
indeed in the last year of the carter presidency the nations future seemed particularly bleak in light of severe economic problems a traumatic seizure of american hostages in iran and a soviet invasion of afghanistan.
in the midst of these problems american conservatives slowly and steadily prepared for a political revolution.
a coalition of disparate but impassioned groups on the right including a large movement known as the new right with vaguely populist impulses gained strength from the nations troubles and from their own success in winning support for a broad ranging revolt against taxes.
their efforts culminated in the election of 1980 when ronald reagan became the most conservative man in at least sixty years to be elected president of the united states.
reagans first term was a dramatic contrast to the troubled presidencies that had preceded it and signaled a reversal or at least a modification of ruling economic and social policies.
he won substantial victories in congress cutting taxes reducing spending on domestic programs building up the military.
perhaps equally important he made his own engaging personality one of the central political forces in national life.
easily reelected in 1984 he seemed to have solidified the conservative grip on national political life.
in his second term however a series of scandals and misadventures and the presidents own declining energy limited the administrations effectiveness.
nevertheless reagans personal popularity remained high and the economy continued to prosper factors that propelled his vice president george h w bush to succeed him in 1989.
bushs presidency was not as successful as reagans had been and the perception of his disengagement with the nations growing economic problems contributed to bushs defeat in 1992.
but a colossal historic event overshadowed most domestic concerns during bushs term in office the collapse of the soviet union and the fall of communist regimes all over europe.
the united states was to some degree a dazzled observer of this process.
but the end of the cold war also propelled the united states into the possession of unchallenged 788 chapter 31 global preeminence and drew it increasingly into the role of international arbiter and peacemaker.
the gulf war of 1991 was the most dramatic example of the new global role the united states would now increasingly assume as the worlds only true superpower.

on an early tuesday morning in 2001 a commercial airliner crashed into the side of one of two tallest buildings in new york the north tower of the world trade center.
within thirty minutes another commercial airliner struck the south tower.
before the steel girders in both towers buckled and collapsed from the tremendous heat of the burning wreckage americans learned of even more disasters.
a plane flew into the pentagon in washington d c and another crashed a few hundred miles away in a field not far from pittsburgh after passengers apparently seized the cockpit and prevented the hijackers from reaching their unknown target.
in these four almost simultaneous catastrophes nearly 3 000 people died.
the events of september 11 and their aftermath sparked significant changes in american life.
and yet there was at least one great continuity between the world of the 1990s and the world that seemed to begin on september 11 2001.
the united states in the last years of the twentieth century and the first years of the twenty first more than at any other time in its history was becoming more and more deeply entwined in a new age of globalism an age that combined great promise with great peril.

beginning with clinton and continuing through the administration of president barack obama democrats and republicans regularly chose ideological purity over political compromise effectively gumming up the machinery of the federal government and nearly bringing it to the brink of shutting down on more than one occasion.
at times the political divides occurred within a party conservative republicans refusing the hand of negotiation to their more liberal brethren on matters of higher taxes raising the national debt ceiling or supporting national health insurance.
like few periods in american history the turn of the twentyfirst century showcased bitter splits between the parties that fundamentally affected how the white house and congress functioned.
launching the clinton presidency bill clinton entered office as the first democratic president since jimmy carter and the first self proclaimed activist president meaning a president seeking to expand the active role of the federal government in solving social problems since lyndon johnson.
indeed his domestic agenda was more ambitious than that of any president since the 1960s.
but clinton also had significant political weaknesses.
having won the vote of well under half the electorate he had no powerful mandate for change.
the new administration began with a series of missteps and misfortunes in its first months.
the presidents effort to end the longtime ban on gay men and lesbians serving in the military met with ferocious resistance and he was forced to settle for a the age of globalization 791 compromise known as dont ask dont tell which forbade recruiters to ask recruits about their sexual preferences but also forbade servicemen and servicewomen to reveal them.
several of his early appointments became so controversial he had to withdraw them.
then vince foster a longtime friend of the president who served as a deputy white house counsel and previous legal partner of first lady hillary rodham clinton committed suicide in the summer of 1993.
his death sparked an escalating inquiry into some banking and real estate ventures involving the clintons in the early 1980s which became known as the whitewater affair.
an independent counsel began examining these issues in 1993.
the clintons were ultimately cleared of wrongdoing in whitewater in 2000.
despite its many problems the clinton administration had some important achievements in its first year.
the president narrowly won approval of a budget that marked a significant turn away from some of the policies of the reagan bush years especially the focus on reducing personal and corporate taxes.
it included a substantial tax increase on the wealthiest americans a sizable reduction in many areas of government spending and a major expansion of tax credits to low income working people.
clinton was a committed advocate of free trade.
after a long and difficult battle against among others ross perot the afl cio and many democrats in congress he secured passage of the north american free trade agreement nafta which eliminated free trade agreements most trade barriers among the united states canada and mexico.
later he won approval to sign a global accord that created the world trade organization wto an international organization charged with negotiating agreements and settling disputes among its members.
the presidents most notable and ambitious initiative was a major reform of the nations health care system.
early in 1993 he appointed a task force chaired by the first lady.
the presidential task force proposed a sweeping reform designed to guarantee coverage to every american and hold down the costs of medical care.
but there was substantial opposition from those who believed the reform would transfer too much power to the government.
well funded opposition doomed the plan.
the foreign policy of the clinton administration was at first cautious and tentative.
yugoslavia a nation created after world war i out of a group of small balkan countries dissolved again into several different countries in the wake of the 1989 collapse of its communist government.
bosnia was among the new nations and it quickly became embroiled in a bloody civil war between its two major ethnic groups one muslim the other serbian and christian backed by the neighboring serbian republic.
all efforts by the other european nations and the united states to negotiate an end to the struggle failed until 1995 when the american negotiator richard holbrooke finally brought the warring parties together and crafted an agreement to partition bosnia.
the republican resurgence the trials of the clinton administration and the failure of health care reform in particular proved damaging to the democratic party as it faced the congressional elections of 1994.
for the first time in over forty years republicans gained control of both houses of congress.
throughout 1995 the republican congress under the aggressive leadership of house speaker newt gingrich worked at a sometimes feverish pace to construct newt gingrich what they called a contract with america an ambitious and even radical legislative program.
the republicans proposed a series of measures to transfer important powers from the federal government to the states pushed for dramatic reductions in federal spending including a major restructuring of the medicare program to reduce costs and attempted to scale back a wide range of federal regulatory functions.
740 chapter 30 in the summer of 1969 more than 400 000 people gathered for a music festival on a farm near woodstock new york.
the gathering became a symbol of the youth movement of the sixties.
shelly rustin black star woodstock to themes of anger frustration and rebellion.
many popular musicians used their music to express explicit political radicalism as well especially some of the leading folk singers of the era such as bob dylan and joan baez.
rocks driving rhythms its undisguised sensuality its often harsh and angry tone all made it an appropriate vehicle for expressing the themes of the social and political unrest of the late 1960s.
a powerful symbol of the fusion of rock music and the counterculture was the massive woodstock music festival at woodstock new york in the summer of 1969 where 400 000 people gathered on a farm for nearly a week.
despite heavy rain mud inadequate facilities and impossible crowding the attendees remained peaceful and harmonious.
champions of the counterculture spoke rhapsodically at the time of how woodstock represented the birth of a new youth culture the woodstock nation four months later however another large rock concert at the altamont racetrack near san francisco featuring the rolling stones and attended by 300 000 people exposed a darker side of the youth culture.
altamont became a brutal and violent event at which four people died several accidentally or from drug overdoses but one because of injuries inflicted by members of a hells angels motorcycle gang who were serving as security guards at the concert and who brutally beat and stabbed a number of people.
the mobilization of minorities the growth of african american protest encouraged other minorities to assert themselves and demand redress of their grievances.
for indians hispanic americans gay men and lesbians and others the late 1960s and 1970s were a time of growing self expression and political activism.
the crisis of authority 741 seeds of indian militancy few minorities had deeper or more justifiable grievances against the prevailing culture than did american indians or native americans as they began defiantly to call themselves in the 1960s.
indians were the least prosperous least healthy and least stable ethnic group in the nation.
and while african americans attracted the attention for good or for ill of many whites indians for years had remained largely ignored.
for much of the postwar era federal tribal policies tried to incorporate indians into mainstream american society whether indians wanted to assimilate or not.
two laws passed in 1953 established the basis of this policy which became known termination policy as termination through termination the federal government withdrew all official recognition of the tribes as legal entities they were no longer administratively separate from state governments and were subject to the same local jurisdictions as non native american residents.
at the same time the government encouraged indians to assimilate into the white world and worked to funnel native americans into cities where presumably they would adapt themselves to the larger society and lose their cultural distinctiveness.
despite some individual successes the new policies were a disastrous failure on the whole.
indians themselves fought so bitterly against these policies that in 1958 the eisenhower administration barred further terminations.
in the meantime the struggle against termination mobilized a new generation of indian militants and breathed life into the principal native american organization the national congress of american indians which had been created in 1944.
the democratic administrations of the 1960s made no effort to revive termination.
instead they made modest efforts to restore at least some degree of tribal autonomy such as funneling office of economic opportunity money to tribal organizations through the community action programs.
in the meantime the tribes themselves began to fight for greater self determination.
the new militancy benefited from the rapid increase in the indian population which was growing much faster than that of the rest of the nation nearly doubling between 1950 and 1970 to a total of about 800 000.
the indian civil rights movement in 1961 more than 400 members from 67 tribes gathered in chicago and issued the declaration of indian purpose which stressed the right to choose our own way of life and the responsibility of preserving our precious heritage another example of a growing indian self consciousness the national indian youth council created in the aftermath of the 1961 chicago meeting promoted the idea of indian nationalism and intertribal unity.
in 1968 a group of young militant indians established the american indian movement aim which drew support from urban areas american indian movement and reservations alike.
the new activism produced results.
in 1968 congress passed the indian civil rights act.
it guaranteed reservation indians protections by the bill of rights indian civil rights act but also recognized the legitimacy of tribal laws within the reservations.
in 1968 indian fishermen citing old treaty rights clashed with washington state officials on the columbia river and in puget sound.
the following year members of several tribes occupied the abandoned federal prison on alcatraz island in san francisco bay claiming the site by right of discovery in response the nixon administration appointed louis bruce a mohawk sioux as commissioner of indian affairs in 1969 and in 1970 the president promised both 742 chapter 30 the occupation of alcatraz alcatraz an island in san francisco bay once housed a large federal prison that by the late 1960s had been abandoned.
in 1969 a group of indian activists occupied the island and claimed it as indian land precipitating a long standoff with authorities.
ap images increased tribal self determination and an increase in federal aid.
but the protests continued.
in november 1972 nearly a thousand demonstrators most of them lakota sioux forcibly occupied the building of the bureau of indian affairs in washington d c for six days.
in february 1973 members of aim seized the town of wounded knee south dakota the site of the 1890 massacre of sioux by federal troops.
for two months they occupied the town demanding that the government honor its long forgotten treaty obligations.
the indian civil rights movement like other civil rights movements of the same time fell far short of winning full equality for native americans.
but it helped the tribes win a series of new legal rights and protections that together gave them a stronger position than they had enjoyed at any previous time in the twentieth century.
latino activism the fastest growing minority group in the united states in the 1970s was latinos or hispanic americans.
large numbers of mexicans had entered the country during world war ii in response to the wartime labor shortage and many had remained in the cities of the southwest and the pacific coast.
by 1960 los angeles had a bigger mexican population than any place except mexico city.
but the greatest expansion in the latino population of the united states was yet to growing latino population come.
in 1960 the census reported slightly more than 3 million latinos living in the united states.
by 1970 that number had grown to 9 million and by 2000 to 35 million.
by 2010 the number passed 50 million.
hispanics constituted more than a third of all legal immigrants to the united states after 1960.
the crisis of authority 743 large numbers of puerto ricans who were entitled to american citizenship by birth migrated to eastern urban areas particularly new york city where they formed one of the poorest communities in the city.
south floridas substantial cuban population began with a wave of middle class refugees fleeing the castro regime in the early 1960s.
these first cuban migrants quickly established themselves as a successful and highly assimilated part of miamis middle class.
in 1980 a second much poorer wave of cuban immigrants the so called marielitos named for the port from which they left cuba arrived in florida when castro temporarily relaxed exit restrictions.
later in the 1980s large numbers of immigrants both legal and illegal began to arrive from central and south america from guatemala nicaragua el salvador peru and other countries.
like african americans and indians many latinos responded to the highly charged climate of the 1960s by strengthening their ethnic identification and by organizing for political and economic power.
affluent hispanics in miami filled influential positions in the professions and local government in the southwest latino voters elected mexican americans to seats in congress and to governorships.
a mexican american political organization la raza unida exercised influence in southern california and elsewhere in the southwest in the 1970s and beyond.
one of the most visible efforts to organize hispanics occurred in california where an arizona born farmworker of mexican descent csar chvez created an effective csar chvez union of largely mexican itinerant farmworkers the united farm workers ufw.
for most latinos however the path to economic and political power was more difficult.
mexican americans and others were slow to develop political influence in proportion to their numbers.
in the meantime latinos formed one of the poorest segments of the united states population.
kennedy and chvez csar chvez leader of the united farm workers endured a hunger strike in 1968 in the spirit of nonviolent protest against the treatment of field workers.
robert f kennedy just beginning his campaign for the presidency visited the union leader to show his support.
at this point chvez had been fasting for several weeks.
photo by michael rougier time life pictures getty images 744 chapter 30 gay liberation another important liberation movement to emerge in the 1960s was the effort by gay men and lesbians to win political and economic rights and social acceptance.
homosexuality has been a generally unacknowledged reality throughout western civilization.
nonheterosexual men and women were forced for generations to suppress their sexual preferences to exercise them surreptitiously or to live within isolated and often persecuted communities.
but by the late 1960s the liberating impulses that had affected other groups helped mobilize gay men and lesbians to fight for their own rights.
on june 27 1969 police officers raided the stonewall inn a gay nightclub in new york citys greenwich village and began arresting patrons simply for frequenting the place.
the raid was not unusual but the response was.
gay onlookers taunted the police and then attacked them.
someone started a blaze in the stonewall inn itself almost trapping the police inside.
rioting continued throughout greenwich village the center of new yorks gay community through much of the night.
the stonewall riot marked the growth of the gay liberation movement one of the stonewall riot most controversial challenges to traditional values and assumptions of its time.
new organizations among them the gay liberation front founded in new york in 1969 sprang up around the country.
public discussion and media coverage of homosexuality long subject to an unofficial taboo quickly and dramatically increased.
gay activists had some success in challenging the long standing assumption that homosexuality was aberrant behavior many argued that no sexual preference was any more normal than another.
one victory came when the american psychiatric association stopped categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness in 1974.
most of all however the gay liberation movement transformed the outlook of many gay men and lesbians themselves.
it helped them come out express their preferences openly and unapologetically and demand from society a recognition that gay relationships could be as significant and worthy of respect as heterosexual ones.
by the early 1980s the gay liberation movement had made remarkable strides.
even the ravages of the aids epidemic which in the beginning at least affected the gay community more disastrously than any other group failed to halt the growth of gay liberation.
indeed it not only strengthened the gay community but it also helped americans understand and humanize those suffering which in turn slowly led to increased acceptance.
by the early twenty first century gay men and lesbians had achieved many of the same milestones that other oppressed minorities had attained in earlier decades.
openly gay politicians won election to public office.
universities established gay and lesbian studies programs.
laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual preference made slow halting progress at the state and local levels.
but gay liberation produced a powerful backlash against gay liberation backlash as well.
president bill clintons 1993 effort to end the ban on gay men and lesbians serving in the military met a storm of criticism from members of congress and within the military itself.
clinton retreated to a dont ask dont tell policy and even signed the defense of marriage act doma in 1996 that allowed states to refuse to recognize same sex marriages granted under the laws of other states.
conservative voters in some cities and states approved referendum questions on their ballots outlawing civil rights protections for gay men and lesbians and during a bitter debate over gay rights in the 2004 presidential campaign voted state bans on gay marriage.
antigay violence continued periodically in communities around the country.
the crisis of authority 745 at the same time however support for gay rights grew stronger in many parts of the country.
in 2010 president obama and the congress repealed the dont ask dont tell policy that forced people in the military to hide their homosexuality.
and in june 2015 the supreme court affirmed the right of same sex couples to wed in all 50 states.
the new feminism women constitute over 50 percent of the united states population.
but during the 1960s and 1970s many women began to identify with minority groups as they renewed demands for a liberation of their own.
the rebirth the 1963 publication of betty friedans the feminine mystique is often cited as one of the first events of contemporary womens liberation.
a writer for womens betty friedan magazines in the 1950s friedan traveled around the country interviewing women who had graduated with her from smith college in 1947.
most of these women were living out the dream that postwar american society had promised them they were affluent wives and mothers living in comfortable suburbs.
and yet many of them were deeply frustrated and unhappy with no outlets for their intelligence talent and education.
friedans book did not so much cause the revival of feminism as help give voice to a movement that was already stirring.
by the time the feminine mystique appeared president kennedy had already established the presidents commission on the status of women which brought national earnings in 2009 dollars rounded to nearest 100 60 000 50 000 men 47 100 women 36 300 40 000 30 000 20 000 34 000 20 600 10 000 0 note people 15 years old and older beginning in 1980 and people 14 years old and older as of the following year for previous years.
before 1989 data are for civilian workers only.
u s census bureau data comparing the median earnings of full time year round workers show changes in the gender wage gap over time.
if the equal pay act barred employers from paying women less than men for the same work what factors might account for the differences in median earnings of men and women.
u s census bureau current population survey 1961 to 2009 annual social and economic supplements median earnings by gender 1960 2009 746 chapter 30 attention to sexual discrimination.
also in 1963 the kennedy administration helped win passage of the equal pay act which barred the pervasive practice of paying women less than men for the same work in some fields.
a year later congress incorporated into the civil rights act of 1964 an amendment title vii that extended to women many of the same legal protections against discrimination that were being extended to african americans and other minorities.
in 1966 friedan joined with other feminists to create the national organization for now women now which was to become the nations largest and most influential feminist organization.
now responded to the complaints of women by demanding greater educational opportunities for women and denouncing the domestic ideal and the traditional concept of marriage.
but the heart of the movement was an effort to address the needs of women in the workplace.
womens liberation by the late 1960s new and more radical feminist demands were also attracting a large following especially among younger white educated women.
many of them drew inspiration from the new left and the counterculture.
some were involved in the civil rights movement others in the antiwar crusade.
many had found that even within those movements they faced discrimination and exclusion and were subordinated to male leaders.
in its most radical form the new feminism rejected the whole notion of marriage family and even heterosexual relationships a vehicle some women claimed of male domination.
few women embraced such extremes.
but by the early 1970s large numbers of women were coming to see themselves as an exploited group banding together against oppression and developing a culture of their own.
in cities and towns across the country feminists opened womens bookstores bars and coffee shops.
they founded feminist newspapers and magazines.
they created womens health clinics centers to assist victims of rape and abuse day care centers and particularly after 1973 abortion clinics.
expanding achievements in 1971 the government extended its affirmative action guidelines to include women linking sexism with racism as an officially acknowledged social problem.
women made rapid progress in the meantime in their efforts to move into the economic and political mainstream.
the nations all male educational institutions began to crack open their doors to women.
princeton and yale did so in 1969 and many others soon did the same.
in 1972 congress approved legislation known as title ix requiring universities to support male and female athletic programs at equal levels.
women were also becoming an important force in business and the professions.
nearly half of all married women held jobs by the mid 1970s and almost 90 percent of all women with college degrees worked.
the two career family in which both the husband and the wife maintained active professional lives slowly became a widely accepted middle class norm.
it had been common within much of the working class for decades.
there were also important symbolic changes such as the refusal of many women to adopt their husbands surnames when they married and the use of the term ms in place of mrs or miss to signal the irrelevance of a womans marital status in the professional world.
by the mid 1980s women were serving in both houses of congress on the supreme court in numerous federal cabinet positions as governors of several states and in many the crisis of authority 747 other political positions.
in 1981 ronald reagan named the first female supreme court justice sandra day oconnor in 1993 bill clinton named the second ruth bader ginsburg.
in 1984 the democratic party chose a woman representative women in government geraldine ferraro of new york as its vice presidential candidate.
madeleine albright under clinton and condoleezza rice under george w bush became the first women to serve as secretary of state.
and in 2008 hillary clinton nearly became the democratic candidate for president.
she too became secretary of state in the obama administration.
in academia women were expanding their presence in traditional scholarly fields they were also creating new fields womens and gender studies which in the 1980s and 1990s were among the fastest growing areas of american scholarship.
in 1972 congress approved the equal rights amendment era to the constitution and sent it to the states.
for a while ratification seemed almost the equal rights amendment certain.
by the late 1970s however the momentum behind the amendment had died because of a rising chorus of objections to it from people including many antifeminist women who feared that it would disrupt traditional social patterns.
in 1982 the ten years allotted for ratification expired.
the abortion issue a major goal of american feminism since the 1920s has been the effort by women to win greater control of their own sexual and reproductive lives.
in its least controversial form this impulse helped produce an increasing awareness beginning in the 1970s of the problems of rape sexual abuse and domestic abuse.
the dissemination of contraceptives and birth control information became more widespread and less controversial than it had been earlier in the century.
a related issue however stimulated as much popular controversy as any question of its time abortion.
abortion had once been legal in much of the united states but by the beginning of the twentieth century it was banned by statute in most of the country and remained so into the 1960s although many abortions continued to be performed quietly and often dangerously out of sight of the law.
the womens movement created strong new pressures for the legalization of abortion.
several states had abandoned restrictions on abortion by the end of the 1960s.
and in 1973 the supreme courts decision in roe v wade roe v wade based on an implied but not specified right to privacy first protected by the court only a few years earlier in griswold v connecticut invalidated all laws prohibiting abortion during the first trimester the first three months of pregnancy.
but even then the issue remained far from settled.
environmentalism in a turbulent society like feminism environmentalism entered the 1960s with a long history but relatively little public support.
also like feminism environmentalism profited from the turbulence of the era and emerged by the 1970s as a powerful force in american life.
the rise of this new movement was in part a result of the intensifying level of environmental degradation in advanced industrial societies of the late twentieth century.
it was a result too of the growth of ecology a science that provided environmentalists with new and powerful arguments.
748 chapter 30 the new science of ecology until the mid twentieth century most people who considered themselves environmentalists based their commitment on aesthetic or moral grounds.
they wanted to preserve nature because it was too beautiful to despoil because it was a mark of divinity on the world or because it permitted humans a spiritual experience that would otherwise be unavailable to them.
other groups took their cue from the late president theodore roosevelt.
these conservationists wanted to protect the environment for use in outdoor activities like camping and hunting.
in the course of the twentieth century however scientists in much of the world began to create a new rationale for environmentalism.
they called it ecology.
ecology is the science of the interrelatedness of the natural world.
it addresses such problems as air and water pollution the destruction of forests the extinction of species and toxic wastes which are not separate isolated problems.
all elements of the earths environment are intimately and delicately linked.
damaging any one of those elements therefore risks damaging all the others.
among the early contributions to popular knowledge of ecology was the work of writer and naturalist aldo leopold.
during a career in forest management leopold sought to apply the new scientific findings on ecology to his interactions with the natural world.
and in 1949 he published a classic of environmental literature the sand county almanac in which he argued that humans had a responsibility to understand and maintain the balance of nature that they should behave in the natural world according to a code that he called the land ethic by then the science of ecology was spreading widely in the scientific community.
among the findings of ecologists were such now common ideas as the food rachel carson chain the ecosystem biodiversity and endangered species rachel carsons sensational 1962 book silent spring which revealed the dangers of pesticides was based solidly on the ideas of ecologists and did at least as much as leopolds work to introduce those ideas to a larger public.
environmental advocacy among the major environmental organizations were the wilderness society the sierra club the national audubon society the nature conservancy the national wildlife federation and the national parks and conservation association.
all of these organizations predated the rise of modern ecological science but the growth of environmental threats and scientific efforts to address them kept these organizations engaged like never before.
they found allies among such groups as the american civil liberties union the league of women voters the national council of churches and even the afl cio.
out of these organizations emerged a new generation of environmental activists able to contribute to the legal and political battles of the movement.
scientists provided the necessary data.
lawyers fought battles with government agencies and in the courts.
many other forces contributed to what became the environmental movement.
lady bird johnson the first lady helped raise public awareness of the landscape with her energetic beautification campaign in the mid 1960s a campaign unconnected to any ecological concepts but one that reflected a growing popular dismay at the despoiling of the landscape by rapid economic growth.
members of the counterculture contributed to environmental awareness with their romanticization of the natural world and their repudiation of the technocracy but perhaps the greatest force behind environmentalism was the condition of the environment itself.
by the 1960s the damage to the natural world from postwar population the crisis of authority 749 and economic growth was becoming hard to ignore.
water pollution which had been a problem in some areas of the country for many decades was becoming so pollution widespread that almost every major city was dealing with the unpleasant sight and odor as well as the health risks of polluted rivers and lakes.
in cleveland ohio for example the cuyahoga river actually burst into flame from time to time from the petroleum waste being dumped into it the city declared the river an official fire hazard.
perhaps more alarming was the growing awareness that the air itself was becoming unhealthy that toxic fumes from factories power plants and most of all automobiles were poisoning the atmosphere.
weather forecasts and official atmospheric information began to refer to smog levels using a relatively new word formed from a combination of smoke and fog which became an almost perpetual fact of daily life in such cities as los angeles and denver.
in 1969 a damaged oil well platform off santa barbara california spewed hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil into the ocean just off the popular beaches of this affluent city.
this oil spill had a tremendous impact on the environmental consciousness of millions of americans.
another much larger spill indeed the largest in american history occurred off the coast of alaska in 1989 when the giant tanker exxon valdez hit a reef in prince william sound.
the damage it caused to the nearby shoreline and wildlife also greatly increased environmental consciousness.
in april 2010 the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded forty one miles off the louisiana coast killing eleven.
over the next three months chemical dispersants used to control the spill and 5 million gallons of crude oil spread into major oil spills the gulf of mexico destroying sea life and damaging the coastline.
the long term effects are still unknown.
environmentalists brought to public attention many long term dangers and helped create a broad and powerful movement.
earth day and beyond on april 22 1970 people all over the united states participated in the first earth day originally proposed by wisconsin senator gaylord nelson as a series of teach ins on college campuses earth day gradually took on a much larger life.
carefully managed by people who wanted to avoid associations with the radical left it had a less threatening quality than antiwar demonstrations and civil rights rallies seemed to have.
according to some estimates over 20 million americans participated in earth day observances making earth day possibly the largest single demonstration in the nations history.
the cautious centrist character of earth day and related efforts to popularize environmentalism helped create a movement that was for a time less divisive than other more controversial causes.
gradually environmentalism became more than simply a series of demonstrations and protests.
it became part of the consciousness of the vast majority of americans absorbed into popular culture built into primary and secondary education and endorsed by almost all politicians even if many of them actually opposed some environmental goals.
it also became part of the fabric of public policy.
in 1970 congress passed and president nixon signed the national environmental protection act which created a new agency the environmental protection agency to enforce antipollution epa established standards on businesses and consumers.
the clean air act also passed in 1970 and the clean water act passed in 1972 became additional tools in the governments arsenal of weapons against environmental degradation.
750 chapter 30 different administrations displayed varying levels of support for environmental goals and new environmental problems continued to emerge even as older ones sometimes found solutions.
environmentalism became simultaneously a movement a set of public policies and a broad national ideal and it was the combination of all those aspects that made it a powerful force in american life.
nixon kissinger and the vietnam war richard nixon assumed office in 1969 committed not only to restoring stability at home but to creating a new and more stable order in the world.
central to his hopes for international stability was a resolution of the stalemate in vietnam.
yet the new president felt no freer than his predecessor to abandon the american commitment there.
vietnamization despite nixons own deep interest in international affairs he brought with him into government a man who at times seemed to overshadow the president himself in the henry kissinger conduct of diplomacy henry kissinger a harvard professor whom nixon appointed as his special assistant for national security affairs.
kissinger quickly established dominance over secretary of state william rogers and secretary of defense melvin laird.
together nixon and kissinger set out to find an acceptable solution to the stalemate in vietnam.
the new vietnam policy moved along several fronts.
one was the move to vietnamize the conflict that is train and equip the south vietnamese military to assume the burden of combat in place of american forces.
in the fall of 1969 nixon announced the withdrawal of 60 000 american ground troops from vietnam.
by the fall of 1972 relatively few american soldiers remained in indochina.
from a peak of more than 540 000 in 1969 the number had dwindled to about 60 000.
vietnamization and the decreased draft calls it produced did help quiet domestic opposition to the war for a time.
it did nothing however to break the stalemate in the negotiations with the north vietnamese in paris.
the new administration decided that new military pressures would be necessary to do that.
escalation by the end of 1969 nixon and kissinger had decided that the most effective way to tip the military balance in south vietnams favor was to destroy bases in cambodia and laos that the u s military believed were the launching points for many north vietnamese attacks.
laos cambodia and vietnam are neighboring states in the peninsula of indochina.
very early in his presidency nixon secretly ordered the air force to bomb these bases on april 30 1970 the president announced that he was sending u s ground troops across the border into cambodia to destroy them.
literally overnight the cambodian invasion restored the dwindling antiwar movement to vigorous life.
the first days of may saw widespread and vocal antiwar demonstrations.
a mood of crisis was already mounting when on may 4 four college students were killed and nine injured after members of the national guard opened fire on antiwar demonstrakent state and jackson state tors at kent state university in ohio.
ten days later police killed the crisis of authority 751 two african american students at jackson state university in mississippi during a demonstration there.
the clamor against the war spread into the government and the press.
congress angrily repealed the gulf of tonkin resolution in december.
then in june 1971 first the new york times and later other newspapers began publishing excerpts from a secret study of the war prepared by the defense department during the johnson administration.
the socalled pentagon papers were leaked to the press by former defense official pentagon papers daniel ellsberg.
they provided evidence that the government had been dishonest both in reporting the military progress of the war and in explaining its own motives for american involvement.
the administration went to court to suppress the documents but the supreme court ruled that the press had the right to publish them.
morale and discipline among american troops in vietnam were rapidly deteriorating in the waning years of the war.
in 1971 lieutenant william calley was tried and convicted of overseeing a massacre of more than 100 unarmed south vietnamese civilians in 1968 near the village of my lai.
it attracted wide public attention to the dehumanizing impact of the war on those who fought it both americans and vietnamese.
less publicized were other more widespread problems among american troops in vietnam desertion drug addiction racism refusal to obey orders even the killing of unpopular officers by enlisted men.
by 1971 polls indicated that nearly two thirds of americans supported withdrawal from vietnam.
president nixon however believed that a defeat in vietnam would cause unacceptable damage to the nations credibility.
the fbi the cia the white house itself and other federal agencies increased their efforts to discredit and harass antiwar and radical groups often through illegal means.
in indochina meanwhile the fighting raged on.
american bombing in vietnam and cambodia increased.
in march 1972 the north vietnamese mounted their biggest offensive since 1968 the so called easter offensive.
american and south vietnamese easter offensive forces managed to halt the communist advance but it was clear that without american support the south vietnamese would not have succeeded.
at the same time nixon ordered american planes to bomb targets near hanoi the capital of north vietnam and haiphong its principal port and called for the mining of seven north vietnamese harbors.
peace with honor as the 1972 presidential election approached the administration stepped up its effort to produce a breakthrough in negotiations with the north vietnamese.
in april the president dropped his longtime insistence on the removal of north vietnamese troops from the south before any american withdrawal.
meanwhile henry kissinger met privately in paris with the north vietnamese foreign secretary le duc tho to work out terms for a cease fire.
on october 26 only days before the presidential election kissinger announced that peace is at hand several weeks later after the election negotiations broke down once again.
although both the american and the north vietnamese governments were ready to accept the kissinger tho plan for a cease fire president nguyen van thieu of south vietnam balked still insisting on a full withdrawal of north vietnamese forces from the south.
kissinger tried to win additional concessions from the communists to meet thieus objections but on december 16 talks broke off.
the next day december 17 american b 52s began the heaviest and most destructive air raids of the entire war on hanoi haiphong and other north vietnamese targets.
752 chapter 30 civilian casualties were high and fifteen american b 52s were shot down by the north vietnamese in the entire war to that point the united states had lost only one of the christmas bombing giant bombers.
on december 30 nixon terminated the christmas bombing the united states and the north vietnamese returned to the conference table and on january 27 1973 they signed an agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in vietnam nixon claimed that the christmas bombing had forced the north vietnamese to relent.
at least equally important however was the enormous american pressure on thieu to accept the cease fire.
the terms of the paris accords were little different from those kissinger and tho had accepted in principle a few months before.
nor were they much different from the peace plan johnson had proposed in 1968.
there would be an immediate ceasefire.
the north vietnamese would release several hundred american prisoners of war.
the thieu regime would survive for the moment but north vietnamese forces already in the south would remain there.
an undefined committee would work out a permanent settlement.
a harried u s official struggles to keep panicking vietnamese from boarding an already overpacked helicopter on the roof of the u s embassy in saigon.
the hurried evacuation of americans took place only hours before the arrival of north vietnamese troops signaling the final defeat of south vietnam.
ap images the evacuation of saigon the crisis of authority 753 defeat in indochina american forces were hardly out of indochina before the paris accords began to collapse.
in march 1975 the north vietnamese launched a full scale offensive against the now greatly weakened forces of south vietnam.
thieu appealed to washington for assistance.
the president now gerald ford appealed to congress for additional funding congress refused.
late in april 1975 communist forces marched into saigon shortly fall of saigon after officials of the thieu regime and the staff of the american embassy had fled the country in humiliating disarray.
the communist forces quickly occupied the capital renamed it ho chi minh city and began the process of reuniting vietnam under the government based in hanoi.
at about the same time the lon nol regime in cambodia fell to the murderous forces of the khmer rouge whose brutal policies led to the death of more than a third of the countrys people over the next several years.
such were the dismal results of more than a decade of direct american military involvement in vietnam.
more than 1 2 million vietnamese soldiers had died in combat along with countless civilians throughout the region.
a beautiful land had been ravaged its agrarian economy left in ruins until an economic revival began in the early 1990s vietnam remained for more than a decade one of the poorest nations in the world.
the united states had paid a heavy price as well.
the war had cost the nation almost 150 billion in direct costs and much more indirectly.
it had resulted in the deaths of over 57 000 young americans and the injury of 300 000 more.
and the nation had suffered a blow to its confidence and self esteem from which it did not soon recover.
nixon kissinger and the world the continuing war in vietnam provided an unhappy backdrop to what nixon considered his larger mission in world affairs the construction of a new international order.
the president had become convinced that the old assumptions of a bipolar world in which the united states and the soviet union were the only real great powers were now obsolete.
america must adapt to the new multipolar international structure in which china japan and western europe were becoming major independent forces.
nixon had a considerable advantage over many other politicians in changing the assumptions behind american foreign policy.
his long anticommunist record gave him credibility among many conservatives for his effort to transform american relations with communist china and the soviet union.
the china initiative and soviet american detente for more than twenty years ever since the fall of chiang kai shek in 1949 the united states had treated china the most populous nation on earth as if it did not exist.
instead america recognized the regime in exile on the small island of taiwan as the legitimate government of china.
nixon and kissinger wanted to forge a new relationship with the chinese communists in part to strengthen them as a counterbalance to the soviet union.
the chinese for their part were eager to end chinas own isolation from the international arena.
in july 1971 nixon sent henry kissinger on a secret mission to beijing.
when kissinger returned the president made the startling announcement that he would visit china himself within the next few months.
that fall with american approval the united 754 chapter 30 president nixons 1972 visit to china was an important step in normalizing relations between the united states and the peoples republic of china.
here nixon toasts the developing relationship with prime minister zhou enlai.
universal images group getty images nixon in china nations admitted the communist government of china and expelled the representatives of the taiwan regime.
finally in february 1972 nixon paid a formal visit to china.
it erased much of the deep animosity between the united states and the chinese communists.
nixon did not yet formally recognize the communist regime but in 1972 the united states and china began low level diplomatic relations.
the initiatives in china coincided with an effort by the nixon administration to improve relations with the soviet union an initiative known by the french word dtente.
in 1971 american and soviet diplomats produced the first strategic arms limitation treaty salt i which froze the arsenals of some nuclear missiles icbms on both sides at present levels.
in may of that year the president traveled to moscow to sign the agreement.
the next year the soviet premier leonid brezhnev visited washington.
dealing with the third world the policies of rapprochement with communist china and dtente with the soviet union reflected nixons and kissingers belief in the importance of stable relationships among the great powers.
but as americas experience in vietnam already illustrated the socalled third world remained the most volatile and dangerous source of international tension.
since the end of world war i the united states and the european powers had lost or withdrawn control over former colonies.
the result was a number of newly independent but economically fragile and politically unstable nations around the globe.
see america in the world the end of colonialism the nixon kissinger policy toward the third world tried to maintain the status quo without involving the united states too deeply in local disputes.
in 1969 and 1970 the nixon doctrine president described what became known as the nixon doctrine by which the united states would participate in the defense and development of allies and friends the crisis of authority 755 but would leave the basic responsibility for the future of those friends to the nations themselves.
in practice the nixon doctrine meant a declining american interest in contributing to third world development.
there was also a growing contempt for the united nations where underdeveloped nations were gaining influence through their sheer numbers.
and there was increasing american support for authoritarian regimes attempting to withstand radical challenges from within.
in 1970 for example the cia poured substantial funds into chile to help support the government against a communist challenge.
when the marxist candidate for president salvador allende came to power through an open election despite allende overthrown american efforts the united states began funneling more money to opposition forces in chile to help destabilize the new government.
in 1973 a military junta seized power from allende who was subsequently murdered.
the united states developed a friendly relationship with the new repressive military government of general augusto pinochet.
in the middle east conditions grew more volatile in the aftermath of a 1967 war in which israel had occupied substantial new territories dislodging many palestinian arabs from their homes.
the refugees were a source of considerable instability in jordan lebanon and the other surrounding countries into which they moved.
in october 1973 on the jewish high holy day of yom kippur egyptian and syrian forces attacked israel.
for ten days the israelis struggled to recover from the surprise attack finally they launched an effective counteroffensive against egyptian forces in the sinai.
at that point the united states intervened placing heavy pressure on israel to accept a cease fire rather than press its advantage.
the yom kippur war demonstrated the growing dependence of the united states and its allies on arab oil.
a brief but painful embargo in 1973 1974 by the arab members of the organization of the petroleum exporting companies opec against opec embargo the united states and other allies that supported israel provided an ominous warning of the costs of dependence on foreign oil.
it also prompted congress to pass fuel economy standards requiring automakers to raise average mileage from 13 5 miles per gallon to 27.
the standard has since been raised to 54 5 mpg by 2025.
politics and economics in the nixon years nixon ran for president in 1968 promising a return to more conservative social and economic policies and a restoration of law and order.
once he was in office however his domestic policies sometimes continued and even expanded the liberal initiatives of the previous two administrations.
domestic initiatives many of nixons domestic policies were a response to what he believed to be the demands of his constituency the silent majority of conservative mostly silent majority middle class people who he believed wanted to reduce federal interference in local affairs.
he tried unsuccessfully to persuade congress to pass legislation prohibiting school desegregation through the use of forced busing.
he forbade the department of health education and welfare now called the department of health and human services to cut off federal funds from school districts that had failed to comply with court america in the world the end of colonialism on july 4 1946 less than a year after the close of world war ii a ceremony in manila marked what senator millard tydings of maryland called one of the most unprecedented most idealistic and most far reaching events in all recorded history on that day the united states voluntarily ended nearly five decades of colonial control of the philippines which it had acquired as part of the spoils from the 1898 spanish american war.
philippine independence was only a small part of a dramatic change in the political structure of the world.
the close of world war ii marked not only the defeat of fascism in germany italy and japan but also the beginning of the end of the formal system of imperialism that european powers had maintained for centuries.
the repudiation of colonialism was driven in part by the heightened belief in democracy and self determination that the war helped strengthen through much of the world.
it was also driven by the weakness of the european powers after world war ii and their inability to sustain control over their increasingly restive colonies.
like most great geopolitical changes the drive for colonial independence was turbulent and often violent.
the united states had been a latecomer to the imperialist system.
but even its peaceful divestiture of the philippines reflected the challenges many imperial powers and postcolonial nations faced in renegotiating colonial relationships.
america was not quite as ready to cede military presence and economic influence in the region as it was to give up political responsibility over the islands.
philippine independence came with important caveats that the united states maintained control of fillipino military bases and that required through the bell trade act passed by congress in 1946 that the philippines not engage in any direct economic competition with the united states and that it revise its constitution to allow american interests free and unfettered access to the nations natural resources.
many filipinos argue that their nation did not achieve full independence until 1991 when the philippine senate refused to ratify a treaty that would have extended the american lease on the subic bay naval base once the largest u s navy installation in the pacific.
a year later the united states closed the base and left marking the first time in 400 years that the philippines once a spanish possession was not home to a foreign military power.
englands imperial holdings were the vastest in the world and the existence of the british empire was deeply embedded in englands economic life and national self image.
but it too withdrew from most of its colonies in the decades after world war ii beginning in 1947 with its largest and most important colony india.
the british raj as the colonial government was known withdrew from south asia in response to a growing independence movement on the subcontinent.
as often happened as colonial rule ended suppressed conflicts in the native population quickly emerged in the case of india between hindus and muslims.
the price of indian independence therefore was the partition of the country into india and pakistan and several decades later bangladesh.
a year later the british gave up its world war i mandate of palestine ceding the territory to the united nations and allowing for the creation of israel as well as many of its holdings in southeast asia including burma and ceylon.
malaya followed in 1957 and singapore in 1965.
in 1982 england passed the canada act effectively severing canada from the united kingdom and culminating a move toward full canadian self government that had begun several d ecades earlier.
in 1997 england returned one of its last important overseas territories hong kong to the control of china bringing nearly to an end the era of the british empire.
the dissolution of the british empire did not always proceed smoothly.
the suez crisis of 1956 in which the combined efforts of britain france and israel failed to halt egypts nationalization of the suez canal dealt a decisive blow to englands status as a major power in the middle east.
in 1982 englands dispute over the tiny falkland islands erupted into war with argentina which claimed the islands just off its coast as its own.
after the deaths of 258 english and 649 argentine soldiers england maintained its control of the falklands although argentina continues to assert its right to the islands.
despite these controversies the dissolution of the british empire proceeded relatively smoothly compared to the experience of the french who became engaged in several major conflicts after 1945.
in late 1946 vietnamese nationalists rose up against the french colonial government that had recently reoccupied the region after the defeat of japan in world war ii.
frances effort to return to vietnam culminated ultimately in its defeat at dien bien phu in 1954 and its subsequent withdrawal from indochina.
france also became embroiled in and tried to suppress by force a number of other violent colonial uprisings in madagascar cameroon and most notably algeria.
the algerian war 1954 1962 was a particularly bloody and costly conflict taking on aspects of a civil war and involving guerrilla warfare torture acts of terrorism and eventually the collapse of the french government in 1958.
algeria ultimately won its independence.
the end of the colonial system had its greatest impact on africa.
european powers had carved up almost all of sub saharan africa in the nineteenth century.
in the decades after world war ii almost all the african colonies won their independence even if not always easily morocco 1956 ghana 1957 the congo 1960 nigeria 1960 uganda 1962 kenya 1963 and gambia 1965.
african nationalism was troubled for decades by political instability and in some countries extreme poverty.
the caribbean also saw many new independent nations born in the postwar era including jamaica 1961 trinidad and tobago 1962 barbados 1966 and guyana 1966.
the most recent epicenter of independence movements has been in the lands that used to comprise the former soviet union.
a long and costly war in afghanistan began in the 1970s as the soviet union struggled to retain control of the nation in the face of powerful local insurgencies.
the war was one of the principal factors in the unraveling of the soviet empire that began in 1991.
many of the former soviet republics which considered themselves colonies of russia soon separated from russia and became independent nations.
these included estonia latvia and lithuania the formerly independent baltic nations seized by the soviet union during world war ii.
other former soviet possessions that became independent nations included ukraine moldavia armenia georgia azerbaijan kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan and turkmenistan.
russia continues to deal with the problems of empire.
a vicious conflict with chechnya an islamic area of russia insisting on independence created terror and instability for years.
the end of colonialism was one of the most epochal global changes of the last several centuries a change that brought to an end a system that was based on the assumption of european and american superiority over non western peoples.
despite the many problems new postcolonial nations have encountered since their independence few if any such nations would choose to become colonies again.
although formal colonialism came to an end in the post world war ii era other aspects of imperialism did not.
many former colonies which comprise much of the nonindustrialized world still struggle with the indirect exercise of economic power that wealthy western nations continue to exert over them.

758 chapter 30 orders to integrate.
at the same time he began to reduce or dismantle many of the social programs of the great society and the new frontier.
in 1973 he abolished the office of economic opportunity a centerpiece of the antipoverty program of the johnson years.
yet nixons domestic policies had progressive and creative elements as well.
he signed legislation creating the environmental protection agency and establishing the most stringent environmental regulations in the nations history.
he ordered the first affirmative action program for workers on federally funded projects.
one of the administrations boldest efforts was an attempt to overhaul the nations welfare system.
nixon proposed replacing the existing system with what he called the family assistance plan fap.
it would in effect have created a guaranteed annual income for all americans 1 600 in federal grants which could be supplemented by outside earnings up to 4 000.
the fap won approval in the house in 1970 but the bill failed in the senate.
nixon also became the first president since truman to propose a plan for national health insurance which likewise made no progress in congress.
from the warren court to the nixon court of all the liberal institutions that aroused the enmity of the conservative silent majority in the 1950s and 1960s none evoked more anger and bitterness than the supreme court warren court rulings under chief justice earl warren.
the warren courts rulings on racial matters disrupted traditional social patterns in both the north and the south.
its defense of civil liberties directly contributed to the increase in crime disorder and moral decay in the eyes of many americans.
in engel v vitale 1962 the court ruled that prayers in public schools were unconstitutional sparking outrage among religious fundamentalists and others.
in roth v united states 1957 the court sharply limited the authority of local governments to curb pornography.
in a series of other decisions the court greatly strengthened the civil rights of criminal defendants and many americans believed greatly weakened the power of law enforcement officials to do their jobs.
for example in gideon v wainwright 1963 the court ruled that every felony defendant was entitled to a lawyer regardless of his or her ability to pay.
in escobedo v illinois 1964 it ruled that a defendant must be allowed access to a lawyer before questioning by police.
in miranda v arizona 1966 the court confirmed the obligation of authorities to inform a criminal suspect of his or her rights.
by 1968 the warren court had become the target of americans who felt the united states had shifted too far toward helping poor dispossessed and criminal individuals at the expense of the middle class.
nixon promised to give the court a more conservative cast.
when chief justice earl warren retired early in 1969 nixon replaced him with a federal appeals court judge of conservative leanings warren burger.
at about the same time associate justice abe fortas resigned his seat after the disclosure of a series of alleged financial improprieties.
to replace him nixon named clement f haynsworth a respected federal circuit court judge from south carolina.
but haynsworth came under fire from senate liberals black organizations and labor unions for his conservative record on civil rights.
the senate rejected him.
nixons next choice was g harrold carswell a florida federal appeals court judge of little distinction.
he too was rejected.
nixon angrily denounced the votes.
but he was careful thereafter to choose men of standing within the legal community to fill vacancies on the supreme court harry blackmun a moderate jurist from minnesota lewis f powell jr a respected lawyer from virginia and william rehnquist a member of the nixon justice department.
the crisis of authority 759 the new court however fell far short of what the president and many conservatives had expected.
rather than retreating from its commitment to social reform the court in many areas actually moved further toward it.
in swann v charlotte mecklenburg board of education 1971 it ruled in favor of forced busing to achieve racial burger court rulings balance in schools.
despite intense and occasionally violent opposition of local communities as diverse as boston and louisville kentucky the judicial commitment to integration was not overturned.
in furman v georgia 1972 the court overturned existing capital punishment statutes and established strict new guidelines for such laws in the future.
in roe v wade 1973 one of the most controversial decisions in the courts modern history it struck down laws forbidding abortions in the first three months of pregnancy.
in other decisions however the burger court did demonstrate a more conservative temperament than the warren court had shown.
although the justices approved busing as a tool for achieving integration they rejected in milliken v bradley 1974 a plan to transfer students across municipal lines in this case between detroit and its suburbs to achieve racial balance.
while the court upheld the principle of affirmative action in its celebrated 1978 decision bakke v board of regents of california it established restrictive new guidelines for such programs in the future.
in stone v powell 1976 the court agreed to certain limits on the right of a defendant to appeal a state conviction to the federal judiciary.
the 1972 landslide nixon entered the presidential race in 1972 with substantial strength.
his energetic reelection committee had collected enormous sums of money.
the president himself used the powers of incumbency to strengthen his political standing in strategic areas.
and nixons foreign policy successes especially his trip to china increased his stature in the eyes of the nation.
nixon was most fortunate in 1972 however in his opposition.
george wallace partly at nixons urging entered the democratic primaries and helped divide the party until a would be assassin shot the alabama governor during a rally at a maryland shopping center in may.
paralyzed from the waist down wallace was unable to continue campaigning.
in the meantime the most liberal factions of the party succeeded in establishing their candidate senator george s mcgovern of south dakota as the george mcgovern front runner for the nomination.
an outspoken critic of the war and a forceful advocate of liberal positions on many social and economic issues mcgovern profited greatly from party reforms which he himself had helped draft that gave increased influence to women minorities and young people in the selection of the democratic ticket.
but in the process the mcgovern campaign came to be associated with aspects of the turbulent 1960s that many middle class americans were eager to reject.
on election day nixon won reelection by one of the largest margins in history 60 7 percent of the popular vote to mcgoverns 37 5 percent and an electoral margin of 520 to 17.
the democratic candidate carried only massachusetts and the district of columbia.
but serious problems some beyond the presidents control and others of his own making lurked in the wings.
the troubled economy although it was a political scandal that would ultimately destroy the nixon presidency the most important issue of the early 1970s was the beginning of a long term transformation 760 chapter 30 of the american economy.
for three decades that economy had been the envy of the world.
in fact however americas prosperity rested in part on several artificial conditions that were rapidly disappearing by the late 1960s.
the most immediate change was the end of the nations easy access to cheap raw materials a change that became a major cause of the serious inflation that plagued the economy through much of the 1970s.
for many years opec had operated as an informal bargaining unit for the sale of oil by third world nations but had seldom managed to exercise any real strength.
but in the early 1970s opec began to use its oil both as an economic tool and as a political weapon.
in 1973 in the midst of the yom kippur war arab members of opec announced that they would no longer ship petroleum to nations supporting israel that is to the united states and its allies in western europe.
at about the same time the opec nations agreed to raise their prices 500 percent from 3 to 15 a barrel.
these twin shocks produced momentary economic chaos in the west.
the united states suffered its first fuel shortage since world war ii.
and although the crisis eased a few months later the price of energy continued to rise.
another longer term change in the american economy was the transformation of the nations manufacturing sector.
ever since world war ii american industry had enjoyed relatively little competition from the rest of the world.
by the end of the 1960s however both western europe and japan had recovered from the damage their manufacturing sectors had absorbed during world war ii.
by the early 1970s they were providing stiff competition to american firms in the sale of automobiles steel and many other products both in world markets and within the united states.
some american corporations failed.
others restructured themselves to become more competitive again in world markets but in the process closed many older plants and eliminated hundreds of thousands of oncelucrative manufacturing jobs.
the high wage high employment industrial economy that had been a central fact of american life since the 1940s was gradually disappearing.
the nixon response nixons initial answer to these mounting economic problems was a conventional antiinflationary one.
he reduced federal spending and raised taxes producing a modest budget surplus in 1969.
but when those policies proved difficult to sustain nixon turned increasingly to control of the currency.
placing conservative economists at the head of the federal reserve board he ensured sharply higher interest rates and a contraction of the money supply.
even so the cost of living rose a cumulative 15 percent during nixons first two and a half years in office.
economic growth in the meantime declined.
in the summer of 1971 nixon imposed a ninety day freeze on all wages and prices at their existing levels.
then in november he launched the second phase of his economic plan mandatory guidelines for some wage and price increases to be administered by a federal agency.
inflation subsided temporarily but the recession continued.
fearful that the recession would be more damaging than inflation in an election year the administration reversed itself late in 1971 interest rates were allowed to drop sharply and government spending increased producing the largest budget deficit since world war ii.
the new tactics helped revive the economy in the short term but inflation rose substantially.
in 1973 prices rose 9 percent in 1974 after the arab oil embargo and the opec price increases they rose 12 percent the highest rate since shortly after world war ii.
the new energy crisis in the meantime was quickly becoming a national preoccupation.
but while nixon talked often about the need to achieve energy independence he offered few concrete proposals.
the crisis of authority 761 the watergate crisis although economic problems greatly concerned the american people in the 1970s another stunning development preoccupied the nation beginning early in 1973 the fall of richard nixon.
scholars wrangle over the exact origins and legacies of nixons fall from grace but they widely agree that the presidents demise was in part a result of the turbulent climate of the early 1970s.
it was also a result of his own reckless personality and overpowering fear that he and the nation faced grave dangers from the radicals and dissidents who were challenging his policies.
the scandals early on the morning of june 17 1972 police arrested five men who had broken into the headquarters of the democratic national committee in the watergate office building in washington d c two others were seized a short time later and charged with supervising the break in.
when reporters for the washington post began researching the backgrounds of the culprits they discovered that among those involved in the burglary were former employees of the committee for the re election of the president crp.
one of them had worked in the white house itself.
they had moreover been paid for the break in from a secret fund of nixons reelection committee a fund controlled by among others members of the white house staff.
public interest in the disclosures grew slowly in the last months of 1972.
early in 1973 however the watergate burglars went on trial and under prodding from federal judge john j sirica one of the defendants james w mccord agreed to cooperate both with the grand jury and with a special senate investigating committee recently established under senator sam j ervin of north carolina.
mccords testimony opened a floodgate of confessions and for months a parade of white house and campaign officials exposed one illegality after another.
foremost among them was a member of the inner circle of the white house john dean counsel to the president who had warned nixon that the watergate cover up was a cancer on the presidency and who later leveled allegations against nixon himself.
two different sets of scandals emerged from the investigations.
one was a general pattern of abuses of power involving both the white house and the nixon campaign committee which included but was not limited to the watergate break in.
the other scandal watergate and the one that became the major focus of public attention for nearly two years was the way in which the administration tried to manage the investigations of the watergate breakin and other abuses a pattern of behavior that became known as the cover up there was never any conclusive evidence that the president had planned or approved the burglary in advance.
but there was mounting evidence that he had been involved in illegal efforts to obstruct investigations of the episode.
see debating the past watergate nixon accepted the departure of members of his administration implicated in the scandals.
but the president continued to insist on his own innocence.
there the matter might have rested had it not been for the disclosure during the senate hearings of a white house taping system that had recorded virtually every conversation in the presidents office during the period in question.
all those investigating the scandals sought access watergate tapes to the tapes.
nixon pleading executive privilege refused to release them.
a special prosecutor appointed by the president to handle the watergate cases harvard law professor archibald cox took nixon to court in october 1973 in an effort to force him to relinquish the recordings.
nixon fired cox and suffered the humiliation of watching both attorney debating the past watergate forty two years after watergate one of the most famous political scandals in american history historians and others continue to argue about its causes and significance.
their interpretations tend to fall into several broad categories.
one argument emphasizes the evolution of the institution of the presidency over time and sees watergate as the result of a much larger pattern of presidential usurpations of power that stretched back at least several decades.
arthur m schlesinger jr helped develop this argument in his 1973 book the imperial presidency which argues that ever since world war ii americans have believed that the nation was in a state of permanent crisis threatened from abroad by the menace of communism threatened from within by the danger of i nsufficient will.
a succession of presidents believed in the urgency of this crisis and in their duty to take whatever measures might be necessary to combat it.
that led them gradually to usurp more and more power from congress from the courts and from the public.
initially this expansion of presidential power came in the realm of international affairs.
it included covert and at times illegal activities overseas.
gradually presidents began to look for ways to circumvent constraints in domestic matters as well.
nixons actions in the watergate crisis were in other words a culmination of this long and steady expansion of covert presidential power.
jonathan schell in the time of illusion 1975 offers a variation of this argument tying the crisis of the presidency to the pressure that nuclear weapons place on presidents to protect the nations and their own credibility 762 another explanation of watergate emphasizes the difficult social and political environment of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
nixon entered office according to this view facing an unprecedentedly radical opposition that would stop at nothing to discredit the war and destroy his authority.
he found himself therefore drawn into taking similarly desperate measures of his own to defend himself.
nixon made this argument in his own 1978 memoirs now that this season of mindless terror has fortunately passed it is difficult perhaps impossible to convey a sense of the pressures that were influencing my actions and reactions during this period but it was this epidemic of unprecedented domestic terrorism that prompted our efforts to discover the best means by which to deal with this new phenomenon of highly organized and highly skilled revolutionaries dedicated to the violent destruction of our democratic system.
the historian herbert parmet echoes parts of this argument in richard nixon and his america 1990.
stephen ambrose offers a more muted version of the same view in richard nixon 1989.
most of those who have written about watergate however search for the explanation not in institutional or social forces but in the personalities of the people involved and most notably in the personality of richard nixon.
even many of those who have developed structural explanations schlesinger schell and ambrose for e xample return eventually to nixon himself as the most important explanation for watergate.
others begin there perhaps most notably stanley i kutler in the wars of watergate 1990 and later abuse of power 1997 in which he presents extensive excerpts from conversations about watergate taped in the nixon white house.
kutler emphasizes nixons lifelong resort to vicious political tactics and his long standing belief that he was a special target of unscrupulous enemies and had to get them before they got him.
watergate was rooted kutler argues in the personality and history of nixon himself a corrosive hatred he claims decisively shaped nixons own behavior his career and eventually his historical standing understand analyze evaluate 1.

general elliot richardson and his deputy resign in protest.
this saturday night massacre as it was called made the presidents predicament much worse.
not only did public pressure force him to appoint a new special prosecutor texas attorney leon jaworski who proved just as determined as cox to subpoena the tapes but the episode precipitated an investigation by the house of representatives into the possibility of impeachment.
the fall of richard nixon nixons situation deteriorated further in the following months.
late in 1973 vice president spiro agnew became embroiled in a scandal of his own when evidence surfaced that he had accepted bribes and kickbacks while serving as governor of maryland and even as vice president.
in return for a justice department agreement not to press the case agnew pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of income tax evasion and resigned ford replaces agnew from the government.
with the controversial agnew no longer in line to succeed to the presidency the prospect of removing nixon from the white house became less worrisome to his opponents.
the new vice president was house minority leader gerald ford an amiable and popular michigan congressman.
the impeachment investigation quickly gathered momentum.
in april 1974 in an effort to head off further subpoenas of the tapes the president released transcripts of a number of relevant conversations claiming that they proved his innocence.
investigators and much of the public felt otherwise.
even these edited tapes seemed to suggest nixons complicity in the cover up.
in july the crisis reached a climax.
first the supreme court ruled unanimously in united states v richard m nixon that the president must relinquish the tapes to special prosecutor jaworski.
days later the house judiciary committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment.
even without additional evidence nixon might well have been impeached by the full house and convicted by the senate.
early in august however he provided at last the smoking gun the concrete proof of his guilt that his defenders had long contended was missing from the case against him.
among the tapes that the supreme court compelled 763 764 chapter 30 nixons farewell only moments before nixon had been in tears saying good bye to his staff in the east room of the white house.
but as he boarded a helicopter to begin his trip home to california shortly after resigning as president he flashed his trademark victory sign to the crowd on the white house lawn.
bettmann corbis nixon to relinquish were several that offered apparently incontrovertible evidence of his involvement in the watergate cover up.
only three days after the burglary the recordings disclosed the president had ordered the fbi to stop investigating the break in.
impeachment and conviction now seemed inevitable.
for several days nixon cloistered himself in the white house.
finally on august 8 resignation 1974 he announced his resignation the first president in american history ever to do so.
at noon the next day while nixon and his family flew west to their home in california gerald ford took the oath of office as president.
many americans expressed relief and exhilaration that as the new president put it our long national nightmare is over but the wave of good feeling could not obscure the deeper and more lasting damage of the watergate crisis.
in a society in which distrust of leaders and institutions of authority was already widespread the fall of richard nixon confirmed for many americans their most cynical assumptions about the untrustworthy character of american public life.
conclusion the victory of richard nixon in the 1968 presidential election represented a popular repudiation of turbulence and radicalism.
it was a call for a restoration of order and stability.
but order and stability were not the dominant characteristics of nixons troubled years in office.
nixon entered office when the political left and the counterculture were approaching the peak of their influence.
american culture and society in the late 1960s and early 1970s were shaped decisively by and were deeply divided over the challenges by young people the crisis of authority 765 to the prevailing social norms.
these were also the years in which a host of new liberation movements joined the drive for racial equality and when above all women mobilized effectively to demand changes in the way society treated gender differences.
nixon had run for office attacking the failure of his predecessor to end the war in vietnam.
but for four years under his presidency the war and the protests against it continued and even in some respects escalated.
the division of opinion over the war was as deep as any of the other divisions in national life.
it continued to poison the nations politics and social fabric until the american role in the conflict finally shuddered to a close in 1973.
but much of the controversy and division in the 1970s was a product of the nixon presidency itself.
nixon was in many ways a dynamic and even visionary leader who proposed some important domestic reforms and who made important changes in american foreign policy most notably making overtures to communist china and forging dtente with the soviet union.
he was also however a devious secretive man whose white house became engaged in a series of covert activities that produced the most dramatic political scandal in american history.
watergate as it was called preoccupied much of the nation for nearly two years beginning in 1972 and ultimately in the summer of 1974 the scandal forced richard nixon who had been reelected to office only two years before by one of the largest majorities in modern history to become the first president in american history to resign.
nixon was elected to lead the nation out of a war it no longer wanted but his shameful exit from office and the ongoing vietnam war continued to damage the nations self confidence and trust in government.

what was reaganomics and how did this policy affect the national economy.
the frustrations of the early 1970s the defeat in vietnam the watergate crisis the decay of the american economy inflicted damaging blows to the confident optimistic nationalism that had characterized so much of the postwar era.
some americans responded to these problems by announcing the arrival of an age of limits in which americans would have to learn to live with less.
by the end of the decade however another response was gaining strength one that combined a steady retreat from some of the heady liberal visions of the 1960s with a reinforced commitment to traditional ideas of economic growth international power and american virtue.
766 politics and diplomacy after watergate in the aftermath of richard nixons ignominious departure from office many americans wondered whether faith in the presidency and in the government as a whole could ever be restored.
the administrations of the two presidents who succeeded nixon did little to answer those questions.
the ford custodianship gerald ford inherited the presidency under difficult circumstances.
he had to try to rebuild confidence in government in the wake of the watergate scandals and to restore prosperity in the face of major economic difficulties.
the new presidents effort to establish himself as a symbol of political integrity suffered a setback only a month after he took office when he granted richard nixon a full free and absolute pardon for any crimes he may have committed during his presidency.
the pardon angered a public eager to see nixon face criminal charges and caused a decline in fords popularity from which he never fully recovered.
nevertheless most americans considered ford a decent man his honesty and amiability did much to reduce the bitterness and acrimony of the watergate years.
the ford administration enjoyed far less success in its effort to solve the problems of the economy.
to curb inflation the president called for largely ineffective voluntary efforts.
after supporting high interest rates opposing increased federal spending through liberal use of his veto power and resisting pressures for a tax reduction ford had to deal with a confounding economic mix of rising unemployment high inflation and slowing economic growth in 1974 and 1975 known as stagflation while it occurred only during this twoyear period it was synonymous with most of the economic troubles of the seventies.
