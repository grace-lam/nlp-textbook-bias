building a new world guiding question how did the conferences at dumbarton oaks and yalta attempt tosh the postwar world.
well before the war ended president roosevelt had begun to thi about what the world would be like after the war.
many people ii the united states worried that the great depression would com back.
others worried that the united states would return to isolationism and let the rivalries between other countries lead t new wars.
roosevelt was determined however to build a new economic and political system that would preserve the peace an promote economic growth in the world.
the bretton woods system president roosevelt believed that high tariffs like the smoot hawley tariff of 1931 had helped cause the great depression and his advisors were convinced that the best way to generate prosperity and economic growth after the war was to increase tl amount of trade between countries and to create institutions thi would keep the trade system stable.
in july 1944 roosevelt organized a conference for the worlc nations except those that belonged to the axis.
the conference held at bretton woods new hampshire and established many international economic institutions that are still part of the wor economic system today.
the first organization set up at bretton woods was the world bank.
its purpose was to help rebuild europe after the war and he.
nations in asia africa and latin america develop their economic the world bank still performs this role today loaning money to h 396 nations with their economic development.
the second institution set up was the international monetary fund imf.
its purpose was to help countries with trade deficits.
a trade deficit is when a country imports more than it exports.
countries with trade deficits have more of their money flowing out to buy foreign goods than they have flowing in from other countries who are buying their goods.
the imf was to use its funds to prevent trade wars and to prevent each countrys money from changing too much in value.
the imf continues to perform this function today.
in addition to these two institutions the nations set up a new currency system.
the u s dollar became the worlds reserve currency.
all nations set an exchange rate between their currency and the dollar.
the dollar in turn was put on a gold standard.
one ounce of gold would equal 35 u s dollars and the united states pledged to always keep enough gold in reserve so that anyone with dollars could convert them into gold on demand.
one ofthe positives of the bretton woods system was that it would prevent nations from using inflation to escape their debts.
everyone remembered that germany had used inflation to make its currency almost worthless after world war i as a way to avoid paying its reparations debts.
the bretton woods system would keep the worlds currencies stable and help keep the world at peace.
the weakness of the system was that a gold standard limited the use of monetary policy to fight inflation or get out of a recession.
by setting exchange rates it also meant trade between nations could become unbalanced if the exchange rate did not accurately reflect the market value of goods being traded across borders.

he believed one cause of world war ii had been the american decision to stay out of the league of nations after world war i.
he wanted the united states and its allies to create a new international organization that would take an active role in preserving the peace.
in 1944 at the dumbarton oaks estate in washington d c delegates from 39 countries met to discuss the new organization which was to be called the united nations un.
the delegates at the conference agreed that the un would have a general assembly in which every member nation in the world would have one vote.
the un would also have a security council with 11 members.
five countries would be permanent members of the security council britain france china the soviet union and the united states.
these five permanent members would each have veto power.
the advantage ofthe united nations was that it put all ofthe great powers that had helped to defeat the axis in the security council.
this would force them to consult with each other and work together whenever the united nations took action.
the weakness ofthe united nations was that the veto allowed any one member ofthe security council to stop the un from taking action.
on april 25 1945 representatives from 50 countries came to san francisco to officially organize the united nations and design its charter.
the general assembly was given the power to vote on resolutions and to choose the nonpermanent members of the security council.
the security council was responsible for international peace and security.
it could ask its members to use military force to uphold a un resolution.

leaders of the big three allied nations met at the yalta conference to determine how to organize postwar europe.
critical thinking predicting consequences how might allowing stalin to influence the political landscape of eastern europe affect that region s later foreign policy.
the yalta conference in february 1945 with the war in europe nearly over roosevelt church and stalin met at yalta a soviet resort on the black sea to plan the postwar world.
several agreements reached at yalta later played an important role in causing the cold war.
a key issue discussed at yalta was poland.
shortly after the german had invaded poland in 1939 the polish government fled to britain.
in e however soviet troops drove back the germans and entered poland.
as they liberated poland from german control the soviets encouraged po communists to set up a new government.
as a result two governments claimed the right to govern poland one communist and one non communis president roosevelt and prime minister churchill both argued that the poles should be free to choose their own government.
stalin however quickly pointed out that every time invaders had enter russia from the west they had come through poland.
eventually the three leaders compromised.
roosevelt and churchill agreed to recognize the poli government set up by the soviets.
stalin agreed it would include members prewar polish government and free elections would be held as soon as pos the declaration of liberated europe after reaching a compromise on poland the three leaders agreed to issue the declaration of liberated europe.
the declaration echoed the atlantic charte asserting the right of all people to choose the form of government under wi they will live.
the allies promised that the people of europe would be allow create democratic institutions of their own choice and to create temporary governmen that represented all democratic elements pledged the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments resp to the will of the people dividing germany the conference then focused on germany.
roosevelt churchill and stalin agreed to di germany into four zones.
great britain the united states the soviet union and france each control one zone.
the same four countries would also divide the german capita city of berlin into four zones even though it was in the soviet zone.
although pleased with the decision to divide germany stalin also demanded that germany pay heavy reparations for the war damages it had caused.
an agreement was reached that germany could pay war reparations with trade goods and products half of which would go to the soviet union.
the allies would remove industrial machinery railroad cars and other equipment from germany as reparations.
later arguments about reparations greatly increased tensions between the united states and the soviet union.
rising tensions the yalta decisions shaped the expectations of the united states.
two weeks after yalta the soviets pressured the king of romania into appointing a communist government.
the united states accused the soviets of violating the declaration of liberated europe.
soon afterward the soviets refused to allow more than three non communist poles to serve in the 18 member polish government.
there was also no indication that they intended to hold free elections in poland as promised.
on april 1 president roosevelt informed the soviets that their actions in poland were not acceptable.
yalta marked a turning point in soviet american relations.
president roosevelt had hoped that an allied victory and the creation of the united nations would lead to a more peaceful world.
instead as the war came to an end the united states and the soviet union became increasingly hostile toward each other.
the cold war an era of confrontation and competition between the nations lasted from about 1946 to about 1990.
soviet concerns as the war ended soviet leaders became concerned about security.
they wanted to keep germany weak and make sure that the countries between germany and the soviet union were under soviet control.
soviet leaders also believed that communism was a superior economic system that would eventually replace capitalism.
they believed that the soviet union should encourage communism in other nations.
they accepted lenins theory that capitalist countries would eventually try to destroy communism.
this made them suspicious of capitalist nations.
american economic issues while soviet leaders focused on securing their borders american leaders focused on economic problems.
they believed that the great depression became so severe because nations reduced trade.
they also believed that when nations stop trading they are forced into war to get resources.
by 1945 roosevelt and his advisers were convinced that economic growth through world trade was the key to peace.
they also thought that the free enterprise system with private property rights and limited government intervention in the economy was the best route to prosperity.
un responses to the war in response to the atrocities of world war ii the united nations held a general assembly in december 1946.
they passed a resolution that made genocide punishable internationally.
the text of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide became the first un human rights treaty.
former first lady eleanor roosevelt chaired a un commission on human rights in 1948.
the international commission drafted the universal declaration of human rights which promoted the inherent dignity of every human being and was a commitment to end discrimination.

satellite nations nations politically and economically dominated or controlled by another more powerful country truman takes control guiding question why did the potsdam conference further increase tensions between the united st and the soviet union.
eleven days after confronting the soviets on poland president roosevelt died harry s truman became president.
truman was strongly anti communist.
h believed world war ii had begun because britain had tried to appease hitler did not intend to make that mistake with stalin.
we must stand up to the russians he told secretary of state edward stettinius the day he took office.
ten days later truman did exactly that at a meeting with soviet foreign minister molotov.
truman immediately brought up poland and demanded th stalin hold free elections as he had promised at yalta.
molotov took the unexpectedly strong message back to stalin.
the meeting marked an importa shift in soviet american relations and set the stage for further confrontations the potsdam conference in july 1945 with the war against japan still raging truman finally met stalin at potsdam near berlin.
both men had come to potsdam to work a deal on germany.
truman was now convinced that industry was criti to germany s survival.
unless its economy was allowed to revive the i of europe would never recover and the german people might turn to communism out of desperation.
stalin and his advisers were convinced they needed reparations froi germany.
the war had devastated the soviet economy.
soviet troops hs begun stripping their zone in germany of its machinery and equipmcn use back home but stalin wanted germany to pay much more.
400 atjhe cnference truman took a firm stand against heavy reparations.
he insisted that germany s industry had to be allowed to recover.
truman suggested the soviets take reparations from their zone while the allies allowed in ustry to revive in the other zones.
stalin opposed this idea since the soviet zone was mostly agricultural.
to get the soviets to accept the agreement truman offered stalin a small amount of industrial equipment from the other zones but required the soviets to pay for part of it with food shipments.
he also offered to accept the new german polish border the soviets had established.
stalin did not like the proposal.
at potsdam truman learned of the successful u s atomic bomb tests.
he hinted to stalin that the united states had a new powerful weapon.
stalin suspected truman of trying to bully him.
he thought the americans wanted to limit reparations to keep the soviets weak.
despite his suspicions stalin had to accept the terms.
american and british troops controlled germanys industrial heartland and there was no way for the soviets to get reparations without cooperating.
the potsdam conference marked yet another increase in tensions.
the iron curtain descends although truman had won the argument over reparations he had less success on other issues at potsdam.
the soviets refused to make stronger commitments to uphold the declaration of liberated europe.
the presence of the soviet army in eastern europe ensured that pro soviet communist governments would eventually be established in the nations of poland romania bulgaria hungary and czechoslovakia.
the communist countries of eastern europe came to be called satellite nations because they were controlled by the soviets as satellites are tied by gravity to the planets they orbit.
although not under direct soviet control these nations had to remain communist and friendly to the soviet union.
they also had to follow policies that the soviets approved.
after watching the communist takeover in eastern europe the former british prime minister winston churchill coined a phrase to describe what had happened.
on march 5 1946 in a speech delivered in fulton missouri churchill referred to an iron curtain falling across eastern europe.
the press picked up the term and for the next 43 years it described the communist nations of eastern europe and the soviet union.

the long telegram increasingly exasperated by the soviets refusal to cooperate officials at the u s state department asked the american embass in moscow to explain soviet behavior.
on february 22 1946 diplomat george kennan responded with what became known as the long telegram a message thousands of words long explaining his views of the soviets.
according to kennan the soviets view of the world came from a traditional russian sens of insecurity and fear of the west intensified by the communi ideas of lenin and stalin.
because communists believed they we in a historical struggle against capitalism kennan argued it was impossible to reach any permanent settlement with them.
kennan proposed what became basic american policy throughout the cold war a long term patient but firm and vigilant containmei of russian expansive tendencies in kennans opinion the soviet system had major economic and political weaknesses.
if the unitec states could keep the soviets from expanding their power it would only be a matter of time before their system would fall apart beating communism without going to war.

crisis in iran while trumans administration discussed kennans ideas a series of crises erupte uring the spring and summer of 1946.
these crises seemed to prove that kennan was right about the soviets.
the first crisis began in iran.
during world war ii the united states had troops in southern iran while soviet troops held northern iran to secure a supply line from the persian gulf.
after the war instead of withdrawing as promised the soviet troops remained in northern iran.
stalin then began demanding access to irans oil supplies.
to increase the pressure soviet troops helped local communists in northern iran establish a separate government.
american officials saw these actions as a soviet push into the middle east.
the secretary of state sent stalin a strong message demanding that soviet forces withdraw.
at the same time the battleship uss missouri sailed into the eastern mediterranean.
the pressure seemed to work.
soviet forces withdrew having been promised a joint soviet iranian oil company although the iranian parliament later rejected the plan.
the truman doctrine frustrated in iran stalin turned northwest to turkey.
there the straits of the dardanelles were a vital route from soviet ports on the black sea to the mediterranean.
for centuries russia had wanted to control this strategic route.
in august 1946 stalin demanded joint control of the dardanelles with turkey.
presidential adviser dean acheson saw this move as part of a soviet plan to control the middle east.
he advised truman to make a show of force.
the president ordered the new aircraft carrier franklin d roosevelt to join the missouri in protecting turkey and the eastern mediterranean.
meanwhile britain tried to help greece.
in august 1946 greek communists launched a guerrilla war against the greek government.
british troops helped fight the guerrillas but in february 1947 britain informed the united states that it could no longer afford to help greece due to britains weakened postwar economy.
shortly after truman went before congress to ask for 400 million to fight communist aggression in greece and turkey.
his speech outlined a policy that became known as the truman doctrine.

recovery program or marshall plan which would give european nations american aid to rebuild their economies.
truman saw both the marshall plan and the truman doctrine as essential for containment.
marshall offered help to all nations planning a recovery program.
although the marshall plan was offered to the soviet union and its satellite nations the soviets rejected it and developed their own economic program.
this action further separated europe into competing regions.
th marshall plan pumped billions of dollars in supplies machinery and food into western europe.
the regions recovery weakened the appeal of communism and opened new markets for trade.
in his 1949 inaugural address truman proposed assistance for underdeveloped countries outside the war zone.
the point four program aimed to provide them with scientific advances and industrial progress for their improvement and growth.
the department of state administered the program until its merger with other foreign aid programs in 1953.

the soviets however still wanted germany to pay reparations.
this dispute brought the nations to the brink of war.
by early 1948 american officials had concluded that the soviets were trying to undermine germanys economy.
in response the united states britain an france merged their german zones and allowed the germans to have theii own government creating the federal republic of germany which becam known as west germany.
they also agreed to merge their zones in berlin and make west berlin part of west germany.
the soviet zone became the german democratic republic or east germany.
west germany was most.
independent but not allowed to have a military.
the creation of west germany convinced the soviets they would neve get the reparations they wanted.
in june 1948 soviet troops blockaded we berlin hoping to force the united states to reconsider its decision or abandon west berlin.
truman sent bombers capable of carrying atomic weapons to bases in britain.
hoping to avoid war with the soviets he ordered the air force to fly supplies into berlin rather than troops.
the berlin airlift began in june 1948 and continued through the sprir of 1949 bringing in more than two million tons of supplies to the city.
finally lifted the blockade on may 12 1949.
the airlift symbolized americ determination to contain communism and not give in to soviet demands.
404 the creation of nato the berlin blockade convinced many americans that the soviets were bent on conquest.
the public began to support a military alliance with western europe.
by april 1949 an agreement had been made to form the north atlantic treaty organization nato a mutual defense alliance.
nato initially included 12 countries the united states canada britain france italy belgium denmark portugal the netherlands norway luxembourg and iceland.
nato members agreed to come to the aid of any member who was attacked.
for the first time the united states had committed itself to maintaining peace in europe.

to prevent a communist revolution in asia the united states sent the nationalist government 2 billion in aid beginning in the mid 1940s.
the nationalists however squandered this advantage through poor military planning and corruption.
by 1949 the communists had captured the chinese capital of beijing while support for the nationalists declined.
in august 1949 the u s state department discontinued aid to the chinese nationalists.
the defeated nationalists then fled to the small island of formosa now called taiwan.
the victorious communists established the peoples republic of china in october 1949.
chinas fall to communism shocked americans.
to make matters worse in september 1949 the soviet union announced that it had successfully tested its first atomic weapon.
then early in 1950 the peoples republic of china and the soviet union signed a treaty of friendship and alliance.
many western leaders feared that china and the soviet union would support communis revolutions in other nations.
the united states kept formal diplomatic relations with only the nationalist chinese in taiwan.
it used its veto power in the un securi council to keep representatives of the new communist peoples republic of china out of the un allowing the nationalists to retain their seat.
new policies in japan the chinese revolution brought about a significant change in american policy toward japan.
at the end of world war ii general douglas macarthur had taken charge of occupied japan.
his mission was to introduce democracy and keep japan from threatening war again.
once the united states lost china as its chief ally in asia it adopted policies to encourage the rapid recovery of japans industrial economy.
just as the united states viewed west germany as the key to defending all of europe against communism it saw japan as the key to defending asia.

the soviets provided military aid to the north koreans who quickly built an army.
on june 25 1950 north korean troops invaded the south driving back the poorly equipped south korean forces.
truman saw the communist invasion of south korea as a test of the containment policy and ordered american naval and air power into actit he then called on the united nations to act.

truman then gave the order to pursue the north koreans beyond the 38th parallel.
macarthur pushed the north koreans north to the yalu river the border with china.

he asked for a blockade of chinese ports the use of chiang kai sheks nationalist forces and the bombing of chinese cities with atomic weapons.
truman fires macarthur president truman refused macarthurs demands because he did not want to expand the war into china or to use the atomic bomb.
macarthur persisted publicly criticizing the president and arguing that it was a mistake to keep the war limited.
there is no substitute for victory macarthur insisted by which he meant that if the united states was going to go to war it should use all of its power to win.
a limited war was a form of appeasement he argued and appeasement begets new and bloodier war determined to maintain control of policy and show that he commanded the military an exasperated truman fired macarthur for insubordination in april 1951.
later in private conversation truman explained i was sorry to have to reach a parting of the way with the big man in asia but he asked for it and i had to give it to him macarthur who remained popular despite being fired returned home to parades and a heros welcome.
many americans criticized the president.
congress and military leaders however supported his decision and his korean strategy.
american policy in asia remained committed to limited war a war fought to achieve a limited objective such as containing communism.

a new red scare guiding question how did the post world war ii red scare compare and contrast with tht one that followed world war i.
during the 1950s rumors and accusations spawned fears that communists were trying to take over the world.
the red scare beg in september 1945 when a clerk named igor gouzenko walked out of the soviet embassy in ottawa canada and defected.
gouzenko carried documents showing a soviet effort to infiltrate government agencies in canada and the united states with the specific goal of obtaining information about the atomic bomb.
the case stunned americans.
it implied that spies had infiltrated the american government.
soon the search for spies escalated into a general fear of communist subversion or effort to weaken a society and overthrow its government.
thetruman loyalty review program in early 1947 president truman established a loyalty review progr to screen all federal employees.
trumans action seemed to confirm suspicions that communists had infiltrated the government and so added to fears that communism was sweeping the nation.
between 1947 and 1951 more than six million federal employees were screen for loyalty a term difficult to define.
a person might become a suspect for reading certain books belonging to various groups traveling overseas or seeing certain foreign films.
the federal bureau of investigation fbi scrutinized some 14 000 people.
aboi 2 000 quit their jobs many under pressure.
another 212 were fire for questionable loyalty despite a lack of actual evidence.
410 huac and anti communist investigations fbi director j edgar hoover remained unsatisfied.
in 1947 he went before the house un american activities committee huac.
formed in 1938 to investigate subversive activities in the united states huac had been a minor committee before hoover s involvement.
he urged huac to hold public hearings on communist subversion to expose not just communists but also communist sympathizers and fellow travelers under hoover s leadership the fbi sent agents to infiltrate groups suspected of subversion and wiretapped thousands of telephones.
hollywood on trial one of huac s first hearings in 1947 focused on the film industry as a cultural force that communists might manipulate to spread their ideas and influence.
future american president ronald reagan was head of the screen actors guild at the time and when called before huac he testified that there were communists in hollywood.
during the hearings ten screenwriters known as the hollywood ten used their fifth amendment right to protect themselves from self incrimination and refused to testify.
the incident led producers to blacklist or agree not to hire anyone who was believed to be a communist or who refused to cooperate with the committee.
the blacklist created an atmosphere of distrust and fear.
alger hiss in 1948 whittaker chambers a magazine editor and former communist party member told huac that several government officials were also former communists or spies.
one official chambers named was alger hiss a diplomat who had served in roosevelts administration attended the yalta conference and helped organize the united nations.
hiss sued chambers for libel but chambers testified that in 1937 and 1938 hiss had given him secret state department documents.
hiss denied being either a spy or a member of the communist party and he also denied ever having known chambers.
the committee was ready to drop the investigation until california representative richard nixon convinced his colleagues to continue the hearings to determine who had lied.
chambers produced copies of secret documents along with microfilm that he had hidden in a hollow pumpkin.
these pumpkin papers chambers claimed proved hiss was lying.
a jury agreed and convicted hiss of perjury or lying under oath.
the rosen bergs another spy case centered on accusations that american communists had sold secrets about the atomic bomb to the soviets to help them produce a bomb in 1949.
in 1950 the hunt for spies led the fbi to arrest julius and ethel rosenberg a new york couple who were members of the communist party.
the government charged them with spying for the soviets.
the rosenbergs denied the charges but were condemned to death for espionage.
many people believed that they were simply victims caught in the wave of anti communist frenzy.
appeals and pleas for clemency failed however and the rosenbergs were executed in june 1953.
project venona in 1946 american and british cryptographers working for a project code named venona cracked the soviet unions spy code enabling them to read approximately 3 000 messages between moscow and the united states collected during the cold war.
these messages confirmed extensive soviet spying and ongoing efforts to steal nuclear secrets.
the government did not reveal project venonas existence until 1995.
the venona documents provided strong evidence that the rosenbergs were indeed guilty.

critical thinking drawing conclusions why were people suspicious of oppenheimer.
biography joseph mccarthy 1908 1957 when wisconsin politician joseph mccarthy first ran for senate in 1946 he claimed his opponent was communistically inclined.
his later accusations of communist subversion made him a national figure.
between 1950 and 1954 mccarthy made headlines for his investigations of government departments and figures despite his inability to build a solid case against anyone.
his often wild accusations became the hallmark ofmccarthyism.
the red scare spreads many state and local governments universities businesses unions churches and private groups also began efforts to find communists.
the university of california required its faculty to take loyalty oaths and fired 157 who refused.
many catholic groups became anti communist and urged members to identify communists within the church.
the taft hartley act of 1947 required union leaders to take oaths saying that they were not communists.
many union leaders did not object.
instead they launched efforts to purge their own organizations eventually expelling 11 unions that refused to remove communist leaders.
h reading progress check comparing and contrasting what was one way that the red scare of the 1950s ant the red scare ofthe 1920s were similar.
mccarthyism guidingquestion why did many americans believe senator mccarthy s accusations.
in 1949 the red scare intensified as the soviet union successfully tested an atomic bomb and china fell to communism.
to many americans these events seemed to prove that the united states was losing the cold war.
in february 1950 little known senator joseph r mccarthy gave a speech to a republican womens group in west virginia.
halfway through his speech mccarthy made a surprising statement when he claimed primarysource critical thinking identifying central ideas what was the larger threat behind allowing mccarthyism to spread.
m while i cannot take the time to name all the men in the state department who have been named a members ofthe communist party and members of a spy ring i have here in my hand a list of 205 that were known to the secretary of state as being members ofthe communist party and who nevertheles are still working and shaping the policy ofthe state department 99 quoted in the fifties 1 the associated press sent the statement nationwide.
reporters at an airport asked mccarthy to see his list.
mccarthy replied that he would be happy to show it to them but unfortunately it was in his bag on the plane.
in fact the list never appeared.
mccarthy however continued making charges.
mccarthy proclaimed that communists were a danger at home and abroad.
he distributed a booklet accusing democratic party leaders of corruption and of protecting communists.
mccarthy often targeted secretary of state dean acheson calling him incompetent and a tool of stalin.
he also accused george c marshall former army chief of staff and secretary of state of disloyalty.
the prevailing anxiety about communism made many americans willing to accept mccarthys claims.
the mccarran act in 1950 with mccarthy and others arousing fears of communist spies congress passed the internal security act also called the mccarran act.
the act made it illegal to attempt to establish a totalitarian government ir the united states and required all communist related organizations to publish their records and register with the united states attorney general.
communists could not have passports and in cases of a national emergency could be arrested and detained.
unwilling to punish people fi their opinions truman vetoed the bill but congress easily overrode his veto in 1950.
later supreme court cases limited the acts scope.
412 mccarthy s rise and fall in 1953 mccarthy became chairman of the senate subcommittee on investigations which forced government officials to testify about alleged communist influences.
investigations became witch hunts searches for disloyalty based on weak evidence and irrational fears.
mccarthys tactic of damaging reputations with vague unfounded charges became known as mccarthyism.
mccarthy s sensational accusations put him in the headlines and the press quoted him often and widely.
he badgered witnesses and then refused to accept their answers.
his tactics left a cloud of suspicion that he and others interpreted as guilt.
people were afraid to challenge him.
in 1954 mccarthy began to look for soviet spies in the united states army during weeks of televised hearings millions of americans watched mccarthy question and bully officers harassing them about trivial details and accusing them of misconduct.
his popular support began to fade.
finally to strike back at the armys lawyer joseph welch mccarthy brought up the past of a young lawyer in welchs firm who had been a member of a communist front organization while in law school.
welch who was fully aware of the young mans past exploded at mccarthy for possibly ruining the young mans career until this moment i think i never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.
you have done enough.
have you no sense of decency sir at long last.
have you left no sense of decency spectators cheered.
welch had said what many americans had been thinking.
later that year the senate passed a vote of censure or formal disapproval against mccarthy.
although he remained in the senate mccarthy had lost all influence.
he died in 1957.

life during the early cold war guiding question how did fears of nuclear war affect american society.
the red scare and the spread of nuclear weapons had a profound impact on american life in the 1950s.
fears of communism and war affected both ordinary americans and government leaders.
1 facing the bomb i americans were shocked when the soviets successfully tested the more powerful hydrogen bomb or h bomb in 1953.
the united states had tested i its own h bomb less than a year earlier.
americans prepared for a surprise analyzing supreme court cases watkins v united states 1957 in 1954 labor organizer john watkins testified before huac.
he agreed to discuss his connections with the communist party and to identify people who were still members but refused to talk about those who were no longer members.
watkins received a misdemeanor conviction for refusing to answer questions pertinent to the question under inquiry in 1957 he appealed his case to the supreme court.
in a 6 to l decision the supreme court held that the activities of huac during its investigations were beyond the scope of the stated aims of the committee as well as the authority of congressional powers.
defending what argument would you make in support of john watkins s position.
some americans invested in personal bomb shelters stocked with food believing it would allow them to survive a bomb blast.

schools created bomb shelters and held bomb drills to teach students to duck and cover to protect themselves from a nuclear bomb blast although duck and cover might have made people feel safer it would not have protected them from nuclear radiation.
experts have note that for every person killed outright by a nuclear blast four more would die later from fallout the radiation left over after a blast.
to protect themselves some families built backyard fallout shelters.
popular culture in the cold war as worries about nuclear war and communist infiltration filled the public imagination cold war themes soon appeared in films plays television tl titles of dance tunes and popular fiction.
matt cvetic an fbi undercover informant who secretly infiltrated the communist party captivated readei with reports in the saturday evening post in 1950.
his story was later mad into the movie i was a communist for the fbi 1951.
another film walke on beacon 1952 features the fbis activities in a spy case.
in 1953 arthui millers thinly veiled criticism of the communist witch hunts the crucib appeared on broadway.
the play remains popular today as a cautionary tale about how hysteria can lead to false accusations.
in 1953 a weekly television series i led three lives about an undercover fbi counterspy who was also a communist party official debuted.
popular tunes such as atomic boogie and atom bomb baby played on the radio.
the next year author philip wylie published tomorrow a novel describing the horrific effects of nuclear war on an unprepared american city.
wylie wrote his novel to educate the public about the horrors of atomic war.
one of the most famous and enduring works of this period is john herseys nonfiction book hiroshima.
originally published as the august h edition of the new yorker magazine the book provides six firsthand accou of the united states dropping the atomic bomb on hiroshima japan.
not only did it make some americans question the use of the bomb but hiroshima also underscored the real personal horrors of a nuclear attack.
at the same time the country was enjoying postwar prosperity and optimism.
that spirit combined with mccarthyism fears of communist infiltration and the threat of atomic attack made the early 1950s a time c contrasts.

guiding question how were the policies of massive retaliation and brinkmanship different from previous military policies.
by the end of 1952 many americans were ready for a change in leadership.
the cold war had much to do with that attitude.
many people believed that trumans foreign policy was not working.
the soviet union had tested an atomic bomb and consolidated its hold on eastern europe.
china had fallen to communism and american troops were fighting in korea.
tired of the criticism and uncertain he could win truman decided not to run again.
the democrats nominated adlai stevenson governor of illinois.
the republicans chose dwight d eisenhower the general who had organized the d day invasion.
stevenson had little chance against a national hero who had helped win world war ii.
americans wanted someone they could trust to lead the nation in the cold war.
eisenhower won in a landslide.
more bang for the buck the cold war shaped eisenhowers thinking from the moment he took office.
he was convinced that the key to victory was not simply military might but also a strong economy.
the united states had to show the world that the free enterprise system could produce a better society than communism.
at the same time economic prosperity would prevent communists from gaining support in the united states and protect society from subversion.
as a professional soldier eisenhower knew the costs associated with large scale conventional war.
preparing for that kind of warfare he believed was too expensive.
we cannot defend the the cold war begins 415 4 in 1955 the u s air force unveiled the huge b 52 bomber which could fly across continents to drop nuclear bombs.

massive retaliation a policy of threatening a massive response including the use of nuclear weapons against a communist state trying to seize a peaceful state by force ibff texas essential knowledge and skills a 2d explain the significance of the following years as turning points 1898 spanish american war 1914 1918 world war i 1929 the great depression begins 1939 1945 world war ii 1957 sputnik launch ignites u s soviet space race 1968 1969 martin luther king jr assassination and u s lands on the moon 1991 cold war ends 2001 terrorist attacks on world trade center and the pentagon and 2008 election of first black president barack obama 8d explain reasons and outcomes for u s involvement in foreign countries and their relationship to the domino theory including the vietnam war 17c describe the economic impact of defense spending on the business cycle and education priorities from 1945 to the 1990s 27b explain how specific needs result in scientific discoveries and technological innovations in agriculture the military and medicine including vaccines nation in a way which will exhaust our economy the president declare instead of maintaining a large and expensive army the nation must be prepared to use atomic weapons in all forms nuclear weapons he said gave more bang for the buck the korean war had convinced eisenhower that the united states could not contain communism by fighting a series of small wars.
such were unpopular and too expensive.
instead wars had to be prevented the first place.
the best way to do that seemed to be to threaten to use nuclear weapons.
this policy came to be called massive retaliation.
eisenhower s emphasis on nuclear weapons required new technoloj deliver them.
the president wanted to make sure that the united states could wage nuclear war even if the soviets destroyed american bases ii europe or asia.
this required technology that would allow the u s to the ussr without needing bases overseas.
at the same time american forces had to be very difficult to destroy in one attack.
if massive retali was to be an effective strategy american nuclear weapons had to be deployed in a way that an enemy could not eliminate them all at once i surprise attack.
for this reason the united states began to build what1 later be referred to as the nuclear triad a three part system made up ol range bombers land based missiles and missile carrying submarines.
in 1955 the u s air force unveiled the first part of the triad the hu b 52 bomber which could fly across continents to drop nuclear bombs b 52 is still in use today.
but because bombers could be shot down eisenhower also approved the development of intercontinental ballisti missiles icbms that could reach anywhere in the world in less than 30 minutes.
the atlas missile was the first american icbm.
it was als to launch the first seven u s astronauts in the early 1960s.
a modified version of the atlas is still used today to launch satellites.
for the third part of the triad eisenhower also began a program t submarines capable of launching nuclear missiles from underwater.
tl polaris submarine was the first submarine ever built to launch long ra missiles.
the first polaris submarine was deployed in 1960 and carriec 16 nuclear missiles.
the new policy enabled eisenhower to cut military spending fror around 50 billion to about 34 billion by reducing the size of the an w ich was expensive to maintain.
he then increased the u s nuclear arsenal from about 1 000 bombs in 1953 to about 18 000 bombs in 15 416 one result of the decision to focus on massive retaliation was the emergence of a new arms race.
the united states and the soviet union began to compete in the development of missiles and bombers and steadily expanded the size and power of their nuclear arsenal.
brinkmanship president eisenhower s willingness to threaten nuclear war to maintain peace worried some people.
critics called this brinkmanship the willingness to go to the brink of war to force the other side to back down and argued that it was too dangerous.
during several crises however president eisenhower felt compelled to threaten nuclear war.
the taiwan crisis shortly after the korean war ended a new crisis erupted in asia.
although communists had taken power in mainland china chinese nationalists still controlled taiwan and several small islands along chinas coast.
in the fall of 1954 china threatened to seize two of the islands.
eisenhower saw taiwan as part of the anti communist barrier in asia that needed to be protected at all costs.
when china began shelling the islands and announced that taiwan would be liberated eisenhower asked congress to authorize the use of force to defend taiwan.
he then warned that an attack on taiwan would be resisted by u s naval forces and hinted that they would use nuclear weapons to stop an invasion.
soon afterward china backed down.
the suez crisis the following year a serious crisis erupted in the middle east.
eisenhower wanted to prevent arab nations from aligning with the soviet union.
to build support among arabs secretary of state dulles offered to help egypt finance the construction of a dam on the nile river.
the deal ran into trouble in congress however because egypt had bought weapons from communist czechoslovakia.
dulles was forced to withdraw the offer.
a week later egyptian troops seized control of the suez canal from the anglo french company that had controlled it.
the egyptians intended to use the canals profits to pay for the dam.
in october 1956 british and french troops invaded egypt.
eisenhower was furious with britain and france.
the situation became even more dangerous when the soviet union threatened rocket attacks on britain and france and offered to send troops to help egypt.
eisenhower immediately put u s nuclear forces on alert noting if those fellows start something we may have to hit em and if necessary with everything in the bucket pressured by the united states the british and french called off the invasion.
the soviet union had won a major diplomatic victory by supporting egypt.
soon other arab nations began accepting soviet aid.
analyzing primary sources secretary of state dulles on brinkmanship you have to take chances for peace just as you must take chances in war.
some say that we were brought to the verge of war.
of course we were brought to the verge of war.
the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art.
if you try to run away from it if you are scared to go to the brink you are lost.
weve had to look it square in the face we walked to the brink and we looked it in the face.
we took strong action.
john foster dulles quoted in rise to globalism dbq analyzing primary sources why did dulles believe that brinkmanship strengthened u s foreign policy.
brinkmanship the practice of pushing a dangerous situation to the limit to force an opponent to backdown an atlas rocket lifts off carrying a payload to orbit.
the atlas missile was the first american intercontinental ballistic missile icbm.
first developed in the 1950s intercontinental ballistic missiles can deliver a nuclear warhead to any target in the world in less than 30 minutes.
the atlas rocket is still used today to launch satellites into orbit.

covert not openly shown or engaged in secret developing nation a nation whose economy is primarily agricultural b reading progress check contrasting how did eisenhower s military policies contrast with those oftrume covert operations guiding question why did president eisenhower want to use covert operations tocombat the spread of communism.
president eisenhower relied on brinkmanship on several occasions but hi knew it could not work in all situations.
it could prevent war but it could not prevent communists from staging revolutions within countries.
to d this eisenhower decided to use covert or hidden operations conducted the central intelligence agency cia.
many of the cias operations took place in developing nations nations with primarily agricultural economies.
many of these countries blamed european imperialism and american capitalism for their problen their leaders looked to the soviet union as a model of how to industriali their countries.
they often threatened to nationalize or put under government control foreign businesses operating in their countries.
one way to stop developing nations from moving into the communis camp was to provide them with financial aid as eisenhower had tried to in egypt.
in some cases however in which the threat of communism seemed stronger the cia ran covert operations to overthrow anti ameri leaders and replace them with pro american leaders.
iran and guatemala two examples of covert operations that achieved american objectives toi place in iran and guatemala.
by 1953 iranian prime minister mohamme mossadegh had nationalized the anglo iranian oil company.

the cold war begins 421 j l i p u i i understanding how historians interpret the past why learn this skill.
as you have read about the history of the united states you probably have realized that j historians do not always agree about why things happened or agree about how events affected things that happened later.
when you study history it is easy to become confused unless you have some idea of how historians interpret the past and the different approaches they use.
learning the skill i the study of how historians approach history is called historiography.
it is in some ways the history of historians and their different approaches to interpreting the past.
one of the important things to understand is that how people view history changes over time.
this happens for several reasons.
sometimes an event has to happen before people realize a past event was important and needs to be studied.
historical interpretations also change over time because new information becomes available.
for example a country may open its archives.
another reason interpretations change over time is because historians look at different kinds of evidence.
there are three big questions for historians.
the first is causation historians want to explain why something happened or why people made certain choices.
the second issue is outcome historians want to explain what happened because of an event or choices people made.
the third issue is meaning historians want to explain why a historical event matters.
there are several approaches historians take to answer these questions.
the first is sometimes called intentionalism or volitionalism.
it has also been nicknamed the great man approach to history.
it focuses on leaders especially political leaders.
it looks at who made key choices and tries to figure out why they made those choices.
a second approach to history is structuralis a structural approach looks at the way things are organized the rules and structures of the political system the economy and society.
for example instead of focusing on a president am his goals ambitions and choices a structural might look at how the constitution structures the president s role and forces him to make certain choices and limits his ability to make other choices.
a third approach to history is intellectualisi intellectual historians assume that ideas are tl most important cause of things.
they look at ideas ideology culture and people s perceptions so as to understand what happen as you might expect these three approacl can lead to very different histories of the same event.
and within these approaches historian narrow their emphasis even further.
some structuralists for example emphasize the role the economy alone or the role of social classej others focus just on the political system.
amc intellectual historians some focus on ideology while others stress the role of culture.
practicing the skill read the following paragraphs and then answer the questions that follow about interpreting the causes of the cold war.
over the years there have been many differeni arguments put forward for why the cold war beg historians have suggested roosevelt made mistah yalta and did not stand up to stalin soon enough some think truman was too aggressive and unwil to compromise.
some argue that stalin was authoritarian and paranoid and determined to cor everything he could.
others have suggested stalir was a committed communist and determined to dt everything he could to spread communism into europe.
some have suggested the cold war was partly churchill s responsibility.
they suggest br maneuvered the united states into taking over britain s role of balancing power in europe so as j protect the british empire.
422 historians have also argued that american capitalism and its desire for overseas markets led to the clash with the soviets.
others think the fundamental clash was between a democratic republic based on individual rights versus a totalitarian communist system.
another group of historians point out that the russians knew their history of being invaded from the west and just wanted a buffer zone on their border to protect themselves.
others think the american military was determined to avoid another pearl harbor and pushed for alliances and overseas bases to make sure america remained safe.
in which theories above are historians practicing a volitional or intentionalist approach to the cold war.
what would a structuralist emphasize in trying to understand the causes of the cold war.
what theories about the cold war would intellectual historians favor.

the origins of the movement guidingquestion what techniques did the civil rights movement useto challenge segregatioi on december 1 1955 rosa parks left her job as a seamstress in montgomery alabama and boarded a bus to go home.
in 1955 buses in montgomery reserved seats in the front for whites and seats in the rear for african americans.
seats in the middle were available to african americans only if there were few whites on the bus.
parks took a seat just behind the white section and soon all ol the seats on the bus were filled.
when the driver noticed a white man standing he told parks and three other african americans in her row to get up so the white man could sit down.
when parks did not move the driver called the police.
news of parkss arrest reached the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp which asked parks whether her case could be used to challenge segregation.
parks replied if you think it will mean something to montgomery and do some good ill be happy to go along with it parkss decision would spark a new era in the civil rights movement.
the struggle would not be easy.
in 1896 the supreme court had declared segregation to be constitutional in plessy v ferguson which established the separate but equal doctrine.
laws that segregated african americans were permitted as long as equal facilities were provided.
the facilities provided for africa americans however were usually of poorer quality than those provided for whites.
areas without laws requiring segregation often had de facto segregation segregation by custom and tradition.
472 court challenges begin aw pp movement had been building for a long time.
since 1909 6 a supported court cases aimed at overturning segregation.
over the years the naacp had achieved some victories.
in 1935 for example the supreme court ruled in norris v alabama that exclusion of african americans from juries violated their rights to equal protection under the law.
new political power african americans also enjoyed increased political power.
northern politicians increasingly sought their votes and listened to their concerns.
during the 1930s many african americans benefited from new deal programs and began supporting the democratic party.
this gave the party new strength in the north.
the northern wing of the party was now able to counter southern democrats who often supported segregation.
the push for desegregation during world war ii african american leaders began to use their political power to help end discrimination in wartime factories.
they also increased opportunities for african americans in the military.
in 1942 james farmer and george houser founded the congress of racial equality core in chicago.

they all dealt with the question of whether the principle separate but equal established in plessy v ferguson was constitutional with regard to public schools.
how the court ruled in a unanimous decision in 1954 the court ruled in favor of linda brown and the other plaintiffs.
in doing so it overruled plessy v ferguson.
it rejected the idea that equivalent but separate schools for african american and white students were constitutional.
the court held that racial segregation in public schools violated the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause.
chief justice earl warren summed up the courts decision declaring i n the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.
separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.
the court s rejection of separate but equal was a major victory for the civil rights movement.
it led to the overturning of laws requiring segregation in other public places.

brown v board of education after world war ii the naacp continued to challenge segregation in th courts.
from 1939 to 1961 the naacps chief counsel and director of its legal defense and educational fund was african american attorney thurgood marshall.
after the war marshall focused his efforts on ending segregation in public schools.
in 1954 the supreme court decided to combine several cases and isst general ruling on segregation in schools.
one of the cases involved a youi african american girl named linda brown who was denied admission t her neighborhood school in topeka kansas because of her race.
she was told to attend an all black school across town.
with the help of the naa her parents sued the topeka school board.

southern resistance the brown decision marked a dramatic reversal of the precedent establisl in the plessy v ferguson case in 1896.
brown v board of education applies only to public schools but the ruling threatened the entire system of segregation.
although it convinced many african americans that the tirr had come to challenge segregation it also angered many white southerm some became even more determined to defend segregation regardless of what the supreme court ruled.

the supreme court inadvertently encouraged white resistance when followed up its decision in brown v board of education a year later.
the court ordered school districts to proceed with all deliberate speed to e school segregation.
the wording was vague enough that many districts were able to keep their schools segregated for many more years.

the civil rights movement 475 eisenhower responds guiding question how did president eisenhower respond to the civil rights movement.
president eisenhower sympathized with the civil rights movement yet he feared the possible effect of a court ruling overturning segregation.
following the precedent set by president truman he ordered navy shipyards and veterans hospitals to desegregate.
at the same time eisenhower disagreed with using protests and court rulings.
he believed segregation and racism would end gradually as values changed.
with the nation in the midst of the cold war he worried that challenging white southerners might divide the nation.
publicly he refused to endorse the brown v board of education decision remarking i dont believe you car change the hearts of men with laws or decisions regardless eisenhowei knew he had to uphold the authority of the federal government.
as a result he became the first president since reconstruction to send troops into the south to protect the rights of african americans.

he ordered troops from the arkansas national guard to prevent the nine students from entering the school the national guard troops surrounded the school an angry white mob gathered to intimidate students.
faubus had used the armed forces of a state to oppose the federal government the first such challenge to the constitution since the civil war.
eisenhower knew that he could not allow faubus to defy the federal government.
after a conference between eisenhower and faubus proved fruitless the district court ordered the governor to remove the troops.
instead of ending the crisis however faubus simply left the school to tl mob.
after the african american students entered the building angry whites beat at least two african american reporters and broke many windows.
the violence finally convinced president eisenhower th he had to act.
federal authority had to be upheld.
he immediately ordered the u s army to send troops to little rock and federalized the arkansas national guard.
by nightfall more th 1 000 soldiers of the 101st airborne division had arrived.

senate majority leader democrat lyndon johnson however put together a compromise that enabled the act to pass.
although its final form was much weaker than originally intended the act still brought the power of the federal government into the civil rights debate.
it created a civil rights division within the department of justice and gave it the authority to seek court injunctions against anyone interfering with the right to vote.
it also created the united states commission on civil rights to investigate any denial of voting rights.

watching the events from the white house president johnson became furious.
eight days later j he appeared before a nationally televised joint session of congress to propose a new voting rights law.
the civil rights movement 485 the voting rights act of 1965 on august 3 1965 the house of representatives passed the voting rights bill by a wide margin.
the following day the senate also passed the bill.
the voting rights act of 1965 authorized the u s attorney general to sen federal examiners to register qualified voters bypassing local officials whi often refused to register african americans.
the law also suspended discriminatory devices such as literacy tests in counties where less than half of all adults had been registered to vote.
the results were dramatic.
by the end of the year almost 250 000 african americans had registered as new voters.
the number of african american elected officials in the south also increased.
in 1960 for examf no african american from the south held a seat in the u s congress.
by 2011 there were 44 african american members of congress.
the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 marked a turning point the civil rights movement.
the movement had now achieved two major legislative goals.
segregation had been outlawed and new federal laws were in place to prevent discrimination and protect voting rights.
after 1965 the movement began to shift its focus.
it turned its attention to the problems of african americans trapped in poverty and living in ghettos many of the nations major cities.
the voting rights act of 1965 like the civil rights act of 1964 immediately raised constitutional questions.
historically each state had been allowed to set the rules regarding eligibility to vote.
article 1 sectio of the constitution only specifies that each state has to use the same rule for choosing members of congress as it uses for choosing members of it.
state legislature.
article 2 section 1 specifies that each state gets to choos how to select the electors who vote for the president.
by banning literacy tests congress was imposing a rule on voting and it was unclear whethi this violated the rights of the states to set voting rules.
in 1966 in katzenbach v morgan the supreme court ruled that the 14th amendm gave congress the authority to ban literacy tests and impose voting rule the state governments.

it matters because by the mid 1960s much progress had been made in the area of civil rights.
however leaders of the movement began to understand that merely winning political rights for african americans would not completely solve their economic problems.
african american leaders would continue to try to end economic inequality.
urban problems guiding question why did riots break out in dozens of u s cities in the late 1960s.
despite the passage of civil rights laws in the 1950s and 1960s racism was still common in american society.
changing the law could not change peoples attitudes nor did it end urban poverty.
in 1965 approximately 70 percent of african americans lived in large cities.
even if african americans had been allowed to move into white neighborhoods many were stuck in low paying jobs with little chance of advancement.
in 1960 only 15 percent of african americans held professional managerial or clerical jobs compared to 44 percent of whites.
the average income of african american families was only 55 percent of that of the average income for white families.
almost half of african americans lived in poverty with an unemployment rate typically twice that of whites.
poor neighborhoods in the nations major cities were overcrowded and dirty leading to higher rates of illness and infant mortality.
juvenile delinquency rates rose as did the rate of young people dropping out of school.
complicating matters even more was a rise in the number of single parent households.
the watts riot just five days after president johnson signed the voting rights act a riot erupted in watts an african american neighborhood in los angeles.
allegations of police brutality served as the catalyst for this uprising.
it lasted for six days and required more than 14 000 members of the national guard and 1 500 law officers to restore the civil rights movement 487 racism prejudice or discrimination against a person because of his or her race continued from p 487 tob texas essential knowledge and skills 9a trace the historical development of the civil rights movement in the 19th 20th and 21st centuries including the 13th 14th 15th and 19th amendments 9b describe the roles of political organizations that promoted civil rights including ones from african american chicano american indian womens and other civil rights movements 9c identify the roles of significant leaders who supported various rights movements including martin luther king jr cesar chavez rosa parks hector p garcia and betty friedan 9d compare and contrast the approach taken by some civil rights groups such as the black panthers with the nonviolent approach of martin luther king jr 26a explain actions taken by people to expand economic opportunities and political rights including those for racial ethnic and religious minorities as well as women in american society order.
riots broke out in dozens of other american cities between 1964 anc 1968.
in detroit burning looting and conflicts with police and the national guard resulted in 43 deaths and more than 1 000 wounded in 1967.
property loss was estimated at almost 200 million.
the kerner commission in the same year president johnson appointed the national advisory commission on civil disorders headed by governor otto kerner of illinois to study the causes of the urban riots and to make recommendations.
the kerner commission as it became known blamed racism for most inner city problems.
our nation is moving toward two societies one black one white separate and unequal it concluded.
the commission recommended the creation of inner city jobs and the construction of new public housing but with the spending for the vietnar war johnson never endorsed the recommendations of the commission.
the shift to economic rights in the mid 1960s dr martin luther king jr decided to focus on the economic problems that african americans faced.
to call attention to deplorable housing conditions dr king and his wife coretta moved into a slum apartment in an african american neighborhood in chicago.
he and the sclc hoped to improve the economic status of african americans in poor neighborhoods.
the chicago movement however made little headway.
when dr king led a march through the all white suburb of marquette park to demonstrat the need for open housing he was met by angry white mobs more hostile than those in birmingham and selma.
mayor richard j daley met with dr king and discussed a new program to clean up the slums.
associations o realtors and bankers also agreed to promote open housing.

stokely carmichael 1941 1998 stokely carmichael was the founder of the 1960s black power movement.
as a freedom rider he traveled to the south to ride on buses in protest of interstate transportation segregation laws.
in 1964 carmichael traveled to alabama where he organized an independent political party called the lowndes county freedom organization.
the organization s symbol was a black panther.
in 1966 he first spoke of a new black power movement which both promoted african american pride and advocated the necessity of self defense in violent situations.
eventually carmichael relocated to guinea west africa where he changed his name to kwame ture.
he died of cancer in guinea in 1998.
malcolm x 1925 1965 malcolm x was one of the most controversial black activists of the mid twentieth century.
he converted to the nation of islam while imprisoned in the 1940s.
paroled in 1952 he became an anti white muslim activist calling himself malcolm x.
distancing himself from the nation of islam he created his own group called the organization of afro american unity.
during a pilgrimage he began to rethink his social policies.
he decided that white people were not inherently evil and that african americans could enact change through traditional means.
malcolm x s new viewpoints drew harsh criticism from the nation of islam.
on february 21 1965 three african american gunmen assassinated him.
black power guidingquestion why did many young african americans join the black power movement.
dr kings lack of progress in chicago seemed to show that nonviolent protests could do little to solve economic problems.
after 1965 many african americans especially urban young people began to turn away from king.
some leaders called for more aggressive forms of protest.
some organizations including core and sncc believed that african americans alone should lead their struggle.
many young african americans called for black power a term that had many meanings.
a few including robert f williams and h rap brown interpreted black power to mean that physical self defense was acceptable.
to most including stokely carmichael the leader of sncc in 1966 the term meant that african americans should control the social political and economic direction of their struggle black power the mobilization of the political and economic power of african americans especially to compel respect for their rights and to improve their condition primary source mthis is the significance of black power as a slogan.
for once black people are going to use the words they want to use not just the words whites want to hear.
the need for psychological equality is the reason why sncc today believes that blacks must organize in the black community.
only black people can create in the community an aroused and continuing black consciousness.
from what we want the new york review of books september 1966 black power stressed pride in the african american cultural group.
it emphasized racial distinctiveness rather than adapting to the dominant culture.
african americans showed pride in their racial heritage by adopting new afro hairstyles and african style clothing.
many also took the civil rights movement 489 enforcement the act of urging or carrying out by force african names.
dr king and some other leaders criticized black power as philosophy of hopelessness and despair.
malcolm x by the early 1960s a young man named malcolm x had become a symb of the black power movement.
born malcolm little in omaha nebraska experienced a difficult childhood and adolescence.
in 1946 he was senttc prison for burglary.
prison transformed malcolm.
he educated himself ai played an active role in the prison debate society.
eventually he joined the nation of islam commonly known as the black muslims.
despite the name the nation of islam is very different fn mainstream islam.
the nation of islam preached black nationalism.
afte joining the nation of islam malcolm little changed his name to malcoln the x symbolized the family name of his enslaved african ancestors.
he declared that his true name had been stolen from him by slavery and he would no longer use the name white society had given him.
malcolm xs criticisms of white society and the mainstream civil rights movement gained national attention for the nation of islam.
by 1964 malcolm x had broken with the black muslims.
discouraged scandals involving the nation of islams leader he went to the muslim holy city of makkah mecca in saudi arabia.
after seeing muslims from mar races worshipping together he no longer promoted separatism.
after male x broke with the nation of islam he continued to criticize the organizati because of this organization members shot and killed him in february 1965.
malcolm xs speeches and ideas influenced a new generation of militant african american leaders who preached black power black nationalism and economic self sufficiency.
in 1966 in oakland califorr huey p newton and bobby seale organized the black panthers.
black panther leaders called for an end to racial oppression and for control of major institutions in the african american community such as schools enforcement housing and hospitals.
b reading progress check summarizing how did the black power movement lead african americans av from dr king s message of nonviolent disobedience and the goal of integral dr king is assassinated guidingquestion how did martin luther king jr s death affect the civil rights movement.
in march 1968 dr king went to memphis tennessee to support a strike c african american sanitation workers.
at the time the sclc had been planning a national poor peoples campaign to promote economic advancement for impoverished americans.
the purpose of this campaig was to lobby the federal government to commit billions of dollars to end poverty and unemployment in the united states.
people of all races and nationalities were to converge on washington d c where they would camp out until both congress and president johnson agreed to pass the requested legislation to fund the proposal.
on april 4 1968 as he stood on his hotel balcony in memphis dr kin was assassinated by a sniper.
in a speech the previous night he had told gathering at a local church ive been to the mountaintop ive looke over.
and i ve seen the promised land.
i may not get there with you but want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land 490 j dr kings death touched off both national mourning and riots in more than 100 cities including washington d c.
the reverend ralph abernathy who had served as a trusted assistant to dr king for many years led the poor peoples campaign in kings absence.
however the demonstration did not achieve any of the major objectives that either king or the sclc had hoped it would.
in the wake of dr kings death congress did pass the civil rights act of 1968.
this law sometimes known as the fair housing act of 1968 outlawed discrimination on the basis of race color religion or national origin when selling renting or financing housing.
in many communities across the nation racism had led to an informal segregation.
people would simply refuse to sell their homes or rent property to people based on their race.
sometime banks would not approve loans because of racist attitudes or assumptions that affected the thinking of the loan officers.
the civil rights act of 1968 put an end to these practices.
the law also benefited immigrants and religious minorities.
historically in many places in the united states jewish americans had encountered rules preventing them from buying or renting property in certain neighborhoods.
the civil rights act of 1968 expanded their economic opportunities as well.
the assassination of dr king in 1968 marked a turning point in the civil rights movement.
after his death the movement began to fragment.
with formal laws in place banning segregation and discrimination and guaranteeing voting rights the movement lost some of its unity of purpose and the vision he had given it.
the shift to economic rights was already underway at the time of his death and it was clear that the struggle to end poverty and provide more economic opportunity would be very difficult and would have to involve very different approaches than the movement had used in the past.

9a 9b 9c 9d the civil rights movement 491 j u k u t i t sequencing and reading a time line why learn this skill.
many people complain that history is just a bunch of dates they have to memorize.
in fact the relationship between events is what really matters to historians.
they want to explain what caused something to happen or how something affected something else over time.
history is a series of causes and effects that happen over time in a sequence.
unlike science where you can repeat an experiment in history everything happens once in a particular order.
if you want to know what caused something you have to know the sequence of events.
learning the skill sequencing is simply putting things in the correct order.
what came first.
what came next.
did an event happen before or after another event.
putting historical events in the correct 2c 29b sequence will often reveal a possible relationship between them.
historians then look at the historical evidence to see if they can prove that there is a cause and effect relationship in the sequence.
sequencing involves two types of chronology absolute chronology and relative chronology.
absolute chronology is when something happened.
generally we use a specific date and time to establish absolute chronology.
relative chronology tells when something happened compared to something else.
if you give the year president obama was first elected you are using absolute chronology.
if you are asked whether president reagan came before or after president clinton you use relative chronology to answer.
a very common way to present a sequence of related historical events and teach their relative and absolute chronology is to use a time line.
a time line is a kind of chart that can be key events of the civil rights movement 1954 1965 492 presented on a horizontal or vertical line.
it lists events that occurred between specific dates in order.
the number of years between these dates is called the time span.
for example a time line that begins in 1400 and ends in 1500 has a time span of 100 years.
time lines are usually divided into smaller segments or time intervals.
intervals can be vast each interval being an entire historical era or they can be small a year a month a day whatever is needed to sequence the events.
a time line is a visual aid it helps you remember the correct order of events and people and also the dates associated with them.
it often includes captions with each event giving a quick summary of what happened.
practicing this skill look at the time line on key events of the civil rights movement and then answer the questions that follow 1.
what is the time span of this time line.
what intervals is the time line using.
when did martin luther king deliver his i have a dream speech.
what major legislation was passed the year after the speech.
use the time line to put these people and events in the correct relative chronology freedom summer james farmer greensboro sit ins rosa parks 5.
what major event happened just before congress passed the voting rights act.
what relationship is there between the two events.
what possible cause and effect sequence does the time line show between court decisions protests and legislation.

then go to the lesson new approaches to civil rights in the chapter politics and economics 1968 1980.
create a time line sequencing the events of the civil rights movement from 1968 1980.

the truman doctrine came after world war ii had been concluded the fighting had stopped and international arrangements were in disarray.
it became very clear that the soviet union was going to grab as much real estate as possible in the aftermath of that great war.
thus the truman doctrine said in essence we will not allow a little country to be pushed around and be taken over by the communists.
somebody has to come to their rescue and we will do that.

the chinese had controlled the region for hundreds of years.
then from the late 1800s until world war ii the french ruled vietnam laos and cambodia a region then known as french indochina.
the growth of vietnamese nationalism by the early 1900s nationalism had become a powerful force in vietnam.
several political parties pushed for independence or for reform of french colonial rule.
among the leaders of the nationalist movement was nguyen that thanh better known by his assumed name ho chi minh.
after years in europe china and the soviet union he returned to southeast asia.
there he helped found the indochinese communist party in 1930 and worked for independence.
ho chi minhs activities forced him to flee indochina and spew several years in exile in the soviet union and china.
in 1941 he returned to vietnam.
by then japan had seized control of the country.
ho chi minh organized a nationalist group called the vietminh which united communists and non communists in the effort to expel the japanese.
soon afterward the united states began sending aid to the vietminh.
america aids the french when japan surrendered to the allies in 1945 it gave up control of indochina.
ho chi minh quickly declared vietnams independence.
france had no intention of losing its former colony however.
french troops returned to vietnam in 1946 and drove the vietminh into hiding 500 the vietminh fought back against the french dominated regime and slowly gained control of large areas of the country.
as the fighting escalated france appealed to the united states for help.
the request put american officials in a difficult position.
the united states opposed colonialism.
it had pressured the dutch to give up their empire in indonesia and supported the british decision to give india independence in 1947.
american officials however did not want vietnam to be communist.
chinas fall to communism and the outbreak of the korean war helped convince president truman to aid france.
president eisenhower continued trumans policy and defended his decision with what became known as the domino theory the idea that if vietnam fell to communism the rest of southeast asia would follow like a line of dominoes falling over.
domino theory the belief that if one nation in asia fell to the communists neighboring countries would follow defeat at dien bien phu despite aid from the united states the french continued to struggle against the vietminh who used hit and run and ambush tactics.
these are the tactics of guerrillas irregular troops who blend into the civilian population and are difficult for regular armies to fight.
rising casualties and a lack of victories made the war unpopular with the french public.
the turning point came in the mountain town of dien bien phu.
by seizing the town the french planned to cut the vietminhs supply lines and force them into open battle.
soon afterward a huge vietminh force surrounded dien bien phu and began bombarding the town.
on may 7 1954 the french forces fell to the vietminh.
the defeat convinced the french to make peace and withdraw from indochina.

goh dihn deh ehm held the south.
french troops soon left and the united states became the principal protector of the new government in south vietnam.

american involvement deepens guiding question how did american involvement in vietnam change during the kennedy and johnson administrations.
after ngo dinh diem refused to hold national elections ho chi minh and the communists began an armed struggle to reunify the nation.
they organized a new guerrilla army of south vietnamese communists which became known as the vietcong.
eisenhower sent hundreds of military advisers to train south vietnams army but the vietcong continued to grow more powerful because many vietnamese opposed diems government.
by 1961 the vietcong had established control over much of the countryside.
kennedy takes over when president kennedy took office in 1961 he continued to support south vietnam believing the country was vital in the battle against communism.
from 1961 to late 1963 the number of u s military personnel in south vietnam jumped from about 2 000 to around 15 000.
yet they failed to shore up the floundering diem regime.
for example the south vietnamese created special fortified villages known as strategic hamlets.
they then moved villagers to these hamlets despite the peasants resentment at being uprooted from their villages.
the program proved to be extremely unpopular.
the overthrow of diem american officials blamed diem.
he made himself even more unpopular by discriminating against buddhism one of the countrys most widely practiced religions.
in the spring of 1963 he banned the traditional religious flags for the buddhas birthday.
when buddhists protested in the streets diems police killec nine people.
in response a buddhist monk poured gasoline over his robes and set himself on fire the first of several to do so.
images of their self destruction horrified americans as they watched the footage on television news reports.
in august 1963 u s ambassador henry cabot lodge arrived in vietnam.
he learned that several vietnamese generals were plotting to overthrow the unpopular diem.
when lodge expressed u s sympathy for their cause the generals launched a military coup seizing power on november 1 1963.
they executed diem soon after.
despite his unpopularity diem had been a respecte nationalist.
after his death south vietnams government weakened.
johnson and vietnam just three weeks after diems death kennedy was assassinated.
the presidency and the growing problem of vietnam now belonged to ent lyndon b johnson.
although he approached vietnam cautiously 502 at first johnson wanted to keep the country from falling to the communists.
additionally some had blamed democrats when china became communist in 1949.
should the democrats lose vietnam johnson feared it might shatter my presidency kill my administration and damage our democracy on august 2 1964 johnson announced that north vietnamese torpedo boats had fired on two u s destroyers in the gulf of tonkin.
two days later he reported another attack.
insisting that these were unprovoked he ordered american aircraft to attack north vietnamese ships and naval facilities.
johnson then asked congress for the authority to defend american forces and allies in southeast asia.
congress readily agreed and on august 7 1964 it passed the gulf of tonkin resolution.
this authorized the president to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the united states and to prevent further aggression soon after the vietcong began to attack bases where american advisers were stationed in south vietnam.
after one particularly damaging attack johnson sent american aircraft to bomb north vietnam.
analyzing primary sources should america fight in vietnam.
as the war in vietnam dragged on americans became increasingly divided about the nation s role in the conflict.
in january 1966 george w ball delivered an address to indicate how we got into vietnam and why we must stay.
george f kennan a former ambassador to the soviet union argued that american involvement in vietnam was something we would not choose deliberately if the choice were ours to make all over again today.
yes u t he conflict in viet nam is a product of the great shifts and changes triggered by the second world war t he soviet union under stalin exploited the confusion to push out the perimeter of its power and influence in an effort to extend the outer limits of communist domination by force or the threat of force.
the bloody encounters in vietnam are thus in a real sense battles and skirmishes in a continuing war to prevent one communist power after another from violating internationally recognized boundary lines fixing the outer limits of communist dominion.
in the long run our hopes for the people of south viet nam reflect our hopes for people everywhere.
what we seek is a world living in peace and freedom from a speech delivered january 30 1966 george w ball undersecretary of state no vietnam is not a region of major military industrial importance e ven a situation in which south vietnam was controlled exclusively by the vietcong would not present in my opinion dangers great enough to justify our direct military intervention.
and to attempt to crush north vietnamese strength to a point where hanoi could no longer give any support for vietcong political activity in the south would have the effect of bringing in chinese forces at some point our motives are widely misinterpreted and the spectacle of americans inflicting grievous injury on the lives of a poor and helpless people produces reactions among millions of people throughout the world profoundly detrimental to the image we would like them to hold of this country from testimony before the senate foreign relations committee february 10 1966 george f kennan former diplomat dbq analyzing historical documents q identifying central ideas why does ball believe that the united states is justified in fighting in vietnam.

in may 1968 benavidez went to the aid of special forces team members who were wounded and surrounded unable to get to a helicopter.
benavidez ran 80 yards through enemy fire.
wounded three times in getting to the men he stayed with them some eight hours preparing an evacuation.
during that time he was wounded two more times.
while carrying men to the rescue helicopter he was attacked from behind but managed to kill his attacker in hand to hand combat.
only after loading all the dead and wounded did benavidez board the helicopter.
his actions saved the lives of at least eight other men.
both the american public and johnsons advisers generally supported these actions.
some officials disagreed however.
undersecretary of state george ball initially supported involvement in vietnam but later turned against it.
he warned that if the united states go.
too involved it would be difficult to get out.
once on the tigers back he warned we cannot be sure of picking the place to dismount.
other advisers such as national security advisor mcgeorge bundy believed that success in vietnam was important to protect american interests and maintain stability in southeast asia.
in a memo to the president he argued primary source the stakes in vietnam are extremely high.
the american investment is very large and american responsibility is a fact of life which is palpable in the atmosphere of asia and even elsewhere the international prestige of the u s and a substantial part of our influence are directly at risk in vietnam quoted in the best and the brightest 191 in march 1965 johnson again expanded american involvement by ordering a sustained bombing campaign against north vietnam.

a bloody stalemate guiding question what military tactics were used by the vietcong and how did american troops respond.
by the end of 1965 more than 180 000 u s combat troops were fighting in vietnam.
in 1966 that number doubled.
the u s military entered vietnam with great confidence.
america seemed omnipotent then wrote one ofth first marines to arrive philip caputo in his prologue to a rumor of war.
w saw ourselves as the champions of a cause that was destined to triumph lacking the firepower of the american forces the vietcong used ambushes booby traps and other guerrilla tactics.
these techniques could be greatly destructive.

nearby troopers t hold of the unconscious soldier and half carrying half dragging hin pulled him the rest of the way through the tangle.
m quoted in vietnam 4 history the vietcong also frustrated american troops by blending in with the general population and then quickly vanishing.
it was a sheer physical impossibil to keep the enemy from slipping away whenever he wished explained one american general.
search and destroy to counter these tactics american troops tried tc ind enemy troops bomb their positions destroy t eir supply lines and force them out into the of for combat.
american planes dropped napalm a jellied gasoline that explodes on contact.
they also used agent orange a chemical that strips leaves from trees and shrubs turning farmland and forest into wasteland.
american military leaders underestimated the vietcongs strength.
they also misjudged the enemys stamina and the support they had among the south vietnamese.
american generals believed that bombing and killing large numbers of vietcong would destroy their morale and lead them to surrender.
the guerrillas however had no intention of surrendering and they were willing to accept huge losses to achieve their goals.
the ho chi minh trail in the vietcongs war effort north vietnamese support was a major factor.
although the vietcong included many south vietnamese north vietnam provided arms advisers and leadership.
as vietcong casualties mounted north vietnam began sending north vietnamese army units to fight.
north vietnam sent arms and supplies south by way of a network of jungle paths known as the ho chi minh trail.
the trail wound through cambodia and laos bypassing the border between north vietnam and south vietnam.
north vietnam itself received weapons and other support from the soviet union and china.
johnson feared directly attacking north vietnam would bring china into the war as had happened in korea.
yet johnsons limits made winning the war very difficult.
instead of conquering territory american troops had to fight a war of attrition defeating enemy forces by wearing them down.
this strategy led troops to conduct grisly body counts after battles to determine how many enemy soldiers had been killed.
the american military began measuring progress in the war by the number of enemy dead.
bombing from american planes killed many thousands of vietnamese.
american soldiers were also dying in increasing numbers.
the notion of a quick and decisive victory grew increasingly remote.
as a result many citizens back home began to question the nations involvement in the war.

as the war dragged on however public support began to wane.
media accounts seemed to contradict government reports.
for example the american commander in south vietnam general william westmoreland reported that the enemys hopes are bankrupt and the end begins to come into view yet millions of people saw images of american casualties on television in their living rooms each day as vietnam became the first television war for many people a credibility gap had developed they had a hard time believing what the johnson administration said about the war.
congress which in the gulf of tonkin resolution had granted johnson a great deal of power to conduct the war began to seek greater involvement.
beginning in february 1966 the senate foreign relations committee held educational hearings on vietnam.
they called in policy makers and critics to discuss the administrations military strategy.
teach ins begin in march 1965 a group of faculty members and students at the university of michigan joined together in a teach in.
they discussed the issues surrounding the war and reaffirmed their reasons for opposing it.
in may 1965 122 colleges held a national teach in by radio for more than 100 000 antiwar demonstrators.
people opposed the war for different reasons.
some saw the conflict as a civil war in which the united states should not 506 interfere.
others saw south vietnam as a corrupt dictatorship and believed defending it was immoral.
anger at the draft thousands of demonstrators held protests against the war.
students for a democratic society sds organized a march on washington d c that drew more than 20 000 people.
a rally at the lincoln memorial drew tens of thousands of protesters as well.
many protesters focused on what they saw as an unfair draft system.
until 1969 college students could often defer military service until after graduation.
young people from working class families unable to afford college were more likely to be drafted.
draftees were most likely to be assigned to combat units and they commonly made up more than half of casualties.
most who served in vietnam however enlisted voluntarily.
nevertheless a disproportionate number of working class and minority youths went to war.
between 1961 and 1966 african americans constituted about 10 percent of military personnel.
because african americans were more likely to be assigned to combat units however they accounted for almost 20 percent of combat related deaths.
this skewed death rate angered african american leaders.
in april 1967 dr martin luther king jr publicly condemned the conflict i speak for the poor of america who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in vietnam.
the great initiative in this war is ours.
the initiative to stop it must be ours in response military officials tried to reduce african american casualties.
by wars end african americans made up about 12 percent of americas dead.
as the war escalated an increased draft call put many college students at risk of being drafted.
an estimated 500 000 draftees refused to go.
some burned their draft cards did not show up for induction or fled the country.
from 1965 to 1968 officials prosecuted over 3 000 americans who refused to serve.
in 1969 a lottery system was instituted so only those with low numbers were subject to the draft.
many draftees argued that if they were old enough to fight they were old enough to vote.
in 1971 the twenty sixth amendment to the constitution was ratified giving all citizens age 18 and older the right to vote in all state and federal elections.

in november 1967 eugene mccarthy a little known liberal senator from minnesota declared that he would challenge johnson for th democratic presidential nomination.
at first his candidacy was mostly dismissed but he attracted support from those who opposed the war.
in march 1968 mccarthy made a str showing in the new hampshire primary winning more than 40 percent of the vote.
realizing that johnson was vulnerable senator robert kennedy who also opposed the war quickly entered the race for the democratic nomination.

warren court reforms 1 ngqui how mportantaresome of the warren court rulings for today s society.
in 1953 earl warren governor of california became chief justice of the united states.
under warrens leadership the supreme court issued several rulings that dramatically reshaped american politics and society.
one person one vote some of the courts more notable decisions concerned reapportionment.
by 1960 more americans resided in urban than in rural areas but many states electoral districts did not reflect this shift.
in tennessee for example a rural county with only 2 340 voters had one state representative while an urban county with 133 times more voters had only seven.
thus rural voters had far more political influence than urban ones.
some tennessee voters took the matter to court and their case baker v carr 1962 went to the supreme court.
the court ruled that federal courts had jurisdiction to hear lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw electoral districts.
in reynolds v sims 1964 the court ruled that states must reapportion electoral districts along the principle of one person one vote so that all citizens votes would have equal weight rather than giving arbitrary power to rural voters.
the decision shifted political power from rural and often conservative areas to urban areas where more liberal voters lived.
it also boosted the political power of african americans and hispanics who typically lived in cities.

in beker v carr the supreme court ruled on whether federal courts had jurisdiction in lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw their electoral districts.
in reynolds v sims the court decided whether uneven electoral districts violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
how the court ruled in beker v cerr the supreme court ruled that federal courts can hear lawsuits seeking to force state authorities to redraw electoral districts.
in reynolds v sims the court ruled that the inequality of representation in the alabama legislature did violate the equal protection clause.

in 1953 earl warren governor of california became chief justice ofthe united states.
under warrens leadership the supreme court issued several rulings that dramatically reshaped american politics and society.
one person one vote some of the courts more notable decisions concerned reapportionment.
by 1960 more americans resided in urban than in rural areas but many states electoral districts did not reflect this shift.
in tennessee for example a rural county with only 2 340 voters had one state representative while an urban county with 133 times more voters had only seven.
thus rural voters had far more political influence than urban ones.
some tennessee voters took the matter to court and their case baker v carr 1962 went to the supreme court.
the court ruled that federal courts had jurisdiction to hear lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw electoral districts.
in reynolds v sims 1964 the court ruled that states must reapportion electoral districts along the principle of one person one vote so that all citizens votes would have equal weight rather than giving arbitrary power to rural voters.
the decision shifted political power from rural and often conservative areas to urban areas where more liberal voters lived.
it also boosted the political power of african americans and hispanics who typically lived in cities.
reapportionment the method states use to draw up political districts based on changes in population arbitrary existing or coming about seemingly at random or as an unfair or unreasonable act of will iitiffii analyzing supreme court cases baker v carr 1962 reynolds v sims 1964 background ofthe cases although many more americans were living in urban areas most states had not redrawn their political districts to reflect this shift.
this gave rural voters more political influence than urban voters.
in baker v carr the supreme court ruled on whether federal courts had jurisdiction in lawsuits seeking to force states to redraw their electoral districts.
in reynolds v sims the court decided whether uneven electoral districts violated the equal protection clause ofthe fourteenth amendment.
how the court ruled in baker v carr the supreme court ruled that federal courts can hear lawsuits seeking to force state authorities to redraw electoral districts.
in reynolds v sims the court ruled that the inequality of representation in the alabama legislature did violate the equal protection clause.
these rulings forced states to reapportion their political districts according to the principle of one person one vote.

critical thinking drawing conclusions what can you conclude about what police told suspects before the establishment of miranda rights.
extending due process the supreme court began to use the fourteenth amendment to extend the bill of rights to the states.
originally the bill of rights applied only to the federal government.
many states had their own bills of rights but some federal rights did not exist at the state level.
the fourteenth amendment states that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law due process means that the law may not treat individuals unfairly arbitrarily or unreasonably.
the court ruled in several cases that due process meant applying the federal bill of rights to the states.
in 1961 the supreme court ruled in mapp v ohio that state courts could not consider evidence obtained in violation of the u s constitution.
in gideon v wainwright 1963 the court ruled that a defendant in a state court had the right to a lawyer regardless of his or her ability to pay.
in escobedo v illinois 1964 the court ruled that suspects must be allowed access to a lawyer and informed of their right to remain silent before being questioned.
miranda v arizona 1966 went further requiring authorities to inform suspects of their right to remain silent that anything they say can and will be used against them in court and that they have a right to a lawyer.
these warnings are known as miranda rights.
due process a judicial requirement that laws may not treat individuals unfairly arbitrarily or unreasonably and that courts must follow proper procedures and rules when trying cases prayer and privacy the supreme court also reaffirmed the separation of church and state.
the court applied the first amendment to the states in engel v vitale 1962 ruling that states could not compose official prayers and require those prayers to be recited in public schools.
in abington school district v schempp 1963 it ruled against state mandated bible readings in public schools.
the court ruled in griswold v connecticut 1965 that prohibiting the sale and use of birth control devices violated citizens constitutional right to privacy.
as with most rulings of the warren court some people supported these decisions and others did not.

to contain communism and stay ahead in technology president kennedy created aid programs for developing nations and expanded the space program.
containing communism guiding question how were president kennedy s programs to combat communism different from the programs of previous administrations.
when john f kennedy entered the white house in 1961 the cold war with the soviet union dominated all other concerns.
he used a range of programs to try to stop the spread of communism.
these included a conventional weaponry program to give the nations military more flexibility.
the programs also included economic aid to latin america and the creation of the peace corps to help developing nations.
a more flexible response kennedy took office at a time of growing global instability.
resentment at wealthy western nations was on the rise in the developing world often encouraged by the soviet union.
kennedy felt that eisenhower had relied too heavily on nuclear weapons.
to allow for a flexible response to resist communist movements the president pushed for a buildup of troops and conventional weapons.
he also expanded the special forces an elite army unit used in limited conflicts.
despite his commitment to flexible response kennedy had warned against a missile gap during his campaign.
although no gap actually existed the united states began a massive build up of intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms armed with nuclear warheads.
at the time kennedy took office less than 20 icbms were deployed by the united states and only 50 new minuteman missiles were planned.
the soviet union had less than 10 icbnls the new frontier and the great society 455 john f kennedy delivered his inaugural speech on january 20 1961.

nonetheless kennedy decided to build 1000 minutemen icbms.
the decision continued the arms race for the remainder of the 1960s and into the 1970s.
tensions increased as the sovi began their own mass production of missiles and began to look for other ways to ensure they could match the firepower of the united states.
aid to other countries kennedy wanted to renew diplomatic focus on latin america where governments were often in the hands of the wealthy few and many people lived in extreme poverty.
in some countries these conditions spurred the growth of left wing movements aimed at overthrowing their government in his inaugural address president kennedy said to our sister republic south of our border we offer a special pledge to convert our good word into good deeds in a new alliance for progress.
when the united states became involved in latin america it was usually to help existing governments stay in power and to prevent communist movements from flourishing.
poor latin americans resente this intrusion just as they resented american corporations whose presei was seen as a kind of imperialism.
the alliance for progress to improve relations between the united stat and latin america kennedy proposed the alliance for progress a series of cooperative aid projects with latin american governments.
the alliance was designed to create a free and prosperous latin america that wou.
be more stable and less likely to support communist inspired revolutions.
over a 10 year period the united states pledged 20 billion to help latin american countries establish better schools housing health care fairer land distribution.
the results were mixed.

again as in 1957 with the launch of sputnik the first satellite the soviets had beaten the united states in the space race.
kennedy worried that soviet successes in space might convince the world that communism was better than capitalism.
less than six weeks after the soviet flight the president went before congress and declared i believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon kennedys speech set in motion a massive effort to develop the necessary technology.
in 1962 john glenn became the first american to orbit earth.
six years later the united states sent three men into orbit in a capsule called apollo.
the capsule was launched using the saturn v the most powerful rocket ever built.
the saturn v gave both apollo and its lunar module which astronauts would use to land on the moon enough velocity to reach the moon.
on july 16 1969 a saturn v lifted off in florida carrying three american astronauts neil armstrong edwin buzz aldrin and michael collins.
on july 20 armstrong and aldrin boarded the lunar module named eagle and headed down to the moon.
minutes later armstrong radioed nasas flight center in texas houston.
the eagle has landed armstrong became the first human being to walk on the moon.

crises of the cold war guiding questions what was the most important foreign policy event of the kennedy administrate why was it the most important event.
president kennedys efforts to combat communist influence in other countries led to some of the most intense crises of the cold war.
at time these crises left americans and people in many other nations wondering whether the world would survive.

cubas alliance with the soviets worried many americans.
soviet premier nikita khrushchev was also expressing his hope to strengthen cubas military.
fearing that the soviets would use cuba as a base from which to spread revolution president eisenhower had authorized the cia to secretly train and arm a group of cuban exiles known as lu brigada to invade the island.
his goal was to set off a popular uprising against castro.
when kennedy became president his advisers approved the plan.
kennedy agreed to the operation with some changes.
on april 17 1961 about 1 400 armed cuban exiles landed at the bay of pigs on the south coast of cuba.
the invasion was a disaster.
lu brigada s boats ran aground on coral reefs.
then kennedy canceled their air support to keep the united statess involvement a secret.
the expected popular uprising never happened.
within two days castros forces killed or captured almost all the members of lu brigada.
the bay of pigs was a dark moment for the kennedy administration.
the incident exposed an american plot to overthrow a neighbors government.
the disastrous outcome made the united states look weak and disorganized.
the berlin wall goes up in june 1961 kennedy faced another foreign policy challenge when he met with soviet premier nikita khrushchev in vienna austria.
to stop germans from leaving communist east germany for west berlin khrushchev demanded that the western powers recognize east germany and withdraw from berlin.
berlin was a city lying completely within east germany.
kennedy refused and reaffirmed the wests commitment to west berlin.
khrushchev retaliated by building a wall through berlin blocking movement between the soviet sector and the rest of the city.
guards along the wall shot at people who tried to cross from east berlin to west berlin.
the berlin wall stood as a symbol of cold war divisions.
the cuban missile crisis during the summer of 1962 american intelligence learned that soviet technicians and equipment had arrived in cuba and that military construction was in progress.
on october 22 kennedy announced that the soviet union had placed long range nuclear missiles in cuba.
this location made them a clear threat to the united states.
kennedy ordered a naval quarantine to stop the delivery of more missiles and demanded the existing missile sites be dismantled.
he warned that if attacked the united states would respond fully against the soviet union.
still work on the missile sites continued.
nuclear warfare seemed more possible than ever.
then after a flurry of secret negotiations the soviet union offered to remove the missiles if the united states promised not to invade cuba.
the united states also agreed to remove its missiles from turkey near the soviet border.
in reality neither kennedy nor khrushchev wanted nuclear war.

unfortunately many americans live on the outskirts of hope some because of their poverty and some because of their color and all too many because of both.
our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.
this administration declares unconditional war on poverty in america by the summer of 1964 johnson had convinced congress to pass the economic opportunity act which attacked inadequate public services illiteracy and unemployment.
the act established 10 new programs within a new agency the office of economic opportunity oeo.

take turns telling each other the information you learned in this lesson about the war on poverty and the great society.
subsidy money granted by the government to achieve a specific goal that is beneficial to society johnsons ambitious vision encompassed more than 60 programs initiated between 1965 and 1968 including medicare and medicaid.
medicare had strong support because it was offered to all senior citizens about half of whom lacked health insurance.
medicares twin program medicaid financed health care for welfare recipients living below the poverty line.
these programs reflected new deal ideals by entitling categories of americans to benefits.
great society programs also strongly supported education.

the new law opened wider the door ofthe united states to immigrants from all parts of europe asia and africa.
the great society s legacy great society programs touched nearly every aspect of american life and improved many lives.
in the years since johnson left office however debate has continued over whether the great society was truly a success.
in many ways the impact of the great society was limited.
some programs did not work as well as hoped.
in many cases the programs grew so quickly they became unmanageable and difficult to evaluate.
cities states and groups eligible for aid began to expect immediate and life changing benefits.
other americans opposed the massive growth of federal programs.
when johnson attempted to fund both his grand domestic agenda and the increasingly costly war in vietnam the great society eventually suffered.
some great society initiatives have survived however including medicare and medicaid the department of transportation the department of housing and urban development hud and project head start.
overall the programs provided some important benefits to poor communities and gave political and administrative experience to minority groups.
the great societys attempt to create more economic opportunity did have some unintended consequences.
the cost of medicare began to expand rapidly in part because of the rising costs of medical care and new medical technology and in part because of the tendency of congress to add more and more items to what medicare covers.
in addition as baby boomers aged the number of people signing up for medicare became a greater proportion of the population.
because medicare is an entitlement program the government is obligated to make payments and this has contributed to deficit spending and the rise in the national debt.
critics of the great society have also argued that far from ending poverty the various programs of the war on poverty and great society actually fostered a culture of dependency and a new permanent underclass according to this argument people in the underclass were trapped unable to improve their economic circumstances because they had become too reliant on government programs.

chapter 19 place and time united states 1970 1979 when president nixon took office he decided to take a new approach to american relations with the soviet union and the people s republic of china.
the united states had been at odds with these communist countries for decades.
nixon s new approach was one of detente or easing of tensions with the two nations.
the cold war was still on but nixon believed that only by redefining american foreign policy and forming partnerships with his opponents could anything be gained.

we have differences over southeast asia.
we have different attitudes toward japan.
we have different attitudes toward korea.
now we say and most of our rather naive american press buys this line that the new relationship between china and america is due to the fact we have a basic friendship between our peoples.

his greatest accomplishments however were in foreign policy where he worked to ease cold war tensions with china and the soviet union.
appealing to middle america guiding question what were nixon s keys to victory in the 1968 presidential election.
many americans longed for an end to the turmoil that seemed to be plaguing the nation.
in 1968 these frustrated citizens turned to republican presidential candidate richard nixon.
he aimed his campaign messages at this group whom he referred to as middle america and the silent majority nixon promised peace with honor in vietnam and law and order at home.
he also promised a more streamlined government and a return to more traditional values.
in the election nixon faced president johnsons vice president democrat hubert humphrey.
he also went up against a strong third party candidate george wallace an experienced southern politician and avowed supporter of segregation.
wallace captured 13 5 percent of the popular vote.
yet nixon managed to win with 43 4 percent of the popular vote to humphreys 42 7 and 301 electoral votes to humphreys 191.
the southern strategy nixon partially owed his victory to a surprisingly strong showing in the south.
the south had long been a democratic stronghold but nixon worked hard to get its support.
he had met with powerful south carolina senator strom thurmond and won his support by promising several things.
nixon agreed to appoint only conservatives to the federal courts and to name a southerner to the supreme court.
he also promised to oppose court ordered busing and to choose a vice presidential candidate that the south could support.
nixon chose spiro agnew governor of the state of maryland.
nixons efforts paid off on election day.
large numbers of white southerners left the democratic party.
humphreys only southern victory was in lyndon johnsons home state of texas.
wallace claimed most ofthe states in the deep south but nixon captured virginia tennessee kentucky and north carolina.
thurmonds support delivered his state of south carolina for the republicans as well.
after his victory nixon set out to attract more southerners to the republican party.
this effort became known as the southern strategy.
he took steps to slow desegregation and worked to overturn civil rights policies.
he also reversed a program that had cut off funds for racially segregated schools.
a law and order president nixon had promised to uphold law and order and his administration went after antiwar protesters.
attorney general john mitchell warned that he stood ready to prosecute anyone who crossed state lines to start riots.
his deputy richard kleindienst declared were going to enforce the law against draft evaders against radical students against deserters against civil disorders against organized crime and against street crime president nixon also attacked the recent supreme court rulings that expanded the rights of accused criminals.
nixon openly criticized the court and its chief justice earl warren.
the president promised to fill vacancies on the court with judges who would support the rights of law enforcement over the rights of suspected criminals.
warren retired soon after nixon took office.
the president replaced him with respected conservative judge warren burger.
he placed three other conservative justices on the court including one from the south.
the burger court did not reverse warren court rulings on suspects rights but it refused to expand those rights.
for example in stone v powell 1976 it limited defendants rights to appeal state convictions to the federal judiciary.
the burger court also reaffirmed capital punishment.

the new federalism nixon had also promised to reduce the size of the federal government.
he planned to end several federal programs and give more control to state and local governments.
nixon called this the new federalism he argued that such an approach would make government more effective.
i reject the patronizing idea that government in washington d c is inevitably more wise more honest and more efficient than government at the local or state level nixon declared.
the idea that a bureaucratic elite in washington knows whats best for people is really a contention that people cannot govern themselves under nixons new federalism plan congress passed a series of revenue sharing bills granting federal funds to state and local agencies.
as states came to depend on federal funds the federal government could impose conditions on states.
unless states met those conditions funds would be cut off.
as part of the new federalism nixon wanted to end many of johnsons great society programs.
he vetoed funding for the department of housing and urban development.
he eliminated the office of economic opportunity and tried unsuccessfully to shut down the job corps.
when congress appropriated money for programs he opposed nixon impounded or refused to release the funds.
by 1973 it was estimated that he had impounded as much as 18 billion.
the supreme court eventually declared the practice of impoundment unconstitutional.
the family assistance plan one federal program nixon wanted to reform was the nations welfare system aid to families with dependent children afdc.
the program had many critics.
in 1969 nixon proposed replacing the afdc with the family assistance plan.
the plan called for providing needy families a yearly grant of 1 600 which could be supplemented by outside earnings.
many liberals applauded the plan as a significant step toward expanding federal responsibility for the poor.
although the program won approval in the house in 1970 it soon came under harsh attack.
welfare recipients complained that the federal grant was too low.
conservatives disapproved of guaranteed income.
such opposition led to the programs defeat in the senate.

nixon s foreign policy guiding question what do you think was nixon s greatest foreign policy achievement.
despite nixons domestic initiatives a state department official later recalled that nixon had a monumental disinterest in domestic policies nixon once expressed his hope that a competent cabinet of advisers could run the country allowing him to focus on foreign affairs.
nixon and kissinger in a move that would greatly influence his foreign policy nixon chose as his national security advisor henry kissinger a former harvard professor.
kissinger had served under presidents kennedy and johnson as a foreign policy consultant.
although secretary of state william rogers outranked him kissinger soon took the lead in helping shape nixons foreign policy.
542 the nixon doctrine nixon and kissinger shared many views.
both believed abandoning the war in vietnam would damage the nations position in the world.
thus they worked toward a gradual withdrawal while also training the south vietnamese to defend themselves.
this policy of vietnamization as it was called was extended globally in what came to be known as the nixon doctrine.
in july 1969 only six months after taking office nixon announced that the united states would honor all ofthe alliances it had signed.
the nation would continue to provide military aid and training to allies.
yet it would no longer conceive all the plans design all the programs execute all the decisions and undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world americas allies would have to take responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in their own areas of the world.
the new policy of detente the soviet union was not pleased when nixon became president.
he was known to be strongly anti communist.
yet nixon and kissinger believed the united states needed to adjust to the growing role of china japan and western europe.
this emerging multipolar world demanded a different approach to american foreign policy.
both nixon and kissinger wanted to continue to contain communism but they believed that negotiation with communists was a better way for the united states to achieve its international goals.
they developed a new approach called detente or relaxation of tensions between the united states and its two major communist rivals the soviet union and china.
nixon said that the nation had to build a better relationship with its main rivals for world peace detente a policy that attempts to relax or ease tensions between x nations primarysource k we must understand that detente is not a love fest.
it is an understanding between nations that have opposite purposes but which share common interests including the avoidance of a nuclear war.
such an understanding can work that is restrain aggression and deter war only as long as the potential aggressor is made to recognize that neither aggression nor war will be profitable.
quoted in the limits of power 1992 the successes of detente were diminished due to upheavals in smaller nations.
in chile president salvador allende was killed during a coup supported by the american cia.
similarly the angolan civil war which began in 1975 featured secret aid from the united states.
the conflicts in chile and angola were examples of proxy wars conflicts during the cold war that did not directly involve the united states and the soviet union but pursued cold war aims of the two superpowers.

shortly after the public learned of american negotiations with china the soviets proposed an american soviet summit or high level diplomatic meeting to be held in may 1972.
on may 22 president nixon flew to moscow for a weeklong summit.
nixon was the first american president since world war ii to visit the soviet union.
during the historic moscow summit the two superpowers signed the first strategic arms limitation treaty or salt i a plan the two nations had been working on for years.
the treaty temporarily froze the number of strategic nuclear weapons.

how does society it matters because despite a successful first term richard nixon and his supporters worried about reelection.
the tactics they resorted to led to the watergate scandal one ofthe nation s great constitutional crises.
the roots of watergate guiding question why did nixon s advisers order a break in at the democratic party s headquarters.
the watergate scandal led to the only time in the nations history when the president of the united states was forced to resign from office.
it began on the morning of june 17 1972 when a young washington post reporter named bob woodward was assigned to cover a seemingly insignificant but bizarre incident.
early that morning five men had broken into the democratic national committee dnc headquarters in the citys watergate apartment office complex.
woodward attended the arraignment.
he was asked to go to see if there was a story worth reporting.
as woodward sat near the back of the courtroom listening to the bail proceedings for the five defendants the judge asked each man his occupation.
one of the men james mccord answered that he was retired from government service.
where in government asked the judge.
cia mccord whispered.
woodward sprang to attention.
why was a former cia agent involved in what seemed to be just a burglary.
over the next two years woodward and another reporter carl bernstein investigated this question.
they uncovered a scandal that helped trigger a constitutional crisis and eventually forced nixon to resign.
mounting a reelection fight the watergate scandal directly involved the nixon administrations efforts to cover up its involvement in the break in at the democratic national committee headquarters.
it also included other illegal actions.
many scholars believe the roots of the scandal however lay in nixons character and the atmosphere of the white house.
sasstl politics and economics 545 incident single occurrence of a happening or situation challenger one who enters a competition james mccord shows the senate watergate committee the bugging device he installed.
criticalthinking identifying central ideas what made the watergate scandal so damaging to the nixon administration.
richard nixon had fought hard to become president battling back from numerous political defeats.
along the way he had grown defensive secretive and often resentful of his critics.
he became president amid race riots war protests and other turmoil.
he became so consumed with his opponents that he made an enemies list of people whom he considered a threat to his presidency.
as the 1972 presidential election approached nixons reelection prospects seemed promising but not certain.
he had just finished triumphant trips to china and the soviet union.
former governor george wallace had dropped out ofthe race after an assassins bullet paralyzed him.
and many considered democratic challenger senator george mcgovern too liberal.
but the vietnam war still raged and staffers remembered the close 1968 election.
determined to win they began spying on opposition rallies and spreading rumors about opponents.
trying to help the president nixons advisers ordered five men to break into the democratic partys headquarters at the watergate complex and steal sensitive campaign information.
they were also to place wiretaps on the office telephones.
while the burglars worked a security guard spotted a piece of tape holding a door lock.
the guard removed the tape but when he passed the door later he saw that it had been replaced.
he quickly called police who arrived shortly and arrested the men.
the cover up begins after the break in the media discovered that one burglar james mccord was not only an ex cia officer but also a member of the committee for the re election of the president crp.
reports surfaced that the burglars had been paid from a secret crp fund controlled by the white house.
nixon may not have ordered the break in but he did order a cover up.
white house officials destroyed incriminating documents and gave investigators false testimony.
with nixons consent administration officials asked the cia to stop the fbi from investigating the source of money paid to the burglars.
the cia told the fbi that the investigation threatened national security.
fbi deputy director w mark felt then secretly leaked information about watergate to the washington post.
meanwhile nixons press secretary dismissed the incident and the president told the american public the white house has had no involvement whatever in this particular incident it worked.
most americans believed nixon.
despite efforts by the media to keep the story alive few people paid much attention during the 1972 presidential campaign.
nixon won reelection by one of the largest margins in history.

in early 1973 the watergate burglars went on trial.
under relentless prodding from federal judge john j sirica mccord agreed to cooperate with the grand jury investigation and to testify before the newly created senate select committee on presidential campaign activities.
the chairman of the committee was democratic senator sam j ervin from north carolina.
a summer of shocking testimony mccords testimony opened a floodgate of confessions.
presidential counsel john dean who had testified in june 1973 confessed that former attorney general john mitchell had ordered the watergate break in and that nixon had taken part in the cover up.
the nixon administration strongly denied the charges.
dean had no evidence and the senate committee spent weeks trying to determine who was telling the truth.
the answer appeared on july 16.
white house aide alexander butterfield testified that nixon had ordered a taping system installed in the white house to record all conversations to help him write his memoirs after leaving office.
the tapes would tell the committee what nixon knew and when he knew it if the president released them.
the case of the tapes at first nixon refused to hand over the tapes pleading executive privilege the principle that white house conversations should remain confidential to protect national security.
special prosecutor archibald cox took nixon to court in october 1973 to make him give up the tapes.
nixon ordered attorney general elliot richardson to fire cox but richardson refused and resigned.
nixon then ordered richardsons deputy to fire cox but he too resigned.
nixons solicitor general robert bork finally fired cox but the incident badly damaged nixons reputation.

jaworski believed that the tapes would prove the active involvement of the president in the watergate cover up.
nixon filed a motion to prevent the subpoena claiming executive privilege.
the case went to district court but that court withheld judgment pending the decision of the supreme court.
the senate committee overseeing the watergate investigation chaired by senator sam ervin fourth from left at the table wanted access to nixon s white house tape recordings.
how the court ruled in a unanimous 8 to 0 decision justice rehnquist did not take part the supreme court found that executive privilege did not protect nixon s tape recordings.
the ruling stated that while the president has a right to protect military secrets and other sensitive material and has a right to some confidentiality the needs of a criminal trial must take precedence.
in the court s opinion chief justice warren burger wrote we conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice dbq analyzing historical documents 0 identifying central ideas what was the purpose or central issue of the case.

in july the supreme court ruled that nixon had to surrender them.
he complied.
days later the house judiciary committee voted to impeach nixon or officially charge him with misconduct.
charges included obstructing justice misusing federal agencies to violate the rights of citizens and defying the authority of congress.
then new evidence emerged a tape revealed that nixon had ordered the cia to stop the fbi probe into the watergate burglary on june 23 1972.
impeachment and conviction were inevitable.
on august 9 1974 nixon resigned in disgrace.
vice president gerald ford took office as president of the united states after nixons resignation.
he urged americans to put the scandal behind them saying our long national nightmare is over on september 8 1974 ford announced a full pardon for nixon.
fords pardon of nixon drew public criticism and diminished his popularity.

the ethics in government act required financial disclosure by high government officials throughout all branches of government.
the fbi domestic security investigation guidelines act restricted the fbis political intelligence gathering activities.
congress also laid out a means to appoint an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing by high government officials.

after the introduction of the national origins quota system in the 1920s the sources and character of immigration to the united states changed dramatically.
for the next few decades the total number of immigrants arriving annually remained markedly lower.

the immigration act of 1965 abolished the national origins quota system.
it gave preference to skilled persons and persons with close relatives who are u s citizens policies that remain in place today.
the preference given to the children spouses and parents of u s citizens meant that migration chains were established.
as newcomers became citizens they could send for relatives in their home country.
also the legislation introduced the first limits on immigration from the western hemisphere.
the act further provided that immigrants could apply for u s citizenship after five years of legal residency.
at the time of its passage few people expected that the new law would cause much change in the pattern or volume of immigration to the united states.
supporters of the law presented it as an extension of americas growing commitment to equal rights for all people regardless of race or ethnicity.

some newcomers arrived in the united states as refugees.
beginning in 1948 refugees from countries ravaged by world war ii were admitted although they were counted as part of their nations quota.
the cold war brought more refugees.
according to the mccarran walter act of 1952 anyone who was fleeing a communist regime could be admitted as a refugee.
the refugee act of 1980 further broadened u s policy by defining a refugee as anyone leaving his or her country due to a well founded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular group or political opinion the growing problem of illegal immigration also prompted changes in immigration law.

this law strengthened border controls to prevent illegal entry into the united states.
it also set up a process to grant amnesty or a pardon to any undocumented alien who could prove that he or she had entered the country before january 1 1982 and had since lived in the united states.

some supported permitting them to earn permanent residence if they learned english paid back taxes and had no criminal record.
in 2006 president george w bush made immigration reform a top priority but members of congress strongly disagreed over how to solve the problem.
a bipartisan majority of the senate favored legislation that blended tougher enforcement of immigration laws with some form of earned citizenship.
the senate bill included a provision that allowed undocumented aliens who grew up in the united states and graduated from high school to apply for citizenship.
conservative republicans who held the majority in the house objected that this would reward illegal behavior.
granting amnesty to people who broke the law penalizes the millions of people who are waiting to come to america legally argued republican senator phil gramm of texas.
the house rejected any form of amnesty and called for the united states to build a wall along its mexican border.
by this time the united states had already tripled the size of its border patrol without reducing illegal immigration.
as congress debated a bill that would subject undocumented aliens to criminal prosecution latinos held rallies across the country carrying signs that read we are not criminals advocates of immigration reform promoted alternatives such as expanding quotas through a guest worker program and establishing a legalization process for those already in the country.
some undocumented immigrants had lived in the united states for years and had raised families.
deporting them would mean separating husbands wives and children.

60s using a database why learn this skill.
do you have a large collection of mp3 music files or a collection of digital photos.
do you have a list of email addresses phone numbers or sms contacts on your phone or computer.
if so you have created a database.
in the world today there a literally millions of databases and if you want to be successful you will almost certainly need to know how to use a database.
learning the skill a database is simply information that has been collected and arranged so that it is easy to find information.
a database can hold any kind of information photos maps text data music etc.
a database is not the same thing as the internet.
the information in a database is usually more reliable and better organized because it is curated.
someone reviewed the data to make sure it was accurate and appropriate.
a database can be created entirely on paper.
an old printed phone book is a database.
but the term is generally used to refer to information stored on a computer.
programmers create software called database management systems dbms that let people store organize search and retrieve data.
modern database software allows users to display the data visually.
instead of just presenting lists of facts and numbers the software takes the information you want from the database and presents it as a graph or chart or table or even sets it as a layer over top of a map so you can see the relationship between the data and geographical locations.
database software also allows users to easily add delete change or update information.
when searching a database it is helps to understand how a database is structured.
a database is made up of records.
a record represents one item of data such as a photo 01 song or an article etc.
each record has standa fields of information.
for example there is usually a title field a subject field and a field with a date and usually there are many other fields as well.
think of a database as a giant table of information made up of columns and rows.
the words used to describe each item in the cells of the table are the fields.
the words p into fields and the words used to label the columns and rows are called metadata.
metad is what the computer searches when you ask it find information in a database.
follow these steps to use a database 1.
determine what information you want t access.
be as specific as possible.
databases typically have a number of fields where you can select words or categories for a specific search.
think about what you already know about the information.
use that knowledge to decide what terms you want in the field.
for your search.
if there is not a field that fits with what you want to find you often can use a keyword search.
this is similar to using search engine on the internet.
keyword searching allows you to combine terms and concepts to find exactly what you ar looking for.
most databases let you use boolean operators.
boolean operators are connecting words that give commands t the computer.
boolean operators are the words and or and not.
they le you combine search words and shape your search more effectively.
create a search string with keywords using boolean operators that matches what you are trying to find.
5 review the records or information retrieved from the database to determine if it is what you wanted.
if not try a new search.
610 practicing this skill in recent years databases have become an extremely popular way to display geographic information.
the databases take the geographic information requested and draw it on a map so that it is easy to visualize.
these kind of databases can be used to see geographic distributions and geographic patterns.
a geographic distribution shows where things are located and how much is located in each area.
a geographic pattern shows how things change geographically over time or over distance.

posing questions about geographic distributions based on the areas where hispanic populations are highest what three countries do you think might be the source for most hispanic immigrants.
what questions do you need to ask about the geographic distribution to be able to know for sure where most hispanic immigrants originated.
posing questions about geographic patterns now change the data table field to percent asian.
how is the geographic pattern of asian americans similar to hispanic americans.

in 1959 robert noyce designed the first integrated circuit a whole electronic circuit on a single silicon chip.
in 1968 noyces company intel put several integrated circuits on a single chip.
this made circuits much smaller and easy to manufacture.
by the late 1960s manufacturers were making microprocessors or single chips with many integrated circuits containing both memory and computing functions.
these microprocessors made computers even smaller and faster.
using microprocessor technology steve jobs and stephen wozniak set out to build a small computer suitable for personal use.
they founded apple computer in 1976.
the following year they launched the apple ii the first practical and affordable home computer.
in 1981 international business machines ibm introduced the personal computer or pc.
in 1984 apple put out the macintosh which used on screen symbols called icons that users could manipulate with a hand operated device called a mouse.
as jobs and wozniak were creating apple bill gates cofounded microsoft.
in 1980 ibm hired microsoft to make an operating system for its new pc.
the system was called ms dos.
microsoft came out with the windows operating system in 1985.
computers became essential tools in almost all businesses.
by the late 1990s many workers were able to telecommute or work from home via computer.
telecommunications also underwent a revolution.
in 1996 congress passed a law allowing phone companies to compete with one another and to send television signals.
it also allowed cable companies to 612 offer telephone service.
soon wireless digital technology made it possible to make small inexpensive satellite dishes for home use.
cell phones invented in the 1940s became popular as wireless digital technology made phones smaller and service cheaper.

breading progress check describing what advantage did microprocessors give to computers.
the rise of the internet guiding question how have advances in telecommunications and the rise ofthe internet affected the u s standard of living.
the internet began as a system of networked computers of a u s defense department agency that linked to a system of networked supercomputers ofthe national science foundation.
similar networks grew across the world and this communications system became known as the internet.
as personal computer ownership rose individuals rather than just government agencies began connecting to the internet.
by 2007 more than 1 billion people around the world were regularly using the internet.
birth of the world wide web in 1990 researchers in switzerland developed a new way to present information on internet linked computers.
known as the world wide web this system used hypertext or links and was accessed with web browser software.
users could post information on web pages and use links to move between sites.
enthusiasm for the world wide web spawned a dot com economy.
the stock of internet related companies helped fuel the prosperity of the 1990s.
it fell dramatically in 2000 when many unprofitable online companies failed.
a few dot com companies were very successful.
this new economy also required american workers to acquire new skills.

global environmentalism guiding question how have the united states and other nations responded to global environmental concerns.
the rise of a global economy also increased awareness of environmental issues.
environmentalists began thinking of the environment as a global system and addressing issues they believed were of global concern.
in the 1980s scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons cfcs were affecting the layer of ozone in earths atmosphere.
ozone blocks many of the suns ultraviolet rays.
at that time cfcs were widely used in air conditioners and refrigerators.
in that same decade scientists documented a large hole in the ozone layer over antarctica.
in 1987 the united states and many other nations agreed to phase out cfcs and other chemicals that might be weakening the ozone layer.
during this time another environmental issue emerged when some scientists warned that global warming could lead to more droughts and other forms of extreme weather.
many experts concluded that carbon dioxide emissions from factories and power plants caused global warming but others disagreed.
the issue became controversial because of the cost of controlling emissions.
industries would have to pay the cost of reducing emissions and these costs would be passed on to consumers.
developing nations trying to industrialize would be hurt the most.
economic growth in wealthier nations would be hurt as well.
concern about global warming led the eu and many other nations to sign the kyoto protocol in 1997 promising to reduce emissions.
president clinton did not submit the protocol for ratification because most senators opposed it.
president george w bush withdrew the united states from the agreement entirely citing flaws in the treaty.

both promised to cut taxes to improve public education and to support plans to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs.
a close vote no candidate won a majority in the 2000 election but gore received the most votes with 48 4 percent of the popular vote compared to 47 9 percent for bush.
to win the presidency however candidates must win a majority of votes in the electoral college.
the election came down to the results in florida both men needed its 25 electoral votes to win.
the counts in florida were so close that state law required a recount of the ballots using vote counting machines.
there were however thousands of ballots the machines could not read.
gore then asked for a recount of ballots in several strongly democratic counties.
after the machine recount showed bush still ahead a battle began over the manual recounts.
6 most florida ballots required voters to cast a vote by punching a small piece of cardboard out of the ballot beside the candidates name.
this small piece is called a chad.
vote counters had to determine how to count a ballot if the chad was still partially attached.
on some the chad was still in place and the voter had left only a dimple on the ballots surface.
vote counters thus had to determine what the voter intended and different counties used different standards.
under state law florida officials had to certify the results by a certain date.
when it became clear that not all of the recounts could be finished in time gore went to court to challenge the deadline.
the florida supreme court agreed to set a new deadline.
at bushs request the u s supreme court intervened to decide whether the florida supreme court had acted constitutionally.

gore appealed this action and the florida supreme court authorized manual recounts of disputed ballots to begin immediately.
bush appealed the ruling to the u s supreme court which ordered the recount to stop.
how the court ruled the florida supreme court ordered any recounts to use a general standard set forth in florida law to discern the clear intent ofthe voter.
in a 7 2 ruling the u s supreme court declared that because different vote counters used different standards the recount did not treat all voters equally.
in addition both federal law and the constitution require the electoral votes for president to be cast on a certain day.

many muslims feared their traditional values were weakening as the oil industrialists also brought western ideas into the region.
new movements arose calling for a strict interpretation of the quran the muslim holy book and a return to traditional religious laws.
some militant supporters began using terrorism to achieve their goals.
the united statess support of israel also angered many in the middle east.

the jews accepted the un plan and established israel in 1948.
arab states responded by attacking israel.

he asked other nations to help and soon some 80 nations had issued orders freezing the assets of the organizations and individuals on the american list.
to protect against further attacks bush created the office of homeland security and asked congress to pass legislation to help law enforcement agencies locate terrorist suspects.
congress had to balance fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure with the need to increase security but in october 2001 bush signed into law the antiterrorist bill called the usa patriot act.
the law made it easier to wiretap suspects track internet communications and seize voice mail.
authorities were permitted to conduct secret searches and were allowed to obtain a nationwide search warrant usable in any jurisdiction.

unemployment which had already begun to rise became even worse.
with the united states facing a new war and a great deal of uncertainty president bush knew he had to act quickly to prevent the mild recession that had already begun from turning into a serious economic downturn.
in his address to the nation on september 20 he asked americans for their continued participation and confidence in the american economy and he stressed that while terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source three months earlier the president had convinced congress to pass a major tax cut in order to help the economy.
the bush tax cuts reduced tax rates for all americans and cut the capital gains tax.
the economy remained weak throughout 2002 however in part because of the uncertainty caused by the war on terror.
bush pushed congress to pass a second tax cut in 2003 that accelerated the tax cuts passed in the first bill.
by mid 2003 the economy was in full recovery and unemployment had begun to fall.

in 2003 troops invaded iraq and toppled the regime of saddam hussein.
the taliban and wmd guiding question why did the united states want to overthrow the taliban regime.
soon after the september 11 attacks the united states launched a war in afghanistan to bring down the taliban regime that had sheltered osama bin laden and other members of al qaeda.
u s warplanes bombed taliban forces as the united states began sending military aid to the northern alliance a coalition of afghan groups that had been fighting the taliban for several years.
the u s bombing campaign quickly shattered the talibans defenses and the northern alliance launched a massive attack.
in december 2001 the taliban government fell and surviving members fled to the mountains of afghanistan.
afghanistan slowly began to recover from decades of war.
rebuilding afghanistan after the taliban fled the united states and its allies helped local afghan leaders create a new government.
meanwhile thousands of u s and allied troops arrived to act as peacekeepers.
in 2003 nato took command of the peacekeeping.
afghanistan held its first nationwide democratic election in december 2004 and hamid karzai was elected president.
one year later the afghan people elected a national assembly.
despite these successes afghanistan continued to suffer from violence.
the u s military has remained in afghanistan in an effort to help stabilize the country.
the search for bin laden u s intelligence agencies believed osama bin laden had fled to pakistan.
reports in the summer of 2010 suggested he was hiding north of pakistans capital city of islamabad.

in 2003 pakistani and u s forces captured khalid shaikh mohammed the man suspected of planning the september 11 attacks.
between 2002 and 2006 the u s government believes to have prevented at least 10 major al qaeda attacks including at least three on the united states and two on great britain.
iraq and weapons of mass destruction the terrorist attacks ot 9 11 showed that groups such as al qaeda were determined to kill as many americans as possible.
president bush and his advisers were deeply concerned that terrorists might acquire weapons of mass destruction wmd including nuclear chemical and biological weapons that could kill large numbers of people all at once.
during the cold war the united states relied upon a policy of deterrence to prevent the use of such weapons.
the rise of state sponsored terrorism created a new problem.
if a nation secretly gave weapons to terrorists who then used them against the united states the u s military might not know whom to attack in response to their use.
the axis of evil in his 2002 state of the union address president bush warned that an axis of evil made up of iraq iran and north korea posed a grave threat.
each nation had been known to sponsor terrorism and was suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction.

between 1991 and 1998 iraq appeared to be hiding weapons of mass destruction from un inspectors.
in 1998 the iraqi government expelled the inspectors.
in response president clinton ordered a massive bombing attack on iraq to destroy its ability to make such weapons.
despite the attack intelligence agencies continued to believe iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction.
hamid karzai 1957 hamid karzai was elected president in afghanistan s first democratic election on october 9 2004.
he had worked to remove the taliban and its supporters from afghanistan.
in 2001 participants ofthe un sponsored bonn conference elected him chairman ofthe interim administration.
he was then elected president ofthe transitional government on june 13 2002 by members of the emergency loya jirga grand council.
karzai had been a strong proponent of establishing a loya jirga believing it to be the only way to resolve the differences among the various afghan factions.
though there have been charges of corruption in his administration as president karzai has been an advocate of human rights and has appointed several women to his cabinet.

later the united nations approved a new resolution against iraq that threatened serious consequences if iraq did not comply.
greading progress check identifying why did president bush call iraq iran and north korea the axis of evil.
confronting iraq guiding question what factors led to the u s invasion of iraq.
the war in iraq relied heavily on advanced technology.
u s forces used new tools such as remote controlled drone bombers and laser guided pointers to precisely target enemy bunkers.
critical thinking interpreting what advantages does this soldier seem to have over the enemy.
in november 2002 iraq agreed to readmit un weapons inspectors.
it then submitted a statement admitting it had weapons of mass destruction before the gulf war but denying it currently had them.
secretary of state colin powell said that iraqs declaration contained lies and was in material breach of the un resolution.
as the united states and a coalition of some 30 nations prepared for war with iraq others in the un security council argued that the inspectors should be given more time to find evidence of iraqs wmd programs.
by march 2003 inspectors still had found nothing and the united states began pressing the united nations to authorize the use of force.
france and russia two un security council members with veto power refused to back such a resolution.
as war became imminent world opinion divided between those who supported the united states and those who opposed an attack on iraq.
around the world antiwar protesters staged rallies and marches.
several nations that had supported the united states in its war on terror and had sent troops to afghanistan including france germany and canada refused to join the coalition against iraq.
saudi arabia and turkey both american allies refused to allow the united states to attack iraq from their territories.
the only nation bordering iraq that granted permission to use its territory was kuwait.
the invasion begins on march 20 2003 the u s led coalition forces attacked iraq.
more than 150 000 u s troops some 45 000 british troops as well as a few hundred special forces from australia and poland took part in the invasion.
much of the iraqi army dissolved as soldiers refused to risk their lives for saddam hussein.
a few fierce battles took place but the iraqis were unable to slow the coalition advance significantly.
on may 1 president bush declared that the major combat was over.
about 140 americans and several thousand iraqis had died.
hussein was captured in late 2003.
after a prolonged trial an iraqi court found him guilty of ordering mass executions.
he was executed in 2006.
insurgents and reconstruction soon after the coalition took control of the country small groups of iraqis began staging bombings sniper attacks and sporadic battles against coalition forces.
some carrying out the attacks were former members of saddam husseins military.
others were affiliated with al qaeda and other radical muslim groups who believed the invasion offered a chance to build support in the muslim world by organizing resistance to the united states.
militias belonging to the different religious and ethnic groups in iraq also carried out some attacks.
the majority of iraqs population is shia muslim but there is also a large sunni muslim minority.
the sunni are themselves divided between sunni arabs who ruled the country under saddam husseins leadership and sunni kurds.
the collapse of husseins dictatorship renewed old hostilities among these groups forcing coalition troops to protect them from attacks from each others militias.
having aimed to overthrow a tyrant and eliminate the possibility of weapons of mass destruction being given to terrorists the united states found itself trying to suppress an insurgency prevent a civil war and establish a new iraqi government.
the united states and its allies spent more than 30 billion to improve infrastructure but insurgent attacks slowed these efforts.
despite the problems iraqs economy began to grow rapidly and a substantial improvement in living standards took place.
u s policy makers now faced a dilemma.
if they pulled troops out too soon iraq might fall into civil war and provide a safe haven and breeding ground for terrorist groups.
at the same time the longer the united states stayed the more its presence might stir resentment and support for terrorist groups.
the best solution seemed to be to get a functioning democratic iraqi government in place as quickly as possible and then train its forces to take over the countrys security.
to do this in january 2005 the iraqi people went to the polls in huge numbers for the first free elections in their countrys history.
after much debate voters then overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in october 2005.
problems in iraq many americans were encouraged when large numbers of iraqis turned out to vote in democratic elections but hope for peace in iraq soon faded.
many americans had expected the war to end quickly but between 2003 and 2006 insurgents killed more than 3 000 u s soldiers.
as the fighting dragged on support for the war began to decline.
also the failure to find any wmd added to growing controversy as to whether the war had been a mistake.
the elections were followed by a rise in sectarian violence as sunni and shia militias turned against each other.
ongoing suicide bombings kidnappings and attacks on u s soldiers set a majority of americans against the war.
as a new york times editorial argued primary source eliminate to remove or get rid of in 2005 iraqis were able to vote in their first free elections.
criticalthinking predicting consequences will regular elections lead to a more stable national government in iraq.
iraq is becoming a country that america should be ashamed to support let alone occupy.
the nation as a whole is sliding closer to open civil war.
in its capital thugs kidnap and torture innocent civilians with impunity then murder them for their religious beliefs.
the stories about innocent homeowners and storekeepers who are dragged from their screaming families and killed by militias are heartbreaking as is the thought that the united states in its hubris helped bring all this to pass.
from the new york times april 2 2006 despite problems of lingering violence and uncertainty many began to rebuild a shattered iraq.
criticalthinking defending what was the most important u s accomplishment in iraq.
631 a u s army soldier plays soccer with iraqi children while on patrol in baghdad.
criticalthinking defending was operation iraqi freedom a success.
why or why not.
democrats demanded the president set a timetable for withdrawing u s troops a policy that president bush described as cut and run troops surge to iraq in 2006 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld resigned and president bush appointed robert gates to replace him.
bush then announced a plan to send a surge of some 20 000 more troops to iraq to restore order in baghdad where the violence was concentrated.
with the additional surge of troops general david petraeus began clearing and holding areas of baghdad that had been plagued by crime and insurgent attacks.
his forces also began reaching out to sunni groups in western iraq that had been opposed to the american presence.
in the western province of anbar a militant group known as al qaeda in iraq aqi was trying to impose a militant version of islam through murder and intimidation.
the sunni groups in that area began working with u s forces to fight aqi.
these actions helped change the course of the war.
by the fall of 2008 violence in iraq had been dramatically reduced.
coalition forces had handed over control of 12 of iraqs 18 provinces to the iraqi government and coalition casualties were lower than at any time since the war began in 2003.
in august 2010 operation iraqi freedom officially ended as the number of u s troops remaining in iraq was reduced to about 50 000.
their job was primarily to train iraqi troops.

security vs liberty guiding question howdid the september 11th terrorist attacks and the wars in afghanistan and iraq increase tension between the need for national security and protecting civil liberties.
in early 2004 president bushs approval ratings began to fall.
the ongoing war in iraq and the failure of inspectors to find any weapons of mass destruction weakened his support as did the scandal at the iraqi prison of abu ghraib where some prisoners were abused by american soldiers.
these events gave democrats the opportunity to mount a serious challenge in the 2004 election.
president bush and vice president cheney were renominated by the republicans.
the democrats nominated massachusetts senator john kerry for president and north carolina senator john edwards for vice president.
despite the problems in iraq voters felt it safer to stay with the incumbent.
nationwide bush won both the popular and the electoral vote.
prisoners at guantanamo the war on terror heightened the tension between national security and civil liberties.
people questioned whether terrorist attacks justified limits on civil liberties and whether captured terrorists had any rights at all.
in 2004 president bush decided to hold captured members of al qaeda at the american military base in guantanamo bay cuba where they could be interrogated.
this decision was very controversial.
some people argued that the prisoners should have the right to a lawyer formal charges and a proper trial.
the bush administration insisted that the prisoners were enemy combatants not suspects charged with a crime and did not have the right to appeal their detentions to an american court.
the administration also declared america s challenges for a new century 633 analyzing supreme court cases hamdan v rumsfeld al qaeda associate salim ahmed hamdan was captured in 2001 and was moved to guantanamo bay in 2002.
president bush later determined that hamdan was eligible for a military trial on counts of committing war crimes.
writing for the supreme court justice john paul stevens argued that the military commission created to conduct the trial violated the uniform code of military justice and the geneva conventions.
stevens stated it is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism should require any variance from the courts martial rules critical thinking drawing conclusions how did the ruling affect the policy on detainees.
controversial given to controversy disputable that the procedures regarding the treatment of prisoners as specified in the geneva conventions did not apply to terrorists since they were not part of any nations armed forces.
the supreme court disagreed.
in rasul v bush 2004 the court ruled that foreign prisoners who claimed that they were unlawfully imprisoned had the right to have their cases heard in court.
in response the bush administration created military tribunals to hear detainee cases.
the supreme court struck this plan down in 2006 in hamdan v rumsfeld.
bush then asked congress to establish new tribunals that met the courts objections.
congress passed the military commissions act which stated that noncitizens captured as enemy combatants had no right to file writs of habeas corpus.
in 2008 in boumediene v bush the supreme court ruled that the detainees had a right to habeas corpus and declared that section of the military commissions act unconstitutional.
domestic surveillance as part of the war on terror the national security agency nsa began wiretapping domestic telephone calls made to overseas locations when they believed one party in the call was a member of al qaeda or affiliated with al qaeda.
when the monitoring program became public in 2005 it created a controversy.
civil rights groups argued that the program violated the fourth amendment.
in 2006 a federal judge declared the wiretapping to be unconstitutional but the following year an appeals court overturned the judges decision.
when congress began drafting legislation to address the issue the bush administration suspended the program and announced that future wiretaps would require a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance court.

and thats what i intend to tell the congress.
i earned capital in the campaign political capital.
and now i intend to spend it debating social security one priority of bushs second term domestic policy was social security reform.
he proposed that workers be allowed to put 4 percent of their income in private accounts rather than in social security.
he believed that private accounts would grow rapidly and help cover the expected shortfall in social security accounts.
democrats argued that privatizing any part of social security was dangerous.
with the public unenthusiastic the plan was never brought to a vote in congress.
although this plan failed bush did convince congress to enact a new prescription drug program for seniors.
under the new program provided by medicare people age 65 and older can sign up for insurance that helps cover the cost of prescription drugs.
hurricane katrina on august 29 2005 hurricane katrina smashed into the gulf coast of the united states spreading devastation from florida to louisiana.
the fierce winds rain high tides and storm surges destroyed buildings roads and electrical lines left thousands of people homeless and cost at least 1 200 lives.
after the hurricane had passed rising waters breached levees protecting new orleans and flooded the low lying city causing thousands to flee to rooftops and for shelter in the convention center and at the superdome.
waiting for days with little food clean water or information from authorities survivors were shown on television news in deplorable conditions.
reporters asked why the government was not responding more quickly.
the mayor of new orleans was faulted for not issuing a mandatory evacuation until the storm was less than a day away and for having failed to provide public transportation.
the federal emergency management agency fema seemed unprepared in its response.
with polls showing a sharp drop in confidence in his administration president bush fired the head of fema and traveled to new orleans to pledge federal funds for rebuilding the city.
congress approved 200 billion for the massive task.

in 2000 the city of new london connecticut seized property from several homeowners and gave the land to a corporation in order to have it redeveloped as part of a plan to rejuvenate the citys economy.
the homeowners challenged the taking of their land arguing that it was not being seized for public use as specified in the constitution.
in 2005 in a 5 4 decision the supreme court interpreted the term public use in a broad way.
the court interpreted the phrase public use to mean the government can take property if it serves a public purpose even if it is not truly for public use.
in other words if government wants to promote development in a community so as to create new jobs or increase tax revenue it can take property from one private owner and give it to another.
the case outraged people across the political spectrum.
many conservatives saw it as example of the court violating rights by going beyond what they believed was the actual meaning of the constitution.
many liberals were outraged that government could take land from individual homeowners and give it to large corporations.
after the decision more than 40 states passed laws restricting the ability of state and local jurisdictions to take land away from homeowners for economic development by businesses.
new supreme court judges in 2005 president bush filled two vacancies on the supreme court.
in the spring of 2005 justice sandra day oconnor announced her retirement.
although appointed by president reagan justice oconnor had been a pivotal swing vote on the court sometimes siding with conservatives sometimes with liberals.
as her replacement bush nominated federal judge john g roberts jr a conservative who was well regarded in the senate.
before the senate could act however chief justice william rehnquist died.
bush then named roberts to replace him.
again attempting to fill justice oconnors vacancy president bush nominated federal judge samuel alito jr a well known conservative justice.
roberts and alito were confirmed by the senate.
the 2006 midterm elections the first two years of president bushs second term had not gone well.
at the same time americans had also grown frustrated with congress.
the republican majority seemed awash in scandals.
two republicans had resigned from congress after being convicted of corruption and house majority leader tom delay had resigned after being indicted for violating campaign finance laws.
congress seemed unable to control spending partly because republicans and democrats had been adding an increasing number of special funding requests to spending bills.
voters expressed their unhappiness with the president and the republican congress in 2006.
the democrats won a majority in both the house and the senate for the first time since 1992.
house democrats then elected california representative nancy pelosi to be the first female speaker of the house of representatives.
she summed up democrats interpretation of their victory primarysource the election of 2006 was a call to change not merely to change the control of congress but for a new direction for our country our founders envisioned a new america driven by optimism opportunity and courage now it is our responsibility to carry forth that vision of a new america into the 21st century.
w from a speech to the house of representatives january 4 2007 despite promises to end the war and change how congress operated speaker pelosi and other democrats were not able to get enough votes to cut funding set a deadline for pulling troops out of iraq or reduce spending.
the american economy was on a downturn.
economic recession by 2008 the american economy was in crisis.
in 2007 many people with low incomes or poor credit began defaulting on their mortgage payments.
at the same time housing prices began to fall.
people could no longer borrow against their home values and banks across the country that had relied on mortgage backed investments did not know what their investments were worth.
without adequate real funds to lend banks reduced the amounts they lent and many businesses feared they could not borrow enough money to keep operating.
this led to a long recession and caused a number of well known investment banking firms to face bankruptcy and collapse.
companies began laying off workers in response to the financial crisis.
by january 2009 the unemployment rate was up to 7 2.

many americans were still angry about bushs bailout plan.
they believed it favored large businesses at the expense of ordinary people.
to counter this anger the act set up a system to monitor how the recovery money was spent.
obama pushed additional legislation through the democrat controlled congress in july 2010.
among other things this financial reform bill provided protection for consumers.
it also called for more government oversight of financial institutions and large companies.
by the end of 2009 there were signs that some of obamas measures were working.
the nations gross domestic product gdp had climbed.
some of the large businesses that had accepted stimulus funds were reporting gains.
the unemployment rate however continued to rise as did the federal deficit.

health care reform energy and the environment guidingquestion what other major domestic events defined obama s first years as president.
as a candidate and president elect obama stressed many other domestic issues.
two priorities were to reform and expand the health care system and to solve the nations energy and environmental problems.
health care reform obamas health care reform plan aimed to lower health care costs introduce better procedures for delivering care and insure all americans.
in a speech to congress delivered in 2009 he said we are the only advanced democracy 640 e rth the only wealthy nation that allows such hardships for millions of its people.
there are now more than thirty million american citizens who cannot get coverage obama wanted to pay for the plan through higher taxes on the wealthy and by reducing wasteful spending.
yet some americans opposed what they saw as another expensive government intrusion.
months of heated partisan debate took place within congress.
no republican voted for the final bill that passed in march 2010 and many vowed to overturn it.
though obama had promised to reform the system of earmarks the bill contained many.
the bill extended coverage to about 32 million more americans who could not previously afford it.
it prevented insurers from denying insurance to people who had preexisting medical conditions.
it also gave tax credits to small businesses that provide health care to their employees.
according to the white house it would lower costs strengthen the medicare program and expand the medicaid program.
interpreting significance energy policy and the environment president obamas energy plan enforced limits on the amount of pollution companies could emit.
conservatives who opposed the idea stalled the bill in congress.
then an environmental disaster struck the gulf of mexico in april 2010.
a british petroleum bp oil rig exploded sending nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the gulf.
it was the worst marine oil spill in history.
commercial fishing and tourism in the gulf region suffered.
obama required bp to create a 20 billion fund to assist people affected by the oil spill.
federal agencies directed the recovery which lasted through october.

when president obama chose sonia sotomayor and elena kagan to fill vacancies on the u s supreme court he became the first president to successfully nominate two women to the nations highest court.

born and raised in a puerto rican family in the bronx new york sotomayor is the nations first justice of latin american descent.

earmarks specifications added by both republicans and democrats for the expenditure of federal money for particular projects 2010 midterm elections guiding qu estion iv wf did the results of the elections say about the mood of the nation at that time.
as the 2010 midterm elections approached obamas approval rating was at a low point.
many americans felt that the stimulus and health care bills had been too expensive and had not strengthened the economy.
a grassroots movement called the tea party sprang up to protest the obama administration.
the movement took its name from a reference to the boston tea party protests against british taxation.
most in the movement opposed what they called big government including taxes the health care program and the economic stimulus plans of bush and obama.
yet they disagreed on many other issues.
republicans gained a rousing win in the midterm elections.
republicans gained 60 seats in the house of representatives and took back control of that house of congress.
it was the biggest shift in power in over 60 years.
the republicans also captured six senate seats though the democrats maintained the majority.
it was clear that americans of all political beliefs needed to work together to solve the issues facing the nation.
in a white house conference a day after the election president obama said over the last two years we ve made progress.
but clearly too many americans haven t felt that progress yet and they told us that yesterday the united states had obstacles to overcome the worst economic depression in 70 years and two ongoing wars.
yet opportunities to innovate in the nations economic system gave new challenges.
the commitment remained to strengthen the nations political institutions as a foundation to address any future conflict.

the income gap the recession widened the gap between income levels in america.
the economy slowly recovered but slow wage growth and high unemployment hit those in middle and lower incomes the hardest.
as wealthier individuals recovered from the recession faster their share of the nations total income increased.
the 2010 census showed that the middle income families share of income had fallen to 45 percent while the wealthiests share of income has risen to 46 percent.
middle income americans cut back on their spending which further restrained the recovery.
these families were hurt by the decline in manufacturing jobs.
the family home was usually their biggest investment.
when housing values fell sharply during the recession some people found themselves paying higher mortgages than their homes were worth.
rising costs of health care and college tuition also hurt those in the middle incomes.
occupy wall street the widening gap between income groups helped spark a movement that called itself occupy wall street protesters claimed that they represented the 99 percent of the population against the wealthiest one percent.
they began by occupying a park in new york citys financial district.
occupy wall street drew attention to economic inequality tax breaks for the wealthy and corporate greed.
most of the protesters were young and identified themselves as political independents.
they were critical of both major parties.
president obama acknowledged that the movement expressed peoples frustration with the financial crisis.
after police moved demonstrators out of the parks they had occupied the movement dwindled.
although the occupy wall street movement expressed popular anger it suffered from a lack of leadership and specific solutions to the nations economic problems.
the tea party in congress public anxiety over the rising national debt was also reflected in a political protest group known as the tea party.
some leaders of the tea party 642 movement won seats in congress during the 2010 midterm election they were determmed to cut federal spending and prevent taxes from rising.
as a large bloc of members of the house of representatives these freshmen politicians favored confrontation rather than cooperation.
republicans called for deep cuts in federal spending while democrats called for raising taxes for the wealthy.
house speaker john boehner attempted to negotiate a budget compromise with president obama but the large tea party faction was dissatisfied with the agreement they reached and refused to support it.
a deadlock developed between the house controlled by republicans and the senate by democrats which kept either party from effecting economic growth.
as public disapproval of polarized politics rose the number of americans who called themselves independents grew.
in some areas independents outnumbered registered republicans or democrats.
political independents told pollsters that they favored cooperation.
these independents increasingly played a role in determining election outcomes.
new civil rights issues the first decades of the 21st century have seen several different civil rights issues emerge.
in 2008 president obama signed the matthew shepard and james byrd hate crimes prevention act a new federal law prompted by the 1998 murders of matthew shepard a gay man and james byrd an african american.
in both cases the savage nature of the murders attracted national attention and began to build support for new hate crimes legislation.
a decade later the new law was signed.
it expanded the definition of hate crimes provided funds to state and local authorities to encourage investigation of hate crimes and gave federal authorities greater power to examine possible hate crimes when local authorities choose not to follow up.
another civil rights issue that emerged in the 1990s also gained momentum in the early 21st century.
the gay and lesbian civil rights movement began to push for the right to same sex marriage in several states.
in 2003 the state of massachusetts became the first state to legalize same sex marriage.
laws regulating marriage have historically been a responsibility of state governments.
as a result the push for same sex marriage took place largely at the state level.
the problem facing gay and lesbian couples was that while they might be married in one state if they moved to another state where the laws were different their marriage might not be considered valid.
in 1996 congress with the support of president clinton had passed the defense of marriage act defining marriage for federal purposes as a union between one man and one women and specifying that states can refuse to recognize same sex marriages allowed in other states.
in 2012 in windsor v united states the supreme court struck down part of the defense of marriage act saying that the federal government could not limit marriage to one man and one woman.
doing so deprived people of their fifth amendment rights under the due process clause because it meant treating people from different states in different ways.
it also violated the rights of states to have different legislation on the issue.
the courts decision however did not overturn state laws regarding marriage.
in early 2014 17 states allowed same sex marriage and 28 states had amended their constitutions to define marriage as between one man and one woman.
also in early 2014 in eight different states judges had overturned state bans on same sex marriage and efforts were underway to bring the issue to the supreme court for final resolution.
america s challenges for a new century 643 clarifying second amendment rights another major development involving the bill of rights came in 2008 in the case of district of columbia v heller.
for the first time the supreme court ruled that the second amendment of the constitution gives individuals the right to own firearms.
the second amendment states a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed for decades supporters of gun control had pointed to the reference to a well regulated militia as evidence that the right did not extend to individuals but only to militias organized by state and federal governments.
in heller the supreme court found for the first time that an individual right to bear arms exists.
in 2010 in mcdonald v chicago the court incorporated the second amendment ruling that it also applies to the states and that state laws must recognize the right of individuals to bear arms.
for many conservatives and organizations such as the nra the decisions represented a major victory in their decades long effort to assert individual rights under the second amendment.
p reading progress check identifying central issues what were the causes of disagreement over setting economic policies.
political and economic issues guidingquestion why was it so difficult for congress and the president to reach agreement on ways to improve the economy.
despite the presidents stimulus plan the national economy suffered from persistently high rates of unemployment.
at the same time that federal funding expanded many state and local governments cut back on their spending and laid off teachers and other public workers.
young people who were just entering the workforce found the worst job market since the great depression.
the national debt spending and taxes the national debt grew alarmingly high.
among the causes of the increased debt were president obamas stimulus plan president george w bushs tax cuts the two wars in iraq and afghanistan an expansion of medicare to cover prescription drugs the housing crisis and the recession.
unemployment was a significant factor because those who lost their jobs or took lower paying employment paid less in taxes.
federal deficits required more borrowing which meant that the government had to pay more for the interest on its debts.
the issues of deficit spending the national debt and taxes drove the two political parties further apart.
the president appointed a commission to reach a compromise but its proposed solutions of cutting spending and raising taxes won little support in congress.
rather than confronting economic problems congress delayed these problems for future consideration.
significant supreme court decisions like congress the supreme court was deeply divided over the issues facing the nation and it reached major decisions with 5 to 4 margins.
in the case of citizens united v the federal elections commission 2010 the supreme court lifted many of the limits congress had set on campaign financing as a restriction on freedom of speech.
as a result corporations could make political contributions and wealthy individuals were free to make unlimited donations.
this ruling sent both political parties scrambling to raise campaign finances.
the ruling also allowed non party groups to spend massive amounts on media advertising.
the resulting onslaught of negative political advertising further propelled political polarization.
since conservative justices held a narrow majority on the supreme court there were doubts that it would uphold presidents obamas healthcare law as constitutional.
four of the justices believed that the government could not mandate that individuals must purchase health insurance or face a penalty.
four of the justices believed equally strongly that the government had constitutional authority to require insurance under its power to regulate interstate commerce.
chief justice john roberts cast the deciding vote in 2012.
in another 5 4 decision the court determined that congress could not legally command people to buy insurance but the federal government did have the power to tax those who did not buy insurance.
the 21 st century economy despite the wars and recessions that have affected the world since 2001 globalization has continued and the worlds economy has become increasingly interconnected.
contributing to this was the ongoing revolution in digital technology and communications.
the use of cell phones the internet and the computer has converged in a way that allows people to connect interact research create and work from anywhere at any time using a wide range of devices.
this new level of interactivity sometimes called hyperconnectivity has begun to transform society and the economy.
as christine lagarde the head of the international monetary fund observed if the previous revolutions were about using machines for brawn this is about using machines for brains multinational corporations rapidly adopted the new information and communications technology.
this allowed them to integrate their operations worldwide to a degree that was not possible in previous decades.
global financial corporations also used this technology to enable the worlds capital to flow rapidly to new opportunities.
yet these interconnections also posed a danger.
the world learned in 2008 that economic problems in one part of the world could affect other parts of the world very quickly.
the members of the supreme court in 2014 bottom clarence thomas antonin scalia john g roberts jr anthony kennedy ruth bader ginsburg top sonia sotomayor stephen g breyer samuel anthony alito jr elena kagan america s challenges for a new century 645 several new corporations led by innovative entrepreneurs found ways tc profit from the new interconnectivity.
steve jobs led apple corporation to enormous success through the introduction of new digital devices includim the iphone introduced in 2007 and the ipad a tablet computer introduced in 2010.
another key entrepreneur in the early 21st century was jeff bezos who founded in 1995 as an online bookstore.
amazon revolutionized online retailing and rapidly became one of the top 500 companies in the world selling almost any product through its website.
amazon has also helped drive the adoption of ebook readers and tablets.
google is another major multinational corporation that arose because o the internet.
founded in 1998 by sergey brin and larry page google began as a search engine for the internet.
the company had the goal of organizing the worlds information and making it accessible and useful.
google rapidly became the most widely used search engine in the world and as the company grew it expanded its research and development into other areas of software.
google maps revolutionized online map use and navigation.
google also financed and later acquired the android operating system widely used on smart phones and tablets.
google continues to fund research into new applications of digital technology including artificial intelligence self driving cars robotics translation software renewable energy and biotechnology.
although the digital revolution has led to the rise of many new technology companies many of the largest multinational corporations shaping the worlds economy predate the digital revolution.
of the 25 largest companies in the world in 2013 eleven were oil companies and four were car companies.
the need for energy and transportation continues to drive much of the worlds economic growth.
efforts are underway to develop alternative energy sources but the primary sources of the worlds energy remain fossil fuels oil coal and natural gas.
in the 1990s an oil and gas company run by entrepreneur george p mitchell developed a new technology hydraulic fracturing also known as fracking to extract gas from shale.
the technology triggered what has been called the shale boom the rapid growth of the gas and oil industry in parts of the united states where large shale formations exist.
fracking technology has helped reduce american dependence on foreign energy and played an important role in the economys recovery from the recession of 2008.
after critics raised concerns about its environmental impact political debates erupted in several states as to whether or not to allow fracking operations to proceed.
b reading progress check identifying central issues what economic solutions did liberals and conservative propose.
a troubled world guidingquestion how did international issues affect the united states.
u s wars in iraq and afghanistan president obama came to office determined to follow a more international approach to foreign policy.
his foreign policy therefore relied more on the united nations and sought to build consensus among american allies.
the obama administration ended the american combat mission in iraq and reduced the number of u s troops stationed there.
at the same time rk arab citizens in several north african nations conducted political protests against their dictator governments during president obama s first term.
this resulted in several regime changes in the regions raising some hopes that democracy might take hold in parts of the middle east.
the president expanded the american combat role in afghanistan.
its mission was to fight the taliban until afghan forces could defend the country on their own.
in 2011 a navy seal team located and killed osama bin laden the leader of al qaeda who had planned the 9 11 attacks on the united states.
the u s also made increased use of pilotless drone aircraft to track and eliminate other militant leaders of al qaeda.
while the drones reduced the chances of american and nato casualties they raised protests when they caused injury and death to innocent civilians near the target.
critics warned that the drone attacks would work against u s policy by alienating civilians who felt threatened by them.
between the iraq and afghanistan wars including military operations foreign aid and wounded veterans health care costs the united states paid more than a trillion dollars a year.
these costs helped fuel the deficits and national debt.
the arab spring the wars in iraq and afghanistan heightened tension between the united states and muslims around the world.
violent extremists sought to exploit this situation.
president obama went to egypt to speak at cairo university in 2009.
he called for a new beginning between the u s and the muslim world based on mutual respect.
he pledged to pursue a peaceful settlement of long dispute between israelis and palestinians and also to promote democracy and human rights against ruthless governments.
in 2011 popular unrest in the middle east led to a series of revolutions against oppressive governments.
the movement known as the arab spring overthrew dictators in tunisia libya and egypt.
since american troops were engaged in combat in afghanistan president obama was reluctant to provide american military support to the rebels in these nations.
instead he relied on other nato nations to provide the air support that helped rebels remove muammar qaddafi from power in libya.
overthrowing dictators caused political instability that posed serious problems for u s policy in the middle east.
some of the government that fell had been security partners with the u s.
there was a danger that religious extremists might gain power which would complicate relations with the u s america s challenges for a new century 647 make compromise with israel more difficult and jeopardize the supply of oil and other commerce from the middle east.
another uncertain danger was the possibility that iran could develop nuclear weapons.
the euro crisis a european debt crisis affected the american economy.
like the united states european nations had also experienced a collapse of their real estate markets bank failures and recession.
some of these governments including greece spain portugal italy and ireland struggled with high deficits and national debt.
high unemployment in these countries diminished their ability to trade with the u s which further slowed the american recovery.
many european countries share a common currency the euro so nations in the euro bloc that had economic problems looked for loans from other nations with stronger economies.
germany boasted the most prosperous economy in europe but germans were unhappy about bailing out those nations that mismanaged their finances.
in order to get financial support from the wealthier nations the debtor governments had to agree to reduce their government spending even though this triggered higher unemployment and further depressed their economies.
trade and investments closely connected the united states economy to europe.
uncertainties over europes economic future worried american investors.
american official encouraged european leaders to stabilize their economies.
debating un treaties from the moment the united nations was founded in 1945 it had critics in the united states.
some americans have been disappointed with the uns inability to act collectively to preserve peace and advance human rights.
others have worried that un treaties and rules might pose a danger to national sovereignty and american freedom.
frustration with the un has continued in the 21st century.
the bush administration found it very difficult to rally the un to support its war in iraq.
at the same time others have been concerned that new international treaties developed by the un endangered the nations sovereignty.
two recent issues have been the law of the sea treaty and the arms trade treaty the law of the sea treaty defines the rules and responsibilities of nations in their use of the worlds oceans.
various versions of the treaty have been debated for decades.
supporters argue that the treaty clearly establishe.
rules for the use of the ocean and resolving disputes.
opponents argue that it undermines national sovereignty by creating an international organization the seabed authority to resolve disputes.
they also point out that the treaty forces businesses to buy licenses to extract resources fron the seabed a form of taxation without representation.
although the unitec states signed the treaty the united states senate has not approved it.
another point of contention has been the arms trade treaty.
the treaty establishes international rules for the sale and transfer of arms between nations.
the proposed treaty was a result of growing concern that much of the violence and human rights violations in the world were a result of the illegal arms trade.
the treaty has been controversial.
many un members have argued that it is an infringement of national sovereignty.
within the united states opposition to the treaty has been strong.
the nra and heritage foundation as well as other political advocacy groups have argued that the treaty would infringe on the second amendment right to bear arms.
supporters of the treaty argue that it specifically pertains to international arms sales and would have no effect on the right to own many international treaties proposed by the un have been controversial and a subject of debate in american politics.
weapons within a nation.
critics point out the requirements of the treaty to monitor and track sales across borders necessarily means nations have to register the ownership of guns within their borders.
although the obama administration signed the treaty in september 2013 a majority of senators indicated they would not vote to approve it.
h reading progress check drawing conclusions what economic consequences did international issues have.
the election of 2012 guidingquestion what issues defined the campaigns of barack obama and mitt romney.
having been elected president in 2008 by promising hope and change president obama found his reelection jeopardized by the disappointingly slow recovery from the recession.
his opponents proposed a different route to economic revival.
the republican nomination after republicans won control of the house of representatives in 2010 the partys chances of defeating president obama seemed stronger.
the campaign for the republican nomination began more than a year before the election.
from the start former massachusetts governor mitt romney was the front runner.
as a former business executive he promised to apply his business leadership skills to improving the economy and putting more people back to work.
romney faced a large number of more conservative republican rivals.
although his rivals appealed to the tea party protest movement they could not match romneys organization and financial resources.
they portrayed romney as more liberal pointing out that he had signed into law a state healthcare bill that was strikingly similar to the presidents plan.
romney won the nomination in large part because republicans felt that he had the best chance of beating president obama.
romney selected wisconsin representative paul ryan for vice president.
as chair of the 1 house budget committee ryan appealed to conservatives for budget plans i for cutting government spending and reducing the budget.
the most 1 controversial provision of ryans budget plan would convert medicare into a system of vouchers.
america s challenges for a new century 649 geography connection the world in spatial terms what commonalities can you identify that united the states that voted for mitt romney.
places and regions why do you think president obama won upper midwest states such as ohio andmichigan.
a choice of different paths mitt romney asked voters if they were better off after four years of obamas leadership.
because the economy had collapsed before obama took office however romney could not blame the recession on him.
instead romney had to convince voters that he could do a better job leading the nation to economic recovery.
republicans believed that government controlled too much of citizens lives and that people should take care of themselves.
democrats argued that government had to do more to help citizens in need and raise living standard republicans saw the deficit as holding back economic development.
democrats said that deficit spending would stimulate the economy and create jobs.
republicans warned that government regulations were keeping business from being more productive and hiring more people.
democrats responded that after the economic collapse government should be more vigilant in regulating business to prevent further abuse.
republicans pledged to make further cuts in taxes.
democrats called for the wealthy to pay a larger share ol the taxes.
economic issues dominated the campaign.
the two parties also disagreed over such social issues as same sex marriage and abortion with republicans defending traditional moral values and democrats calling for greater tolerance.
on international issues by contrast the differences between the parties were less stark.
politics and the new media the internet increasingly played a role in american politics.
by the 2012 elections two thirds of all americans were using social networks.
unlike the traditional media social networks created more interaction by encouraging people to respond and to share information.
studies showed that many people were likely to vote if they learned through social network that their friends were voting.
political parties recognized that social networking had become a new way of getting their messages out.
pollsters 650 began charting public interest in the campaign by the number of tweets sent during the conventions and other political events.
the parties also made much use of email for fundraising.
presidential campaigns still relied largely on web sites to raise funds recruit volunteers and provide lengthier discussions of their positions on the issues.
independent bloggers commentators and satirists were also active much of it anonymously.
a popular tool was to post videos.
the candidates were the subjects of the videos and the traditional media made the videos but they were posted and spread online because of average citizens creating more democracy in the media.
this allowed ordinary citizens rather than politicians and the established media to frame the stories that the public will see and discuss.
obama wins a second term after a long expensive and hard fought campaign president obama won a second term in 2012.
the polls showed that the weakened economy remained the leading issue for the voters.
while people expressed disappointment over the slow recovery they credited the presidents efforts to rebuild the economy and restore employment.
a devastating hurricane also affected the campaign.
in october a major storm hit the atlantic coast flooding portions of new jersey and new york.
president obama took charge of the governments response to the crisis.
his actions earned him some bipartisan support in the final days of the election and may have played a role in convincing some undecided voters.
as americans debated the role of government in their lives the storm showed how essential effective government could be during an emergency.
the election left congress divided between a republican majority in the house of representatives and a democratic majority in the senate.
major issues of deficits taxes immigration and the environment remained unresolved.
they challenged both parties to break the partisan divide and legislative gridlock.
on election night however president obama spoke to the nation in hopeful terms suggesting that whatever the challenges ahead the nation would continue to move forward.

the decade also gave birth to a youth movement that challenged the american political syster and conventional middle class values.
the rise of the youth movement guidingquestion how were the protest techniques used by student protesters similar to c different from those ofthe civil rights movement.
the roots of the 1960s youth movement stretched back to the 1951 in the decade after world war ii the country had enjoyed a time peace and prosperity.
prosperity did not extend to all however.
some especially the artists and writers ofthe beat movement openly criticized american society.
they believed american society had come to value conformity over independence and financial gain ovei spiritual and social advancement.
at the same time the civil right movement raised serious questions about racism in american society the nuclear arms race between the united states and the soviet union made many of the nations youth fear for the future.
for many young people the events of the 1950s had called into questi the wisdom of their parents and their political leaders.
the youth movement originated with the baby boomers the huge generation born after world war ii.
by 1970 58 2 percent o the american population was under 35 years old.
the economic boom of the 1950s meant more families could afford to send theii children to college.
college life gave young people a sense of freedon and independence.
it was on college campuses across the nation that youth protest movements began and reached their peak.
students for a democratic society young people were concerned about the injustices they saw in the nations political and social system.
in their view a small wealthy elite controlled politics and wealth was unfairly divided.
these young people formed what came to be known as the new left.
520 a prominent organization within the new left was students for a democratic society sds.
it defined its views in a 1962 declaration known as the port huron statement.

the free speech movement another movement that captured the nations attention in the 1960s was the free speech movement led by mario savio and others at the university of california at berkeley.
the movement began in the fall of 1964 when the university decided to restrict students rights to distribute literature and to recruit volunteers for political causes on campus.
like many college students those at berkeley were dissatisfied with practices at their university.
huge classes were divided into sections and taught by graduate students.
many professors claimed they were too busy with research to meet with students.
faceless administrators made rules that were not always easy to obey and imposed punishments for violations.
feeling isolated in this impersonal environment many berkeley students rallied to support the free speech movement.
the struggle between berkeleys students and administrators peaked on december 2 1964 with a sit in and powerful speech by savio.
early the next morning 600 police officers entered the campus and arrested more than 700 protesters.
the arrests set off an even larger protest movement.

they created what became known as the counterculture and the people were commonly called hippie hippie culture originally hippies rejected rationality order and traditional middle class values.
they wanted to build a utopia a society that was freer closer to nature and full of love tolerance and cooperation.
many hippies wanted to drop out of society by leaving home.
they wanted to live together in communes group living arrangements in which members shared everything and worked together.

by the middle of th decade a new movement had emerged the feminist or womens liberation movement.
feminism is the belief that men and women should be equal politically economically and socially.
the onset of world war ii provided women with greater opportunity.
after the war however many women returned to traditional roles.
the new postwar emphasis on establishing families discouraged women from seeking employment.
despite the popular emphasis on homemaking the number of women who held jobs outside the home actually increased during the 1950s.
many women went to work to help their families maintain comfortable lifestyles.
by 1960 about one third of all married womei were part of the paid workforce.
yet many people continued to believe that women could better serve society by remaining in the home to influence the next generation of men.
origins of the movement by the early 1960s many women were increasingly resentful of a world where newspaper ads separated jobs by gender banks denied women credit and female employees often were paid less for the same work.
nearly half of american women worked by the mid 1960s but three fourths of these women worked in lower paying clerical sales or factory jobs or as cleaning women and hospital attendants.
524 one stimulus that invigorated the womens movement was the presidents commission on the status of women.
its report highlighted the problems women faced in the workplace and helped create a network of feminist activists who lobbied for womens legislation.
in 1963 they won passage of the equal pay act which in most cases outlawed paying men more than women for the same job.
many women who had stayed home were also discontent.
betty friedan tried to describe the reasons for this in her 1963 book the feminine mystique.
friedan had interviewed women who had graduated with her from smith college in 1942.
she reported that while most had everything they could want in life they felt unfulfilled.
as the book became a best seller women began reaching out to one another.
they poured out their anger and sadness in what came to be known as consciousness raising sessions.
while they talked about their unhappiness they were also building the base for a nationwide mass movement.
congress gave the womens movement another boost by including them in the 1964 civil rights act.
title vii of the act outlawed job discrimination not only on the basis of race color religion and national origin but also on the basis of gender.
this provided a strong legal basis for the changes the womens movement later demanded.
but simply having the law on the books was not enough.
even the agency charged with administering the civil rights act the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc ruled in 1965 that gender segregated help wanted ads were legal.
feminism the belief that men and women should be equal politically economically and socially gender term applied to the characteristics of a male or female the time is now by june 1966 betty friedan had returned to an idea that she and other women had been considering the need for an organization to promote feminist goals.
friedan and others then set out to form the national organization for women now.
in october 1966 a group of about 30 women and men held the founding conference of now.

now statement of purpose 1966 the new organization responded to frustrated housewives by demanding greater educational and career opportunities for women.
now leaders denounced the exclusion of women from certain professions and from most levels of politics.
now also was against the practice of paying women less than men for equal work.
this had been prohibited by the equal pay act but was still commonplace.
when now set out to pass an equal rights amendment to the constitution its membership rose to over 200 000.
by july 1972 the movement had its own magazine ms a key editor of ms was gloria steinem an author who became one of the movements leading figures.

critical thinking determining cause and effect what was one effect that gloria steinem had on the feminist movement.
successes and failures guiding question what political and economic gains did women make during this time.
during the late 1960s and early 1970s the womens movement fought to amend the constitution and enforce title vii of the civil rights act.
it also worked to repeal laws against abortion and pass legislation against gender discrimination in employment housing and education.
as a leading voice in the womens movement steinem explained the need for such legislation.
primary source uthe truth is that all our problems stem from the same sex based myths.
we may appear before you a white radicals or the middle aqed middle class or black soul sisters but we are all sisters in fighting against these outdated myths.
like racial myths they have been reflected in our laws gloria steinem from testimony before a senate subcommittee in support of the era may 19 thinkim like a i historian comparing and contrasting the emergence of social movements in the 1960s and 1970s has deep roots in american history.
social movements historians contend often share common goals quality of life issues political and democratic processes economic and environmental issues.
the significance of the two decades is the concentration of all such issues in a small time span gender equality at home and at work political issues and processes labor and civil rights causes and environmental and health concerns.
the equal rights amendment the womens movement seemed to be off to a strong start when congress passed the equal rights amendment era in march 1972.
the amendmei specified equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex to become part of the constitution the amendment had to be ratified by 38 states.
many state did so 35 by 1979 but then significant opposition to the amendment began to build.
opponents argued that it would take away some womens rights.
these included the right to alimony in divorce cases and the right to have singlegender colleges.
they feared it would eliminate womens exemption from tl draft and do away with laws that provided special protection for women in the workforce.
one outspoken opponent was phyllis schlafly organizer of the stop era campaign.
by the end of 1979 five states had voted to rescind their approval.
many people had become worried that the amendment would give federal courts too much power to interfere with state laws.
unable to achieve ratification by three fourths of the states by the deadline set by congress the era finally failed in 1982.
equality in education one major achievement of the movement came in the area of education.
kathy striebels experience illustrated the discrimination female students often faced in the early 1970s.
in 1971 striebel a junior high school student in st paul minnesota wanted to compete for her schools swim team but the school did not allow girls to join.
kathys mother charlotte was a member o the local now chapter.
through it she learned that st paul had recently banned gender discrimination in education.
she filed a grievance with the city s human rights department and officials required the school to allow kathy to swim.
onuxiiy alter joining me team kathy beat out one of the boys and ea a spot at a meet.
as she stood on the block waiting to swim the opposinj coach declared that she was ineligible because the meet was outside st pa and thus beyond the jurisdiction of its laws.
in response leaders of the womens movement lobbied to ban gende iscrimination in education.
in 1972 congress responded by passing a lav tk c itl y 7 l h edu tit amendments.
one section.
title ix pro lie e era y unded schools from discriminating against women 526 nearly all aspects of school operations from admissions to athletics.
title ix increased opportunities for women but it also had some surprising and unintended consequences.
within just a few years the number of women attending college surged and by 1978 the majority of people attending college were women.
by 2014 women made up approximately 58 of all college students.
title ix also created new opportunities for women in college athletics but it also increased expenses for colleges.
if a college needed to add a womens sport it would sometimes cancel a mens sport in order to pay for it.
in addition prior to title ix the majority of coaches for womens sports were women.
but after title ix as womens sports increased in funding and prestige men were attracted to the field as well.
today less than half of the coaches of womens sports in college are women.
right to privacy and roe v wade the feminist movement worked to secure the right to make private decisions including reproductive decisions.
a constitutional right to marital privacy was introduced in 1965 when the supreme court outlawed state bans on contraceptives for married couples in griswold v connecticut.
the right to privacy was expanded beyond married couples when activists began challenging laws against abortion.
until 1973 the right to regulate abortion was reserved to the states.
the original plan of the constitution reserved most police power to the states.
police power refers to the states authority to enact laws impinging on personal or property rights in the interest of safety health welfare and morality.
early in the countrys history some abortions were permitted in the early stages of pregnancy.
by the mid 1800s however states had passed laws prohibiting abortion except to save the life of the mother.
in the late 1960s some states began adopting more liberal abortion laws.
for example several states allowed abortion if carrying a pregnancy to term might endanger the womans mental health or if she was a victim of rape or incest.
the big change came with the 1973 supreme court decision in roe v wade.
the decision stated that state governments could not regulate abortion during the first three months of pregnancy a time that was ruled to be within a womans constitutional right to privacy.
during the second three months of pregnancy states could regulate abortions on the basis of the health of the mother.
states could ban abortion in the final three months except in cases of a medical emergency.
those in favor of abortion rights cheered roe v wade as a victory but the issue was far from settled politically.
the decision gave rise to the right to life movement whose members consider abortion morally wrong and work toward its total ban.
after the roe v wade ruling the two sides began an impassioned battle that continues today.
in the 1992 case planned parenthood v casey the supreme court modified roe v wade.
the court decided that states could place some restrictions on abortions.
for example doctors could be required to explain the risks and have patients give informed consent.
underage girls might now be required to inform their parents before getting an abortion although the court did strike down laws requiring women to notify their husbands before having an abortion.
it also abandoned the rule that states could ban abortion only in the final trimester.
technology had enabled a fetus to be viable outside the womb much earlier in a pregnancy.
states could now restrict abortion based on the viability ofthe fetus.

more women are working outside the home today in the united states than ever before.
criticalthinking making connections how does the women s movement ofthe 1960s and 1970s help working women today.
the impact of the feminist movement the womens movement profoundly changed society.
since the 1970s many women have pursued college degrees and careers outside ofthe home.
many employers now offer options to help women make work life more compatible with family life including flexible hours on site child care and job sharing.
even with those changes a significant income gap between men and women still exists.
a major reason for the gap is that many working women still hold lower paying jobs such as bank tellers administrative assistants cashiers schoolteachers and nurses.
women have made the most dramatic gains in professional jobs since the 1970s.
by 2000 women made up more than 40 percent of the nations graduates receiving medical or law degrees.

during the 1920s half a million mexicans immigrated to the united states through official channels.
an unknown number entered the country through other means.
while some persons of mexican heritage moved to northern states most remained concentrated in the areas that were once the northern provinces of mexico.
in 1930 90 percent of ethnic mexicans in the united states lived in areas of the west and southwest.
as a result of heavy mexican immigration the ethnic mexican population in texas grew from 71 062 in 1900 to 683 681 in 1930.
southern california likewise had a large spanish speaking population.
mexicans face discrimination across the southwest most mexican americans lived in barrios.
barrios were the product of a combination of the regions history and discrimination against latinos.
los angeles was founded as a spanish town in 1781.
a century later when english speaking settlers arrived they built around the older spanish speaking district.

some left voluntarily believing it would be easier to get by in mexico.
others left as part of the repatriation a series of deportations launched by federal officials.
this included not only immigrants but often their american born children as well.
during world war ii labor shortages in the southwest led to the creation of the bracero program.
under this arrangement mexican workers entered into short term labor contracts mostly as low wage farmworkers.
meanwhile illegal immigration also increased.
in 1954 eisenhowers administration launched a program intended to deport undocumented latino immigrants.
police swept through barrios seeking undocumented immigrants.
as a result more than 3 7 million mexicans were deported over the next three years.
the raids were criticized in the united states and in mexico for intimidating people for simply looking mexican in addition the program often failed to distinguish between individuals legally in the country including u s citizens and those who had entered illegally.
other latinos arrive although mexicans remained the largest group of spanish speaking newcomers in the 1950s large numbers of puerto ricans arrived as well.

latinos organize guidingquestion how was the latino approach to gaining civil rights similar to and different from the african american civil rights movement.
regardless of their citizenship status people of mexican heritage were often treated as outsiders by the english speaking majority.
latinos formed organizations to work for equal rights and fair treatment.
in 1929 a number of mexican american organizations came together to create the league of united latin american citizens lulac.
the organizations purpose was to fight discrimination against persons of latin american ancestry.
membership was limited to those of latin american heritage who were u s citizens.
lulac encouraged assimilation into american society and adopted english as its official language.
in mendez v westminster 1947 a group of mexican parents won a lawsuit that challenged school segregation in california.
two years after the mendez case lulac filed a similar lawsuit that aimed to end the practice of segregating spanish speaking children into mexican schools in the state of texas.
during the 1950s the organization was also a vocal critic of the abuses of deportation authorities.
in 1954 the supreme courts ruling in hernandez v texas extended more rights to latino citizens.
the case ended the exclusion of mexican americans from juries in texas.
another latino organization the american gi forum was founded by dr hector p garcia.
the purpose of the gi forum was to protect the rights of mexican american veterans.
after world war ii latino veterans were excluded from veterans organizations.
they were also denied medical services by the veterans administration.
the gi forums first effort to combat racial injustice involved a mexican american soldier killed during world war ii.
a funeral home refused to hold his funeral because he was mexican american.
the gi forum drew national attention to the incident and the soldier s remains were buried in arlington national cemetery.

encouraged by the african american civil rights movement latinos launched a series of campaigns to improve their economic situation anden discrimination.
in the early 1960s cesar chavez and dolores huerta organized two groups that fought for farmworkers.
in 1965 the groups went on strike in california to demand union recognition increased wages and better benefits.
when employers resisted chavez organized a national boycott of table grapes.
between 14 and 17 million citizens stopped buying grapes and industry profits tumbled.
in 1966 chavez and huerta merged their tw organizations into the united farm workers ufw.
chavez held a hunger strike in 1968 to support the effort.
a ufw spokesman described the impact the hunger strike had on chavez and the farmworkers after twenty five days cesar was carried to a nearby park where the fast ended during a mass with thousands of farmworkers.
he had lost thirty five pounds but there was no more talk about violence among the farmworkers the new union kept the boycott going until 1970 when the grape growers finally agreed to raise wages and improve working conditions.
latino youths also became involved in civil rights.
in 1967 college students in san antonio texas led by jose angel gutierrez founded the mexican american youth organization mayo.
mayo organized walkouts and demonstrations to protest discrimination.
one texas walkou led to the creation of bilingual education at a local high school.
mayos success and the spread of protests across the west and southwest convinced gutierrez to found a new political party in 1969.
it was called la raza unida or the united people la raza unida mobilize mexican american voters with calls for job training programs and greater access to financial institutions.
by the early 1970s it had elected latinos tc local offices in several cities with large latino populations.
a larger civil rights movement among mexican americans many of whom began callinj themselves chicanos emerged.
the movement fought against discrimination and celebrated ethnic pride.
in the late 1960s many latino leaders promoted bilingualism the practice of teaching immigrant students in their own language while they also learned english.
congress supported this movement by passing the bilingual education act in 1968 which directed school districts to set up classes for immigrants in their own language while they were learning english.
this became politically controversial.

artists often working 532 with teams of volunteers from local communities began creating large brightly colored murals on the walls of city buildings schools churches highway overpasses and apartment buildings.
the style ofthe murals was inspired by the works of artists diego garcia and jose orozco.
the murals depicted mexican american culture which is why the movement came to be known as the chicano mural movement.
the style of the murals resembled the styles of art in ancient mexico but it reflected the characteristics and issues of the 1960s and 1970s.
the murals reminded latinos of their cultural heritage and religion portrayed economic and social problems especially those facing farm workers and domestic workers and challenged the racism of the era.
murals also included portraits of cesar chavez famous latino heroes from american mexican and texan history pictures of missions and religious scenes.
an important positive impact of the chicano mural movement was that it helped remind hispanics of their identity their contributions to the united states and encouraged them to support the struggle for their rights.
as with all cultural movements that emphasize an ethnic identity however a potential negative effect of the movement was that it might also have i contributed to division among communities rather emphasizing common ground among all americans.
in addition of course because it was a form 1 of public art not everyone approved.
some people found some images i disturbing and others complained that the murals despite their beautiful colors and artistry were like graffiti and defaced public surfaces.
