the conservative movement builds ever since senator barry goldwater of arizona had run for president in 1964 conservatives had argued that state governments businesses and individuals needed more freedom from the heavy hand of washington d c by 1980 government 830 chapter 25 i spending on entitlement programs programs that provide guaranteed benefits to particular groups was nearly 300 billion annually.
the costs together with stories of fraudulently obtained benefits caused resentment among many taxpayers.
in addition some people had become frustrated with the government s civil rights policies.
congress had passed the civil rights act of 1964 in an effort to eliminate racial discrimination.
over the years however judicial decisions and government regulations had broadened the reach of the act.
a growing number of americans viewed with skepticism what had begun as a movement toward equal opportunity.

main idea analyzing issues what was the agenda of the new right.
the new right as the 1970s progressed right wing grass roots groups across the country emerged to support and promote single issues that reflected their key interests.
these people became known as the new right.
the new right focused its energy on controversial social issues such as opposing abortion blocking the equal rights amendment and evading court ordered busing.
it also called for a return to school prayer which had been outlawed by the supreme court in 1962.
many in the new right criticized the policy of affirmative action.
affirmative action required employers and educational institutions to give special consideration to women african americans and other minority groups even though these people were not necessarily better qualified.
many conser vatives saw affirmative action as a form of reverse discrimination favoring one group over another on the basis of race or gender.
to members of the new right liberal positions on affirmative action and other issues represented an assault on traditional values.
the conservative coalition beginning in the mid 1960s the conservative movement in the united states grew in strength.
eventually conservative groups formed the conservative coalition an alliance of business leaders middle class voters disaffected democrats and fundamentalist christian groups.
conservative intellectuals argued the cause of the conservative coalition in newspapers such as the wall street journal and magazines such as the national review founded in 1955 by conservative william f buckley jr conservative think tanks such as the american enterprise institute and the heritage foundation were founded to develop conservative policies and principles that would appeal to the majority of voters.
the moral majority religion especially evangelical christianity played a key role in the growing strength of the conservative coalition.
the 1970s had brought a huge religious revival especially among fundamentalist sects.
each week millions of americans watched evangelist preachers on television or listened to them on the radio.
two of the most influential televangelists were jerry falwell and pat robertson.
falwell formed an organization called the moral majority.
the moral majority consisted mostly of evangelical and fundamentalist christians who interpreted goals of the conservative movement shrink the size of the federal government and reduce spending promote family values and patriotic ideals stimulate business by reducing government regulations and lowering taxes strengthen the national defense the conservative tidi the bible literally and believed in absolute standards of right and wrong.
they condemned liberal attitudes and behaviors and argued for a restoration of tradi tional moral values.
they worked toward their political goals by using direct mail campaigns and by raising money to support candidates.
jerry falwell became the spokesperson for the moral majority.
a personal voice reverend jerry falwell 46 our nations internal problems are the direct result of her spiritual condition.
right living must be reestablished as an american way of life.
now is the time to begin calling america back to god back to the bible back to morality.
as individual conservative groups formed networks they created a movement dedicated to bringing back what they saw as traditional 11 family values.

president ronald reagan throughout the 1980 presidential campaign and in the early days of his administration president reagan emphasized the perilous state of the economy during the carter administration.
in a speech to the nation on february 5 1981 his first televised speech from the white house reagan announced his new economic program.
he called for a reduction in income tax rates for individuals and a big reduction in government spending.
a personal voice ronald reagan im speaking to you tonight to give you a report on the state of our nations economy.
i regret to say that were in the worst economic mess since the great depression.
its time to recognize that weve come to a turning point.
were threatened with an economic calamity of tremendous proportions and the old business as usual treatment cant save us.
together we must chart a different course.
televised speech to the nation february 5 1981 president reagan would deal with these problems by consistently stressing a sweeping package of new economic policies.
these economic policies dubbed reaganomics consisted of three parts 1 budget cuts 2 tax cuts and 3 increased defense spending.
reaganomics takes over as soon as reagan took office he worked to reduce the size and influence of the federal government which he thought would encourage private investment.
because people were anxious about the economy in 1980 their concern opened the door for new approaches to taxes and the federal budget.
834 chapter 25 main idea summarizing what are the main ideas of supply side economics.
dget cuts reagan s strategy for downsizing the federal government included eep cuts in government spending on social programs.
yet his cuts did not affect a segments of the population equally.
entitlement programs that benefited the middle class such as social security medicare and veterans pensions remained intact.
on the other hand congress slashed by 10 percent the budget for programs that benefited other groups urban mass transit food stamps welfare benefits job training medicaid school lunches and student loans.
tax cuts reaganomics rested heavily upon supply side economics.
this theory held that if people paid fewer taxes they would save more money.
banks could then loan that money to businesses which could invest the money in resources to improve productivity.
the supply of goods then would increase driving down prices.
at reagan s urging congress lowered income taxes by about 25 percent over a three year period.
reagan based his ideas for supply side economics on the work of economists such as george gilder and arthur laffer aj a personal voice arthur laffer the most debilitating act a government can perpetrate on its citizens is to adopt policies that destroy the economys production base for it is the production base that generates any prosperity to be found in the society.
u s tax policies over the last decade have had the effect of damaging this base by removing many of the incentives to economic advancement.
it is necessary to restore those incentives if we are to cure our economic palsy.
the economics of the tax revolt a reader increased defense spending at the same time reagan authorized increases in military spending that more than offset cuts in social programs.
between 1981 and 1984 the defense department budget almost doubled.
indeed the president revived two controversial weapons systems the mx missile and the b l bomber.
in 1983 reagan asked the country s scientists to develop a defense system that would keep americans safe from enemy missiles.
officially called the strategic defense initiative or sdi the system quickly became known as star wars after the title of a popular movie.
the defense department estimated that the system would cost trillions of dollars.
recession and recovery while reagan was charting a new course for the american economy the economy itself was sinking into recession.
lasting from july 1981 until november 1982 it was the most severe recession since the great depression.
however early in 1983 an economic upturn began as consumers went on a spending spree.
their confidence in the economy was bolstered by tax cuts a decline in interest rates and lower inflation.
the stock market surged unemployment declined and the gross national product went up by almost 10 percent.
the stock market boom lasted until 1987 when the market crashed losing 508 points in one day.
this fall was due in large part to automated and computerized buying and selling systems.
however the market recovered and then continued its upward climb.
the national debt climbs beneath the surface of recovery lay problems that continued to plague the economy.
tax cuts had helped the rich while social welfare cuts had hurt the poor.
despite large reductions in parts of the background the trickle down theory ronald reagans budget director david stockman used supply side economics to draft the economic recovery tax act of 1981.
his tax package cut income taxes and business taxes by an average of 25 percent the largest tax cuts went to those with the highest incomes.
administration officials defended the plan by claiming that as prosperity returned the profits at the top would trickle down to the middle class and even the poor.
despite reagans trickle down theory the wealthy gained the most from these tax cuts.
in the 1980s the rich got richer as poverty deepened for many others.

main idea anita hill and clarence thomas testify before the senate judiciary committee in october 1991.
budget federal spending still outstripped federal revenue.
budget deficits were growing.
even though reagan backed away from supply side economics in 1982 and imposed new taxes they were not enough to balance the budget.
by the end of his first term the national debt had almost doubled.
b judicial power shifts to the right one of the most important ways in which reagan accomplished his conservative goals was through his appointments to the supreme court.
reagan nominated sandra day o connor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy to fill seats left by retiring judges.
o connor was the first woman to be appointed to the court.
he also nominated justice william rehnquist the most conservative justice on the court at the time to the position of chief justice.
president bush later made the court even more conservative when david h souter replaced retiring justice william brennan.
bush also nominated clarence thomas to take the place of thurgood marshall.
however controversy exploded when law professor anita hill testified that thomas had sexually harassed her when she worked for him in the 1980s.
during several days of televised senate hearings committee members questioned thomas hill and witnesses for each side.
thomas eventually won approval by a final vote of 52 to 48.
the reagan and bush appointments to the supreme court ended the liberal control over the court that had begun under franklin roosevelt.
these appointments became increasingly significant as the court revisited constitutional issues related to such topics as discrimination abortion and affirmative action.
in 1989 the court in a series of rulings restricted a woman s right to an abortion.
the court also imposed new restrictions on civil rights laws that had been designed to protect the rights of women and minorities.
during the 1990 1991 session the court narrowed the rights of arrested persons.
analyzing effects what were some of the effects of reaganomics 836 chapter 25 deregulating the economy reagan achieved one of his most important objectives reducing the size and power of the federal government in part by cutting federal entitlement programs but also through deregulation the cutting back of federal regulation of industry.
as part of his campaign for smaller government he removed price controls on oil and eliminated federal health and safety inspections for nursing homes.
he deregulated the airline industry allowing airlines to abandon unprofitable air routes and the savings and loan industry.
one of the positive results of this deregulation was that it increased competition and often resulted in lower prices for consumers.
in a further effort at deregulation president reagan cut the budget of the environmental protection agency epa which had been established in 1970 to fight pollution and conserve natural resources.
he ignored pleas from canada to reduce acid rain and appointed opponents of the regulations to enforce them.
for example james watt reagan s secretary of the interior sold millions of acres of public land to private developers often at bargain prices.
he opened the continental shelf to oil and gas drilling which many people thought posed environmental risks.
watt also encouraged timber cutting in national forests and eased restrictions on coal mining.
a history video president reagan shot 71 historical spotlight conservative victories in 1984 and 1988 it was clear by 1984 that reagan had forged a large coalition of conservative voters who highly approved of his policies.

at the end of 2008 the number of adults and children living with hiv aids worldwide was estimated at 33 4 million people of whom the proportions of males and females were almost equal.
increasing numbers grew so did concern health issues one of the most troubling issues that concerned americans in the 1980s was aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
possibly beginning as early as the 1960s aids spread rapidly throughout the world.
caused by a virus that destroys the immune system aids weakens the body so that it is prone to infections and normally rare cancers.
aids is transmitted through bodily fluids and most of the early victims of the disease were either homosexual men or intravenous drug users who shared needles.
however many people also contracted aids through contaminated blood transfusions and children acquired it by being born to infected mothers.
as the 1980s progressed of heterosexuals began contracting aids.
as the epidemic over prevention and cure.
abortion many americans were concerned about abortion in the 1980s.
abortion had been legal in the united states since 1973 when the supreme court ruled in roe v wade that first trimester abortions were protected by a woman s right to privacy.
opponents of legalized abortion quickly organized under the pro life banner.
they argued that human life begins at conception and that no woman has the right to terminate a human life by her individual decision.
proponents of legalized abortion described themselves as pro choice.
they argued that reproductive choices were personal health care matters and noted that many women had died from abortions performed by unskilled people in unsterile settings before the procedure was legalized.
in july 1989 the supreme court ruled in webster v reproductive health care services that states had the right to impose new restrictions on abortion.
as a result abortion restrictions varied from state to state.

main idea identifying problems b what problems in education emerged during the 1980s.
education education became another issue that stirred people s concerns.
in 1983 a federal commission issued a report on education titled a nation at risk.
the report revealed that american students lagged behind students in most other industrialized nations.
in addition the report stated that 23 million americans were unable to follow an instruction manual or fill out a job application form.
the commission s findings touched off a debate about the quality of education.
the commission recommended more homework longer school days and an extended school year.
it also promoted increased pay and merit raises for teachers as well as a greater emphasis on basic subjects such as english math science social studies and computer science.
in april 1991 president bush announced an education initiative america 2000.
he argued that choice was the salvation of american schools and recommended allowing parents to use public funds to send their children to schools of their choice public private or religious.
first lady barbara bush toured the country to promote reading and writing skills.
the urban crisis the crisis in education was closely connected to the crisis in the cities.
many undereducated students lived in cities such as baltimore chicago detroit philadelphia and washington d c during the 1970s the united states had become increasingly suburbanized as more and more white families responded to the lure of new homes big lawns shopping malls and well equipped schools outside the cities.
businesses moved too taking jobs and tax revenue with them.
poor people and racial minorities were often left in cities burdened by high unemployment rates crumbling infrastructures inadequate funds for sanitation and health services deteriorating schools and growing social problems.
by 1992 thousands of people were homeless including many families with children.
cities were increasingly divided into wealthy neighborhoods and poverty stricken areas.
one poverty stricken area south central los angeles which had erupted in violence in 1965 and 1968 erupted again in 1992.
four white police officers had been videotaped beating an african american man named rodney king who had been fleeing from the officers in a speeding car.

beginning in 1981 nasa directed a series of space shuttle flights.
the agency hoped to establish a space station and have the shuttle ferry workers and materials to it.
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 in which the crew was killed crew shown above caused a reexamination of ventures into space.
many people thought the money spent on space should be spent on social needs.
should the federal government spend money on space exploration when so many american citizens require basic assistance.
if you were a legislator being asked to vote in favor of funding space exploration today how would you vote.
the equal rights struggle within this environment of dwindling resources and social struggle women worked to achieve economic and social gains.
geraldine ferraro speaks at the 1984 democratic convention.
political losses and gains during the early 1980s women s rights activists worked to obtain ratification of the equal rights amendment era.
although congress had passed the amendment in 1972 it had not yet been ratified or approved by three fourths of the states.
supporters of the amendment had until june 30 1982 to gain ratification from 38 states.
they obtained only 35 of the 38 ratifications they needed and the era did not become law.
with the failure of the equal rights amendment women s organizations began to concentrate on electing women to public office.
more women candidates began to run for office and in 1984 the democrats chose geraldine ferraro as their vice presidential candidate.
she had spoken of the necessity for women to continue working for equal opportunities in american society.

what conclusion can you draw from this chart.
in the november 1992 election the number of women in the house of representatives increased from 23 to 47 and the number of women senators tripled from two to six.
president reagan also had earlier named two women to his cabinet in 1983 elizabeth dole became secretary of transportation and margaret heckler became secretary of health and human services.
nevertheless women remained underrepresented in political affairs.
inequality several factors contributed to what some called the feminization of poverty.
by 1992 57 8 percent of the nation s women were part of the work force and a growing percentage of women worked as professionals and managers.
however in that year women earned only about 75 cents for every dollar men earned.

north appeared in military uniform adorned with service ribbons and badges.
in defending his actions north talked about patriotism and love of country.
he asserted that he thought he was carrying out the president s wishes and that the end of helping the contras justified almost any means.

what does the cartoonist suggest about nixon by showing him leaving with his bags packed.
whom do the children represent in this cartoon.
main idea summarizing what was the goal of nixons new federalism.
new federalism one of the main items on president nixon s agenda was to decrease the size and influence of the federal government.
nixon believed that lyndon johnson s great society programs by promoting greater federal involvement with social problems had given the federal government too much responsibility.
nixon s plan known as new federalism was to distribute a portion of federal power to state and local governments.
a to implement this program nixon proposed a plan to give more financial freedom to local governments.
normally the federal government told state and local governments how to spend their federal money.
under revenue sharing state and local governments could spend their federal dollars however they saw fit within certain limitations.
in 1972 the revenue sharing bill known as the state and local fiscal assistance act became law.
welfare reform nixon was not as successful however in his attempt to overhaul welfare which he believed had grown cumbersome and inefficient.
in 1969 the president advocated the so called family assistance plan fap.
under the fap every family of four with no outside income would receive a basic federal payment of 1 600 a year with a provision to earn up to 4 000 a year in supplemental income.
unemployed participants excluding mothers of preschool children would have to take job training and accept any reasonable work offered them.
nixon presented the plan in conservative terms as a program that would reduce the supervisory role of the federal government and make welfare recipients responsible for their own lives.
the house approved the plan in 1970.
however when the bill reached the senate lawmakers from both parties attacked it.
liberal legislators considered the minimum payments too low and the work requirement too stiff while conservatives objected to the notion of guaranteed income.
the bill went down in defeat.
new federalism wears two faces in the end nixon s new federalism enhanced several key federal programs as it dismantled others.
to win backing for his new federalism program from a democrat controlled congress nixon sup ported a number of congressional measures to increase federal spending for some social programs.
without fanfare the nixon administration increased social an age of limits security medicare and medicaid payments and made food stamps more accessible.
however the president also worked to dismantle some of the nation s social programs.
throughout his term nixon tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the job corps program that provided job training for the unemployed and in 1970 he vetoed a bill to provide additional funding for housing and urban development.
confronted by laws that he opposed nixon also turned to a little used presidential practice called impoundment.
nixon impounded or withheld necessary funds for programs thus holding up their implementation.
by 1973 it was believed that nixon had impounded almost 15 billion affecting more than 100 federal programs including those for health housing and education.
the federal courts eventually ordered the release of the impounded funds.
they ruled that presidential impoundment was unconstitutional and that only congress had the authority to decide how federal funds should be spent.
nixon did use his presidential authority to abolish the office of economic opportunity a cornerstone of johnson s antipoverty program jj law and order politics as president nixon fought with both houses of congress he also battled the more liberal elements of society including the antiwar movement.
nixon had been elected in 1968 on a dual promise to end the war in vietnam and mend the divisiveness within america that the war had created.
throughout his first term nixon aggressively moved to fulfill both pledges.
the president de escalated america s involvement in vietnam and oversaw peace negotiations with north vietnam.
at the same time he began the taw and order policies that he had promised his silent majority those middle class americans who wanted order restored to a country beset by urban riots and antiwar demonstrations.
to accomplish this nixon used the full resources of his office sometimes illegally.
nixon and members of his staff ordered wiretaps of many left wing individuals and the democratic party offices at the watergate office building in washington d c.
the cia also investigated and compiled documents on thousands of american dissidents people who objected to the government s policies.
the administration even used the internal revenue service to audit the tax returns of antiwar and civil rights activists.
nixon began building a personal enemies list of prominent americans whom the administration would harass.
nixon also enlisted the help of his combative vice president spiro t agnew to denounce the opposition.
the vice president confronted the antiwar protesters and then turned his scorn on those who controlled the media whom he viewed as liberal cheerleaders for the antiwar movement.
known for his colorful quotes agnew lashed out at the media and liberals as an effete weak corps of impudent snobs and nattering nabobs of negativism.
historical spotlight americans walk on the moon not all was political war during the nixon administration.
on july 20 1969 one of americas long held dreams became a reality.
nearly ten years after john f kennedy challenged america to put a person on the moon astronaut neil armstrong climbed down the ladder of his lunar module and stepped onto the surface of the moon.
thats one small step for man armstrong said one giant leap for mankind americans swelled with pride and accomplishment as they watched the historic moon landing on their televisions.
speaking to the astronauts from the white house president nixon said for every american this has to be the proudest day of our lives neil armstrongs photograph of buzz aldrin on the moon main idea analyzing issues in what ways did nixon both strengthen and weaken federal programs.
nixons southern strategy even as president nixon worked to steer the country along a more conservative course he had his eyes on the 1972 presidential election.
nixon had won a slim majority in 1968 less than one percent of the popular vote.
as president he began 796 chapter 24 j main idea forming generalizations q why had many democratic voters in the south become potential republican supporters by 1968.
working to forge a new conservative coalition to build on his support.
in one approach known as the southern strategy nixon tried to attract southern conservative democrats.
by winning over these voters and other discontented democrats the president and his fellow republicans hoped not only to keep the white house but also to recapture a majority in congress.
a new south since reconstruction the south had been a democratic stronghold.
but by 1968 many white southern democrats had grown disillusioned with their party.
in their eyes the party champion of the great society and civil rights had grown too liberal.
this conservative backlash first surfaced in the 1968 election when thousands of southern democrats helped former alabama governor george wallace a conservative segregationist running as an independent carry five southern states and capture 13 percent of the popular vote.
these southern democrats were unhappy with federal desegregation policies and a liberal supreme court.
they formed a congressional bloc in an effort to block integration and maintain the status quo.
nixon slows integration to attract white voters in the south president nixon decided on a policy of slowing the country s desegregation efforts.
in september of 1969 less than a year after being elected president nixon made clear his views on civil rights.
there are those who want instant integration and those who want segregation forever.
i believe we need to have a middle course between those two extremes he said.
throughout his first term president nixon worked to reverse several civil rights policies.
in 1969 he ordered the department of health education and welfare hew to delay desegregation plans for school districts in south carolina and mississippi.
nixon s actions violated the supreme court s second brown v board of education ruling which called for the desegregation of schools with all deliberate speed.
in response to an naacp suit the high court ordered nixon to abide by the second brown ruling.
the president did so reluctantly and by 1972 nearly 90 percent of children in the south attended desegregated schools up from about 20 percent in 1969.
in a further attempt to chip away at civil rights advances nixon opposed the extension of the voting rights act of 1965.
the act had added nearly one million african americans to the voting rolls.
despite the president s opposition congress voted to extend the act.
jj controversy over busing president nixon then attempted to yet another civil rights initiative the integration of schools through busing.
in 1971 the supreme court ruled in swann v charlotte mecklenburg board of education that school districts may bus students to other schools to end the pattern of all black or all white educational institutions.
white students and parents in cities such as boston and detroit angrily protested busing.
one south boston mother spoke for other white northerners many of whom still struggled with the integration process.
mm idea analyzing motives why did president nixon oppose the extension of the voting rights act.
a demonstrator in boston protests court ordered school busing during the early 1970s.
spotlight historical the twenty sixth amendment during president nixons first term the twenty sixth amendment was ratified in 1971 extending voting rights to americans 18 years or older.
the amendment was one example of efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to expand opportunities to participate in government.
at the time liberals supported the amendment because they believed that young people were more likely to be liberal.
conservatives opposed it because they didnt want to extend the vote to more liberals.
opponents also argued that the amendment would be too expensive for states to administer and that 18 year olds were not mature enough for the responsibility.
many americans however considered it unfair to be asked to fight and die for their country in vietnam without being allowed to vote.
nixon also opposed integration through busing and went on national television to urge congress to halt the practice.
while busing continued in some cities nixon had made his position clear to the country and to the south.
a battle over the supreme court during the 1968 campaign nixon had criticized the warren court for being too liberal.
once in the white house nixon suddenly found himself with an opportunity to change the direction of the court.
during nixon s first term four justices including chief justice earl warren left the bench through retirement.
president nixon quickly moved to put a more conservative face on the court.
in 1969 the senate approved nixon s chief justice appointee u s court of appeals judge warren burger.
eventually nixon placed on the bench three more justices who tilted the court in a more conservative direction.
however the newly shaped court did not always take the conservative route for example it handed down the 1971 ruling in favor of racially integrating schools through busing.
main idea summarizing jp what was nixons southern strategy and how did he implement it.
confronting a stagnant economy one of the more pressing issues facing richard nixon was a troubled economy.
between 1967 and 1973 the united states faced high inflation and high unemployment a sit uation economists called stagflation.
the causes of stagflation the economic problems of the late 1960s and early 1970s had several causes.
chief among them was high inflation a result of lyndon johnson s policy to fund the war and social programs through deficit spending.
a flood of new workers includ ing women and baby boomers also led to stagflation.
in addition the nation s economic woes reflected the dynamic dependent on relationship between international trade policies and the foreign oil u s free enterprise system.
increased competition in inter americans in national trade as well as the nation s heavy dependency wait in line for gas during the oil embargo.
vocabulary cartel a bloc of independent business organizations that controls a service or business main idea analyzing causes what factors brought on the countrys economic problems in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
on foreign oil were also contributing factors.
during the 1960s america received much of its petroleum from the oil producing countries of the middle east.
many of these countries belonged to a cartel called opec organization of petroleum exporting countries.
the united states was dependent on opec oil for a significant amount of its large petroleum needs and that dependence was growing.
in 1970 the united states had gotten just over a fifth of its oil from foreign sources.
by 1973 that figure had risen to about a third.
during the 1960s opec gradually raised oil prices.
then in 1973 egypt and syria started the yorn kippur war against israel.
the war the climax of years of intense border disputes was short but brutal.
the soviet union offered supplies to the egyptians and the syrians.
in turn the united states sent massive amounts of military aid to israel its longtime ally.
u s officials also worked to broker a cease fire between the warring nations.
still arab oil producing nations responded by cutting off all oil sales to the united states.
when they resumed selling oil to the united states in 1974 the price had quadrupled.
this sharp rise in oil prices only worsened the problem of inflation.
nixon battles stagflation president nixon took several steps to combat stagflation but none met with much success.
to reverse deficit spending nixon attempted to raise taxes and cut the budget.
congress however refused to go along with this plan.
in another effort to slow inflation nixon tried to reduce the amount of money in circulation by urging that interest rates be raised.
this measure did little except drive the country into a mild recession or an overall slowdown of the economy.
in august 1971 the president turned to price and wage controls to stop inflation.
he froze workers wages as well as businesses prices and fees for 90 days.
inflation eased for a short time but the recession continued.
nixons foreign policy triumphs richard nixon admittedly preferred world affairs to domestic policy.
i ve always thought this country could run itself domestically without a president he said in 1968.
throughout his presidency nixon s top priority was gaining an honorable peace in vietnam.
at the same time he also made significant advances in america s relationships with china and the soviet union.
kissinger and realpolitik the architect of nixon s foreign policy was his adviser for national security affairs henry kissinger.
kissinger who would later become nixon s secretary of state promoted a philosophy known as realpolitik from a german term meaning political realism.
according to realpolitik foreign policy should be based solely on consideration of power not ideals or moral principles.
kissinger believed in evaluating a nation s power not its philosophy or beliefs.
if a country was weak kissinger argued it was often more practical to ignore that country even if it was communist.
realpolitik marked a departure from the former confrontational policy of containment which refused to recognize the major communist countries.
on the other hand kissinger s philosophy called for the united states to fully confront the powerful nations of the globe.
in the world of realpolitik however confrontation largely meant negotiation as well as military engagement.
nixon shared kissinger s belief in realpolitik and together the two men adopted a more flexible approach in dealing with communist nations.
they called their policy detente a policy aimed at easing cold war tensions.
one of the most startling applications of detente came in early 1972 when president nixon who had risen in politics as a strong anti communist visited communist china.
31 main idea summarizing what was the philosophy of realpolitik.
an age of li nixon visits china since the takeover of mainland china by the communists in 1949 the united states had not formally recognized the chinese communist government.
in late 1971 nixon reversed that policy by announ 4 president nixon tours the great wail as part of his visit to china in 1972 i the hurdles that richard nixon overcame to win the presidency in 1968 included his loss in the 1960 presidential race and a 1962 defeat in the race for governor of california.
nixon faced many obstacles from the start.
as a boy he rose every day at 4 a m to help in his fathers grocery store.
nixon also worked as a janitor a bean picker and a barker at an amusement park.
the nixon family suffered great tragedy when one of nixons brothers died from meningitis and another from tuberculosis.
none of these traumatic experiences however dulled the future presidents ambition.
nixon finished third in his law class at duke university and after serving in world war ii he launched his political career.
after winning a seat in congress in 1946 nixon announced i had to win.
thats the thing you dont understand.
the important thing is to win cing to the nation that he would visit china to seek the normalization of relations between the two countries.
by going to china nixon was trying in part to take advantage of the decade long rift between china and the soviet union.
china had long criticized the soviet union as being too soft in its policies against the west.
the two communist superpowers officially broke ties in 1960.
nixon had thought about exploiting the fractured relationship for several years.
we want to have the chinese with us when we sit down and negotiate with the russians he told a reporter in 1968.
upon his arrival at the beijing airport in february 1972 nixon recalls his meeting with chinese premier zhou en lai.
a personal voice richard m nixon i knew that zhou had been deeply insulted by foster dulless refusal to shake hands with him at the geneva conference in 1954.
when i reached the bottom step therefore i made a point of extending my hand as i walked toward him.
when our hands met one era ended and another began.
the memoirs of richard nixon besides its enormous symbolic value nixon s visit also was a huge success with the american public.
observers noted that it opened up diplomatic and economic relations with the chinese and resulted in important agreements between china and the united states.
the two nations agreed that neither would try to dominate the pacific and that both would cooperate in settling disputes peacefully.
they also agreed to participate in scientific and cultural exchanges as well as to eventually reunite taiwan with the mainland h nixon travels to moscow in may 1972 three months after visiting beijing president nixon headed to moscow the first u s president ever to visit the j main idea j analyzing effects ty how did nixons trip change the united states relationship with china.

like his visit to china nixon s trip to the soviet union received wide acclaim.
after a series of meetings called the strategic arms limitation talks salt nixon and soviet premier leonid brezhnev signed the salt i treaty.
this five year agreement limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and submarine launched missiles to 1972 levels.
the foreign policy triumphs with china and the soviet union and the administration s announcement that peace is at hand in vietnam helped reelect nixon as president in 1972.
but peace in vietnam proved elusive.
the nixon administration grappled with the war for nearly six more months before withdrawing troops and ending america s involvement in vietnam.
by that time another issue was about to dominate the nixon administration one that would eventually lead to the downfall of the president.

u s representative barbara jordan 1974.
quoted in notable black american women the committee eventually voted to recommend the impeachment of richard nixon for his role in the watergate scandal.
however before congress could take further action against him the president resigned.
nixon s resignation the first by a u s president was the climax of a scandal that led to the imprisonment of 25 government officials and caused the most serious constitutional crisis in the united states since the impeachment of andrew johnson in 1868.
president nixon and his white house the watergate scandal centered on the nixon administration s attempt to cozer up a burglary of the democratic national committee dnc headquarters at the watergate office and apartment complex in washington d c.
however the 802 chapter 24 main idea summarizing what is meant by imperial presidency.
watergate story began long before the actual burglary.
many historians believe that watergate truly began with the personalities of richard nixon and those of his advisers as well as with the changing role of the presidency.
an imperial presidency when richard nixon took office the executive branch as a result of the great depression world war ii and the cold war had become the most powerful branch of government.
in his book the imperial presidency the historian arthur schlesinger jr argued that by the time richard nixon became president the executive branch had taken on an air of imperial or supreme authority.
president nixon settled into this imperial role with ease.
nixon believed as he told a reporter in 1980 that a president must not be one of the crowd.
don t want him to be down there saying look i m the same as you.
nixon expanded the power of the presidency with little thought to constitutional checks as when he impounded funds for federal programs that he opposed or when he ordered troops to invade cambodia without congressional approval.
a the presidents men as he distanced himself from congress nixon confided in a small and fiercely loyal group of advisers.
they included h r haldeman white house chief of staff john ehrlichman chief domestic adviser and john mitchell nixon s former attorney general.
these men had played key roles in nixon s 1968 election victory and now helped the president direct white house policy.
these men also shared president nixon s desire for secrecy and the consolidation of power.
critics charged that these men through their personalities and their attitude toward the presidency developed a sense that they were somehow above the law.
this sense would in turn prompt president nixon and his advisers to cover up their role in watergate and fuel the coming scandal.
the inner circle main idea analyzing motives why would the nixon campaign team take such a risky action as breaking into the oppositions headquarters.
the drive toward reelection throughout his political career richard nixon lived with the overwhelming fear of losing elections.
by the end of the 1972 reelection campaign nixons campaign team sought advantages by any means possible including an attempt to steal information from the dnc headquarters.
a bungled burglary at 2 30 a m june 17 1972 a guard at the watergate complex in washington d c caught five men breaking into the campaign headquarters of the dnc.
the burglars planned to photograph documents outlining democratic party strategy and to place wiretaps or bugs on the office telephones.
the press soon discovered that the group s leader james mccord was a former cia agent he was also a security coordinator for a group known as the committee to reelect the president crp.
john mitchell who had resigned as attorney general to run nixon s reelection campaign was the crp s director.

he raised it again several times during the day and it obviously is bothering him.
he called at home tonight saying that he wanted to change the plan for his press conference and have it on thursday instead of tomorrow so that it wont look like hes reacting to the democratic break in thing.

as the two men dug deeper into the watergate break in a mysterious inside source helped them to uncover the scandal.
for more than 30 years the reporters refused to identify their source.
then in june 2005 w mark felt the no.
2 man at the fbi at the time of watergate stepped forward and identified himself as the inside source of the reporters information.
while people lauded the two reporters for their dogged determination some nixon officials remain bitter toward them.
woodward defended the reporters work saying we tried to do our job and in fact if you look at it our coverage was pretty conservative.
the cover up quickly began.
workers shredded all incriminating documents in haldeman s office.
the white house with president nixon s consent asked the cia to urge the fbi to stop its investigations into the burglary on the grounds of national security.
in addition the crp passed out nearly 450 000 to the watergate burglars to buy their silence after they were indicted in september of 1972.
throughout the 1972 campaign the watergate burglary generated little interest among the american public and media.
only the washington post and two of its reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein kept on the story.
in a series of articles the reporters uncovered information that linked numerous members of the administration to the burglary.
the white house denied each new post allegation.
upon learning of an upcoming story that tied him to the burglars john mitchell told bernstein that s the most sickening thing i ever heard.
the firm white house response to the charges and its promises of imminent peace in vietnam proved effective in the short term.
in november nixon was reelected by a landslide over liberal democrat george s mcgovern.
but nixon s popular support was soon to unravel.
the cover up unravels in january 1973 the trial of the watergate burglars began.
the trial s presiding judge john sirica made clear his belief that the men had not acted alone.
on march 20 a few days before the burglars were scheduled to be sentenced james mccord sent a letter to sirica in which he indicated that he had lied under oath.
he also hinted that powerful members of the nixon administration had been involved in the break in.
the senate investigates watergate mccord s revelation of possible white house involvement in the burglary aroused public interest in watergate.
president nixon moved quickly to stem the growing concern.
on april 30 1973 nixon dismissed white house counsel john dean and announced the resignations of haldeman ehrlichman and attorney general richard kleindienst who had recently replaced john mitchell following mitchell s resignation.

startling testimony john dean delivered the first bomb.
in late june during more than 30 hours of testimony dean provided a startling answer to senator howard baker s repeated question what did the president know and when did he know it.
the former white house counsel declared that president nixon had been deeply involved in the cover up.
dean referred to one meeting in which he and the president along with several advisers discussed strategies for continuing the deceit.
the white house strongly denied dean s charges.
the hearings had suddenly reached an impasse as the committee attempted to sort out who was telling the truth.
the answer came in july from an unlikely source presidential aide alexander butterfield.
butterfield stunned the committee when he revealed that nixon had taped virtually all of his presidential conversations.
butterfield later claimed that the taping system was installed to help nixon write his memoirs.
however for the senate committee the tapes were the key to revealing what nixon knew and when he knew it.
the saturday night massacre a year long battle for the nixon tapes followed.
archibald cox the special prosecutor whom elliot richardson had appointed to investigate the case took the president to court in october 1973 to obtain the tapes.
nixon refused and ordered attorney general richardson to fire cox.
in what became known as the saturday night massacre richardson refused the order and resigned.
the deputy attorney general also refused the order and he was fired.
solicitor general robert bork finally fired cox.
however cox s replacement leon jaworski proved equally determined to get the tapes.
several months after the massacre the house judiciary committee began examining the possibility of an impeachment hearing.

nixon s offering failed to satisfy investigators who demanded the unedited tapes.
nixon refused and the case went before the supreme court.
on july 24 1974 the high court ruled unanimously that the president must surrender the tapes.
the court rejected nixon s argument that doing so would violate national security.
evidence involving possible criminal activity could not be withheld even by a president.
president nixon maintained that he had done nothing wrong.
at a press conference in november 1973 he proclaimed defiantly i am not a crook.
background although historians sued for access to thousands of hours of tapes it was not until some 21 years later in 1996 that an agreement was made for over 3 700 hours of tape to be made public.
the president resigns even without holding the original tapes the house judiciary committee determined that there was enough evidence to impeach richard nixon.
on july 27 the committee approved three articles of impeachment charging the president with obstruction of justice abuse of power and contempt of congress for refusing to obey a congressional subpoena to release the tapes.

ford tries to whip inflation by the time ford took office america s economy had gone from bad to worse.
both inflation and unemployment continued to rise.
after the massive opec oil price increases in 1973 gasoline and heating oil costs had soared pushing inflation from 6 percent to over 10 percent by the end of 1974.
ford responded with a program of massive citizen action called whip inflation now or win.
the president called on americans to cut back on their use of oil and gas and to take other energy saving measures.
in the absence of incentives though the plan fell flat.
ford then tried to curb inflation through a tight money policy.
he cut government spending and encouraged the federal reserve board to restrict credit through higher interest rates.
these actions triggered the worst economic recession in 40 years.
as ford implemented his economic programs he continually battled a democratic congress intent on pushing its own economic agenda.
during his two years as president ford vetoed more than 50 pieces of legislation.
fords foreign policy ford fared slightly better in the international arena.
he relied heavily on henry kissinger who continued to hold the key position of secretary of state.

in addition carter presented congress with more than 100 proposals on energy conservation and development.
representatives from oil and gas producing states fiercely resisted some of the proposals.
automobile manufacturers also lobbied against gas rationing provisions.
it was impossible for me to imagine the bloody legislative battles we would have to win carter later wrote.
out of the battle came the national energy act.
the act placed a tax on gas guzzling cars removed price controls on oil and natural gas produced in the united states and extended tax credits for the development of alternative energy.
with the help of the act as well as voluntary conservation measures u s dependence on foreign oil had eased slightly by 1979.
cy the economic crisis worsens unfortunately these energy saving measures could do little to combat a sudden new economic crisis.
in the summer of 1979 renewed violence in the middle east produced a second major fuel shortage in the united states.

in 1979 inflation soared from 7 6 percent to 11 3 percent.
faced with increasing pressure to act carter attempted an array of measures none of which worked.
carter s scattershot approach convinced many people that he had no economic policy at all.
carter fueled this feeling of uncertainty by delivering his now famous malaise speech in which he complained of a crisis of spirit that had struck at the very heart and soul of our national will.
carter s address made many americans feel that their president had given up.
by 1980 inflation had climbed to nearly 14 percent the highest rate since 1947.
the standard of living in the united states slipped from first place to fifth place in the world.
carter s popularity slipped along with it.
this economic downswing and carter s inability to solve it during an election year was one key factor in sending ronald reagan to the white house.
the 1980s texas oil boom the economic crisis that gripped the country in the late 1970s was in large part caused by the increased cost of oil.
members of the opec cartel raised the price of oil by agreeing to restrict oil production.
the resulting decrease in the supply of oil in the market caused the price to go up.
most americans were hurt by the high energy prices.
however in areas that produced oil such as texas the rise in prices led to a booming economy in the early 1980s.
for example real estate values for land on which to drill for oil as well as for office space in cities like houston and dallas increased markedly.

andrew young stands outside the united nations in new york city in 1997.
a changing economy many of the economic problems jimmy carter struggled with resulted from long term trends in the economy.
since the 1950s the rise of automation and foreign competition had reduced the number of manufacturing jobs.
at the same time the service sector of the economy expanded rapidly.
this sector includes industries such as communications transportation and retail trade.
the rise of the service sector and the decline of manufacturing jobs meant big changes for some american workers.
workers left out of manufacturing jobs faced an increasingly complex job market.
many of the higher paying service jobs required more education or specialized skills than did manufacturing jobs.
the lower skilled service jobs usually did not pay well.
growing overseas competition during the 1970s caused further change in america s economy.
the booming economies of west germany and countries on the pacific rim such as japan taiwan and korea cut into many u s markets.
many of the nation s primary industries iron and steel rubber clothing automobiles had to cut back production lay off workers and even close plants.
especially hard hit were the automotive industries of the northeast.
there high energy costs foreign competition and computerized production led companies to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.
carter and civil rights although carter felt frustrated by the country s economic woes he took special pride in his civil rights record.
his administration included more african americans and women than any before it.
in 1977 the president appointed civil rights leader andrew young as u s ambassador to the united nations.
young was the first african american to hold that post.
to the judicial branch alone carter appointed 28 african americans 29 women including 6 african americans and 14 latinos.
however president carter fell short of what many civil rights groups had expected in terms of legislation.
critics claimed that carter preoccupied with battles over energy and the economy failed to give civil rights his full attention.
meanwhile the courts began to turn against affirmative action.
in 1978 in the case of regents of the university of california v bakke the supreme court decided that the affirmative action policies of the university s medical school were unconstitutional.
the decision made it more difficult for organizations to establish effective affirmative action programs.

jimmy carter rejected the philosophy of realpolitik the pragmatic policy of negotiating with powerful nations despite their behavior and strived for a foreign policy committed to human rights.
advancing human rights jimmy carter like woodrow wilson sought to use moral principles as a guide for u s foreign policy.
he believed that the united states needed to commit itself to promoting human rights such as the freedoms and liberties listed in the declaration of independence and the bill of rights throughout the world.
putting his principles into practice president carter cut off military aid to argentina and brazil countries that had good relations with the united states but had imprisoned or tortured thousands of their own citizens.
carter followed up this action by establishing a bureau of human rights in the state department.
carter s philosophy was not without its critics.
supporters of the containment policy felt that the president s policy undercut allies such as nicaragua a dictatorial but anti communist country.
others argued that by supporting dictators in south korea and the philippines carter was acting inconsistently.
in 1977 carter s policies drew further criticism when his administration announced that it planned to give up ownership of the panama canal.
jjgj yielding the panama canal since 1914 when the united states obtained full ownership over the panama canal panamanians had resented having their nation split in half by a foreign power.
in 1977 the two nations agreed to two treaties one of which turned over control of the panama canal to panama on december 31 1999.
in 1978 the u s senate which had to ratify each treaty approved the agreements by a vote of 68 to 32 one more vote than the required two thirds.
public opinion was also divided.
in the end the treaties did improve relationships between the united states and latin america.
the collapse of detente when jimmy carter took office detente the relaxation of tensions between the world s superpowers had reached a high point.
beginning with president nixon and continuing with president ford u s officials had worked to ease relations with the communist superpowers of china and the soviet union.
however carter s firm insistence on human rights led to a breakdown in relations with the soviet union.
president carter s dismay over the soviet union s treatment of dissidents or opponents of the government s policies delayed a second round of salt negotiations.
president carter and soviet premier leonid brezhnev finally met in june of 1979 in vienna austria where they signed an agreement known as salt ii.
although the agreement did not reduce armaments it did provide for limits on the number of strategic weapons and nuclear missile launchers that each side could produce.
the salt ii agreement however met sharp opposition in the senate.
critics argued that it would put the united states at a military disadvantage.
then in december 1979 the soviets invaded the neighboring country of afghanistan.
angered over the invasion president carter refused to fight for the salt ii agreement and the treaty died.

however a strong muslim rebel group known as the mujahideen was intent on overthrowing the afghan government.
fearing a rebel victory in afghanistan the soviet union sent troops to afghanistan in late 1979.
while the soviets had superior weaponry the rebels fought the soviets to a stalemate by using guerrilla tactics and intimate knowledge of the countrys mountainous terrain.
after suffering thousands of casualties the last soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan in february 1989.

the iran hostage crisis by 1979 the shah of iran an ally of the united states was in deep trouble.
many iranians resented his regime s widespread corruption and dictatorial tactics.
in january 1979 revolution broke out.
the muslim religious leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini tyo tc le rob ho le ko ma ne led the rebels in overthrowing the shah and establishing a religious state based on strict obedience to the qur an the sacred book of islam.
carter had supported the shah until the very end.
in october 1979 the president allowed the shah to enter the united states for cancer treatment though he had already fled iran in january 1979.
the act infuriated the revolution aries of iran.
on november 4 1979 armed students seized the u s embassy in tehran and took 52 americans hostage.
the militants demanded that the united states send the shah back to iran in return for the release of the hostages.
carter refused and a painful yearlong standoff followed in which the united states continued quiet but intense efforts to free the hostages.
the captives were finally released on january 20 1981 shortly after the new president ronald reagan was sworn in.
despite the hostages release after 444 days in captivity the crisis in iran seemed to underscore the limits that americans faced during the 1970s.
americans also realized that there were limits to the nation s environmental resources.
this realization prompted both citizens and the government to actively address environmental concerns.

think about the camp david accords the iran hostage crisis an age of limits regents of the university of california v bakke 1978 origins of the case in 1973 allan bakke applied to the university of california at davis medical school.
the school had a quota based affirmative action plan that reserved 16 out of 100 spots for racial minorities.
bakke a white male was not admitted to the school despite his competitive test scores and grades.
bakke sued for admission arguing that he had been discriminated against on the basis of race.
the california supreme court agreed with bakke but the school appealed the case.
the ruling the court ruled that racial quotas were unconstitutional but that schools could still consider race as a factor in admissions.
legal reasoning the court was closely divided on whether affirmative action plans were constitutional.
two different sets of justices formed 5 to 4 majorities on two different issues in bakke.
five justices agreed the quota was unfair to bakke.
they based their argument on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
justice lewis powell writing for the majority explained their reasoning.
66 the guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.
if both are not accorded the same protection then it is not equal.
legal sources legislation u s constitution fourteenth amendment 1868 no state shall.

davis on june 4 1982.
the four justices that joined powell in this part of the decision said race should never play a part in admissions decisions.
powell and the other four justices disagreed.
these five justices formed a separate majority arguing that the attainment of a diverse student body is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.
in other words schools could have affirmative action plans that consider race as one factor in admission decisions in order to achieve a diverse student body.
818 chapter 24 related cases united steelworkers of america v weber 1979 the court said a business could have a short term program for training minority workers as a way of fixing the results of past discrimination.
adarand constructors v pena 1995 the court struck a federal law to set aside 10 percent of highway construction funds for minority owned businesses.
the court also said that affirmative action programs must be focused to achieve a compelling government interest.

rf wittts a on october 8 1977 protestors march in suppport of affirmative action at a park in oakland california.
why it mattered many people have faced discrimination in america.
the struggle of african americans for civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s succeeded in overturning jim crow segregation.
even so social inequality persisted for african americans as well as women and other minority groups.
in 1965 president lyndon johnson explained why more proactive measures needed to be taken to end inequality.
you do not take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains and.
bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say you are free to compete with all the others and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.
as a result johnson urged companies to begin to take affirmative action to hire and promote african americans helping them to overcome generations of inequality.
critics quickly opposed affirmative action plans as unfair to white people and merely a replacement of one form of racial discrimination with another.
university admissions policies became a focus of the debate over affirmative action.
the court s ruling in bakke allowed race to be used as one factor in admissions decisions.
schools could consider a prospective student s race but they could not use quotas or use race as the only factor for admission.
historical impact since bakke the court has ruled on affirmative action several times usually limiting affirmative action plans.
for example in adarand constructors v pena 1995 the court struck a federal law to set aside not less than 10 percent of highway construction funds for businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
the court said that affirmative action programs must be narrowly focused to achieve a compelling government interest.
on cases regarding school affirmative action plans the courts have not created clear guidelines.
the supreme court refused to hear an appeal of a 1996 lower court ruling that outlawed any consideration of race for admission to the university of texas law school.
yet in the 2003 decision in grutter v bollinger the court protected a university of michigan law school admissions policy that required the admissions committee to consider the diversity of its student body.
the court reaffirmed the bakke view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest.
since the grutter decision several states have passed laws or constitutional amendments requiring race blind admissions effectively barring affirmative action.
these laws were passed by ballot initiative reflecting a popular view that sees affirmative action as reverse discrimination.

lois gibbs in 1972 lois gibbs and her family moved to niagara falls new york.
underneath this quiet town however was a disaster in the making.
in the 1890s the love canal had been built to provide hydroelectric power for the niagara falls area.
chemical companies were dumping hazardous waste into the canal.
in 1953 bulldozers filled in the canal.
shortly thereafter a school and rows of homes were built nearby.
in 1977 when lois gibbs s son fell sick she decided to investigate.
she eventually uncovered the existence of the toxic waste and mobilized the community to demand government action.
in 1980 president carter authorized funds for many niagara falls families to move to safety.
years later lois gibbs wrote a book detailing her efforts.
a personal voice lois gibbs i want to tell you our story my story because i believe that ordinary citizens using the tools of dignity self respect common sense and perseverance can influence solutions to important problems in our society.
in solving any difficult problem you have to be prepared to fight long and hard sometimes at great personal cost but it can be done.
it must be done if we are to survive at all.
love canal my story lois gibbs s concerns about environmental hazards were shared by many americans in the 1970s.
through the energy crisis americans learned that their natural resources were limited they could no longer take the environment for granted.
americans from grassroots organizations to the government began to focus on conservation of the environment and new forms of energy.
the roots of environmentalism the widespread realization that pollution and overconsumption were damaging the environment began in the 1960s.
one book in particular had awakened 820 chapter 24 america s concerns about the environment and helped lay the groundwork for the activism of the early seventies.
rachel carson and silent spring in 1962 rachel carson a marine biologist published a book entitled silent spring.
in it she warned against the growing use of pesticides chemicals used to kill insects and rodents.
carson argued that pesticides poisoned the very food they were intended to protect and as a result killed many birds and fish.
carson cautioned that america faced a silent spring in which birds killed off by pesticides would no longer fill the air with song.
she added that of all the weapons used in man s war against nature pesticides were some of the most harmful.
a personal voice rachel carson these sprays dusts and aerosols.

can anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life.
silent spring within six months of its publication silent spring sold nearly half a million copies.
many chemical companies called the book inaccurate and threatened legal action.
however for a majority of americans carson s book was an early warning about the danger that human activity posed to the environment.
shortly after the book s publication president kennedy established an advisory committee to investigate the situation.
with rachel carson s prodding the nation slowly began to focus more on environmental issues.
although carson would not live to see the u s government outlaw ddt in 1972 her work helped many americans realize that their everyday behavior as well as the nation s industrial growth had a damaging effect on the environment.
ktv player rachel carson 1907 1964 the marine biologist rachel carson was born far from the sea in the small town of springdale pennsylvania.
carson was a sickly child who often had to remain at home where her mother tutored her.
throughout her youth and into her college years carson was a studious but quiet and aloof person.
carson entered college intent on becoming a writer.
during her sophomore year she took a biology class to fulfill her science requirement and quickly fell in love with the study of nature.
by the next year carson switched her major from english to zoology the study of animals.

environmental concerns in the 1970s during the 1970s the administrations of richard nixon and jimmy carter confronted such environmental issues as conservation pollution and the growth of nuclear energy.
the first earth day the united states ushered in the 1970s a decade in which it would actively address its environmental issues fittingly enough with the first earth day celebration.
on that day april 22 1970 nearly every community in the nation and more than 10 000 schools and 2 000 colleges hosted some type of environmental awareness activity and spotlighted such problems as pol lution the growth of toxic waste and the earth s dwindling resources.
the earth day celebration continues today.
each year on april 22 millions of people around the world gather to heighten public awareness of environmental problems.
the government takes action although president nixon was not considered an environmentalist or someone who takes an active role in the protection of the environment he recognized the nation s growing concern about the environment.
in an effort to make our peace with nature president nixon set out on a course that led to the passage of several landmark measures.
in 1970 he consolidated 15 existing federal pollution programs into the environmental protection agency epa.
the new agency was given the power to set and enforce pollution standards to conduct environmental research and to assist state and local governments in pollution control.
today the epa remains the federal government s main instrument for dealing with environmental issues.
in 1970 nixon signed a new clean air act that added several amendments to the clean air act of 1963.
the new act gave the government the authority to set air standards.
following the 1970 clean air act congress also passed the endangered species act in addition to laws that limited pesticide use and curbed strip mining the practice of mining for ore and coal by digging gaping holes in the land.
some 35 environmental laws took effect during the decade addressing every aspect of conservation and clean up from protecting endangered animals to regulating auto emissions.

balancing progress and conservation in alaska during the 1970s the federal government took steps to ensure the continued well being of alaska the largest state in the nation and one of its most ecologically sensitive.
the discovery of oil there in 1968 and the subsequent construction of a massive pipeline to transport it created many new jobs and greatly increased state revenues.
however the influx of new development also raised concerns about alaska s wildlife as well as the rights of its native peoples.
in 1971 nixon signed the alaska native claims settlement act which turned over millions of acres of land to the state s native tribes for conservation and tribal use.
in 1978 president carter enhanced this conservation effort by setting aside an additional 56 million acres in alaska as national monuments.
in 1980 congress added another 104 million acres as protected areas.
the debate over nuclear energy as the 1970s came to a close americans became acutely aware of the dangers that nuclear power plants posed to both humans and the environment.
during the 1970s as america realized the drawbacks to its heavy dependence on foreign oil for energy nuclear power seemed to many to be an attractive alternative.
opponents of nuclear energy warned the public against the industry s growth.
they contended that nuclear plants and the wastes they produced were potentially dangerous to humans and their environment.
three mile island in the early hours of march 28 1979 the concerns of nuclear energy opponents were validated.
that morning one of the nuclear reactors at a plant on three mile island near harrisburg pennsylvania malfunctioned.

on january 20 1993 william jefferson clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd president of the united states.

bill clinton delivers his inaugural address.
a personal voice william jefferson clinton we must do what america does best offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.
it is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other.
let us ail take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country.
to renew america we must revitalize our democracy.
first inaugural address january 20 1993 clinton s speech recalled the one given by another president as he took office.
in 1961 john f kennedy called on each american to ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country.

880 chapter 26 main idea analyzing causes a what factors accounted for bushs decline in popularity.
the election of 1992 after the u s victory in the persian gulf war in 1991 republican president george bush s popularity had climbed to an 89 percent approval rating.
shortly after the war ended however the nation found itself in the grips of a recession.
in early 1992 bush s approval rating nose dived to 40 percent.
in his run for reelection president bush could not convince the public that he had a clear strategy for ending the recession and creating jobs.
throughout the presidential race bill clinton campaigned as the candidate who would lead the nation out of its economic crisis.
so did a third party candidate texas billion aire h ross perot.
perot targeted the soaring federal budget deficit as the nation s number one problem.
a budget deficit occurs when the federal government borrows money to meet all its spending commitments.
it s time perot declared in his usual blunt style to take out the trash and clean up the barn.
election day results however demonstrated that clinton s center of the road strategy had the widest appeal.
though clinton won he captured only 43 percent of the popular vote.
bush received 38 percent while perot managed an impressive 19 percent.
a new democrat bill clinton won the presidency in part by promising to move away from traditional democratic policies.
he also emphasized the need to move people off welfare and called for growth in private business as a means to economic progress.
in office clinton worked to move the democratic party toward the political center by embracing both liberal and conservative programs.
according to an ally clinton hoped to modernize liberalism so it could sell again.
by doing so he sought to create a new and more inclusive democratic party.

moderate reform and economic boom president clinton demonstrated his willingness to pursue both liberal and conservative policies on health care the budget deficit crime and welfare.
health care reform clinton had pledged to create a plan to guarantee affordable health care for all americans especially for the millions of americans who lacked medical insurance.
once in office clinton appointed first lady hillary rodham clinton a skilled lawyer and child welfare advocate to head the team creating the plan.
the president presented the health care reform bill to congress in september 1993.
congress debated the plan for a year.
intense lobbying and republican attacks on the plan for promoting big government sealed its doom.
in the end congress never even voted on the bill.

balanced budget and an economic boom president clinton was more successful in his efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit.
clinton and the republican controlled congress agreed in 1997 on legislation to balance the federal budget by the year 2002.
the bill cut spending by billions of dollars lowered taxes to win republican support and included programs aimed at helping children and improving health care.
a year later clinton announced that for the first time in nearly 30 years the federal budget had a surplus.
that is the government took in more than it spent.
surpluses were used in part to pay down the nation s debt which had soared to around 5 5 trillion.
perhaps the most effective tool in generating a surplus was the booming economy.
about the time clinton took office the economy rebounded.
unemployment fell and the stock market soared to new heights.
as a result the government s tax revenues rose and fewer people received public aid.
these factors helped slash the federal debt.
reforming welfare clinton and the congressional republicans cooperated to reform the welfare system.
in 1996 a bill was proposed to place limits on how long people could receive benefits.
it also put an end to a 61 year federal guarantee of welfare and instead gave states block grants set amounts of federal money they could spend on welfare or for other social concerns.
although liberal democrats feared the effects of eliminating the federal safety net for the poor the president backed the bill.
over the next few years states moved millions of people from welfare to jobs.
because of the strong economy the transition was more successful than some had been predicting.
crime and terrorism the improved economy along with enlargement of police forces combined to lower crime rates in the 1990s.
however fears were raised among americans by acts of violence and terrorism around the country.
a shocking crime occurred april 1999 when two students at columbine high school in colorado killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded 23 others and then shot themselves.
americans were appalled at copycat crimes that began to occur.
some called for tougher gun control while others argued that exposure to violent imagery should be curtailed.
violence had pervaded television news throughout the decade.
in 1993 terrorists had exploded bombs in the world trade center in new york city.
this was closely followed by a 1995 blast that destroyed a nine story federal office building in oklahoma city killing 168 children women and men.
timothy mcveigh an american veteran of the gulf war was found guilty in the oklahoma bombing.
he was executed in 2001 the first use of the federal death penalty in 38 years.

these included all the passengers on all four planes workers and visitors in the world trade center and the pentagon and hundreds of rescue workers.
see section 1 the war on terrorism in chapter 27 on page 894.
new foreign policy challenges conflicts and confused alliances grew in the wake of the cold war.
the question of u s intervention overseas and the globalization of the economy presented the united states with a host of new challenges.
relations with former cold war foes maintaining strong relations with russia and china became major goals for the clinton administration.
throughout the 1990s the u s and russia cooperated on economic and arms control issues.
still russia criticized u s intervention in yugoslavia where a bloody civil war raged.
meanwhile u s officials protested russian attacks on rebels in the russian region of chechnya.
u s relations with china were strained as well.
clinton had stressed that he would lean on china to grant its citizens more democratic rights.
as president however he put greater emphasis on increasing trade with china.
despite concerns that chinese spies had stolen u s defense secrets clinton supported a bill passed in 2000 granting china permanent trade rights.
troops abroad with the cold war over the united states turned more of its attention to regional conflicts.
president clinton proved willing to use troops to end conflicts overseas.
in 1991 military leaders in haiti forced the elected president from office.
thousands of refugees fled the military leaders harsh rule.
in 1994 president clinton dispatched american troops to haiti and the military rulers were forced to step down.
other interventions occurred in the balkans.
in 1991 yugoslavia broke apart into five nations.
in bosnia one of the new states some serb militias under slobodan milosevic began ethnic cleansing killing or expelling from their homes people of certain ethnic groups.
in 1995 the united states helped negotiate a peace agreement in bosnia.
clinton sent u s troops to join nato troops to help ensure the deal.
about three years later serb forces attacked ethnic albanians in the serb province of kosovo.
the u s and its nato allies launched air strikes against serbian targets in 1999 forcing the serbs to back down.
american troops followed up by participating in an international peace keeping force.
the united states in today s world 81 main idea jfjjf f in both bosnia and kosovo the administration promised early withdrawal.
however the u s troops stayed longer than had been intended drawing criticism of clinton s policies.
trade and the global economy seeing flourishing trade as essential to u s prosperity and to world economic and political stability president clinton championed the north american free trade agreement nafta this legislation would bring mexico into the free trade zone that the united states and canada already had formed.
the political battle over nafta demonstrated the dynamic relationship between the u s free enterprise system and its international trade policies.
opponents believed nafta would cost american jobs.
they argued that because mexican factories paid lower wages they could make and sell goods at a lower cost.
without tariffs to make mexican goods more expensive than american goods many feared american factories would go out of business.
clinton and the other supporters of nafta believed the agreement would increase trade which would help the u s economy.
clinton fought for and won passage of nafta in 1993 when the treaty was ratified by all three countries legislatures.
once the treaty took effect on january 1 1994 trade with mexico increased.
critics of free trade have remained vocal.
in late 1999 protestors gathered in seattle at a meeting of the world trade organization wto an organization that promotes free trade and economic development.
demonstrations at summit of the americas meetings in quebec city canada in 2001 miami in 2003 and mar del plata argentina in 2005 ended violently.
such protests helped to halt plans to launch the free trade area of the americas ftaa an enlarged version of nafta covering the 34 countries in the western hemisphere.
partisan politics and impeachment analyzing causes why did the united states send troops to yugoslavia and kosovo.
while clinton and congress worked together on deficit reduction and nafta relations in washington became increasingly partisan.
in the midst of political wrangling a scandal rocked the white house and bill clinton became the second president in u s history to be impeached.
republicans take control of congress in 1994 after the failure of president clinton s health care plan recurring questions regarding his leadership began to surface.
the new president had failed to deliver on several campaign promises.
this discontent helped contribute to a major republican victory in the 1994 midterm elections.
many republican candidates led by representative newt gingrich of georgia campaigned with a document they called the contract with america ten items republicans promised to enact if they won control of congress.
they included congressional term limits a balanced budget amendment tax cuts tougher crime laws and welfare reform.
many of the ideas that comprised the contract with america originated with the heritage foundation.
founded in 1973 the heritage foundation was one of the key organizations in the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s.
its mission is to develop and advocate conservative public policy within the united states.
in the november 1994 election the republicans gained 54 seats in the house and 8 in the senate handing the democrats a humiliating defeat.
republicans took control of both houses of congress for the first time since 1954.
newt gingrich was chosen as the new speaker of the house.
vocabulary partisan devoted to or biased in support of a party group or cause summarizing what were some of the provisions of the contract of america.
864 chapter 26 main idea analyzing causes what factors contributed most to clintons reelection.
president clinton and the republican controlled congress clashed.
clinton opposed republican budgets that slowed spending on entitlements such as social security and medicaid.
clinton and congress refused to compromise and no budget was passed.
as a result the federal government shut down for almost a week in november 1995 and again for several weeks in the next two months.
the 1996 reelection the budget standoff helped clinton as did the strong economy and passage of the welfare reform law of 1996 which suggested an improved working relationship with congress.
as a result voters reelected clinton in november 1996.
with 49 percent of the popular vote he outpolled the republican nominee u s.
senator bob dole and the reform party candidate h ross perot.
still the republicans maintained control of the house and senate.
president clinton and republican leaders pledged to work more cooperatively jg.
i clinton impeached president clinton was accused of improperly using money from a land deal with the whitewater development company to fund his 1984 gubernatorial reelection campaign.
in addition clinton allegedly had lied under oath about having an improper relationship with a young white house intern.
in 1998 clinton admitted to the relationship but denied lying about it under oath or attempting to obstruct the investigation.
in december 1998 the house of representatives approved two articles of impeachment charging the president with perjury and obstruction of justice.
clinton became only the second president and the first in 130 years to face a trial in the senate.
at the trial a month later the senate fell short of the 67 votes a two thirds majority required to convict him.
clinton remained in office and apologized for his actions.
the impeachment proceedings divided the nation.
while some believed that clinton had violated the voters trust and should be removed from office others argued the trial was politically motivated.
these americans protested the impeachment.
many democrats claimed that prosecuting president clinton was pure partisanship the race for the white house in the 2000 presidential race the democrats chose vice president al gore to succeed bill clinton.
the republicans nominated george w bush governor of texas and the son of the former president.
ralph nader a long time consumer advocate ran as a third party candidate for the green party which championed environmental causes and promoted an overall liberal agenda.
on the eve of the election polls showed that the race would be tight.
election night confusion as election night unfolded al gore appeared to take the lead.
the television networks projected that he would win florida pennsylvania and michigan states rich in electoral votes that would ultimately decide the winner of the race.
then in a stunning turn of events the tv networks recanted their original projection about gore s victory in florida and proclaimed the state too close to call.
as midnight passed it became clear that whoever won florida would gain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election.
about 2 a m the networks predicted bush the winner of florida and thus the presidency.
however as the final votes in florida rolled in bush s lead shrank considerably and the state again became too close to call.
by the next day al gore had won the popular vote by more than 500 000 votes out of 105 million cast across the nation.
the united states in today s world some democrats blamed nader s third party candidacy for the election out come.
some people argue that he split the liberal vote earning votes that would have otherwise gone to gore.
this result narrowed the margin between gore and bush.
however nader supporters argue that he represented an important alterna tive for voters.
dispute rages in florida in the weeks following the election lawyers and spokespersons went to florida to try to secure victory.
george bush s razor thin victory in florida triggered an automatic recount which gave bush a win by just over more than a month after the votes were cast al gore concedes the 2000 presidential election.
500 votes but the battle for the presidency did not end there.
the gore campaign requested manual recounts in four mostly democratic counties.
bush representatives opposed the manual recounts.
james a baker iii former secretary of state and leader of the bush team in florida argued that such recounts would raise the possibility of political mischief.
the battle moves to the courts as the manual recounting began on november 12 the republicans sued to stop the recounts a month long court fight followed.
the battle ultimately reached the supreme court.
on december 12 the court voted 5 to 4 to stop the recounts thus awarding the florida electoral votes and the presidency to bush.
the justices argued that manual recounts lacked uniform standards and therefore violated equal protection for voters.

ktv llav y the bush administration after the protests and legal actions subsided george w bush was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the united states on january 20 2001.
bush inherited several challenges including a weakening national economy and an energy problem in california.
during his first months as president bush began to advance his political agenda.
he declared plans to reform the federal role in education and to privatize social security.
bush also proposed a 1 35 trillion tax cut which became law in june 2001.
antiterrorist measures the political landscape changed dramatically after the september 11 terrorist attacks.
the bush administration now with the overwhelming support of congress and the american people shifted its energy and attention to combating terrorism.
in october 2001 bush signed an antiterrorism bill into law.
the law allowed the government to detain foreigners suspected of terrorism for seven days without charging them with a crime.
by the following month bush had created the department of homeland security a government body set up to coordinate national efforts to combat terrorism.
in addition the federal government increased its involvement in aviation security.
the bush administration also began waging a war against terrorism.
in october 2001 coalition forces led by george w bush 1946 george w bush was born into a family steeped in politics.
his father george h w bush was the 41st president of the united states 1989 1993.
however george w bush did not immediately follow in his fathers political footsteps.
in 1975 he started an oil company in midland texas.
for a time he also was part owner of the texas rangers baseball team.
eventually bush was elected governor of texas in 1994.
six years later he became the 43rd president of the united states.
he won reelection in 2004 i 866 chapter 26 main idea evaluating leadership how do you think the american people responded to bushs antiterrorist measures.
the united states began bombing afghanistan.
the afghan government was harboring osama bin laden and his al qaeda terrorist network believed responsible for the september 11 attacks.
in 2002 the coalition successfully broke up the al qaeda network in afghanistan.
osama bin laden however remained at large.
nonetheless the bush administration gained widespread public approval for the decisive steps taken.
bush also scored a major success when direct elections were held for the first time in afghanistan in october 2004.
the afghan people elected interim president hamid karzai as their first democratically elected president.
although afghanistan still faced many problems the elections were considered a positive move toward resolving them.
war against iraq in 2003 bush expanded the war on terrorism to iraq.
following the persian gulf war iraq had agreed to un demands to stop the production of biological chemical and nuclear weapons.
however throughout the 1990s the leader of iraq saddam hussein cooperated only partly with un arms inspectors and eventually barred them from entering his country.
after the september 11 attacks bush alleged that hussein was supporting terrorists and might supply them with weapons of mass destruction wmd.
bush called for renewed arms inspections in iraq.
the inspectors determined that iraq had not resumed its wmd programs but hussein had again not cooperated fully with the inspection process.
the united states and great britain then ended diplomacy with iraq and invaded in march 2003.
within a month iraq s forces were defeated.
u s forces then began an intensive search for wmd in iraq.
no traces of wmd were found.
u s forces captured the former dictator in december 2003 and hussein was later tried and executed by the iraqi government.
hamid karzai is victorious in afghanistan s first direct presidential election.
domestic agenda meanwhile on the home front president bush concentrated on education and the economy.
he signed into law an education reform plan entitled no child left behind.
this plan called for more accountability by states for students success mandatory achievement testing and more school options available for parents.
the economy posed a greater challenge as corporate scandals such as those related to the companies enron and worldcom rocked the nation.
the scandals had a negative impact on the u s economy.
congress responded by passing the sarbanes oxley act.
this act established a regulatory board to oversee the accounting industry and its involvement with corporations.
in 2003 congress passed and bush signed into law a 350 billion tax cut which bush claimed would help the sagging economy and create jobs.
democrats in congress opposed the tax cut saying it would mostly benefit the rich.
the democrats were overruled however because the republican party had regained control of the senate in the 2002 midterm elections.
bush reelected in 2004 although the bush administration received much initial support for the war on terrorism many americans came to question the decision to invade iraq.
they were dismayed by the failure to find wmd there.
in 2004 president bush was reelected despite deep divisions among the american people.
during bush s second term discontent about the war grew.
at the same time controversies arose over warrantless spying on american citizens and allegations that the administration allowed torture of terrorist suspects.
the bush administration was also criticized over its response to hurricane katrina.
in the 2006 mid term elections democrats regained control of both the house and the senate.
the united states in today s world 8 the obama administration history video election 2008 f n the continuing war in iraq and a deteriorating economy contributed to president bush s unpopularity.
the collapse of the financial markets in the fall of 2008 did little to improve the situation.
more than two thirds of americans disapproved of his handling of the presidency.
as a result in the 2008 presidential election americans voted for a change in direction by electing democrat barack obama u s senator from illinois.
in defeating republican senator john mccain of arizona obama made history as the first african american to be elected president of the united states.
on taking office obama pushed through an economic stimulus package to combat the recession brought on by the crash of the financial markets.
in addition he fulfilled a campaign promise by passing a sweeping health care reform bill.
however aspects of health care reform drew criticism from some people.
in addition many americans expressed their unhappiness with continued high levels of unemployment.
this discontent allowed republicans to gain a majority of seats in the u s house of representatives during the 2010 midterm elections.
in foreign policy obama drew up plans to end combat operations in iraq and in afghanistan.
he also continued to combat terrorism.

the fed has been described as the economic pacemaker of the united states because it helps determine how much money there will be in the american economy.
before being elected president in 2000 george w bush made it a point to meet with alan greenspan before meeting with any other government officials in washington.
but there was alarming news as well.
wage inequality between upper and lower income americans the income gap widened.
median household income began to drop.
although economists disagreed about the reasons for the economy s instability most everyone agreed it was undergoing significant changes.
more service less security chief among the far reaching changes in the workplace of the 1990s was the explosive growth of jobs in the service sector the part of the economy that provides services to consumers.
by 2008 nearly 80 percent of american workers were teachers medical professionals lawyers engineers store clerks waitstaff and other service workers.
low paying jobs such as sales and fast food grew fastest.
these positions often part time or temporary offered limited benefits.
many corporations rather than invest in salaries and benefits for full time staff hired temporary workers or temps and began to downsize trim payrolls to streamline operations and increase profits.
these private sector decisions to downsize were meant to create economic opportunities for some citizens.
by increasing profits they benefited the shareholders who owned corporate stock.
however they also had unintended consequences for the economy as a whole.
manpower inc a temporary services agency became the largest u s employer earning 2 billion in 1993 when 640 000 americans cashed its paychecks.
in 2008 about one fifth of the nation s labor force worked in temporary or part time positions.

in 2008 about 14 percent of workers aged 16 to 24 were unemployed more than double the national rate.
and many young americans are living at home longer and are less financially secure than american youth in the past.
farms and factories the nation s shift to a service economy came at the expense of america s traditional workplaces.
manufacturing which surpassed farming mid century as the largest job sector experienced a sharp decline in the 1980s and 1990s.
in 1992 for example 140 000 steelworkers did the same work that 240 000 had accomplished ten years earlier.
the decline in industrial jobs contributed to a drop in union membership.
in 1945 35 percent of american workers belonged to unions by 2008 only 12 percent were union members.
in the 1990s and early 2000s unions had trouble organizing.
high tech and professional workers felt no need for unions while low wage service employees feared losing their jobs in a strike.
some workers saw their incomes decline.
the increased use of computer driven robots to make manufactured goods eliminated many jobs but it also spurred a vibrant high tech economy.
those with advanced training and specialized technical skills or a sense of entrepreneurial risk taking saw their salaries rise and their economic security expand.

suddenly companies could work directly with consumers or with other companies.
many predicted that the price of doing business would fall markedly and that overall worldwide productivity would jump dramatically.
the boom of new business was termed the new economy.
however the positive economic outlook fueled by the new economy was short lived.
in 2000 only 38 percent of online retailing made a profit.
as a result many dotcoms went out of business.
this decline had many causes.
entrepreneurs often provided inadequate advertising for their e companies.
also many dotcoms had hard to use web sites that confused customers.
the unsuccessful dotcoms caused many investors to stop putting money in internet businesses.
in 2002 the u s economy was also hard hit by corporate scandals when enron was charged with using illegal accounting practices and worldcom filed what was then the largest bankruptcy claim in u s history.
investors began to lose faith in corporations.
in addition the continued threat of international terrorism had a negative effect on the economy.
all of these factors caused the nasdaq to decline.

e3 a international competition with the increase of global trade many u s businesses transformed into multinational corporations or large corporations with branches in several countries.
multinational corporations are beneficial in that they provide new jobs goods and services around the world and spread technological advances.
however by building factories in countries with lax governmental regulation some multinational corporations may be able to employ harmful environmental and labor policies leading to pollution and unsafe working conditions.
also international trade agreements caused some american workers to worry about massive job flight to countries that produced the same goods as the united states but at a lower cost.
in the 1990s u s multinational corporations frequently moved their operations to less economically advanced countries such as mexico where wages were lower.
after the passage of nafta more than 100 000 low wage jobs were lost in u s manufacturing industries such as apparel auto parts and electronics.
also competition with foreign companies helped u s companies to maintain low wages and decrease benefits jgj international slowdown around the turn of the 21st century the global economy began to slow down.
between 1997 and 2002 the gross domestic product in japan declined by 6 percent.

the u s economy also suffered.
as it happened both the u s and world economies began to reverse the downward trend by 2004.
however in late 2007 a global financial crisis began brought on by the collapse of several major banking firms.
financially secure banks cut back on lending.
as a result businesses found it difficult to get the credit they needed to invest in new inventory or pay their employees much less hire new ones.
the u s unemployment rate jumped and the stock market dipped earning the period the nickname the great recession.

the united states in today s world i lilljj kelo v city of new london 2005 origins of the case in 1998 a private company proposed building a research facility on a large piece of unused land in new london connecticut.
hoping the new facility would revive the surrounding area s economy the city planned to use its power of eminent domain to give nearby land to a private developer.
the developer intended to tear down the private homes that were occupying the land in order to build a hotel restaurants shops offices and private high rise apartments.
the city believed these projects qualified as public use but local homeowners including susette kelo disagreed and took the matter to the courts.
the ruling the supreme court ruled that the planned development of the land qualified as a public use because it was intended to improve the citys poor economy.
legal reasoning the fifth amendments takings clause gives the government the right of eminent domain the power to take private property for public use.
the question in kelo v city of new london was whether the economic benefits of a private development constitute public use under the fifth amendment.
justice john paul stevens writing for the 5 4 majority ruled legal sources for more than a century our public use jurisprudence has wisely eschewed avoided rigid formulas and intrusive scrutiny in favor of affording legislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of the takings power according to the court the fifth amendment did not require a literal definition of public use the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as public purpose was sufficient.
in her dissenting opinion justice sandra day oconnor argued that the decision blurred the distinction between private and public use of property.
under the banner of economic development all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner so long as it might be upgraded i e given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public in the process u s constitution u s constitution fifth amendment 1791 n or shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation u s constitution fourteenth amendment 1868 n or shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law.
related cases berman v parker 1954 the court interpreted the takings clause of the fifth amendment determining that private property can be taken for a public purpose with just compensation.
hawaii housing authority v midkiff 1984 the court held that the power of eminent domain allowed a state to take property from an oligopoly for distribution to a wider population of private residents.
874 chapter 26 why it mattered the fifth amendment protects an individuals right to own private property.
this protection is one of the principles upon which our economic system is based.
however the same amendment also gives government the right to take private property for public use with just compensation.
this right allows government officials to force property owners to sell their land to the government at what is determined to be a fair price.
in many instances the governments use of eminent domain is beneficial for communities and the individuals and industries that live and operate there.
for example for years the right has been used to create public roads or railroad tracks that improve transportation and make trade more efficient benefiting the community as a whole.
by expanding the definition of public use to include ventures by private developers kelo has also expanded the circumstances under which local governments can seize private property.
this decision has the potential to broaden the impact of governmental actions on individuals industries and communities with respect to fifth amendment proper ty rights.
some observers worried that the kelo decision would allow governments to take actions that would benefit some at the expense of the others.
historical impact the kelo decision has served as something of a cautionary tale.
many americans worried that the ruling gave local government too much power to abuse its right of eminent domain.
in response 43 state legislatures and 8 state supreme courts have taken measures to restrict the use of eminent domain and strengthen property rights protections.
in june 2013 the house judiciary committee approved the private property rights protection act which would prohibit governments that receive federal funds from using eminent domain to transfer private property from one owner to another for economic development.
the legislation is a direct response to the kelo ruling.
in new london the company whose research facility prompted the development has announced plans to leave the area and the condemned and bulldozed neighborhood where susette kelo once lived remains vacant.

people were able to speak to or correspond with each other instantaneously almost anytime almost anywhere.
the cartoon suggests that americans are dependent on their communication devices and that the once relaxing and peaceful family vacation has given way to the hustle and bustle of constant access.
skillbuilder analyzing political cartoons 1.
what modern day communication devices are being used in this cartoon.
in what ways do the characters in this cartoon seem trapped by modern day communications technology.
entering the information age in the 1980s the computer industry transformed the world.
instead of giant mainframes and minicomputers desktop workstations now ruled business.
home computers became widely available.
the information superhighway a network of communication devices linking people and institutions across the nation and the world promised to advance the revolution further.
in 1994 vice president al gore began to oversee the government s participation in developing this superhighway.
even though private industries would build the superhighway the government would keep access democratic ensure affordable service for everyone protect privacy and property rights and develop incentives for investors.
vocabulary interface the point of communication between a computer and any other entity such as a printer or human operator the 1990s enjoyed explosive growth of the internet an international network linking computers and allowing almost instant transmittal of text images and sound to users around the world.
use of the network was further popularized by the world wide web which provided a simple visual interface for words and pictures to be seen by an unlimited audience.
through an electronic connection such as a tv cable or phone line users could access an array of media from streaming video to research archives from online shopping catalogs to customized news broadcasts.
as businesses schools and organizations began to use the web as a primary form of communication new forms of social interaction emerged.
users developed online communities such as myspace and facebook to meet and communicate with one another.
by 2009 nearly 228 million americans used the internet regularly to send email to network to share music and photos or to browse through pages on the web.
business and marketplace applications the late 20th century advances in computers and communications have had an impact on american society and business comparable to the industrial developments of the late 1800s.
the desire to capitalize on these innovations for profit drove several companies to enter the marketplace with technology products developed for personal use.
as a result consumers now clamor for the most current technology in cell phones laptop computers and tablets and other personal electronic devices.
the united states in today s world these innovations have affected the workplace as well.
because of cell phones fax machines the internet wireless connectivity and overnight shipping people can more readily telecommute or work from a location of their choice instead of going to an office every day computer based management techniques have also allowed many businesses to streamline.
for instance some manufacturers have implemented just in time jit systems in which they bring in only as many raw materials as are needed to produce the goods their customers demand.
such efficiencies allow them to use their resources elsewhere.
legislating technology in the 1980s the government was slow to recognize the implications of the new communications technology.
in 1994 however the federal communications commission fcc began to auction the valuable rights to airwaves and collected over 9 billion.
then with the rapid growth in the communications industry the federal government took several steps to ensure that consumers received the best service.
congress passed the telecommunications act of 1996 removing barriers that had previously prevented one type of communications company from starting up or buying another related one.
while it increased competition in the industry the law also paved the way for major media mergers.
when capital cities abc inc joined the walt disney company industry watchdogs noted that this reflected the trend toward concentrating media influence in the hands of a few powerful conglomerates.
the passage of the telecommunications act won applause from the communications industry but only mixed reviews from the public.
consumer activists worried that the law would fail to ensure equal access to new technologies for rural residents and poor people.
civil rights advocates contended that the communications decency act part of the telecommunications act restricted free speech because it barred the transmission of indecent materials to minors via the internet.
since the early 2000s the issue of network neutrality has created considerable controversy.
supporters of network neutrality want regulations established that would prevent service providers or the government from restricting access to or content delivered on the internet.

scientific advances enrich lives main idea analyzing effects how might the telecommunications act affect consumers.
at nasa langley research center in virginia an aerospace engineer wearing stereo glasses sees a 3 d view of a space station simulation as shown in the background.
the exciting growth in the telecommunications industry in the 1990s and early 2000s was matched by developments that revolutionized robotics space exploration and medicine.
the world witnessed marvels that for many echoed science fiction.
simulation robotics and machine intelligence visual imaging and artificial intelligence a computer s ability to perform activities that require intelligence were combined to provide applications in industry medicine and education.
for example virtual reality began with the flight simulators used to train military and commercial pilots.
today with a headset that holds tiny video screens and earphones and with a data glove that translates hand movements to a computer screen a user can navigate a virtual landscape.
doctors have used virtual reality to take a computerized tour of a patient s throat and lungs to check for medical problems.
surgeons have performed longdistance surgery through telepresence systems gloves computers and robotic elements specially 878 chapter 26 wired so that a doctor can operate on a patient hundreds of miles away.
architects and engineers have used virtual reality to create models of their designs.
modeling also affected the nightly newscast.
using supercomputers and improved satellite data meteorologists could offer extended weather forecasts that reached the accuracy of one day forecasts of 1980.
the use of such technologies has increased worker productivity.
as technology became more sophisticated computers increased in capability.
ibm s deep blue defeated chess champion garry kasparov in 1997.
computational linguists steadily improved natural language understanding in computers thus fine tuning the accuracy of voice recognition systems.
robots grew more humanlike as engineers equipped them with high capacity chips simulating brain function.

background the international space station was established by joining and expanding upon the russian station mir and the american spacelab.
space exploration in the 1990s astronomy expanded our view of the universe.
in 1997 nasa s pathfinder and its rover sojourner transmitted live pictures of the surface of mars to millions of internet users.
shuttle missions meanwhile concentrated on scientific research and assembly transport and repair of orbiting objects paving the way to possible human missions to mars and other space travel in the coming century.

since then dozens more have been detected.
on july 21 2011 the atlantis crew completed the final mission of nasa s 30 year shuttle program.
however u s space exploration goes on and continues to benefit americans quality of life in many ways.
in addition to the discoveries we can make about the universe the innovation required to develop vehicles and other systems for space travel has yielded many products of use on earth from sunglasses and smoke detectors to the magnetic resonance imagery mri machines used for medical scans.
also space exploration is inspiring to society as a whole convincing americans that no challenge is too big to overcome.
biotechnology the most profound insight into the book of life came from the field of biotechnology.
the human genome project an international effort to map the genes of the human body and celera a private company in molecular biology simultaneously announced in 2000 that they had sequenced nearly all of the human genome only a decade after the research began.
cooperation via the internet and access to computerized databases by multiple research groups vastly accelerated the scientists ability to identify and order over three billion chemical letters of the united states in today s world 87 researchers work at the beijing genomics institute at shenzhen in southern china.
the genetic code of dna.
molecular biologists hoped that this genetic map would offer the key to treating many inherited diseases and diagnosing congenital disabilities and that drug makers could one day design pharmaceuticals for each patient s particular profile.
dna had been in the spotlight before the breakthrough announcement.
in well publicized legal proceedings prosecutors relied on dna evidence to help prove the guilt of defendants who may have left behind a single hair at a crime scene.
others wrongly imprisoned were released when genetic analysis proved their innocence.
but different opinions arose over some of the new biotechnology.
some speculated that technological progress outpaced social evolution and societys ability to grapple with the consequences.
in 1997 scottish researchers cloned dolly the sheep from one cell of an adult sheep.
shortly thereafter two rhesus monkeys were cloned in oregon and many wondered whether human cloning was next.
firms sought to patent genes used for medical and research applications using the principle of invention and property.
advances such as these as well as gene therapy artificial human chromosomes and testing embryos for genetic defects all sparked heated debates among scientists ethicists religious leaders and politicians.
the use of genetic engineering the artificial changing of the molecular biology of organisms cells to alter an organism also aroused public concern.
however the federal department of agriculture fda holds that genetically engineered foods are safe and that they require no extra labeling.
scientists in the late 1990s modified corn and rice to provide resistance to pests and increase nutritional value.
in 1996 the european union limited the importation of such products in response to consumer pressure allowing only those clearly labeled as having been genetically modified.
medical progress people suffering from some diseases benefited from advances in medicine in the 1990s and early 2000s.
cancer survival rates improved drastically as clinicians explored the use of gene therapy genetically engineered antibodies and immune system modulation.
improvements in tracking the spread of hiv the virus that causes aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome through the body made researchers better prepared to find a cure.
aids patients were treated with combination therapies and public health officials advocated abstinence and safer sex practices to control the spread of hiv.
improved technology for making medical diagnoses offered new hope as well.
magnetic resonance imaging mri for example was used to produce cross sectional images of any part of the body.
advances that will make the mri procedure ten times faster will also make mri more widely available and cheaper to use.
medical researchers look ahead to using fleets of tiny nanosensors one thousandth the width of a human hair to find tumors and to deploying nano bots to repair tissues and even genes.
background in 2007 about 14 100 americans died from aids roughly one third the 1992 number.
880 chapter 26 environmental measures energy consumption in the united states has been increasing gradually since the 1970s.
despite efforts to cut petroleum consumption since the energy crisis the transportation sector remains almost completely dependent on petroleum.
in 2009 americans consumed 8 8 million barrels of petroleum in the form of gasoline per day.
use of coal natural gas and other energy sources has also increased since the 1970s as americans have adopted more technologies requiring electricity to operate in their homes and workplaces.
while the total energy consumption is going up however energy use per household has been on the decline.
increased energy efficiency of appliances heating and air conditioning has offset increases in home size and use of household electronics.
as more products requiring energy to function become a part of americans daily lives they continue to find ways to use energy more efficiently.
with the spreading use of technology came greater concern about the impact of human activities on the natural environment.
scientists have continued examining ways to reduce american dependence on pollution producing fossil fuels.
fossil fuels such as oil provided 84 percent of the energy in the united states in 2009 but also contributed to poor air quality acid rain and global warming.
many individuals have tried to help by reducing consumption of raw materials.
the recycling of glass bottles and jars plastic bottles newspapers cardboard and aluminum cans and other materials is now commonplace.
in 2007 recycling saved the energy equivalent of nearly 11 billion gallons of gasoline.
improved standard of living american scientific discoveries and technological innovations have had a positive affect on the standard of living.
improvements in communication and transportation have made it possible for the united states to participate in the global economy.
new technological advances led to new industries which created jobs for more americans.
innovations have improved productivity which enables prices of goods and services to decline and wages to increase.
as a result americans are able to take advantage of consumer technologies such as personal computers and mobile devices that make their lives easier.
finally new medical technologies improve health and increase life expectancy.
however the pace of innovation has slowed since the 1970s.
the federal government and private industries will have to work together to reinvigorate american innovation so that the nation can continue to reap the benefits.

one american s story every ten years the united states conducts a census or head count of its population.
the results of the census determine among other things how billions of federal dollars are spent for housing health care and education over the coming decade.
the census bureau estimates that the 1990 census undercounted latinos by more than five percent.
this undercount resulted in a loss of millions of dollars of aid to municipalities with large latino populations as well as denying latinos political representation in all levels of government.

in the next seven years it grew by nearly 30 percent to 45 5 million.
urban challenges one of the most significant socio cultural changes in american history has been the movement of americans from the cities to the suburbs.
the years after world war ii through the 1980s saw a widespread pattern of urban flight the process in which americans left the cities and moved to the suburbs.
at mid century the population of cities exceeded that of suburbs.
by 1970 the ratio became even 882 chapter 26 by the early 2000s after decades of decline some major cities across the country had increased their populations while others slowed or halted declines.
the transformation of the united states into a nation of suburbs had intensified the problems of the cities.
j main idea analyzing causes list the factors that influenced middle class residents to leave cities for suburbs.
causes of urban change several factors contributed to the movement of americans out of the cities.
because of the continued movement of job seeking americans into urban areas in the 1950s and 1960s many urban american neighborhoods became overcrowded.
overcrowding in turn contributed to such urban problems as increasing crime rates and decaying housing.
during the 1970s and early 1980s city dwellers who could afford to do so moved to the suburbs for more space privacy and security.
often families left the cities because suburbs offered newer less crowded schools.
as many middle class americans left cities for the suburbs the economic base of many urban neighborhoods declined and suburbs grew wealthy.
following the well educated labor force more industries relocated to suburban areas in the 1990s.
the economic base that provided tax money and supported city services in large cities such as new york detroit and philadelphia continued to shrink as people and jobs moved outward.
in addition many downtown districts fell into disrepair as suburban shoppers abandoned city stores for suburban shopping malls.
according to the 1990 census the 31 most impoverished communities in the united states were in cities.
by the mid 1990s however as the property values in the nation s inner cities declined many people returned to live there.
in a process known as gentrification they purchased and rehabilitated deteriorating urban property oftentimes displacing lower income people.
old industrial sites and neighborhoods in locations convenient to downtown became popular especially among young single adults who preferred the excitement of city life and the uniqueness of urban neighborhoods to the often more uniform environment of the suburbs.
architecture history through rebuilding the riverfronts as part of the effort to revitalize cities a number of architects landscape architects and urban planners have focused on enhancing what for many urban centers had become a neglected eyesore their waterfronts.
in pittsburgh landscape architects turned a dreary strip of concrete and parking lot into allegheny riverfront park an inviting stretch of natural walkways and recreation areas.
skillbuilder interpreting visual sources 1.
why might landscape architects consider improving riverfronts to be a key part of revitalizing cities.
in what other ways could architects and urban designers make city living more attractive.
the united states in today s world suburban living while many suburbanites continued to commute to city jobs during the 1990s and early 2000s increasing numbers of workers began to telecommute or use new communications technology such as computers modems and fax machines to work from their homes.
another notable trend was the movement of minority populations to the suburbs.
nationwide by the early 2000s more latinos asians and african americans lived in the suburbs than lived in the core cities.
suburban growth led to intense competition between suburbs and cities and among the suburbs themselves for business and industry.
since low rise suburban homes yielded low tax revenues tax hungry suburbs offered tax incentives for companies to locate within their borders.
these incentives resulted in lower tax revenues for local governments meaning that less funds were available for schools libraries and police departments.
consequently taxes were often increased to fund these community services as well as to build the additional roads and other infrastructure necessary to support the new businesses.
the shift of populations from cities to suburbs was not the only significant change in american life in the 1990s and early 2000s.
the american public was also growing older and its aging raised complex issues for policymakers.
hurricane katrina urban areas can also face challenges due to extreme weather.
in 2005 new orleans experienced widespread flooding as a result of a combination of physical and human geographic factors.
in august hurricane katrina a massive storm with sustained winds of 125 mph made landfall along the coast of the gulf of mexico and devastated parts of alabama mississippi and louisiana.
much of the city of new orleans lies below sea level using levees to hold back surrounding waters.
the city was flooded when these levees failed in the aftermath of the hurricane.
investigations have revealed that design flaws in the levees caused them to burst under the weight of hurricane katrina s storm surge.
the human suffering due to the storm and subsequent flooding was immense.

increased longevity and the aging of the baby boom generation were the primary reasons for the rising median age.
behind the rising median age lie several broad trends.
the country s birthrate has slowed slightly and the number of seniors has increased as americans live longer because of advances in medical care and living healthier lifestyles.
the number of people over 85 has increased at a faster rate than any other segment of the population to 5 7 million in the year 2008.
the graying of america has placed new demands on the country s programs that provide care for the elderly.
these programs accounted for only 6 percent of the national budget in 1955.
by 2010 these programs consumed about one third of the national budget.
the major programs that provide care for elderly and disabled people are medicare and social security.
medicare which pays medical expenses for senior citizens began in 1965 when most americans had lower life expectancies.
by 2010 the costs of this program exceeded 465 billion.
884 chapter 26 main idea predicting effects what are the factors that will force an eventual restructuring of social security.
social security which pays benefits to retired americans was designed to rely on continued funding from a vast number of younger workers who would contribute taxes to support a small number of retired workers.
that system worked well when younger workers far outnumbered retirees and when most workers didn t live long after retirement.
in 1996 it took social security contributions from three workers to support every retiree.
by 2030 however with an increase in the number of elderly persons and an expected decline in the birthrate there will be only two workers contributions available to support each senior citizen.
few issues loomed as large in the recent presidential elections as what to do about social security.
if the government does not restructure the system social security will eventually pay out more money than it will take in.
some people suggest that the system be reformed by raising deductions for workers taxing the benefits paid to wealthier americans and raising the age at which retirees can collect benefits.
the shifting population in addition to becoming increasingly suburban and elderly the population of the united states has also been transformed by immigration.
between 1970 and 2010 the country s population swelled from 204 million to more than 309 million.
immigration accounted for much of that growth.
as the nation s newest residents yearned for u s citizenship however other americans debated the effects of immigration on american life.

in contrast more than 30 percent of immigrants since the 1960s have come from asia and about 50 percent from the western hemisphere primarily mexico.
in mexico for example during three months in 1994 1995 the mexican peso was devalued by 73 percent.
the devaluation made the mexican economy decline.
as a result almost a million mexicans lost their jobs.
many of the unemployed headed north in search of jobs in the united states.
this search for a better opportunity continued throughout the 1990s as thousands of legal and illegal immigrants arrived each day the vast majority from mexico.
to help those persons seeking more opportunity in america a temporary guest worker program for those immigrants residing illegally in the united states was proposed several times in the early 2000s.
by 2010 however this guest worker program had not been enacted into law.
census bureau data indicated that patterns of immigration are changing the country s ethnic and racial makeup.
by 2001 for example california had become a majority minority state with asian americans latinos african americans and native americans making up more than half its population.
by 2009 three other states hawaii new mexico and texas had also become majority minority states.
arizona georgia maryland mississippi and new york were close with minority populations of 40 percent.
debates over immigration policy the presence of such a large number of immigrants has also added to the continuing debate over u s immigration policies.
many americans believe that their country can t absorb more immigrants.
by the early 1990s an estimated 3 2 million illegal immigrants from mexico el salvador guatemala and haiti had made their way to the united states.
many illegal immigrants also arrived from canada poland china and ireland.
they took jobs many americans turned down as farm workers and domestic servants often receiving the minimum wage or less and no benefits.
by 2009 an estimated 10 8 million illegal immigrants resided in the united states.
hostility toward illegal immigration has increased in states such as california and arizona two states with high percentages of immigrants.
in 1994 california passed proposition 187 which cut all education and nonemergency health benefits to illegal immigrants.
by march 1998 proposition 187 was ruled unconstitutional.
in 2010 arizona passed a law that enhanced state and local police authority to enforce federal immigration laws.
these efforts to control immigration inspired political participation among hispanic voters who saw themselves as targets.
as more immigrants make their way to the u s and the nations ethnic composition changes debates about immigration will continue.
those who favor tighter restrictions argue that immigrants take desired jobs.
others however point to america s historical diversity and the new ideas and energy immigrantsbring.
background the u s census has asked a race question on every census since the first survey in 1790.
since 1890 the categories and definitions have changed with nearly every census.
ain ipea comparing how are current arguments against immigration similar to those used in the past.
886 chapter 26 native americans continue legal battles as the nation debated its immigrant policies the ancestors of america s original inhabitants continued to struggle.
the end of the 20th century found most members of this minority enduring extremely difficult lives.
in 2007 about 25 percent of native americans lived below the poverty line more than two times the poverty rate for white americans.
furthermore native americans endured suicide rates and alcoholism rates that were considerably higher than that of the general population.
in the face of such hardships native americans strived to improve their lives.
throughout the 1990s dozens of tribes attained greater economic independence by establishing thriving gaming resorts.
although controversial for promoting gambling reservation gaming 27 billion a year industry by 2008 provided native americans with much needed money for jobs education social services and infrastructure.
over the past decades native americans have used the courts to attain greater recognition of their tribal ancestry and land rights.
in 1999 for example the u s supreme court ruled that the chippewa indians of minnesota retained fishing and hunting rights on some 13 million acres of land that were guaranteed to them in an 1837 treaty.
across the nation a number of other tribes have had similar land rights affirmed.
america in a new millennium as the 21st century begins americans face both new problems and old ones.
environmental concerns have become a global issue and have moved to center stage.
furthermore poverty remains a problem for many americans in the late 20th century as does the increasing threat that terrorist acts pose to americans at home and abroad.
it is clear that the new century america faces will bring changes but those changes need not deepen divisions among americans.
with effort and cooperation the change could foster growth and tolerance.
the 20th century brought new ways of both destroying and enriching lives.
what will the 21st bring.

the united states in today s world tracing themes immigration and migration immigrants to the united states have been part of a worldwide movement pushing people away from traditional means of support and pulling them toward better opportunities.
most immigrants have left their homelands because of economic problems though some have fled oppressive governments or political turmoil.
war has often been the deciding factor for people to immigrate to the united states or to migrate within the country.
others have migrated to escape poverty religious persecution and racial violence.
but the chief lure in coming to the united states or migrating within its borders continues to be the opportunity to earn a living.
migrating to the west throughout the 19th century americans continued their movement westward to the pacific ocean.
victory in the war with mexico in 1848 greatly increased the amount of land under american control and thousands of americans moved out west to take advantage of it.
two important consequences emerged from this movement.
first following the discovery of gold in california hundreds of thousands of people from around the world rushed in to strike it rich.
within a year there were enough residents in california to qualify it for statehood.
second americans disagreed over whether the new lands should be open to slavery.
that disagreement fueled the fires that led to the civil war.
adapting to american ways with hope and apprehension millions of foreign immigrants poured into americas pulsing cities during the early 20th century.
bringing with them values habits and attire from the old world they faced a multitude of new experiences expectations and products in the new world.
many native born americans feared that the new immigrants posed a threat to american culture.
instead of the immigrants being allowed to negotiate their existence by combining the old with the new they were pressured to forget their old cultures languages and customs for more american ways.
migrating for jobs throughout the 20th century african americans migrated across the united states.
in the great migration of the early 20th century they left their homes in the rural south.
of the millions of african americans who left most moved to cities usually in the north.
the second migration sparked by world war ii allowed african americans to take industrial jobs many formerly held by whites to support the war effort.
this migration had lasting consequences for the civil rights movement.
many african americans who remained in the south moved to cities where they developed organizations that helped them fight segregation.
in search of a new life in 1964 603 vietnamese lived in the united states.
a decade later as the vietnam war ended hundreds of thousands of vietnamese refugees fled their homeland for other nations including the united states.
vietnamese immigration to america continued and by 1998 there were nearly 1 million vietnamese born persons living in the united states.
the men and women who made this long and arduous journey from vietnam are part of the changing face of u s immigration.
beginning in the 1970s asians and latin americans replaced europeans as the two largest immigrant groups in the united states.
between 1970 and 1990 about 1 5 million europeans journeyed to americas shores.
during that same period roughly 5 6 million latin americans and 3 5 million asians arrived.
this trend has continued.
in 2008 the largest immigrant groups in the united states hailed from mexico the philippines india and china and hong kong respectively.
these most recent arrivals to the united states have come for largely the same reasons greater freedom and economic opportunity and the chance to begin a new life.

one american s story jessie lopez de la cruz s life changed one night in 1962 when cesar chavez came to her home.
chavez a mexican american farm worker was trying to organize a union for california s mostly spanish speaking farm workers.
chavez said the women have to be involved.
they re the ones working out in the fields with their husbands.
soon jessie was in the fields talking to farm workers about the union.
a personal voice jessie lopez de la cruz wherever i went to speak.
i told them about.
how we had no benefits no minimum wage nothing out in the fields no restrooms nothing.
i said weil.
do you think we should be putting up with this in this modern age.
we can stand up.
we can talk back.
this country is very rich and we want a share of the money those growers make off our sweat and our work by exploiting us and our children quoted in moving the mountain women working for social change the efforts of jessie lopez de la cruz were just part of a larger rights movement during the turbulent and revolutionary 1960s.
as african americans were fighting for civil rights latinos and native americans rose up to assert their own rights and improve their lives.
the latino presence grows latinos or americans of latin american descent are a large and diverse group.
during the 1960s the latino population in the united states grew from 3 million to more than 9 million.
today the latino population includes people from sever al different areas primarily mexico puerto rico cuba the dominican republic central america and south america.
each of these groups has its own history its 768 chapter 23 r in the 1920s thousands of mexican people came to the u s and settled in barrios.
shown here hispanic men gather in a park in california main idea identifying problems aj what problems did different groups of latino immigrants share.
own pattern of settlement in the united states and its own set of economic social cultural and political concerns.
latinos of varied origins mexican americans the largest latino group have lived mostly in the southwest and california.
this group includes descendants of the nearly 100 000 mexicans who had lived in territories ceded by mexico to the united states in 1848.
another million or so mexicans came to the united states in the 1910s following mexico s revolution.
still others came as braceros or temporary laborers during the 1940s and 1950s.
in the 1960s close to half a million mexicans immigrated most in search of better paying jobs.
puerto ricans began immigrating to the united states after the u s occupation of puerto rico in 1898.
as of 1960 almost 900 000 puerto ricans were living in the continental united states including almost half a million on new york city s west side.
large cuban communities also formed in new york city and in miami and new jersey.
this is because hundreds of thousands of cubans many of whom were academics and professionals fled to the united states in 1959 to escape fidel castro s communist rule.
in addition tens of thousands of salvadorans guatemalans nicaraguans and colombians immigrated to the united states after the 1960s to escape civil war and chronic poverty.
wherever they had settled during the 1960s many latinos encountered ethnic prejudice and discrimination in jobs and housing.
most lived in segregated barrios or spanish speaking neighborhoods.
the latino jobless rate was nearly 50 percent higher than that of whites as was the percentage of latino families living in poverty y historical spotlight desperate journeys in the 1960s and 1970s thousands of poor mexicans illegally crossed the 2 000 mile border between the united states and mexico each year.
the journey these illegal aliens undertook was often made more difficult by coyotes guides who charged large amounts of money to help them cross the border but who often didnt deliver on their promises.
illegal immigrants problems didnt end when they entered the united states where they were denied many social services including unemployment insurance and food stamps.
in addition the immigration and naturalization service urged businesses to refrain from hiring them.
as a result some owners stopped employing people with latino names including legal immigrants latinos fight for change as the presence of latinos in the united states grew so too did their demand for greater representation and better treat ment.
during the 1960s latinos demanded not only equal opportunity but also a respect for their culture and heritage.
an era of social chai yty player cesar chavez 1927 1993 cesar chavez spoke from experience when he said many things in farm labor are terrible as a teenager chavez moved with his family from farm to farm picking such crops as grapes apricots and olives.
the worst crop was the olives chavez recalled.
the olives are so small you can never fill the bucket the seeds of protest grew early in chavez.
as a teenager he once went to see a movie only to find that the theater was segregated whites on one side of the aisle and mexicans on the other side.
i really hadnt thought much about what i was going to do but i had to do something chavez recalled.
the future union leader sat down in the whites only section and stayed there until the police arrived and arrested him.
the farm worker movement as jessie lopez de la cruz explained thousands working on california s fruit and vegetable farms did backbreaking work for little pay and few benefits.
cesar chavez believed that farm workers had to unionize that their strength would come from bargaining as a group.
in 1962 chavez and dolores huerta established the national farm workers association.
four years later this group merged with a filipino agricultural union also founded by huerta to form the united farm workers organizing committee ufwoc.
chavez and his fellow organizers insisted that california s large fruit and vegetable companies accept their union as the bargaining agent for the farm workers.
in 1965 when california s grape growers refused chavez launched a nationwide boycott of the companies grapes.
chavez like martin luther king jr believed in using nonviolence to reach his goal.
the union sent farm workers across the country to convince consumers not to buy california grapes.
chavez then went on a three week fast in which he lost 35 pounds.
he ended his fast by attending mass with senator robert f kennedy.
the efforts of the farm workers eventually paid off.
in 1970 huerta negotiated a contract between the grape growers and the ufwoc.
union workers would finally be guaranteed higher wages and other benefits long denied them.
cultural pride the activities of the california farm workers helped to inspire other latino brown power movements across the country.
in new york members of the puerto rican population began to demand that schools offer spanish speaking children classes taught in their own language as well as programs about their culture.
in 1968 congress enacted the bilingual education act which provided funds for schools to develop bilingual and cultural heritage programs for non english speaking children.
young mexican americans started to call themselves chicanos or chicanas a shortened version of mexicanos that expressed pride in their heritage.
a chicano community action group called the brown berets formed under the leadership of david sanchez.
in 1968 they organized walkouts in east los angeles high schools.
about 15 000 chicano students walked out of class demanding smaller classes more chicano teachers and administrators and programs designed to reduce the high latino dropout rate.
militant mexican american students also won the establishment of chicano studies programs at colleges and universities.
art was another outlet to express cultural pride.
chicano murals began to appear on buildings in cities across the southwest.
these murals reinvigorated a sense of shared cultural heritage.
some also conveyed political messages.
political power latinos also began organizing politically during the 1960s.
some worked within the two party system.
for example the mexican american political association mapa helped elect los angeles politician edward roybal to the house of representatives.
during the 1960s eight hispanic americans served in the house and one hispanic senator was elected joseph montoya of new mexico.
others like texan jose angel gutierrez sought to create an independent latino political movement.
in 1970 he established la raza unida the people united.
in the 1970s la raza unida ran latino candidates in five states and won races for mayor as well as other local political offices.

preac er reies tijerina founded the alianza federal de mercedes federal alliance of land grants to help reclaim u s land taken from mexican landholders in the 19th century.
he and his followers raided the rio arriba county courthouse in tierra amarilla new mexico in order to force authorities to recognize the plight of new mexican small farmers.
they were later arrested.
vocabulary homogeneous uniform or similar throughout i main idea analyzing motives why did native americans resist assimilation.
native americans struggle for equality as are latinos native americans are sometimes viewed as a single homogeneous group despite the hundreds of distinct native american tribes and nations in the united states.
one thing that these diverse tribes and nations have shared is a mostly bleak existence in the united states and a lack of autonomy or ability to control and govern their own lives.
through the years many native americans have clung to their heritage refusing to assimilate or blend into mainstream society.
native american nationalist vine deloria jr expressed the view that mainstream society was nothing more than ice cream bars and heart trouble and.
getting up at six o clock in the morning to mow your lawn in the suburbs.
native americans seek greater autonomy despite their cultural diversity native americans as a group have been the poorest of americans and have suffered from the highest unemployment rate.
they have also been more likely than any other group to suffer from tuberculosis and alcoholism.
although the native american population rose during the 1960s the death rate among native american infants was nearly twice the national average while life expectancy was several years less than for other americans.
in 1954 the eisenhower administration enacted a termination policy to deal with these problems but it did not respect native american culture.
native americans were relocated from isolated reservations into mainstream urban american life.
the plan failed miserably.
most who moved to the cities remained desperately poor.
in 1961 representatives from 61 native american groups met in chicago and drafted the declaration of indian purpose which stressed the determination of native americans to choose our own way of life.
the declaration called for an end to the termination program in favor of new policies designed to create economic opportunities for native americans on their reservations.
in 1968 president lyndon johnson established the national council on indian opportunity to ensure that programs reflect the needs and desires of the indian people.
voices of protest many young native americans were dissatisfied with the slow pace of reform.
their discontent fueled the growth of the american indian movement aim an often militant native american rights organization.
while aim began in 1968 largely as a self defense group against police brutality it soon branched out to include protecting the rights of large native american populations in northern and western states.

campbell s father was a north cheyenne and his great grandfather black horse fought in the 1876 battle of the little bighorn in which the cheyenne and the sioux defeated lieutenant colonel george custer.
in 1992 campbell was elected to the u s senate from colorado marking the first time since 1929 that a native american had been elected to the senate.
campbell stated that while he served the entire nation the needs of native americans would always remain a priority.

chippewa protester confronting the government in its early years aim as well as other groups actively and sometimes violently confronted the government.
in 1972 aim leader russell means organized the trail of broken treaties march in washington d c to protest the u s government s treaty violations throughout history.
native americans from across the country joined the march.
they sought the restoration of 110 million acres of land.
they also pushed for the abolition of the bureau of indian affairs bia which many believed was corrupt.
the marchers temporarily occupied the bia building destroyed records and caused 2 million in property damage.
a year later aim led nearly 200 sioux to the tiny village of wounded knee south dakota where the u s cavalry had massacred a sioux village in 1890.
in protest against both tribal leadership and federal policies the sioux seized the town taking hostages.
after tense negotiations with the fbi and a shootout that left two native americans dead and others wounded the confrontation ended with a government promise to reexamine native american treaty rights.

a an era of social changt i i reynolds v sims 1964 origins of the case in 1901 seats in the alabama state legislature were apportioned or assigned to districts based on population.
by the early 1960s each alabama county still had the same number of representatives as it did in 1901 even though the populations of the counties had changed.
a group of voters sued to make representation proportional to the changed populations.
when the suit succeeded state legislators who were threatened with losing their seats appealed to the supreme court.
the ruling the supreme court upheld the principle of one person one vote and ruled that the equal protection clause required representation in state legislatures to be based on population.
legal reasoning prior to reynolds the court had already applied the one person one vote principle to federal congressional elections see legal sources.
in reynolds chief justice earl warren extended this principle to state legislatures.
he argued that when representation does not reflect population some people s votes are worth more than others.
66 the fundamental principle of representative government in this country is one of equal representation for equal numbers of people without regard to.
place of residence within a state.
legislators represent people not trees or acres.
legislators are elected by voters not farms or cities or economic interests 99 warren concluded that alabama s apportionment scheme discriminated against people because of where they live.
for these reasons the court ruled that any acceptable apportionment plan must provide an equal number of legislative seats for equally populated areas.
a plan that does not is unconstitutional because it denies some voters the equal protection of the laws.

wesberry v sanders 1964 the court applied the one person one vote rule to congressional districts.
i chief justice warren front center and members of tl 1 1964 supreme court.
why it mattered the voters who initiated the suit against alabama s apportionment were part of america s tremendous urban growth in the 20th century.
during and after world war ii tens of thousands of americans including large numbers of african americans moved from rural areas to cities and suburbs.
voters in alabama s more urban areas found that they were underrepresented.
likewise before reynolds urban residents as a whole paid far more in taxes than they received in benefits.
a great deal was at stake.
the one person one vote principle increased the influence of urban residents by forcing legislatures to create new election districts in the cities to reflect their large populations.
as more legislators representing urban and suburban needs were elected they were able to change funding formulas tunneling more money into their districts.
in addition minorities immigrants and professionals who tend to make up a large proportion of urban populations gained better representation.
on the other hand the power of farmers was eroded as election districts in rural areas were combined and incumbents had to campaign against each other for a single seat.
historical impact the warren court s reapportionment decisions in baker v carr gray v sanders wesberry v sanders and reynolds were a revolution in u s politics.
the lawsuit that culminated in the reynolds decision was also part of a broader movement in the 1960s to protect voting rights.
largely because of the voting rights act of 1965 voter registration among african americans in mississippi for instance climbed from 6 7 percent to 59 8 percent.
viewed together the combination of increased protection of voting rights and acceptance of the one person one vote principle brought the united states several steps closer to fulfilling its democratic ideals.
in the 1990s the court revisited reapportionment.
a 1982 act of congress had required states to create districts with minority majorities in order to increase the number of nonwhite representatives.
as a result following the 1990 census a record number of african americans were elected to congress.
but opponents contended that defining districts by race violated equal protection and one person one vote.
in a series of decisions the court agreed and abolished minority districting.

betty friedan november 1967 during the 1950s writer betty friedan seemed to be living the american dream.
she had a loving husband healthy children and a house in the suburbs.
according to the experts doctors psychologists and women s magazines that was all a woman needed to be fulfilled.
why then wasn t she happy.
in 1957 after conducting a survey of her smith college classmates 15 years after graduation she found she was not alone.
friedan eventually wrote a book the feminine mystique in which she addressed this problem that has no name.
a personal voice betty friedan the problem lay buried unspoken.
it was a strange stirring a sense of dissatisfaction a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the united states.
each suburban wife struggled with it alone.
as she made the beds shopped for groceries matched slipcover material ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children chauffeured cub scouts and brownies lay beside her husband at night she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question is this all the feminine mystique during the 1960s women answered friedan s question with a resounding no.
in increasing numbers they joined the nation s african americans latinos and native americans in the fight for greater civil rights and equality in society.
a new womens movement arises the theory behind the women s movement of the 1960s was feminism the belief that women should have economic political and social equality with men.
feminist beliefs had gained momentum during the mid 1800s and in 1920 won women the right to vote.
while the women s movement declined after this achievement it reawakened during the 1960s spurred by the political activism of the times.

this 1960s pin displays a slogan used by betty friedan at the national womens political caucus.
women in the workplace in 1950 only one out of three women worked for wages.
by 1960 that number had increased to about 40 percent.
still during this time certain jobs were considered men s work and women were shut out.
the jobs available to women mostly clerical work domestic service retail sales social work teaching and nursing paid poorly.
the country largely ignored this discrimination until president kennedy appointed the presidential commission on the status of women in 1961.
in 1963 the commission reported that women were paid far less than men even when doing the same jobs.
furthermore women were seldom promoted to management positions regardless of their education experience and ability.
these newly publicized facts awakened many women to their unequal status in society.
women and activism ironically many women felt the sting move oh little girl of discrimination when they became involved in the civil rights and antiwar movements movements that toted the ideological banner of protecting people s rights.
within some of these organizations such as sncc and sds men led most of the activities while women were assigned lesser roles.
when women protested this arrangement the men usually brushed them aside.
such experiences led some women to organize small groups to discuss their concerns.
during these discussions or consciousness raising sessions women shared their lives with each other and discovered that their experiences were not unique.
rather they reflected a much larger pattern of sexism or discrimination based on gender.
author robin morgan delineated this pattern.
a personal voice robin morgan it makes you very sensitive raw even this consciousness.
everything from the verbal assault on the street to a well meant sexist joke your husband tells to the lower pay you get at work for doing the same job a man would be paid more for to television commercials to rock song lyrics to the pink or blue blanket they put on your infant in the hospital nursery to speeches by male revolutionaries that reek of male supremacy everything seems to barrage your aching brain.
you begin to see how all pervasive a thing is sexism.
quoted in sisterhood is powerful an anthology of writings from the womens liberation movement we have more important issues to talk about here than women s liberation 9 a male antiwar activist an era of social change the womens movement emerges the feminine mystique which captured the very discontent that many women were feeling quickly became a bestseller and helped to galvanize women across the country.
by the late 1960s women were working together for change.
this is not a movement one joins observed robin morgan.
the women s liberation movement exists where three or four friends or neighbors decide to meet regularly on the welfare lines in the supermarket the factory the convent the farm the maternity ward.
the movement experiences gains and losses as the women s movement grew it achieved remarkable and enduring political and social gains for women.
along the way however it also suffered setbacks most notably in its attempt to ensure women s equality in the constitution.
the creation of now the women s movement gained strength with the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 which prohibited discrimination based on race religion national origin and gender and created the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to handle discrimination claims.
by 1966 however some women argued that the eeoc didn t adequately address women s grievances.
that year 28 women including betty friedan created the national organization for women now to pursue women s goals.
the time has come the founders of now declared to confront with concrete action the conditions which now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity.
which is their right as individual americans and as human beings.
b now members pushed for the creation of child care facilities that would enable mothers to pursue jobs and education.
now also pressured the eeoc to enforce more vigorously the ban on gender discrimination in hiring.
now s efforts prompted the eeoc to declare sex segregated job ads illegal and to issue guidelines to employers stating that they could no longer refuse to hire women for traditionally male jobs.
a diverse movement in its first three years now s ranks swelled to 175 000 members.
a number of other womens groups sprang up around the country too.
in 1968 a militant group known as the new york radical women staged a well publicized demonstration at the annual miss america pageant.
the women threw bras girdles wigs and other women s garbage into a freedom trash can.
they then crowned a sheep miss america.
around this time gloria steinem a journalist political activist and ardent supporter of the women s liberation movement made her voice heard on the subjects of feminism and equality.
steinem s grandmother had served as president of the ohio woman s suffrage association from 1908 to 1911 steinem had inherited her passion and conviction.
in 1971 steinem helped found the national women s political caucus a moderate group that encouraged women to seek political office.
in 1972 she and other women created a new women s magazine ms designed to treat contemporary issues from a feminist perspective.
legal and social gains as the women s movement progressed women began to question all sorts of gender based distinctions.
people protested that a woman s physical playr gloria steinem 1934 gloria steinem became one of the more prominent figures of the womens movement after she and several other women founded ms magazine in 1972.
the magazine soon became a major voice of the womens movement.
steinem said that she decided to start the feminist magazine after editors in the mainstream media continually rejected her stories about the women s movement editors who had assumed i had some valuable biological insight into food male movie stars and textured stockings now questioned whether i or other women writers were biologically capable of writing objectively about feminism.
that was the beginning main idea analyzing causes g what prompted women to establish now 778 chapter 23 thousands of women march through the streets of new york city during the summer of 1970 to promote womens equality.

main idea appearance was often considered a job qualification.
girls exclusion from sports such as baseball and football came into question.
some women began using the title ms and refused to adopt their husband s last name upon marriage.
these changes in attitude were paralleled by numerous legal changes.
in 1972 congress passed a ban on gender discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance as part of the higher education act.
as a result several all male colleges opened their doors to women.
that same year congress expanded the powers of the eeoc and gave working parents a tax break for child care expenses.
roe v wade one of the more controversial positions that now and other feminist groups supported was a woman s right to have an abortion.
in 1973 the supreme court ruled in roe v wade that women do have the right to choose an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy.
some thought the ruling might bring to an end the emotional and divisive public argument.
however the issue still divides americans today.
the equal rights amendment era in what seemed at first to be another triumph for the women s movement congress passed the equal rights amendment era in 1972.
the amendment then needed ratification by 38 states to become part of the constitution.
first introduced to congress in 1923 the era would guarantee that both men and women would enjoy the same rights and protections under the law.
it was many supporters said a matter of simple justice.
the amendment scared many people and a stop era campaign was launched in 1972.
conservative phyllis schlafly along with conservative religious groups political organizations and many anti feminists felt that the era would lead to a parade of horribles such as the drafting of women the end of laws protecting homemakers the end of a husband s responsibility to provide for his family and same sex marriages.
schlafly said that radical feminists hate men marriage and children and were oppressed only in their distorted minds.
a personal voice phyllis schlafly u s constitution is not the place for symbols or slogans it is not the proper device to alleviate psychological problems of personal inferiority.
symbols and slogans belong on bumper strips not in the constitution.
it would be a tragic mistake for our nation to succumb to the tirades and demands of a few women who are seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems.
quoted in the equal rights amendment the history and the movement the new right emerges in order to combat the era and the pro abortion supporters conservatives built what they called a new pro family movement.
in the 1970s this coalition which focused on social cultural and moral problems came to be known as the new right.
phyllis schlafly became a leader within the new right movement.
in 1972 she founded the eagle forum a conservative interest group focused primarily on social issues.
the group also uses donations to support conservative political candidates.
throughout the 1970s the new right built grassroots support for social conservatism.

awomans place sin thehouse ah so1n the 5 wjsi the new right and the women s movement clashed most dramatically over the era.
by 1977 it had won approval from 35 of the 38 states needed for ratification but the new right gained strength.
by june of 1982 the deadline for ratification not enough states had approved the amendment.
the era went down in defeat.
despite era s defeat the women s movement altered society in countless ways such as by transforming women s conventional roles and their attitudes toward career and family.
interviews with women graduates at stanford university reflect the change.
of graduates in 1965 70 percent planned not to work at all when their children were of preschool age.
when the class of 1972 was surveyed only 7 percent said they would stop working to raise children.
the women s movement also succeeded in expanding career opportunities for women.
for instance as of 1970 8 percent of all medical school graduates and 5 percent of all law school graduates were women.
by 1998 those proportions had risen to 42 and 44 percent respectively.
yet many women ran into a glass ceiling an invisible but very real resistance to promoting women into top positions.
by 1983 women held 13 5 percent of elected state offices as well as 24 seats in the u s congress.
more importantly as historian sara evans has noted by 1980 feminist concerns were firmly on the national political agenda and clearly there to stay.
most of all the women s movement helped countless women open their lives to new possibilities.

in 1966 alex forman left his conventional life in mainstream america and headed to san francisco.
arriving there with little else but a guitar he joined thousands of others who were determined to live in a more peaceful and carefree environment.
he recalled his early days in san francisco s haight ashbury district the hub of hippie life.

everybody was in love with life and in love with their fellow human beings to the point where they were just sharing in incredible ways with everybody.
taking people in off the street and letting them stay in their homes.
you could walk down almost any street in haight ashbury where i was living and someone would smile at you and just go hey its beautiful isnt it.
it was a very special time.
quoted in from camelot to kent state forman was part of the counterculture a movement made up mostly of white middle class college youths who had grown disillusioned with the war in vietnam and injustices in america during the 1960s.
instead of challenging the system they turned their backs on traditional america and tried to establish a whole new society based on peace and love.
although their heyday was shortlived their legacy remains.
members of the counterculture relax in a california park.
the counterculture in the late 1960s the historian theodore roszak deemed these idealistic youths the counterculture.
it was a culture he said so different from the mainstream that it scarcely looks to many as a culture at all but takes on the alarming appearance of a barbarian intrusion.
an era of social chi in turn on drop out members of the counterculture known as hippies shared some of the beliefs of the new left movement.

like a rolling stone bob dylan i hippie culture the hippie era sometimes known as the age of aquarius was marked by rock n roll music outrageous clothing sexual license and illegal drugs in particular marijuana and a new hallucinogenic drug called lsd or acid.
timothy leary an early experimenter with the drug promoted the use of lsd as a mind expanding aid for self awareness.
hippies also turned to eastern religions such as zen buddhism which professed that one could attain enlightenment through meditation rather than the reading of scriptures.
hippies donned ragged jeans tie dyed t shirts military garments love beads and native american ornaments.
thousands grew their hair out despite the fact that their more conservative elders saw this as an act of disrespect.
signs across the country said make america beautiful give a hippie a haircut.
hippies also rejected conventional home life.
many joined communes in which the members renounced private property to live communally.
by the midsixties haight ashbury in san francisco was known as the hippie capital mainly because california did not outlaw hallucinogenic drugs until 1966.
decline of the movement after only a few years the counterculture s peace and harmony gave way to violence and disillusionment.
the urban communes eventually turned seedy and dangerous.
alex forman recalled there were ripoffs violence.
people living on the street with no place to stay.
having dispensed with society s conventions and rules the hippies had to rely on each other.
many discovered that the philosophy of do your own thing did not provide enough guidance for how to live.
we were together at the level of peace and love said one disillusioned hippie.
we fell apart over who would cook and wash dishes and pay the bills.
by 1970 many had fallen victim to the drugs they used experiencing drug addiction and mental breakdowns.
the rock singer janis joplin and the legendary guitarist jimi hendrix both died of drug overdoses in 1970.
as the mystique of the 1960s wore off thousands of hippies lined up at government offices to collect welfare and food stamps dependent on the very society they had once rejected.

art the counterculture s rebellious style left its mark on the art world.
the 1960s saw the rise of pop art popular art.
pop artists led by andy warhol attempted to bring art into the mainstream.
pop art was characterized by bright simple commercial looking images often depicting everyday life.
for instance warhol became famous for his bright silk screen portraits of soup cans marilyn monroe and other icons of mass culture.
these images were repeated to look mass produced and impersonal a criticism of the times implying that individual freedoms had been lost to a more conventional cookie cutter lifestyle.
main idea making inferences what did rock n roll symbolize for american youth.
rock music during the 1960s the counterculture movement embraced rock n roll as its loud and biting anthem of protest.
the music was an offshoot of african american rhythm and blues music that had captivated so many teenagers during the 1950s.
the band that perhaps more than any other helped propel rock music into mainstream america was the beatles.
the british band made up of four youths from working class liverpool england arrived in america in 1964 and immediately took the country by storm.
by the time the beatles broke up in 1970 the four lads had inspired a countless number of other bands and had won over millions of americans to rock n roll.
one example of rock n roll s popularity occurred in august 1969 on a farm in upstate new york.
more than 400 000 showed up for a music festival called woodstock music and art fair.
this festival represented as one songwriter put it the 60s movement of peace and love and some higher cultural cause.
for three days the most popular bands and musicians performed including jimi hendrix janis joplin joe cocker joan baez the grateful dead and jefferson airplane.
despite the huge crowd woodstock was peaceful and well organized.
however tom mathews a writer who attended the woodstock festival recalled his experience there as less than blissful.
the beatles shown here in 1967 influenced fashion with their long hair and psychedelic clothing.

while some hailed the increasing permissiveness as liberating others attacked it as a sign of moral decay.
for millions of americans the new tolerance was merely an uncivilized lack of respect for established social norms.
eventually the counterculture movement would lead a great many americans to more liberal attitudes about dress and appearance lifestyle and social behavior yet in the short run it produced largely the opposite effect.

analyzing issues what role did the counterculture and antiwar movement play in helping richard nixon win the presidency.
the conservative response in the late 1960s many believed that the country was losing its sense of right and wrong.
increasingly conservative voices began to express people s anger.
at the 1968 republican convention in miami candidate richard m nixon expressed that anger.
a personal voice richard nixon as we look at america we see cities enveloped in smoke and flame.
we hear sirens in the night.
we see americans hating each other at home did we come all this way for this.

speech at republican convention 1968 conservatives attack the counterculture nixon was not the only conservative voice expressing alarm.
fbi director j edgar hoover issued a warning that revolutionary terrorism was a threat on campuses and in cities.
other conservative critics warned that campus rebels posed a danger to traditional values and threatened to plunge american society into anarchy.
conservatives also attacked the counterculture for what they saw as its decadent values.
in the view of psychiatrist bruno bettelheim student rebels and members of the counterculture had been pampered in childhood as young adults they did not have the ability for delayed gratification.
according to some conservative commentators the counterculture had abandoned rational thought in favor of the senses and uninhibited self expression.
the angry response of mainstream americans caused a profound change in the political landscape of the united states.
by the end of the 1960s conservatives were presenting their own solutions on such issues as lawlessness and crime the size of the federal government and welfare.
this growing conservative movement would propel nixon into the white house and set the nation on a more conservative course.

only 28 dewey served in the office of strategic services the chief intelligence gathering body of the u s military and forerunner of the central intelligence agency.
dewey was sent to assess what was becoming an explosive situation in vietnam a southeast asian country that had recently been freed from japanese rule as a result of the allied victory in world war ii.
see map on page 733.
before the war france had ruled vietnam and the surrounding countries now it sought with british aid to regain control of the region.
the vietnamese had resisted japanese occupation now they were preparing to fight the french.
dewey saw nothing but disaster in france s plan.
cochinchina southern vietnam is burning he reported the french and british are finished here and we the united states ought to clear out of southeast asia.
on his way to the airport dewey encountered a roadblock staffed by vietnamese soldiers and shouted at them in french.
presumably mistaking him for a french soldier the guards shot him in the head.
thus a peter dewey whose body was never recovered was the first american to die in vietnam.
unfortunately dewey would not be the last.
as vietnam s independence effort came under communist influence the united states grew increasingly concerned about the small country s future.
eventually america would fight a war to halt the spread of communism in vietnam.
the war would claim the lives of almost 60 000 americans and more than 2 million vietnamese.
it also would divide the american nation as no other event since the civil war.
lieutenant colonel a peter dewey america supports france in vietnam americas involvement in vietnam began in 1950 during the french indochina war the name given to france s attempt to reestablish its rule in vietnam after world war ii.
seeking to strengthen its ties with france and to help fight the spread of communism the united states provided the french with massive eco nomic and military support.
730 chapter 22 vocabulary peasant a member of the class of agricultural laborers main idea synthesizing how and why did the united states support frances vietnam war efforts.
french rule in vietnam from the late 1800s until world war ii france ruled most of indochina including letnam laos and cambodia.
french colonists who built plantations on peasant land and extracted rice and rubber for their own profit encountered growing unrest among the vietnamese peasants.
french rulers reacted harshly by restricting freedom of speech and assembly and by jailing many vietnamese nationalists.
these measures failed to curb all dissent and opposition continued to grow.
the indochinese communist party founded in 1930 staged a number of revolts under the leadership of ho chi minh.
although the french condemned ho chi minh to death for his rebellious activity he fled vietnam and orchestrated vietnam s growing independence movement from exile in the soviet union and later from china.
in 1940 the japanese took control of vietnam.
the next year ho chi minh returned home and helped form the vietminh an organization whose goal it was to win vietnam s independence from foreign rule.
when the allied defeat of japan in august 1945 forced the japanese to leave vietnam that goal suddenly seemed a reality.
on september 2 1945 ho chi minh stood in the middle of a huge crowd in the northern city of hanoi and declared vietnam an independent nation.
france battles the vietminh france however had no intention of relinquishing its former colony.
french troops moved back into vietnam by the end of 1945 eventually regaining control of the cities and the country s southern half.
ho chi minh vowed to fight from the north to liberate the south from french control.
if ever the tiger pauses ho had said referring to the vietminh the elephant france will impale him on his mighty tusks.
but the tiger will not pause and the elephant will die of exhaustion and loss of blood.
in 1950 the united states entered the vietnam struggle despite a peter dewey s warnings.
that year president truman sent nearly 15 million in economic aid to france.
over the next four years the united states paid for much of france s war pumping nearly 1 billion into the effort to defeat a man america had once supported.
ironically during world war ii the united states had forged an alliance with ho chi minh supplying him with aid to resist the japanese.
but by 1950 the united states had come to view its one time ally as a communist aggressor the vietminh drive out the french upon entering the white house in 1953 president eisenhower continued the policy of supplying aid to the french war effort.
by this time the united states had settled for a stalemate with the communists in korea which only stiffened america s resolve to halt the spread of communism elsewhere.
during a news conference in 1954 eisenhower explained the domino theory warning that if vietnam fell to communism other southeast asian countries would soon follow just like dominoes toppling.
you have a row of dominoes set up the president said.
you knock over the first one and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly.
despite massive u s aid however the french could not retake vietnam.
they were forced to surrender in may of 1954 when the vietminh overran the french outpost at dien bien phu in northwestern vietnam.
ho chi minh 1890 1969 born nguyen tat thanh to a poor vietnamese family ho chi minh which means he who enlightens found work as a cook on a french steamship.
this allowed him to visit such cities as boston and new york.
ho chi minh based the phrasing of the vietnamese declaration of independence on the u s.
declaration of independence.
his admiration for the united states turned to disappointment however after the government chose to support france rather than his nationalist movement.
the communist rulers name lived on after his death in 1969.
in 1975 the north vietnamese army conquered south vietnam and changed the name of the souths capital from saigon to ho chi minh city.
the vietnam war years 7 from may through july 1954 the countries of france great britain the soviet union the united states china laos and cambodia met in geneva switzerland with the vietminh and with south vietnam s anti communist nationalists to hammer out a peace agreement.
the geneva accords temporarily divided vietnam along the 17th parallel.
the communists and their leader ho chi minh controlled north vietnam from the capital of hanoi.
the anti communist nationalists controlled south vietnam from the capital and southern port city of saigon.
an election to unify the country was called for in 1956.
the united states steps in the vietcong saw the united states and south vietnam as oppressors.
this propaganda poster reads vietnam will surely be victorious and america will surely be defeated in the wake of france s retreat the united states took a more active role in halting the spread of communism in vietnam.
wading deeper into the country s affairs the eisenhower and the kennedy administrations provided economic and military aid to south vietnam s non communist regime.
diem cancels elections although he directed a brutal and repressive regime ho chi minh won popular support in the north by breaking up large estates and redistributing land to peasants.
moreover his years of fighting the japanese and french had made him a national hero.
recognizing ho chi minh s widespread popularity south vietnam s president ngo dinh diem nge din de em a strong anti communist refused to take part in the countrywide election of 1956.
the united states also sensed that a countrywide election might spell victory for ho chi minh and supported canceling elections.
the eisenhower administration promised military aid and training to diem in return for a stable reform government in the south.
jg diem however failed to hold up his end of the bargain.
he ushered in a corrupt government that suppressed opposition of any kind and offered little or no land distribution to peasants.
in addition diem a devout catholic angered the country s majority buddhist population by restricting buddhist practices.
by 1957 a communist opposition group in the south known as the vietcong had begun attacks on the diem government assassinating thousands of south vietnamese government officials.
although the political arm of the group would later be called the national liberation front nlf the united states continued to refer to the fighters as the vietcong.
ho chi minh supported the group and in 1959 began supplying arms to the vietcong via a network of paths along the borders of vietnam laos and cambodia that became known as the ho chi minh trail.
see map on page 733.
as the fighters stepped up their surprise attacks or guerrilla tactics south vietnam grew more unstable.
the eisenhower administration took little action however deciding to sink or swim with ngo dinh diem.
kennedy and vietnam the kennedy administration which entered the white house in 1961 also chose initially to swim with diem.
wary of accusations that democrats were soft on communism president kennedy increased financial aid to diem s teetering regime and sent thousands of military advisers to help train south vietnamese troops.
by the end of 1963 16 000 u s military personnel were in south vietnam.
meanwhile diem s popularity plummeted because of ongoing corruption and his failure to respond to calls for land reform.
to combat the growing vietcong presence in the south s countryside the diem administration initiated the strategic hamlet program which meant moving all villagers to protected areas.

the alleged attack on u s ships prompted president johnson to launch bombing strikes on north vietnam.
he asked congress for powers to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the united states and to prevent further aggression.
congress approved his request and adopted the tonkin gulf resolution on august 7.
while not a declaration of war it granted johnson broad military powers in vietnam.
some felt it altered the u s constitution s system of checks and balances by allowing the executive branch to wage war without a declaration of war from the legislative branch.
johnson did not tell congress or the american people that the maddox had been in the gulf of tonkin to collect information for secret raids against north vietnam.
furthermore johnson had prepared the resolution months beforehand and was only waiting for the chance to push it through congress.
in february of 1965 president johnson used his newly granted powers.
in response to a vietcong attack that killed eight americans johnson unleashed operation rolling thunder the first sustained bombing of north vietnam.

n ifatakl tim o brien is a novelist who has written several books about his experience in vietnam and its lasting effects.
drafted at the age of 21 o brien was sent to vietnam in august 1968.
he spent the first seven months of his nearly two year duty patrolling the fields outside of chu lai a seacoast city in south vietnam.
o brien described one of the more nerve racking experiences of the war walking through the fields and jungles many of which were filled with land mines and booby traps.

quoted in a life in a year the american infantryman in vietnam 1965 1972 deadly traps were just some of the obstacles that u s troops faced.
as the infiltration of american ground troops into vietnam failed to score a quick victory a mostly supportive u s population began to question its government s war policy.
a vietnams terrain was often treacherous such as the thick jungles and rivers these u s soldiers encountered in 1966.
johnson increases u s involvement much of the nation supported lyndon johnson s determination to contain com munism in vietnam.
in the years following 1965 president johnson began send ing large numbers of american troops to fight alongside the south vietnamese.
736 chapter 22 i i throng support for containment even after congress had approved e on in gulf resolution president johnson opposed sending u s ground troops to vietnam.
johnson s victory in the 1964 presidential election was due in part to charges that his republican opponent barry goldwater was an anticommunist who might push the united states into war with the soviet union.
in contrast to goldwater s heated warlike language johnson s speeches were more moderate yet he spoke determinedly about containing communism.
he declared he was not about to send american boys 9 or 10 000 miles away from home to do what asian boys ought to be doing for themselves however in march of 1965 that is precisely what the president did.
working closely with his foreign policy advisers particularly secretary of defense robert mcnamara and secretary of state dean rusk president johnson began dis main idea contrasting what differing opinions did johnsons advisers have about vietnam.
patching tens of thousands of u s soldiers to fight in vietnam.
some americans viewed johnson s decision as contradictory to his position during the presidential campaign.
however most saw the president as following an established and popular policy of confronting communism anywhere in the world.
congress as well as the american public strongly supported johnson s strategy.
a 1965 poll showed that 61 percent of americans supported the u s policy in vietnam while only 24 percent opposed.
there were dissenters within the johnson administration too.
in october of 1964 undersecretary of state george ball had argued against escalation warning that once on the tiger s back we cannot be sure of picking the place to dismount.
however the president s closest advisers strongly urged escalation believing the defeat of communism in vietnam to be of vital importance to the future of america and the world.
dean rusk stressed this view in a 1965 memo to president johnson.
t v y playr a personal voice dean rusk 46 the integrity of the u s commitment is the principal pillar of peace throughout the world.
if that commitment becomes unreliable the communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and almost certainly to a catastrophic war.
so long as the south vietnamese are prepared to fight for themselves we cannot abandon them without disaster to peace and to our interests throughout the world.
quoted in in retrospect the troop buildup accelerates by the end of 1965 the u s government had sent more than 180 000 americans to vietnam.
the american commander in south vietnam general william westmoreland continued to request more troops.
westmoreland a west point graduate who had served in world war ii and korea was less than impressed with the fighting ability of the south vietnamese army or the army of the republic of vietnam arvn.
the arvn cannot stand up to this pressure without substantial u s combat support on the ground the general reported.
the only possible response is the aggressive deployment of u s.
throughout the early years of the war the johnson administration complied with westmorelands requests by 1967 the number of u s troops in vietnam had climbed to about 500 000.
general william westmoreland 1914 2005 general westmoreland retired from the military in 1972 but even in retirement he could not escape the vietnam war.
in 1982 cbs tv aired a documentary entitled the uncounted enemy a vietnam deception.
the report viewed by millions asserted that westmoreland and the pentagon had deceived the u s government about the enemys size and strength during 1967 and 1968 to make it appear that u s forces were winning the war.
westmoreland claiming he was the victim of distorted false and specious information.
derived by sinister deception filed a 120 million libel suit against cbs.
the suit was eventually settled with both parties issuing statements pledging mutual respect.
cbs however stood by its story.
the vietnam war years 7j fighting in the jungle the united states entered the war in vietnam believing that its superior weaponry would lead it to victory over the vietcong.
however the jungle terrain and the enemy s guerrilla tactics soon turned the war into a frustrating stalemate.
an elusive enemy because the vietcong lacked the high powered weaponry of the american forces they used hit and run and ambush tactics as well as a keen knowledge of the jungle terrain to their advantage.
moving secretly in and out of the general population the vietcong destroyed the notion of a traditional front line by attacking u s troops in both the cities and the countryside.
because some of the enemy lived amidst the civilian population it was difficult for u s troops to discern friend from foe.
a woman selling soft drinks to u s soldiers might be a vietcong spy.
a boy standing on the corner might be ready to throw a grenade.
adding to the vietcong s elusiveness was a network of elaborate tunnels that allowed them to withstand airstrikes and to launch surprise attacks and then disappear quickly.
connecting villages throughout the countryside the tunnels became home to many guerrilla fighters.
the more the americans tried to drive us away from our land the more we burrowed into it recalled nguyen quoc a major in the vietcong army.
in addition the terrain was laced with countless booby traps and land mines.
because the exact location of the vietcong was often unknown u s troops laid land mines throughout the jungle.
the vietcong also laid their own traps and disassembled and reused u s mines.

main idea making inferences in what way did the united states underestimate the vietcong.
vietnam s jungles and rice paddies not only dealt with sweltering heat and leeches but also had to be cautious of every step.
in a 1969 letter to his sister specialist fourth class salvador gonzalez described the tragic result from an unexploded u s bomb that the north vietnamese army had rigged.
a personal voice salvador gonzalez two days ago 4 guys got killed and about 15 wounded from the first platoon.
our platoon was 200 yards away on top of a hill.
one guy was from floral park in new york city.
he had five days left to go before being sent home.
he was standing on a 250 lb.
bomb that a plane had dropped and didnt explode.
so the nva north vietnamese army wired it up.
well all they found was a piece of his wallet.
quoted in dear america letters home from vietnam a frustrating war of attrition westmoreland s strategy for defeating the vietcong was to destroy their morale through a war of attrition or the gradual wearing down of the enemy by continuous harassment.
introducing the concept of the body count or the tracking of vietcong killed in battle the general believed that as the number of vietcong dead rose the guerrillas would inevitably surrender.
however the vietcong had no intention of quitting their fight.
despite the growing number of casualties and the relentless pounding from u s bombers the vietcong who received supplies from china and the soviet union remained defiant.
defense secretary mcnamara confessed his frustration to a reporter in 1966 if i had thought they would take this punishment and fight this well.
i would have thought differently at the start.
general westmoreland would say later that the united states never lost a battle in vietnam.
whether or not the general s words were true they underscored the degree to which america misunderstood its foe.
the united states viewed the war strictly as a military struggle the vietcong saw it as a battle for their very existence and they were ready to pay any price for victory.
land mines perhaps 3 million armed mines remain in vietnam and they are still claiming lives.
between 1999 and 2008 589 vietnamese have been killed and another 956 have been injured by these remnants of the vietnam war.
the 1997 mine ban treaty bans production and use of antipersonnel mines worldwide.
as of 2010 156 nations had agreed to the treaty with the notable exceptions of the united states russia and china.
in 1998 president clinton declared that the united states would sign the treaty by 2006 if suitable alternatives to land mines had been developed and asked the military to begin working toward this goal.
in 2004 however president george w bush said he would not sign the treaty.
the obama administration too decided to leave u s policy on mines unchanged.
the battle for hearts and minds another key part of the american strategy was to keep the vietcong from winning the support of south vietnam s rural population.
edward g lansdale who helped found the fighting unit known as the u s army special forces or green berets stressed the plan s importance.
just remember this.
communist guerrillas hide among the people.
if you win the people over to your side the communist guerrillas have no place to hide.
the campaign to win the hearts and minds of the south vietnamese villagers proved more difficult than imagined.
for instance in their attempt to expose vietcong tunnels and hideouts u s planes dropped napalm a gasoline based bomb that set fire to the jungle.
they also sprayed agent orange a leaf killing toxic chemical.
the saturation use of these weapons often wounded civilians and left villages and their surroundings in ruins.
years later many would blame agent orange for cancers suffered by vietnamese civilians and american veterans.
u s soldiers conducted search and destroy missions uprooting civilians with suspected ties to the vietcong killing their livestock and burning villages.
many villagers fled into the cities or refugee camps creating by 1967 more than 3 million refugees in the south.
the irony of the strategy was summed up in february 1968 by a u s major whose forces had just leveled the town of ben tre we had to destroy the town in order to save it.
the vietnam war years.
sinking morale the frustrations of guerrilla warfare the brutal jungle conditions and the failure to make substantial headway against the enemy took their toll on the u s troops morale.
philip caputo a marine lieutenant in vietnam who later wrote several books about the war summarized the soldiers growing disillusionment when we marched into the rice paddies we carried along with our packs and rifles the implicit convictions that the vietcong could be quickly beaten.
we kept the packs and rifles the convictions we lost.
as the war continued american morale dropped steadily.
many soldiers required by law to fight a war they did not support turned to alcohol marijuana and other drugs.
low morale even led a few soldiers to murder their officers.
morale worsened during the later years of the war when soldiers realized they were fighting even as their government was negotiating a withdrawal.
4 another obstacle was the continuing cor ruption and instability of the south vietnamese government.
nguyen cao ky a flamboyant air marshal led the government from 1965 to 1967.
ky ignored u s pleas to retire in favor of an elected civilian government.
mass demonstrations began and by may of 1966 buddhist monks and nuns were once again burning themselves in protest against the south vietnamese government.
south vietnam was fighting a civil war within a civil war leaving u s officials confused and angry.
a this u s soldier in vietnam wears symbols of both war and peace on his chest.
j main idea analyzing causes what factors led to the low morale of u s troops.
fulfilling a duty most american soldiers however firmly believed in their cause to halt the spread of communism.
they took patriotic pride in fulfilling their duty just as their fathers had done in world war ii.
most american soldiers fought courageously.
particularly heroic were the thousands of soldiers who endured years of torture and confinement as prisoners of war.
in 1966 navy pilot gerald coffee s plane was shot down over north vietnam.
coffee spent the next seven years until he was released in 1973 as part of a cease fire agreement struggling to stay alive in an enemy prison camp.
a personal voice gerald coffee my clothes were filthy and ragged.
with no boots my socks which id been able to salvage were barely recognizable.
only a few threads around my toes kept them spread over my feet some protection at least as i shivered through the cold nights curled up tightly on my morguelike slab.
my conditions and predicament were so foreign to me so stifling so overwhelming.
id never been so hungry so grimy and in such pain.
beyond survival the early war at home the johnson administration thought the war would end quickly.
as it dragged on support began to waver and johnson s domestic programs began to unravel.
740 chapter 22 main idea analyzing effects ly what led to the growing concern in america about the vietnam war.
the great society suffers as the number of u s troops in vietnam continued to mount the war grew more costly and the nation s economy began to suffer.
the inflation rate which was less than 2 percent through most of the early 1960s more than tripled to 5 5 percent by 1969.
in august of 1967 president johnson asked for a tax increase to help fund the war and to keep inflation in check.
congressional conservatives agreed but only after demanding and receiving a 6 billion reduction in funding for great society programs.
vietnam was slowly claiming an early casualty johnson s grand vision of domestic reform.
the living room war through the media specifically television vietnam became america s first living room war.
the combat footage that appeared nightly on the news in millions of homes showed stark pictures that seemed to contradict the administration s optimistic war scenario.
quoting body count statistics that showed large numbers of communists dying in battle general westmoreland continually reported that a vietcong surrender was imminent.
defense secretary mcnamara backed up the general saying that he could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
the repeated television images of americans in body bags told a different story though.
while communists may have been dying so too were americans over 16 000 between 1961 and 1967.
critics charged that a credibility gap was growing between what the johnson administration reported and what was really happening.
one critic was senator j william fulbright chairman of the powerful senate foreign relations committee.
fulbright a former johnson ally charged the president with a lack of candor in portraying the war effort.
in early 1966 the senator conducted a series of televised committee hearings in which he asked members of the johnson administration to defend their vietnam policies.
the fulbright hearings delivered few major revelations but they did contribute to the growing doubts about the war.
one woman appeared to capture the mood of middle america when she told an interviewer i want to get out but i don t want to give in.
by 1967 americans were evenly split over supporting and opposing the war.
however a small force outside of mainstream america mainly from the ranks of the nation s youth already had begun actively protesting the war.
their voices would grow louder and capture the attention of the entire nation.

in 1969 stephan gubar was told to report for possible military service in vietnam.
gubar 22 a participant in the civil rights movement had filed as a conscientious objector co or someone who opposed war on the basis of religious or moral beliefs.
he was granted 1 a o status which meant that while he would not be forced to carry a weapon he still qualified for noncombatant military duty.
that year gubar was drafted called for military service.
as did many other conscientious objectors gubar received special training as a medic.
he described the memorable day his training ended.
a personal voice stephan gubar the thing that stands out most was.
being really scared being in formation and listening to the names and assignments being called.
the majority of cos i knew had orders cut for vietnam.
and even though i could hear that happening even though i could hear that every time a cos name came up the orders were cut for vietnam i still thought there was a possibility i might not go.
then when they called my name and said vietnam.
i went to a phone and i called my wife.
it was a tremendous shock.
quoted in days of decision while many young americans proudly went off to war some found ways to avoid the draft and others simply refused to go.
the growing protest movement sharply divided the country between supporters and opponents of the government s policy in vietnam.
stephan gubar the working class goes to war the idea of fighting a war in a faraway place for what they believed was a questionable cause prompted a number of young americans to resist going to vietnam.
a manipulatable draft most soldiers who fought in vietnam were called into combat under the country s selective service system or draft which had been established during world war i.
under this system all males had to register with their local draft boards when they turned 18.
all registrants were screened and unless they were excluded such as for medical reasons in the event of war men between the ages of 18 and 26 would be called into military service.
742 chapter 22 vocabulary deferment the act or instance of delaying as americans doubts about the war grew thousands of men attempted to find ways around the draft which one man characterized as a very manipulatable system.
some men sought out sympathetic doctors to grant medical exemptions while others changed residences in order to stand before a more lenient draft board.
some americans even joined the national guard or coast guard which often secured a deferment from service in vietnam.
one of the most common ways to avoid the draft was to receive a college deferment by which a young man enrolled in a university could put off his military service.
because university students during the 1960s tended to be white and financially well off many of the men who fought in vietnam were lower class whites or minorities who were less privileged economically.
with almost 80 percent of american soldiers coming from lower economic levels vietnam was a working class war.
african americans in vietnam african americans served in disproportionate numbers as ground combat troops.
during the first several years of the war blacks accounted for more than 20 percent of american combat deaths despite representing only about 10 percent of the u s population.
the defense department took steps to correct that imbalance by instituting a draft lottery system in 1969.
martin luther king jr had refrained from speaking out against the war for fear that it would divert attention from the civil rights movement.
but he could not maintain that stance for long.
in 1967 he lashed out against what he called the cruel irony of american blacks dying for a country that still treated them as second class citizens.
a personal voice dr martin luther king jr 44 we were taking the young black men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in southeast asia which they had not found in southwest georgia and east harlem.
we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching negro and white boys on tv screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools.
quoted in america s vietnam war 4 narrative history racial tension ran high in many platoons and in some cases the hostility led to violence.
the racism that gripped many military units was yet another factor that led to low troop morale in vietnam.

thousands more volunteered their services in vietnam to the american red cross and the united services organization uso which delivered hospitality and entertainment to the troops.
as the military marched off to vietnam to fight against communist guerrillas some of the men at home as well as many women waged a battle of their own.
tensions flared across the country as many of the nation s youths began to voice their opposition to the war.
the roots of opposition even before 1965 students were becoming more active socially and politically.
some participated in the civil rights struggle while others pursued public service.
as america became more involved in the war in vietnam college students across the country became a powerful and vocal group of protesters.
the new left the growing youth movement of the 1960s became known as the new left.
the movement was new in relation to the old left of the 1930s which had generally tried to move the nation toward socialism and in some cases communism.
while the new left movement did not preach socialism its followers demanded sweeping changes in american society.
voicing these demands was one of the better known new left organizations students for a democratic society sds founded in 1960 by tom hayden and a1 haber.
the group charged that corporations and large government institutions had taken over america.
the sds called for a restoration of participatory democracy and greater individual freedom.
in 1964 the free speech movement fsm gained prominence at the university of california at berkeley.
the fsm grew out of a clash between students and administrators over free speech on campus.
led by mario savio a philosophy student the fsm focused its criticism on what it called the american machine the nation s faceless and powerful business and government institutions.
campus activism across the country the ideas of the fsm and sds quickly spread to college campuses.

with the onset of the vietnam war students across the country found a galvanizing issue and joined together in protest.
by the mid sixties many youths believed the nation to be in need of fundamental change.
main idea summarizing for what reasons did the protesters oppose the vietnam war.
the protest movement emerges throughout the spring of 1965 groups at a number of colleges began to host teach ins to protest the war.
at the university of michigan where only a year before president johnson had announced his sweeping great society program teachers and students now assailed his war policy.
this is no longer a casual form of campus spring fever journalist james reston noted about the growing demon strations.
as the war continued the protests grew and divided the country.
the movement grows in april of 1965 sds helped organize a march on washington d c by some 20 000 protesters.
by november of that year a protest rally in washington drew more than 30 000.
then in february of 1966 the johnson administration changed deferments for college students requiring students to be in good academic standing in order to be granted a deferment.
campuses around the country erupted in protest.
sds called for civil disobedience at selective service centers and openly counseled students to flee to canada or sweden.
by the end of 1969 sds had chapters on nearly 400 campuses.
youths opposing the war did so for several reasons.
the most common was the belief that the conflict in vietnam was basically a civil war and that the u s military had no business there.
some said that the oppressive south vietnamese regime was no better than the communist regime it was fighting.
others argued that the united states could not police the entire globe and that war was draining american strength in other important parts of the world.
still others saw war simply as morally unjust.
the antiwar movement grew beyond college campuses.
small numbers of returning veterans began to protest the war.
folk singers such as pete seeger joan baez phil ochs and the trio peter paul and mary used music as a popular protest vehicle.
the number one song in september 1965 was eve of destruction in which singer barry mcguire stressed the ironic fact that young men could be drafted at age 18 but had to be 21 to vote.
perhaps the most popular antiwar song of the time was i feel like i m fixin to die rag by country joe and the fish.
written by bandleader joe mcdonald a vietnam veteran this song sarcastically encouraged young men politicians businesses and even parents to give their whole hearted support to the war.
from protest to resistance by 1967 the antiwar movement had intensified with no sign of slowing down.
we were having no effect on u s policy recalled one protest leader so we thought we had to up the ante.
in the spring of 1967 nearly half a million protesters of all ages gathered in new york s central park.
shouting burn cards not people.
and hell no we won t go.
hundreds tossed their draft cards into a bonfire.
a woman from new jersey told a reporter so many of us are frustrated.
we want to criticize this war because we think it s wrong but we want to do it in the framework of loyalty.
historical spotlight ballad of the green berets not every vietnam era pop song about war was an antiwar song.
at the top of the charts for five weeks in 1966 was the ballad of the green berets by staff sergeant barry sadler of the u s army special forces known as the green berets fighting soldiers from the sky fearless men who jump and die men who mean just what they say the brave men of the green beret.
the recording sold over a million copies in its first two weeks of release and was billboard magazines song of the year.
difficult decisions resist the draft or serve your country.
as the fighting in vietnam intensified young men of draft age who opposed the war found themselves considering one of two options register with the draft board and risk heading off to war or find a way to avoid military service.
ways to avoid service included medical and educational deferments.
but a great many men did not qualify for these.
the choices that remained such as fleeing the country going to jail or giving in and joining the ranks came with a high price.
once a decision was made there was no turning back.
imagine you oppose the war and are called to serve in vietnam.
what decision would you make.
would you feel guilty if you avoided the draft.
if you chose to serve how would you view those who did not serve your country.
do you think more young men would have been willing to serve had this been a different war.
others were more radical in their view.
david harris who would spend 20 months in jail for refusing to serve in vietnam explained his motives.
a personal voice david harris theoretically i can accept the notion that there are circumstances in which you have to kill people.
i could not accept the notion that vietnam was one of those circumstances.
and to me that left the option of either sitting by and watching what was an enormous injustice or finding some way to commit myself against it.
and the position that i felt comfortable with in committing myself against it was total noncooperation i was not going to be part of the machine.
quoted in the war within draft resistance continued from 1967 until president nixon phased out the draft in the early 1970s.
during these years the u s government accused more than 200 000 men of draft offenses and imprisoned nearly 4 000 draft resisters.
although some were imprisoned for four or five years most won parole after 6 to 12 months.
throughout these years about 10 000 americans fled many to canada.
in october of 1967 a demonstration at washington s lincoln memorial drew about 75 000 protesters.
after listening to speeches approximately 30 000 demonstrators locked arms for a march on the pentagon in order to disrupt the center of the american war machine as one organizer explained.
as hundreds of protesters broke past the military police and mounted the pentagon steps they were met by tear gas and clubs.
about 1 500 demonstrators were injured and at least 700 arrested.
war divides the nation by 1967 americans increasingly found themselves divided into two camps regarding the war.
those who strongly opposed the war and believed the united states should withdraw were known as doves.
feeling just as strongly that america should unleash much of its greater military force to win the war were the hawks.
despite the visibility of the antiwar protesters a majority of american citizens in 1967 still remained committed to the war.
others while less certain about the proper u s role in vietnam were shocked to see protesters publicly criticize a war in which their fellow americans were fighting and dying.
a poll taken in december of 1967 showed that 70 percent of americans believed the war protests were acts of disloyalty.
a firefighter who lost his son in vietnam articulated the bitter feelings a number of americans felt toward the antiwar movement.
a personal voice im bitter its people like us who give up our sons for the country.
the college types the professors they go to washington and tell the government what to do.
but their sons they dont end up in the swamps over there in vietnam.
theyre deferred because theyre in school.
or they get sent to safe places.
what bothers me about the peace crowd is that you can tell from their attitude the way they look and what they say that they dont really love this country a firefighter quoted in working class war main idea evaluating do you think it was right for the government to imprison draft resisters.
this sign reflects the view of many americans that the antiwar protests undermined the war effort in vietnam.
main idea responding to antiwar posters americans who supported the government s vietnam policy developed their own slogans support our men in vietnam and evaluating america love it or leave it ej what were the key issues that johnson remains determined throughout the turmoil and division divided america.
that engulfed the country during the early years of the war president johnson remained firm.
attacked by doves for not withdrawing and by hawks for not increasing military power rapidly enough johnson was dismissive of both groups and their motives.
he continued his policy of slow escalation.
a personal voice lyndon b johnson there has always been confusion frustration and difference of opinion in this country when there is a war going on.
you know what president roosevelt went through and president wilson in world war i.
he had some senators from certain areas.
that gave him serious problems until victory was assured.
we are going to have these differences.
no one likes war.
all people love peace.
but you cant have freedom without defending it quoted in no hail no farewell however by the end of 1967 johnson s policy and the continuing stalemate had begun to create turmoil within his own administration.
in november defense secretary robert mcnamara a key architect of u s escalation in vietnam quietly announced he was resigning to become head of the world bank.
it didn t add up mcnamara recalled later.
what i was trying to find out was how the war went on year after year when we stopped the infiltration from north vietnam or shrunk it and when we had a very high body count and so on.
it just didn t make sense.
ir as it happened mcnamara s resignation came on the threshold of the most tumultuous year of the sixties.

while johnson won the primary with 48 percent of the vote the slim margin of victory was viewed as a defeat for the president.

during the first six months of 1968 almost 40 000 students on more than 100 campuses took part in more than 200 major demonstrations.

gj a turbulent race for president the chaos and violence of 1968 climaxed in august when thousands of antiwar demonstrators converged on the city of chicago to protest at the democratic national convention.
the convention which featured a bloody riot between protesters and police fractured the democratic party and thus helped a nearly forgotten republican win the white house.
turmoil in chicago with lyndon johnson stepping down and robert kennedy gone the 1968 democratic presidential primary race pitted eugene mccarthy against hubert humphrey johnson s vice president.
mccarthy while still popular with the nation s antiwar segment had little chance of defeating humphrey a loyal party man who had president johnson s support.
during the last week of august the democrats met at their convention in chicago supposedly to choose a candidate.
in reality humphrey s nomination had already been determined a decision that upset many antiwar activists.
as the delegates arrived in chicago so too did nearly 10 000 protesters.
led by men such as sds veteran tom hayden many demonstrators sought to pressure the democrats into adopting an antiwar platform.
others came to voice their the vietnam war yet chicago police attempt to disperse antiwar demonstrators at the 1968 democratic convention.
protesters shouted the whole world is watching displeasure with humphrey s nomination.
still others known as yippies members of the youth international party had come hoping to provoke violence that might discredit the democratic party.
chicago s mayor richard j daley was determined to keep the protesters under control.
with memories of the nationwide riots after king s death still fresh daley mobilized 12 000 chicago police officers and over 5 000 national guard.
as long as i am mayor daley vowed there will be law and order.
order however soon collapsed.
on august 28 as delegates cast votes for humphrey protesters were gathering in a downtown park to march on the convention.
with television cameras focused on them police moved into the crowd sprayed the protesters with mace and beat them with nightsticks.
many protesters tried to flee while others retaliated pelting the riot helmeted police with rocks and bottles.

quoted in decade of shocks disorder of a different kind reigned inside the convention hall where delegates bitterly debated an antiwar plank in the party platform.
when word of the riot filtered into the hall delegates angrily shouted at mayor daley who was present as a delegate himself.
daley returned their shouts with equal vigor.
the whole world indeed was watching on their televisions.

during the presidential race nixon campaigned on a promise to restore law and order which appealed to many middle class americans tired of years of riots and protests.
he also promised in vague but appealing terms to end the war in vietnam.
nixon s candidacy was helped by the entry of former alabama governor george wallace into the race as a third party candidate.
wallace a democrat running on the american independent party ticket was a longtime champion of school segregation and states rights.
labeled the white backlash candidate wallace captured five southern states.
in addition he attracted a surprisingly high number of northern white working class voters disgusted with inner city riots and antiwar protests.

president nixon and vietnamization in the summer of 1969 newly elected president richard nixon announced the first u s troop withdrawals from vietnam.
we have to get rid of the nightmares we inherited nixon later told reporters.
one of the nightmares is war without end.
however as nixon pulled out the troops he continued the war against north vietnam a policy that some critics would charge prolonged the war without end for several more bloody years.
754 chapter 22 main idea synthesizing what was the impact of vietnamization on the united states.
the pullout begins as president nixon settled into the white house in january of 1969 negotiations to end the war in vietnam were going nowhere.
the united states and south vietnam insisted that all north vietnamese forces withdraw from the south and that the government of nguyen van thieu then south vietnam s ruler remain in power.
the north vietnamese and vietcong demanded that u s troops withdraw from south vietnam and that the thieu government step aside for a coalition government that would include the vietcong.
in the midst of the stalled negotiations nixon conferred with national security adviser henry kissinger on a plan to end america s involvement in vietnam.
kissinger a german emigrant who had earned three degrees from harvard was an expert on international relations.
their plan known as vietnamization called for the gradual withdrawal of u s troops in order for the south vietnamese to take on a more active combat role in the war.
by august of 1969 the first 25 000 u s troops had returned home from vietnam.
over the next three years the number of american troops in vietnam dropped from more than 500 000 to less than 25 000.
with honor part of nixon and kissinger s vietnamization policy was aimed at establishing what the president called a peace with honor.
nixon intended to maintain u s dignity in the face of its withdrawal from war.
a further goal was to preserve u s clout at the negotiation table as nixon still demanded that the south vietnamese government remain intact.
with this objective and even as the pullout had begun nixon secretly ordered a massive bombing campaign against supply routes and bases in north vietnam.
the president also ordered that bombs be dropped on the neighboring countries of laos and cambodia which held a number of vietcong sanctuaries.
nixon told his aide h r haldeman that he wanted the enemy to believe he was capable of anything.

the my lai massacre in november of 1969 americans learned of a shocking event.
that month new york times correspondent seymour hersh reported that on march 16 1968 a u s platoon under the command of lieutenant william calley jr had massacred innocent civilians in the small village of my lai me it in northern south vietnam.
calley was searching for vietcong rebels.
finding no sign of the enemy the troops rounded up the villagers and shot more than 200 innocent vietnamese mostly women children and elderly men.
we all huddled them up recalled 22 year old private paul meadlo.
i poured about four clips into the group.
the mothers was hugging their children.
well we kept right on firing.
the troops insisted that they were not responsible for the shootings because they were only following lieutenant calley s orders.
when asked what his directive had been one soldier answered kill anything that breathed.
twenty five army officers were charged with some degree of responsibility but only calley was convicted and imprisoned.
the invasion of cambodia despite the shock over my lai the country s mood by 1970 seemed to be less explosive.
american troops were on their way home and it appeared that the war was finally winding down.
on april 30 1970 president nixon announced that u s troops had invaded cambodia to clear out north vietnamese and vietcong supply centers.
the president defended his action if when the chips are down the world s most powerful nation acts like a pitiful helpless giant the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations.
throughout the world.
upon hearing of the invasion college students across the country burst out in protest.
in what became the first general student strike in the nation s history more than 1 5 million students closed down some 1 200 campuses.
the president of columbia university called the month that followed the cambodian invasion the most disastrous month of may in the history of.
higher education.
violence on campus disaster struck hardest at kent state university in ohio where a massive student protest led to the burning of the rotc building.
in response to the growing unrest the local mayor called in the national guard.
on may 4 1970 the guards fired live ammunition into a crowd of campus protesters who were hurling rocks at them.
the gunfire wounded nine people and killed four including two who had not even participated in the rally.
ten days later similar violence rocked the mostly all black college of jackson state in mississippi.
national guardsmen there confronted a group of antiwar demonstrators and fired on the crowd after several bottles were thrown.
in the hail of bullets 12 students were wounded and 2 were killed both innocent bystanders.
in a sign that america still remained sharply divided about the war the coun try hotly debated the campus shootings.
polls indicated that many americans supported the national guard respondents claimed that the students got what background calley was imprisoned only a short time before president nixon granted him house arrest.
calley was paroled in 1974 having served three years.
756 chapter 22 photojournalism j history through kent state photographer john filo was a senior at kent state university when antiwar demonstrations rocked the campus.

they were asking for.
the weeks following the campus turmoil brought new attention to a group known as hardhats construction workers and other blue collar americans who supported the u s government s war policies.
in may of 1970 nearly 100 000 members of the building and construction trades council of new york held a rally outside city hall to support the government.
the pentagon papers nixon and kissinger s cambodia policy however cost nixon significant political support.
by first bombing and then invading cambodia without even notifying congress the president stirred anger on capitol hill.
on december 31 1970 congress repealed the tonkin gulf resolution which had given the president near independence in conducting policy in vietnam.
support for the war eroded even further when in june of 1971 former defense department worker daniel ellsberg leaked what became known as the pentagon papers.
the 7 000 page document written for defense secretary robert mcnamara in 1967 1968 revealed among other things that the government had drawn up plans for entering the war even as president lyndon johnson promised that he would not send american troops to vietnam.
furthermore the papers showed that there was never any plan to end the war as long as the north vietnamese persisted.
for many americans the pentagon papers confirmed their belief that the government had not been honest about its war intentions.
the document while not particularly damaging to the nixon administration supported what opponents of the war had been saying.
the vietnam war years henry kissinger 1923 henry kissinger who helped negotiate americas withdrawal from vietnam and who later would help forge historic new relations with china and the soviet union held a deep interest in the concept of power.
you know he once noted most of these world leaders you wouldnt want to know socially.
mostly they are intellectual mediocrities.
the thing that is interesting about them is.
their power at first kissinger seemed an unlikely candidate to work for richard nixon.
kissinger declared that man nixon is not fit to be president however the two became trusted colleagues.
the long war ends in march of 1972 the north vietnamese launched their largest attack on south vietnam since the tet offensive in 1968.
president nixon responded by ordering a massive bombing campaign against north vietnamese cities.
he also ordered that mines be laid in haiphong harbor the north s largest harbor into which soviet and chinese ships brought supplies.
the communists have never been bombed like they are going to be bombed this time nixon vowed.
the bombings halted the north vietnamese attack but the grueling stalemate continued.
it was after this that the nixon administration took steps to finally end america s involvement in vietnam.
is at hand by the middle of 1972 the country s growing social division and the looming presidential election prompted the nixon administration to change its negotiating policy.
polls showed that more than 60 percent of americans in 1971 thought that the united states should withdraw all troops from vietnam by the end of the year.
henry kissinger the president s adviser for national security affairs served as nixon s top negotiator in vietnam.
since 1969 kissinger had been meeting privately with north vietnam s chief negotiator le due tho.
eventually kissinger dropped his insistence that north vietnam withdraw all its troops from the south before the complete withdrawal of american troops.
on october 26 1972 days before the presidential election kissinger announced peace is at hand.
the final push president nixon won reelection but the promised peace proved to be elusive.
the thieu regime alarmed at the prospect of north vietnamese troops stationed in south vietnam rejected kissinger s plan.
talks broke off on december 16.
two days later the president unleashed a ferocious bombing campaign against hanoi and haiphong the two largest cities in north vietnam.
in what became known as the christmas bombings u s planes dropped 100 000 bombs over the course of eleven straight days pausing only on christmas day.
at this point calls to end the war resounded from the halls of congress as well as from beijing and moscow.
everyone it seemed had finally grown weary of the war.
the warring parties returned to the peace table and on january 27 1973 the united states signed an agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in vietnam.
under the agreement north vietnamese troops would remain in south vietnam.
however nixon promised to respond with full force to any violation of the peace agreement.
on march 29 1973 the last u s combat troops left for home.
for america the vietnam war had ended.
the fall of saigon the war itself however raged on.
within months of the united states departure the cease fire agreement between north and south vietnam collapsed.
in march of 1975 after several years of fighting the north vietnamese launched a full scale invasion against the south.
thieu appealed to the united states for help.
america provided economic aid but refused to send troops.

758 chapter 22 main idea evaluating decisions why might the united states have refused to reenter the war.
america can regain its sense of pride that existed before vietnam.
but it cannot be achieved by refighting a war that is finished as far as america is concerned.
on april 30 1975 north vietnamese tanks rolled into saigon and captured the city.
soon after south vietnam surrendered to north vietnam.
the war leaves a painful legacy the vietnam war exacted a terrible price from its participants.
in all 58 000 americans were killed and some 303 000 were wounded.
north and south vietnamese deaths topped 2 million.
in addition the war left southeast asia highly unstable which led to further war in cambodia.
in america a divided nation attempted to come to grips with an unsuccessful war.
in the end the conflict in vietnam left many americans with a more cautious outlook on foreign affairs and a more cynical attitude toward their government.
american veterans cope back home while families welcomed home their sons and daughters the nation as a whole extended a cold hand to its returning vietnam veterans.
there were no brass bands no victory parades no cheering crowds.

in an effort to honor the men and women who served in vietnam the u s government unveiled the vietnam veterans memorial in washington d c in 1982.
many vietnam veterans as well as their loved ones have found visiting the memorial a deeply moving even healing experience.
further turmoil in southeast asia the end of the vietnam war ushered in a new period of violence and chaos in southeast asia.
in unifying vietnam the victorious communists initially held out a conciliatory hand to the south vietnamese.
you have nothing to fear declared colonel bui tin of the north vietnamese army.
however the communists soon imprisoned more than 400 000 south vietnamese in harsh reeducation or labor camps.
as the communists imposed their rule throughout the land nearly 1 5 million people fled vietnam.
they included citizens who had supported the u s war effort as well as business owners whom the communists expelled when they began nationalizing the country s business sector.
also fleeing the country was a large group of poor vietnamese known as boat people because they left on anything from freighters to barges to rowboats.
their efforts to reach safety across the south china sea often met with tragedy nearly 50 000 perished on the high seas due to exposure drowning illness or piracy.
the people of cambodia also suffered greatly after the war.
the u s invasion of cambodia had unleashed a brutal civil war in which a communist group known as the khmer rouge led by pol pot seized power in 1975.
in an effort to transform the country into a peasant society the khmer rouge executed professionals and anyone with an education or foreign ties.
during its reign of terror the khmer rouge is believed to have killed at least 1 million cambodians.
the legacy of vietnam even after it ended the vietnam war remained a subject of great controversy for americans.
many hawks continued to insist that the war could have been won if the united states had employed more military 760 chapter 22 1 main idea contrasting u contrast the two viewpoints regarding the legacy of the vietnam war.
they also blamed the antiwar movement at home for destroying american morale.
doves countered that the north vietnamese had displayed incredible resiliency and that an increase in u s military force would have resulted only in a continuing stalemate.
in addition doves argued that an unrestrained war against north vietnam might have prompted a military reaction from china or the soviet union jy the war resulted in several major u s policy changes.
first the twenty sixth amendment passed in 1971 lowering the voting age for all elections from 21 to 18.
young americans had protested that if they were old enough to be drafted they should be old enough to vote.
also the government abolished the draft which had stirred so much antiwar sentiment.
the country also took steps to curb the president s war making powers.
in november 1973 congress passed the war powers act which stipulated that a president must inform congress within 48 hours of sending forces into a hostile area without a declaration of war.
in addition the troops may remain there no longer than 90 days unless congress approves the president s actions or declares war.
since its passage the resolution s constitutionality has been a subject of debate.
some observers believe that it misinterprets the intention of the founders in granting congress the power to declare war taking too much power from the executive branch.
others feel it simply serves to clarify the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches that the founders intended all along.
in a broader sense the vietnam war significantly altered america s views on foreign policy.
in what has been labeled the vietnam syndrome americans now pause and consider possible risks to their own interests before deciding whether to intervene in the affairs of other nations.
finally the war contributed to an overall cynicism among americans about their government and political leaders that persists today.
americans grew suspicious of a government that could provide as much misleading information or conceal as many activities as the johnson and nixon administrations had done.
coupled with the watergate scandal of the mid 1970s the war diminished the optimism and faith in government that americans felt during the eisenhower and kennedy years.

the vietnam war yei economics spotlight defense spending during world war ii the united states increased its defense spending dramatically over prewar levels.
the military needed to gear up to fight in europe and the pacific and the federal government spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the war effort.
not surprisingly military spending often increased during periods of war and other military conflicts throughout the 20th century.
tensions of the cold war also affected the u s defense budget.
defense spending tended to decrease when those conflicts ended.
some economists have observed the impact of defense spending on the nation s economy.
business cycles economic changes often follow a broad pattern made up of a series of periods of expanding and contracting economic activity known as the business cycle.
the business cycle is measured by increases or decreases in real gross domestic product gdp or the market value of all the goods and services produced in a nation within a specific time period.
the business cycle generally consists of four phases expansion peak contraction and trough.
an expansion is marked by increased business activity.
the unemployment rate falls businesses produce more and consumers buy more goods and services.
a peak is a transition period in which expansion slows.
a contraction or recession occurs when business activity decreases.
the unemployment rate rises while both production and consumer spending fall.
a deep long lasting recession is called a depression.
business activity reaches its lowest point during a trough after which activity starts to increase and a new cycle begins.
u s defense spending 1945 2000 federal defense spending in billions of dollars source defense spending as one might expect defense spending in the united states has for the most part been tied to u s involvement in global conflicts.
as you can see from the graph above the defense budget which had dropped considerably after world war ii ended increased from 1949 to 1953.
the period from 1965 to 1969 saw another increase then from 1976 to 1989 defense spending increased dramatically.
these time periods coincide roughly with the periods of military preparation for and involvement in the korean war the vietnam war and the increase in military spending in response to cold war era global conflicts during the carter and reagan administrations.
except for these general periods of increase defense spending as a percentage of gdp declined gradu ally until the early 2000s following a post world war ii peak of 14 percent in 1953 762 chapter 22 recession periods real gdp in 2000 dollars source u s bureau of economic analysis national bureau of economic research impact on the business cycle some economists have noted that defense spending has an economic impact on the united states.
the military as both an employer and a consumer funnels money into the economy thereby contributing to the gdp as you can see in the graph at left the growth of the u s gdp has been relatively steady since 1945.
however as the u s economy has gone through a series of business cycles it has experienced periods of recession.
the national bureau of economic research nber has tracked business cycles in the united states for the past several decades.
according to nber there have been about a dozen economic contractions and expansions in the u s economy since the great depression.
in the period from 1945 to 2000 the economy experienced nine recession periods as indicated by the blue bars on the graph.
it is worth noting that four of these recessions occurred during periods when defense spending declined 1945 1946 1953 1954 1969 1970 and 1990 1991.
the private sector cannot immediately make up for the drop in government spending that occurs when the defense budget declines.
thus the more sudden and dramatic the decline in defense spending the deeper the recession that occurred.
during two of the previously identified periods of rising defense spending 1949 1953 and 1965 1969 there were no recessions.
however a recession did occur during the 1976 to 1989 period.
the increase in purchases was not enough to prevent a recession in part because defense spending made up a smaller portion of the overall economy than it had before.
impact on education priorities the economic impact of defense spending on education priorities in the united states during this period is less clear.
obviously any money from the federal budget that is dedicated to defense spending is money that cannot be used for education.
on the other hand federal funding for elementary secondary and higher education has risen overall since 1962.
in one sense the nations defense priorities are a reason for an increased focus on education.
since the soviet union launched its satellite sputnik in 1957 the quality of education has been recognized as an issue of national security.
in 1958 in an effort to ensure that the soviet union would not surpass the united states in technological achievement congress passed the national defense education act.
this legislation included funding for additional loans for college students and improved science math and for e gn language instruction in elementary and secondary schools.
providing a solid foundation in technical subjects such as science and math remains a priority of the u s educational system not only because of national security concerns but also to allow americans to stay competitive in a global economy.

by the late 1950s diem s opponents in south vietnam known as the vietcong were in open revolt.

he said that the world was in its hour of maximum danger as cold war tensions ran high.
rather than shrinking from the danger the united states should confront the iron tyranny of communism.

the ussr s launch of sputnik i in 1957 and its development of long range missiles had sparked fears that the american military was falling behind that of the soviets.

yet many felt that at 43 he was too inexperienced.
if elected he would be the second youngest president in the nation s history.
americans also worried that having a roman catholic in the white house would lead either to influence of the pope on american policies or to closer ties between church and state.
kennedy was able to allay worries by discussing the issue openly.
one event in the fall determined the course of the election.
kennedy and nixon took part in the first televised debate between presidential candidates.
on september 26 1960 70 million tv viewers watched the two articulate and knowledgeable candidates debating issues.
nixon an expert on foreign policy had agreed to the forum in hopes of exposing kennedy s inexperience.
however kennedy had been coached by television producers and he looked and spoke better than nixon.
kennedy s success in the debate launched a new era in american politics the television age.
as journalist russell baker who covered the nixon campaign said that night image replaced the printed word as the natural language of politics.
kennedy and civil rights a second major event of the campaign took place in october.
police in atlanta georgia arrested the reverend martin luther king jr and 33 other african american demonstrators for sitting at a segregated lunch counter.
although the other demonstrators were released king was sentenced to months of hard labor officially for a minor traffic violation.
the eisenhower administration refused to intervene and nixon took no public position.
when kennedy heard of the arrest and sentencing he telephoned king s wife coretta scott king to express his sympathy.
meanwhile robert kennedy his brother and campaign manager persuaded the judge who had sentenced king to release the civil rights leader on bail pending appeal.

his inauguration set the tone for a new era at the white house one of grace elegance and wit.
on the podium sat over 100 writers artists and scientists that the kennedys had invited including opera singer marian anderson who had once been barred from singing at constitution hall because she was african american.
kennedy s inspiring speech called for hope commitment and sacrifice.
and so my fellow americans he proclaimed ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country.
during his term the president and his beautiful young wife jacqueline invited many artists and celebrities to the white house.
in addition kennedy often appeared on television.
the press loved his charm and wit and helped to bolster his image.
the kennedy mystique critics of kennedy s presidency argued that his smooth style lacked substance.
but the new first family fascinated the public.
for example after learning that jfk could read 1 600 words a minute thousands of people enrolled in speed reading courses.
the first lady too captivated the nation with her eye for fashion and culture.
it seemed the nation could not get enough of the first family.
newspapers and magazines filled their pages with pictures and stories about the president s young daughter caroline and his infant son john.
with jfk s youthful glamour and his talented advisers the kennedy white house reminded many of a modern day camelot the mythical court of king arthur.
coincidentally the musical camelot had opened on broadway in 1960.
years later jackie recalled her husband and the vision of camelot.
background the fictional king arthur was based on a real fifth or sixth century celt.

main idea developing historical perspective what factors help explain the publics fascination with the kennedys.
672 chapter 20 vocabulary third world during the cold war the developing nations not allied with either the united states or the soviet union a new military policy from the beginning kennedy focused on the cold war.
he thought the eisenhower administration had not done enough about the soviet threat.
the soviets he concluded were gaining loyalties in the economically less developed third world countries of asia africa and latin america.
he blasted the republicans for allowing communism to develop in cuba at america s doorstep.
defining a military strategy kennedy believed his most urgent task was to redefine the nation s nuclear strategy.
the eisenhower administration had relied on the policy of massive retaliation to deter soviet aggression and imperialism.
however threatening to use nuclear arms over a minor conflict was not a risk kennedy wished to take.
instead his team developed a policy of flexible response.
kennedy s secretary of defense robert mcnamara explained the policy.
a personal voice robert s mcnamara the kennedy administration worried that the reliance on nuclear weapons gave us no way to respond to large nonnuclear attacks without committing suicide.
we decided to broaden the range of options by strengthening and modernizing the militarys ability to fight a nonnuclear war.
in retrospect yyrspectfvp main idea summarizing what was the goal of the doctrine of flexible response.
kennedy increased defense spending in order to boost conventional military forces nonnuclear forces such as troops ships and artillery and to create an elite branch of the army called the special forces or green berets.
he also tripled the overall nuclear capabilities of the united states.
these changes enabled eisenhowers warning the increase in defense spending in the 1960s continued the trend in which defense department suppliers were becoming more dominant in the american economy.
before leaving office president eisenhower warned against the dangers of what he called the military industrial complex he included in his parting speech the following comments this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience.
the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every statehouse every office of the federal government.
we recognize the imperative need for this development.
yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist the united states to fight limited wars around the world while maintaining a balance of nuclear power with the soviet union.
however even as kennedy hoped to reduce the risk of nuclear war the world came perilously close to nuclear war under his command as a crisis arose over the island of cuba.
vocabulary suerrilla a soldier travels in a small group harassing and dermining the enemy crises over cuba the first test of kennedy s foreign policy came in cuba just 90 miles off the coast of florida.
about two weeks before kennedy took office on january 3 1961 president eisenhower had cut off diplomatic relations with cuba because of a revolutionary leader named fidel castro.
castro openly declared himself a communist and welcomed aid from the soviet union.
the cuban dilemma castro gained power with the promise of democracy.
from 1956 to 1959 he led a guerrilla movement to topple dictator fulgencio batista.
he won control in 1959 and later told reporters revolutionaries are not born they are made by poverty inequality and dictatorship.
he then promised to eliminate these conditions from cuba.
the united states was suspicious of castro s intentions but nevertheless recognized the new government.
however when castro seized three american and british oil refineries relations between the united states and cuba worsened castro also broke up commercial farms into communes that would be worked by formerly landless peasants.
american sugar companies the new frontier and the great society 6 which controlled 75 percent of the crop land in cuba appealed to the u s government for help.
in response congress erected trade barri ers against cuban sugar.
castro relied increasingly on soviet aid and on the political repression of those who did not agree with him.
while some cubans were taken by his charisma and his willingness to stand up to the united states others saw castro as a tyrant who had replaced one dictatorship with another.
about 10 percent of cuba s population went into exile mostly to the united states.
within the large exile community of miami florida a counterrevolutionary movement took shape.
the bay of pigs in march 1960 president eisenhower gave the cia permission to secretly train cuban exiles for an invasion of cuba.
the cia and the exiles hoped it would trigger a mass uprising that would overthrow castro.
kennedy learned of the plan only nine days after his election.
although he had doubts he approved it.
on the night of april 17 1961 some 1 300 to 1 500 cuban exiles supported by the u s military landed on the island s southern coast at bahia de cochinos the bay of pigs.
nothing went as planned.
an air strike had failed to knock out the cuban air force although the cia reported that it had succeeded.
a small advance group sent to distract castro s forces never reached shore.
when the main unit landed it lacked american air support as it faced 25 000 cuban troops backed up by soviet tanks and jets.
some of the invading exiles were killed others imprisoned.
the cuban media sensationalized the defeat of north american mercenaries.
one united states commentator observed that americans look like fools to our friends rascals to our enemies and incompetents to the rest.
the disaster left kennedy embarrassed.
publicly he accepted blame for the fiasco.
privately he asked how could that crowd at the cia and the pentagon be this wrong qj kennedy negotiated with castro for the release of surviving commandos and paid a ransom of 53 million in food and medical supplies.
in a speech in miami he promised exiles that they would one day return to a free havana.
although kennedy warned that he would resist further communist expansion in the western hemisphere castro defiantly welcomed further soviet aid.
a top castro celebrates after gaining power in cuba.
above the bay of pigs mission was said to have blown up in kennedys face.
vocabulary political repression government intimidation of those with different political views main idea analyzing effects jy what were the consequences of the failed invasion for the united states.
the cuban missile crisis castro had a powerful ally in moscow soviet premier nikita khrushchev who promised to defend cuba with soviet arms.
during the summer of 1962 the flow to cuba of soviet weapons including nuclear missiles increased greatly.
president kennedy responded with a warning that america would not tolerate offensive nuclear weapons in cuba.
then on october 14 photographs taken by american planes revealed soviet missile bases in cuba and some contained missiles ready to launch.
they could reach u s cities in minutes.
on october 22 kennedy informed an anxious nation of the existence of soviet missile sites in cuba and of his plans to remove them.
he made it clear that any missile attack from cuba would trigger an all out attack on the soviet union.
674 chapter 20 for the next six days the world faced the terrifying possibility of nuclear war.
in the atlantic ocean soviet ships presumably carrying more missiles headed toward cuba while the u s navy prepared to quarantine cuba and prevent the ships from coming within 500 miles of it.
in florida 100 000 troops waited the largest invasion force ever assembled in the united states.
c douglas dillon kennedy s secretary of the treasury and a veteran of nuclear diplomacy recalled those tension filled days of october.
a personal voice c douglas dillon the only time i felt a fear of nuclear war or a use of nuclear weapons was on the very first day when wed decided that we had to do whatever was necessary to get the missiles out.
there was always some background fear of what would eventually happen and i think this is what was expressed when people said they feared they would never see another saturday.
quoted in on the brink the first break in the crisis occurred when the soviet ships stopped suddenly to avoid a confrontation at sea.
secretary of state dean rusk said we are eyeball to eyeball and the other fellow just blinked.
a few days later khrushchev offered to remove the missiles in return for an american pledge not to invade cuba.
the united states also secretly agreed to remove missiles from turkey.
the leaders agreed and the crisis ended.
for a moment the world had stood still robert kennedy wrote years later and now it was going around again.
key players john f kennedy 1917 1963 john f jack kennedy grew up in a politically powerful family that helped make his dreams possible.
his parents instilled in him the drive to accomplish great things.
during world war ii he enlisted in the navy and was decorated for heroism.
in 1946 he won his first seat in congress from a boston district where he had never lived.
while a senator he won a pulitzer prize for his book profiles in courage.
although he radiated self confidence kennedy suffered many ailments including addisons disease a debilitating condition that he treated with daily injections of cortisone.
at least one half of the days that he spent on this earth were days of intense physical pain recalled his brother robert.

within four years of stalins death in 1953 khrushchev had consolidated his power in the soviet union.
during his regime which ended in 1964 khrushchev kept american nerves on edge with alternately conciliatory and aggressive behavior.
during a 1959 trip to the united states he met for friendly talks with president eisenhower.
the next year in front of the un general assembly he took off his shoe and angrily pounded it on a desk to protest the u 2 incident.
kennedy and khrushchev take the heat the crisis severely damaged khrushchev s prestige in the soviet union and the world.
kennedy did not escape criticism either.
some people criticized kennedy for practicing brinkmanship when private talks might have resolved the crisis without the threat of nuclear war.
others believed he had passed up an ideal chance to invade cuba and oust castro.
it was learned in the 1990s that the cia had underestimated the num bers of soviet troops and nuclear weapons on the island.
the effects of the crisis lasted long after the missiles had been removed many cuban exiles blamed the democrats for losing cuba a charge that kennedy had earlier leveled at the republicans and switched their allegiance to the gop 676 chapter 20 1 main idea analyzing effects what were the results of the cuban missile crisis.
meanwhile castro closed cuba s doors to the exiles in november 1962 by banning all flights to and from miami.
three years later hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of an agreement that allowed cubans to join relatives in the united states.
by the time castro sharply cut down on exit permits in 1973 the cuban population in miami had increased to about 300 000.
jp crisis over berlin one goal that had guided kennedy through the cuban missile crisis was that of proving to khrushchev his determination to contain communism.
all the while kennedy was thinking of their recent confrontation over berlin which had led to the construction of the berlin wall a concrete wall topped with barbed wire that severed the city in two.
the berlin crisis in 1961 berlin was a city in great turmoil.
in the 11 years since the berlin airlift almost 3 million east germans 20 percent of that country s population had fled into west berlin because it was free from communist rule.
these refugees advertised the failure of east germany s communist government.
their departure also dangerously weakened that country s economy.
the death strip stretched like a barren moat around west berlin with patrols floodlights electric fences and vehicle traps between the inner and outer walls.

most were seeking freedom from communist rule.
the wall isolated west berlin from a hostile german democratic republic gdr.
passing from east to west was almost impossible without the communist government s permission.
during the 28 years the wall was standing approximately 5 000 people succeeded in fleeing.
almost 200 people died in the attempt most were shot by the gdr border guards.
in 1989 east germany opened the berlin wall to cheering crowds.

soviet premier nikita khrushchev khrushchev realized that this problem had to be solved.
at a summit meeting in vienna austria in june 1961 he threatened to sign a treaty with east germany that would enable that country to close all the access roads to west berlin.
when kennedy refused to give up u s access to west berlin khrushchev furiously declared i want peace.
but if you want war that is your problem.
after returning home kennedy told the nation in a televised address that berlin was the great testing place of western courage and will.
he pledged w e cannot and will not permit the communists to drive us out of berlin.
kennedy s determination and america s superior nuclear striking power prevented khrushchev from closing the air and reading from this note card during a speech in west berlin kennedy proclaimed ich bin ein berliner i am a berliner.

instead the soviet premier surprised the world with a shocking decision.
just after midnight on august 13 1961 east german troops began to unload concrete posts and rolls of barbed wire along the border.
within days the berlin wall was erected separating east germany from west germany.
the construction of the berlin wall ended the berlin crisis but further aggravated cold war tensions.
the wall and its armed guards successfully reduced the flow of east german refugees to a tiny trickle thus solving khrushchev s main problem.
at the same time however the wall became an ugly symbol of communist oppression.
searching for ways to ease tensions showdowns between kennedy and khrushchev made both leaders aware of the gravity of split second decisions that separated cold war peace from nuclear disaster.
kennedy in particular searched for ways to tone down his hard line stance.
in 1963 he announced that the two nations had established a hot line between the white house and the kremlin.
this dedicated phone enabled the leaders of the two countries to communicate at once should another crisis arise.
later that year the united states and soviet union also agreed to a limited test ban treaty that barred nuclear testing in the atmosphere.

a personal voice alan shepard until the moment i stepped out of the flight deck.
i hadnt realized the intensity of the emotions and feelings that so many people had for me for the other astronauts and for the whole manned space program.
i was very close to tears as i thought its no longer just our fight to get out there the struggle belongs to everyone in america.
from now on there was no turning back.
moon shot the inside story of america s race to the moon the entire trip which took only 15 minutes from liftoff to splashdown reaffirmed the belief in american ingenuity.
john f kennedy inspired many americans with the same kind of belief.
the promise of progress kennedy set out to transform his broad vision of progress into what he called the new frontier.
we stand today on the edge of a new frontier kennedy had announced upon accepting the nomination for president.
he called on americans to be new pioneers and explore uncharted areas of science and space.
unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.
kennedy had difficulty turning his vision into reality however.
he offered congress proposals to provide medical care for the aged rebuild blighted urban areas and aid education but he couldn t gather enough votes.
kennedy faced the same conservative coalition that had blocked president truman s fair deal.
the new frontier and the great soci conomjc background what is a recession.
a recession is in a general sense a moderate slowdown of the economy marked by increased unemployment and reduced personal consumption.
in 1961 the nation s jobless rate climbed from just under 6 percent to nearly 7 percent.
personal consumption of several major items declined that year as people worried about job security and as a result spent less money.
car sales for example dropped by more than 1 billion from the previous year while fewer people took overseas vacations.
perhaps the surest sign that the country had entered a recession was the admission by government officials of how bleak the situation was.
we are in a full fledged recession secretary of labor arthur goldberg declared in february of 1961.
in his efforts to push his domestic reform measures through congress kennedy showed little skill.
since he had been elected by the slimmest of margins he lacked a popular mandate a clear indication that voters approved of his plans.
as a result he often tried to play it safe politically.
nevertheless kennedy did persuade congress to enact measures to boost the economy build the national defense provide international aid and fund a massive space program.
stimulating the economy one domestic problem the kennedy team tackled was the economy.
by 1960 america was in a recession.
unemployment hovered around 6 percent one of the highest levels since world war ii.
during the campaign kennedy had criticized the eisenhower administration for failing to stimulate growth.
the american economy he said was lagging behind those of other western democracies and the soviet union.
kennedy s advisers pushed for the use of deficit spending which had been the basis for roosevelt s new deal.
they said that stimulating economic growth depended on increased government spending and lower taxes even if it meant that the government spent more than it took in.
accordingly the proposals kennedy sent to congress in 1961 called for increased spending.
the department of defense received a nearly 20 percent budget increase for new nuclear missiles nuclear submarines and an expansion of the armed services.
congress also approved a package that increased the minimum wage to 1 25 an hour extended unemployment insurance and provided assistance to cities with high unemployment.
main idea identifying problems why did kennedy have difficulty achieving many of his new frontier goals.
addressing poverty abroad one of the first campaign promises kennedy fulfilled was the creation of the peace corps a program of volunteer assistance to the developing nations of asia africa and latin america.
critics in the united states called the program kennedy s kiddie korps because many volunteers were just out of college.
some foreign observers questioned whether americans could understand other cultures.
despite these reservations the peace corps became a huge success.
people of all ages and backgrounds signed up to work as agricultural advisers teachers or health aides or to do whatever work the host country needed.
by 1968 more than 35 000 volunteers had served in 60 nations around the world.
a second foreign aid program the alliance for progress offered economic and technical assistance to latin american countries.
between 1961 and 1969 the 680 chapter 20 main idea analyzing motives why did kennedy want to invest in foreign aid.
united states invested almost 12 billion in latin america in part to deter these countries from picking up fidel castro s revolutionary ideas.
while the money brought some development to the region it didn t bring fundamental reforms.
jbj race to the moon on april 12 1961 soviet cosmonaut yuri a gagarin became the first human in space.
kennedy saw this as a challenge and decided that america would surpass the soviets by sending a man to the moon.
in less than a month the united states had duplicated the soviet feat.
later that year a communications satellite called telstar relayed live television pictures across the atlantic ocean from maine to europe.
meanwhile america s national aeronautics and space administration nasa had begun to construct new launch facilities at cape canaveral florida and a mission control center in houston texas.
america s pride and prestige were restored.
speaking before a crowd at houston s rice university kennedy expressed the spirit of the space race.
a personal voice president john f kennedy we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win and the others too address on the nations space effort september 12 1962 historical spotlight johnson and mission control president kennedy appointed vice president johnson as chairman of the national aeronautics and space council shortly after they assumed office in 1961.
the chairmans duties were vague but johnson spelled them out he is to advise the president of what this nation s space policy ought to be and johnsons advice was to land a man on the moon.
a new home for the moon programs manned spacecraft center was created.
some nasa administrators had wanted to consolidate the center and the launch site in florida.
however when johnsons friends at humble oil donated land to rice university which sold 600 acres to nasa and donated the rest the debate was over.
houston became the center of the new space program.
main idea analyzing effects what effect did the space program have on other areas of american life.
seven years later on july 20 1969 the u s would achieve its goal.
an excited nation watched with bated breath as u s astronaut neil armstrong took his first steps on the moon.
as a result of the space program universities expanded their science programs.
the huge federal funding for research and development gave rise to new industries and new technologies many of which could be used in business and industry and also in new consumer goods.
space and defense related industries sprang up in the southern and western states which grew rapidly.

in which year did the federal government spend the most money on the space race.
what state benefited the most.
the new frontier and the great society addressing domestic problems while progress was being made on the new frontiers of space exploration and international aid many americans suffered at home.
in 1962 the problem of poverty in america was brought to national attention in michael harrington s book the other america.
harrington profiled the 50 million people in america who scraped by each year on less than 1 000 per person.
the number of poor shocked many americans.
while harrington awakened the nation to the nightmare of poverty the fight against segregation took hold.
throughout the south demonstrators raised their voices in what would become some of the most controversial civil rights battles of the 1960s.
see chapter 21.
kennedy had not pushed aggressively for legislation on the issues of poverty and civil rights although he effected changes by executive action.
however now he felt that it was time to live up to a campaign promise.
in 1963 kennedy began to focus more closely on the issues at home.
he called for a national assault on the causes of poverty.
he also ordered robert kennedy s justice department to investigate racial injustices in the south.
finally he presented congress with a sweeping civil rights bill and a proposal to cut taxes by over 10 billion.
main idea j making inferences jd in what directions did president kennedy seem to be taking his administration in 1963.
tragedy in dallas in the fall of 1963 public opinion polls showed that kennedy was losing popularity because of his advocacy of civil rights.
yet most still supported their beloved president.
no one could foresee the terrible national tragedy just ahead.
four days in november on the sunny morning of november 22 1963 air force one the presidential aircraft landed in dallas texas.
president and mrs kennedy had come to texas to mend political fences with members of the state s democratic party.
kennedy had expected a cool reception from the conservative state but he basked instead in warm waves of applause from crowds that lined the streets of downtown dallas.
jacqueline and her husband sat in the back seat of an open air limousine.
in front of them sat texas governor john connally and his wife nellie.
as the car approached a state building known as the texas school book depository nellie connally turned to kennedy and said you can t say that dallas isn t friendly to you today.
a few seconds later rifle shots rang out and kennedy was shot in the head.
his car raced to a nearby hospital where doctors frantically tried to revive him but it was too late.
president kennedy was dead.
as the tragic news spread through america s schools offices and homes people reacted with disbelief.
questions were on everyone s lips who had killed 682 chapter 20 vocabulary conspiracy an agreement by two or more persons to take illegal political action main idea contrasting ey how did the warren commissions findings differ from other theories.
z during the next four days television became the window of the world.
a photograph of a somber lyndon johnson taking the oath of office aboard the presidential airplane was broadcast.
soon audiences watched as dallas police charged lee harvey oswald with the murder.
his palm print had been found on the rifle used to kill john f kennedy.
the 24 year old ex marine had a suspicious past.
after receiving a dishonorable discharge oswald had briefly lived in the soviet union and he supported castro.
on sunday november 24 as millions watched live television coverage of oswald being transferred between jails a nightclub owner named jack ruby broke through the crowd and shot and killed oswald.
the next day all work stopped for kennedy s funeral as america mourned its fallen leader.
the assassination and televised funeral became a historic event.
americans who were alive then can still recall what they were doing when they first heard about the shooting of their president.
unanswered questions the bizarre chain of events made some people wonder if oswald was part of a conspiracy.
in 1963 the warren commission investigated and concluded that oswald had shot the president while acting on his own.
later in 1979 a reinvestigation concluded that oswald was part of a conspiracy.
investigators also said that two persons may have fired at the president.
numerous other people have made investigations.
their explanations have ranged from a plot by anti castro cubans to a communist sponsored attack to a conspiracy by the cia.
e what americans did learn from the kennedy assassination was that their system of government is remarkably sturdy.
a crisis that would have crippled a dictatorship did not prevent a smooth transition to the presidency of lyndon johnson.
in a speech to congress johnson expressed his hope that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness but strength.
not long after johnson drove through congress the most ambitious domestic legislative package since the new deal.
assessment sow a th w kennedys assassination from the beginning people have questioned the warren commission report.
amateur investigators have led to increasing public pressure on the government to tell all it knows about the assassination.
in response congress passed the jfk records act in 1992 which created a panel to review government and private files and decide which should be part of the public record.
since the law was enacted newly declassified information has added some weight to a body of evidence that jfk was shot from the front the warren commission had concluded that a single bullet struck the president from behind and that oswald thus could not have acted alone.
while such evidence challenges the warren commissions report no information has yet surfaced that conclusively disproves its findings.

others are migrant workers who move with their entire family from one region to the next as the growing seasons change.
nationally migrant workers make up some 50 percent of hired farm workers depending on the season and other factors.
as the map shows there were three major streams of migrant worker movements in the 1960s the pacific coast the midwest and the atlantic coast.
while these paths may have changed slightly since then the movement of migrant workers into nearly every region of the nation continues today.

for example one family may travel to ohio for the tomato harvest and then return to michigan to pick apples before heading back to texas for the winter months.

lbjs path to power by the time lyndon baines johnson or lbj as he was called succeeded to the presidency his ambition and drive had become legendary.
in explaining his frenetic energy johnson once remarked that s the way i ve been all my life.
my daddy used to wake me up at dawn and shake my leg and say lyndon every boy in town s got an hour s head start on you.
from the texas hills to capitol hill a fourth generation texan johnson grew up in the dry texas hill country of blanco county.
the johnsons never knew great wealth but they also never missed a meal.
686 chapter 20 lbj entered politics in 1937 when he won a special elec tion to fill a vacant seat in the u s house of representatives johnson styled himself as a new dealer and spokesperson for the small ranchers and struggling farmers of his district.
he caught the eye of president franklin roosevelt who took johnson under his wing.
roosevelt helped him secure key committee assignments in congress and steer much needed electrification and water projects to his texas district.
johnson in turn idolized fdr and imitated his leadership style.
once in the house johnson eagerly eyed a seat in the senate.

people called his legendary ability to persuade senators to support his bills the lbj treatment.
as a reporter for the saturday evening post explained johnson also used this treatment to win over reporters.
a personal voice stewart alsop the majority leader johnson was it seemed in a relaxed friendly reminiscent mood.
but by gradual stages this mood gave way to something rather like a human hurri cane.
johnson was up striding about his office talking without pause occasionally leaning over his nose almost touching the reporters to shake the reporters shoulder or grab his knee.
appeals were made to the almighty to the shades of the departed great to the reporters finer instincts and better nature while the reporter unable to get a word in edgewise sat collapsed upon a leather sofa eyes glazed mouth half open.
the new president saturday evening post december 14 1963 johnson s deft handling of congress led to the passage of the civil rights act of 1957 a voting rights measure that was the first civil rights legislation since reconstruction.
johnson s knack for achieving legislative results had captured john f kennedy s attention too during kennedy s run for the white house.
to kennedy johnson s congressional connections and his southern protestant background compensated for his own drawbacks as a candidate so he asked johnson to be his running mate.
johnson s presence on the ticket helped kennedy win key states in the south especially texas which went democratic by just a few thousand votes.
johnsons domestic agenda lyndon b johnson 1908 1973 lbj received his teaching degree from southwest texas state teachers college in 1930.
to finance his own education johnson took a year off from college to work at a mexican american school in cotulla texas.

the new frontier and the great society the war in vietnam as lbj pushed through his domestic programs the u s grew more interested in halting the spread of communism around the world.
in vietnam anticommunist nationalists controlled south vietnam while communist leader ho chi minh had taken over north vietnam.
the geneva accords had temporarily provided peace dividing vietnam along the 17th parallel into two distinct political regions.
despite this treaty the north was supporting communist rebels who were trying to take over the south.
though presidents eisenhower and kennedy had provided economic and military aid to south vietnam soon the u s would be directly involved in fighting the war.
usfy in february 1964 congress passed a tax reduction of over 10 billion into law.
as the democrats had hoped the tax cut spurred economic growth.
people spent more which meant profits for businesses which increased tax revenues and lowered the federal budget deficit from 6 billion in 1964 to 4 billion in 1966.
then in july johnson pushed the civil rights act of 1964 through congress persuading southern senators to stop blocking its passage.
it prohibited discrimination based on race religion national origin and sex and granted the federal government new powers to enforce its provisions.
the war on poverty following these successes lbj pressed on with his own agenda to alleviate poverty.
early in 1964 he had declared unconditional war on poverty in america and proposed sweeping legislation designed to help americans on the outskirts of hope.
in august 1964 congress enacted the economic opportunity act eoa approving nearly 1 billion for youth programs antipoverty measures small business loans and job training.
the eoa legislation created the job corps youth training program vista volunteers in service to america project head start an education program for underprivileged preschoolers the community action program which encouraged poor people to participate in public works programs the 1964 election in 1964 the republicans nominated conservative senator barry goldwater of arizona to oppose johnson.
goldwater believed the federal government had no business trying to right social and economic wrongs such as poverty discrimination and lack of opportunity.
he attacked such long established federal programs as social security which he wanted to make voluntary and the tennessee valley authority which he wanted to sell.
in 1964 most american people were in tune with johnson they believed that government could and should help solve the nation s problems.
moreover goldwater had frightened many americans by suggesting that he might use nuclear weapons on cuba and north vietnam.
johnson s campaign capitalized on this fear.

where goldwater advocated intervention in vietnam johnson assured the american people that sending u s troops there would offer no solution at all to the real problem of vietnam.
lbj won the election by a landslide winning 61 percent of the popular vote and 486 electoral votes while senator goldwater won only 52.
the democrats also increased their majority in congress.
for the first time since 1938 a democratic president did not need the votes of conservative southern democrats in order to get laws passed.
now johnson could launch his reform program in earnest.
j main idea identifying problems what problems in american society did the economic opportunity act seek to address.
campaign buttons like this one capitalized on the nations growing liberal democratic sentiments.
688 chapter 20 h aj 1 a jte c building the great society in may 1964 johnson had summed up his vision for america in a phrase the great society.
in a speech at the university of michigan johnson outlined a legislative program that would end poverty and racial injustice.
but he told an enthusiastic crowd that was just the beginning.
johnson envisioned a legislative program that would create not only a higher standard of living and equal opportunity but also promote a richer quality of life for all.
a personal voice lyndon b johnson the great society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents.
it is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness.
it is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community.
it is a place where man can renew contact with nature.
it is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race the great society may 22 1964 like his idol fdr lbj wanted to change america.
by the time johnson left the white house in 1969 congress had passed 206 of his measures.
the president personally led the battle to get most of them passed.
education during 1965 and 1966 the lbj administration introduced a flurry of bills to congress.
johnson considered education the key which can unlock the door to the great society.
the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 provided more than 1 billion in federal aid to help public and parochial schools purchase textbooks and new library materials.
this was the first major federal aid package for education in the nation s history.

skillbuilder interpreting charts what did the great society programs indicate about the federal governments changing role.
healthcare lbj and congress changed social security by establishing medicare and medicaid.
medicare provided hospital insurance and low cost medical insurance for almost every american age 65 or older.
medicaid extended health insurance to welfare recipients.
housing congress also made several important decisions that shifted the nation s political power from rural to urban areas.
these decisions included appropriating money to build some 240 000 units of low rent public housing and help low and moderate income families pay for better private housing establishing the department of housing and urban development hud and appointing robert weaver the first african american cabinet member in american history as secretary of hud.
main idea comparing how are medicare and medicaid similar.
690 chapter 20 main idea analyzing effects how did the immigration act of 1965 change the nations immigration system.
immigration the great society also brought profound changes to the nation s immigration laws.
the immigration act of 1924 and the national origins act of 1924 had established immigration quotas that discriminated strongly against people from outside western europe.
the act set a quota of about 150 000 people annually.
it discriminated against southern and eastern europeans and barred asians completely.
the immigration act of 1965 opened the door for many non european immigrants to settle in the united states by ending quotas based on nationality jgj the environment in 1962 silent spring a book by rachel carson had exposed a hidden danger the effects of pesticides on the environment.
carson s book and the public s outcry resulted in the water quality act of 1965 which required states to clean up rivers.
johnson also ordered the government to search out the worst chemical polluters.
there is no excuse for chemical companies and oil refineries using our major rivers as pipelines for toxic wastes.
such words and actions helped trigger the environmental movement in the united states.
see chapter 24.
consumer protection consumer advocates also made headway.
they convinced congress to pass major safety laws including a truth in packaging law that set standards for labeling consumer goods.
ralph nader a young lawyer wrote a book unsafe at any speed that sharply criticized the u s automobile industry for ignoring safety concerns.
his testimony helped persuade congress to establish safety standards for automobiles and tires.
precautions extended to food too.
congress passed the wholesome meat act of 1967.
americans can feel a little safer now in their homes on the road at the supermarket and in the department store said johnson.
reforms of the warren court the wave of liberal reform that characterized the great society also swept through the supreme court of the 1960s.
beginning with the 1954 landmark decision brown v board of education which ruled school segregation unconstitutional the court under chief justice earl warren took an activist stance on the leading issues of the day.
several major court decisions in the 1960s affected american society.
the warren court banned prayer in public schools and declared state required loyalty oaths unconstitutional.
it limited the power of communities to censor books and films and said that free speech included the wearing of black armbands to school by antiwar students.
furthermore the court brought about change in federal and state reapportionment and the criminal justice system.
congressional reapportionment in a key series of decisions the warren court addressed the issue of reapportionment or the way in which states redraw election districts based on the changing number of people in them by 1960 about 80 percent of americans lived in cities and suburbs.
however many states had failed to change their congressional districts to reflect this development instead rural districts might have fewer than 200 000 people while some urban districts had more than 600 000.
thus the voters in rural areas had more representation and also more power than those in urban areas.
mow th medicare on the line when president johnson signed the medicare bill in 1965 only half of the nations elderly had health insurance.
today thanks largely to medicare nearly all persons 65 years or older have medical coverage.
over the years federal spending on medicare has steadily increased and today accounts for about 16 percent of all federal outlays.
experts have debated whether medicare can be sustained as people live longer health care costs increase and the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age.
though most americans are not in favor of cutbacks to medicare efforts have been made in the last few years to cut the growth in spending.
the new frontier and the great sociei i i baker v carr 1962 was the first of several decisions that established the principle of one person one vote.
the court asserted that the federal courts had the right to tell states to reapportion redivide their districts for more equal representation.
in later decisions the court ruled that congressional district boundaries should be redrawn so that districts would be equal in population and in reynolds v sims 1964 it extended the principle of one person one vote to state legislative districts.
these decisions increased political power in urban areas.
rights of the accused other warren court decisions greatly expanded the rights of people accused of crimes.
in hernandez v texas 1954 the warren court ruled that a mexican american defendant had a right to be tried by a jury that did not exclude other members of his ethnicity.
this decision also determined that mexican americans were a special class entitled to equal protection under fourteenth amendment.
in mapp v ohio 1961 the court ruled that evidence seized illegally could not be used in state courts.
this is called the exclusionary rule.
in gideon v wainwright 1963 the justices required criminal courts to provide free legal counsel to those who could not afford it.
in escobedo v illinois 1964 the justices ruled that an accused person has a right to have a lawyer present during police questioning.
in 1966 the court went one step further in miranda v arizona where it ruled that all suspects must be read their rights before questioning.
these rulings divided public opinion.
liberals praised the decisions arguing that they placed necessary limits on police power and protected the right to a fair trial.
conservatives bitterly criticized the court for benefiting criminal suspects and severely limiting the power of the police to investigate crimes.
during the late 1960s and 1970s republican candidates portrayed democrats as being soft on crime citing the warren court decisions as major obstacles to fighting crime.
main idea contrasting what were the differing reactions to the warren court decisions on the rights of the accused.
n t counterpoint the great society succeeded in prompting far reaching social change defenders of the great society contend that it bettered the lives of millions of americans.
historian john morton blum notes the great society initiated policies that by 1985 had had profound consequences blacks now voted at about the same rate as whites and nearly 6 000 blacks held public offices almost every elderly citizen had medical insurance and the aged were no poorer than americans as a whole a large majority of small children attended preschool programs attorney margaret burnham argues that the civil rights gains alone justify the great society for tens of thousands of human beings.

then propose a social program you think would address at least one of those problems while avoiding the pitfalls of the great society programs.
failures of the great society prove that government sponsored programs do not work the major attack on the great society is that it created big government an oversized bureaucracy too many regulations waste and fraud and rising budget deficits.
as journalist david alpern writes this comes from the notion that government could solve all the nations problems the great society created unwieldy new mechanisms like the office of economic opportunity and began throwing dollars at problems spawned in the process were vast new constituencies of government bureaucrats and beneficiaries whose political clout made it difficult to kill programs off conservatives say the great societys social welfare programs created a culture of dependency.
economist paul craig roberts argues that the great society.
reflected our lack of confidence in the institutions of a free society.
we came to the view that it is government spending and not business innovation that creates jobs and that it is societys fault if anyone is poor 692 chapter 20 main idea identifying problems what events and problems may have affected the success of the great society.
impact of the great society the great society and the warren court changed the united states.
people dis agree on whether these changes left the nation better or worse but most agree on one point no president in the post world war ii era extended the power and reach of the federal government more than lyndon johnson.
the optimism of the johnson presidency fueled an activist era in all three branches of government for at least the first few years.
the war on poverty did help.
the number of poor people fell from 21 percent of the population in 1962 to 11 percent in 1973.
however many of the programs meant to create economic opportunities were hastily conceived and had unintended consequences including being difficult to accomplish.
johnson s massive tax cut spurred the economy.
but funding the great society contributed to a growing budget deficit a problem that continued for decades.
questions about government finances as well as debates over the effectiveness of these programs and the role of the federal government left a number of people disillusioned.
a conservative backlash began to take shape as a new group of republican leaders rose to power.
in 1966 for example a conservative hollywood actor named ronald reagan swept to victory in the race for governor of california over the democratic incumbent.
thousands of miles away the increase of communist forces in vietnam also began to overshadow the goals of the great society.
the fear of communism was deeply rooted in the minds of americans from the cold war era.

the new frontier and the great society 6 s 1ej miranda v arizona 1966 origins of the case in 1963 ernesto miranda was arrested at his home in phoenix arizona on charges of kidnapping and rape.
after two hours of questioning by police he signed a confession and was later convicted largely based on the confession.
miranda appealed.
he claimed that his confession was invalid because it was coerced and because the police never advised him of his right to an attorney or his right to avoid self incrimination.
the ruling the court overturned mirandas conviction holding that the police must inform criminal suspects of their legal rights at the time of arrest and may not interrogate suspects who invoke their rights.
legal reasoning chief justice earl warren wrote the majority opinion in miranda v arizona.
he based his argument on the fifth amendment which guarantees that an accused person cannot be forced to be a witness against himself or herself.
warren stressed that when suspects are interrogated in police custody the situation is inherently intimidating.
such a situation he argued undermines any evidence it produces because no statement obtained from the defendant while in custody can truly be the product of his free choice.
for this reason the court majority found that miranda s confession could not be used as evidence.
in the opinion chief justice warren responded to the argument that police officials might find this requirement difficult to meet.
legal sources u s constitution not only does the use of the third degree harassment or torture used to obtain a confession involve a flagrant violation of law by the officers of the law but it involves also the dangers of false confessions and it tends to make police and prosecutors less zealous in the search for objective evidence.
ernesto miranda at right converses with attorney john j flynn in february 1967.

gideon v wainwright 1963 the court said that a defendant accused of a felony has the right to an attorney which the government must supply if the defendant cannot afford one.
escobedo v illinois 1964 the court held that a suspect has the right to an attorney when being questioned by police.
694 chapter 20 why it mattered miranda was one of four key criminal justice cases decided by the warren court see related cases.
in each case the decision reflected the chief justice s strong belief that all persons deserve to be treated with respect by their government.
in miranda the court directed police to inform every suspect of his or her rights at the time of arrest and even gave the police detailed instructions about what to say.
the rights of accused people need to be protected in order to ensure that innocent people are not punished.
these protections also ensure that federal state or local authorities will not harass people for political reasons as often happened to civil rights activists in the south in the 1950s and 1960s for example.
critics of the warren court claimed that miranda would lead to more crime because it would become more difficult to convict criminals.
police departments however adapted to the decision.
they placed the list of suspects rights mentioned in miranda on cards for police officers to read to suspects.
the statement of these rights became known as the miranda warning and quickly became famil iar to anyone who watched a police show on television.
as for the defendant ernesto miranda he was retried and convicted on the basis of other evidence.

you may stop talking to me at any time and you may also demand a lawyer at any time.
historical impact the miranda decision was highly controversial.
critics complained that the opinion would protect the rights of criminals at the expense of public safety.
since miranda the court has continued to try to strike a balance between public safety and the rights of the accused.
several cases in the 1970s and 1980s softened the miranda ruling and gave law enforcement officers more power to gather evidence without informing suspects of their rights.
even so conservatives still hoped to overturn the miranda decision.
in 2000 however the supreme court affirmed miranda by a 7 to 2 majority in dickerson v united states.
writing for the majority chief justice william rehnquist argued there is no such justification here for overruling miranda.
miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where warnings have become part of our national culture.

as you read think of alternate responses he could have made at each turn of events.
the cuban missile crisis in the early 1960s the soviets grew concerned about u s nuclear missiles in turkey.
soviet premier nikita khrushchev pledged to protect cuba and decided to put similar missiles in cuba.
0 during the summer of 1962 the flow of soviet weapons into cuba including nuclear missiles greatly increased.
president kennedy responded cautiously at first issuing a warning that the united states would not tolerate the presence of offensive nuclear weapons in cuba.
the soviets claimed the missiles were only for defense.
0 then on october 14 photographs taken by american u 2 planes showed the president that the soviets were secretly building missile bases in cuba.
some of the missiles armed and ready to fire could reach u s cities in minutes.
0 both kennedy and khrushchev faced a choice they could escalate the situation or negotiate.
u s leaders considered launching an air strike on the missile sites or starting a blockade.
0 kennedy hoped the blockade would stop boats from delivering missile parts and allow the soviets the chance to avoid war by removing the missiles themselves the soviets pointed out that a u s attack on cuba could mean war.
0on the evening of october 22 the president made public the evidence of missiles and stated his ultimatum any missile attack from cuba would trigger an all out attack on the soviet union.
meanwhile kennedy had ordered the blockade of cuba.
as soviet ships headed toward the island the u s navy stood prepared to stop them.
and in florida troops massed in preparation for an invasion to avoid confrontation the soviet ships suddenly halted.
khrushchev offered to remove the missiles from cuba in exchange for a pledge not to invade the island.
kennedy agreed and the crisis ended.

the segregation system segregated buses might never have rolled through the streets of montgomery if the civil rights act of 1875 had remained in force.
this act outlawed segregation in public facilities by decreeing that all persons.
shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations of inns public conveyances on land or water theaters and other places of public amusement.
in 1883 however the all white supreme court declared the act unconstitutional.
700 chapter 21 background seep essyv.
ferguson on page 290.
main idea analyzing effects what were the effects of the supreme court decision plessy v ferguson.
plessy v ferguson during the 1890s a number of other court decisions and state laws severely limited african american rights.
in 1890 louisiana passed a law requiring railroads to provide equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races.
in the plessy v ferguson case of 1896 the supreme court ruled that this separate but equal law did not violate the fourteenth amendment which guarantees all americans equal treatment under the law.
armed with the plessy decision states throughout the nation but especially in the south passed what were known as jim crow laws aimed at separating the races.
these laws forbade marriage between blacks and whites and established many other restrictions on social and religious contact between the races.
there were separate schools as well as separate streetcars waiting rooms railroad coaches elevators witness stands and public restrooms.
the facilities provided for blacks were always inferior to those for whites.
nearly every day african americans faced humiliating signs that read colored water no blacks allowed whites only.
fly segregation continues into the 20th century after the civil war some african americans tried to escape southern racism by moving north.
this migration of southern african americans speeded up greatly during world war i as many african american sharecroppers abandoned farms for the promise of industrial jobs in northern cities.
however they discovered racial prejudice and segregation there too.
most could find housing only in all black neighborhoods.
many white workers also resented the competition for jobs.
this sometimes led to violence.
apartheid segregation in south africa in 1948 the white government of south africa passed laws to ensure that whites would stay in control of the country.
those laws established a system called apartheid which means apartness the system divided south africans into four segregated racial groups whites blacks coloreds of mixed race and asians.
it restricted what jobs nonwhites could hold where they could live and what rights they could exercise.
because of apartheid the black african majority were denied the right to vote.
in response to worldwide criticism the south african government gradually repealed the apartheid laws starting in the late 1970s.
in 1994 south africa held its first all race election and elected as president nelson mandela a black anti apartheid leader whom the white government had imprisoned for nearly 30 years.

civil rights 7 thurgood marshall 1908 1993 thurgood marshall dedicated his life to fighting racism.
his father had labored as a steward at an all white country club his mother as a teacher at an all black school.
marshall himself was denied admission to the university of maryland law school because of his race.
in 1961 president john f kennedy nominated marshall to the u s court of appeals.
lyndon johnson picked marshall for u s solicitor general in 1965 and two years later named him as the first african american supreme court justice.
in that role he remained a strong advocate of civil rights until he retired in 1991.
after marshall died in 1993 a copy of the brown v board of education decision was placed beside his casket.
on it an admirer wrote you shall always be remembered a developing civil rights movement in many ways the events of world war ii set the stage for the civil rights movement.
first the demand for soldiers in the early 1940s created a shortage of white male laborers.
that labor shortage opened up new job opportunities for african americans latinos and white women.
second nearly one million african americans served in the armed forces which needed so many fighting men that they had to end their discriminatory policies.
such policies had previously kept african americans from serving in fighting units.
many african american soldiers returned from the war determined to fight for their own freedom now that they had helped defeat fascist regimes overseas.
third during the war civil rights organizations actively campaigned for african american voting rights and challenged jim crow laws.
in response to protests president roosevelt issued a presidential directive prohibiting racial discrimination by federal agencies and all companies that were engaged in war work.
the groundwork was laid for more organized campaigns to end segregation throughout the united states.
challenging segregation in court the desegregation campaign was led largely by the naacp which had fought since 1909 to end segregation.
one influential figure in this campaign was charles hamilton houston a brilliant howard university law professor who also served as chief legal counsel for the naacp from 1934 to 1938.
the naacp legal strategy in deciding the naacp s legal strategy houston focused on the inequality between the separate schools that many states provided.
at that time the nation spent ten times as much money educating a white child as an african american child.
thus houston focused the organization s limited resources on challenging the most glaring inequalities of segregated public education.
in 1938 he placed a team of his best law students under the direction of thurgood marshall.
over the next 23 years marshall and his naacp lawyers would win 29 out of 32 cases argued before the supreme court.
several of the cases became legal milestones each chipping away at the segregation platform of plessyv.
in the 1946 case morgan v virginia the supreme court declared unconstitutional those state laws mandating segregated seating on interstate buses.
in 1950 the high court ruled in sweatt v painter that state law schools must admit black applicants even if separate black schools exist.
brown v board of education marshall s most stunning victory came on may 17 1954 in the case known as brown v board of education of topeka.
see page 708.
in this case the father of eight year old linda brown had charged the board of education of topeka kansas with violating linda s rights by denying her admission to an all white elementary school four blocks from her house.
the nearest all black elementary school was 21 blocks away.
in a landmark verdict the supreme court unanimously struck down segregation in schooling as an unconstitutional violation of the fourteenth amendment s equal protection main idea developing historical perspective how did events during world war ii lay the groundwork for african americans to fight for civil rights in the 1950s.
702 chapter 21 main idea making inferences how did the brown decision affect schools outside of topeka.
pli main idea analyzing causes 5 why werent schools in all regions desegregated immediately after the brown ii decision.
chief justice earl warren wrote that i n the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.
the brown decision was relevant for some 12 million schoolchildren in 21 states.
reaction to the brown decision some officials complied with the ruling but others worked to maintain the status quo.
in kansas and oklahoma state officials said they expected segregation to end with little trouble.
in texas the governor warned that plans might take years to work out.
he actively prevented desegregation by calling in the texas rangers.
in mississippi and georgia officials vowed total resistance.
governor herman talmadge of georgia said the people of georgia will not comply with the decision of the court.
we re going to do whatever is necessary in georgia to keep white children in white schools and colored children in colored schools.
resistance to school desegregation within a year more than 500 school districts had desegregated their classrooms.
in baltimore st louis and washington d c black and white students sat side by side for the first time in history.
however in many areas where african americans were a majority whites resisted desegregation.
in some places the ku klux kian reappeared and white citizens councils boycotted businesses that supported desegregation.
to speed things up in 1955 the supreme court handed down a second ruling known as brown ii that ordered school desegregation implemented with all deliberate speed.
initially president eisenhower refused to enforce compliance.
the fellow who tries to tell me that you can do these things by force is just plain nuts he said.
events in little rock arkansas would soon force eisenhower to go against his personal beliefs.
crisis in little rock in 1948 arkansas had become the first southern state to admit african americans to state universities without being required by a court order.
by the 1950s some scout troops and labor unions in arkansas had quietly ended their jim crow practices.
little rock citizens had elected two men to the school board who publicly backed desegregation and the school superintendent virgil blossom began planning for desegregation soon after brown.
however governor orval faubus publicly showed support for segregation.
in september 1957 he ordered the national guard to turn away the little rock nine nine african american students who had volunteered to integrate little rock s central high school as the first step in blossom s plan.
a federal judge ordered faubus to let the students into school.
naacp members called eight of the students and arranged to drive them to school.
they could not reach the ninth student elizabeth eckford who did not have a phone and she set out alone.
outside central high eckford faced an abusive crowd.
terrified the 15 year old made it to a bus stop where two friendly whites stayed with her.
as white students jeer her and arkansas national guards look on elizabeth eckford enters little rock central high school in 1957.
the crisis in little rock forced eisenhower to act.
he placed the arkansas national guard under federal control and ordered a thousand paratroopers into little rock.
the nation watched the televised coverage of the event.
under the watch of soldiers the nine african american teenagers attended class.
but even these soldiers could not protect the students from troublemakers who confronted them in stairways in the halls and in the cafeteria.
throughout the year african american students were regularly harassed by other students.
at the end of the year faubus shut down central high rather than let integration continue.
on september 9 1957 congress passed the civil rights act of 1957 the first civil rights law since reconstruction.
shepherded by senator lyndon b johnson of texas the law gave the attorney general greater power over school desegregation.
it also gave the federal government jurisdiction or authority over violations of african american voting rights.
yty playeft rosa parks 1913 2005 long before december 1955 rosa parks shown being finger printed had protested segregation through everyday acts.
she refused to use drinking fountains labeled colored only when possible she shunned segregated elevators and climbed stairs instead.
parks joined the montgomery chapter of the naacp in 1943 and became the organizations secretary.
a turning point came for her in the summer of 1955 when she attended a workshop designed to promote integration by giving the students the experience of interracial living.
returning to montgomery parks was even more determined to fight segregation.
as it happened her act of protest against injustice on the buses inspired a whole community to join her cause.
main idea making inferences ss what effect do you think television coverage of the little rock incident had on the nation.
the montgomery bus boycott the face to face confrontation at central high school was not the only showdown over segregation in the mid 1950s.
impatient with the slow pace of change in the courts african american activists had begun taking direct action to win the rights promised to them by the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution.
among those on the frontline of change was jo ann robinson.
boycotting segregation four days after the brown decision in may 1954 robinson wrote a letter to the mayor of montgomery alabama asking that bus drivers no longer be allowed to force riders in the colored section to yield their seats to whites.
the mayor refused.
little did he know that in less than a year another african american woman from alabama would be at the center of this controversy and that her name and her words would far outlast segregation.
on december 1 1955 rosa parks a seamstress and an naacp officer took a seat in the front row of the colored section of a montgomery bus.
as the bus filled up the driver ordered parks and three other african american passengers to empty the row they were occupying so that a white man could sit down without having to sit next to any african americans.
it was time for someone to stand up or in my case sit down recalled parks.
i refused to move.
as parks stared out the window the bus driver said if you don t stand up i m going to call the police and have you arrested.
the soft spoken parks replied you may do that.
robinson and naacp leader e d nixon suggested a bu boycott.
the leaders of the african american community including many ministers formed the montgomer improvement association to organize the boycott.
the elected the pastor of the dexter avenue baptist church 26 year old martin luther king jr to lead the group an ordained minister since 1948 king had just earned ph d degree in theology from boston university.
well i m not sure i m the best person for the position kin confided to nixon but if no one else is going to serve i d be glad to try during the bus boycott montgomerys black citizens relied on an efficient car pool system that ferried people between more than forty pickup stations like the one shown.
walking for justice on the night of december 5 1955 dr king made the following declaration to an estimated crowd of between 5 000 and 15 000 people.
a personal voice martin luther king jr there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled over by the iron feet of oppression.
i want it to be known that were going to work with grim and bold determination to gain justice on buses in this city.
and we are not wrong.
if we are wrong the supreme court of this nation is wrong.
if we are wrong god almighty is wrong.
if we are wrong justice is a lie.
quoted in parting the waters america in the king years 1954 63 i main idea synthesizing why was rosa parkss action on december 1 1955 significant.
king s passionate and eloquent speech brought people to their feet and filled the audience with a sense of mission.
african americans filed a lawsuit and for 381 days refused to ride the buses in montgomery.
in most cases they had to find other means of transportation by organizing car pools or walking long distances.
support came from within the black community workers donated one fifth of their weekly salaries as well as from outside groups like the naacp the united auto workers montgomery s jewish community and sympathetic white southerners.
the boy cotters remained nonviolent even after a bomb ripped apart king s home no one was injured.
finally in 1956 the supreme court outlawed bus segregation martin luther king and the sclc main idea summarizing what were the central points of dr kings philosophy.
the montgomery bus boycott proved to the world that the african american community could unite and organize a successful protest movement.
it also proved the power of nonviolent resistance the peaceful refusal to obey unjust laws.
despite threats to his life and family king urged his followers don t ever let anyone pull you so low as to hate them.
changing the world with soul force king called his brand of nonviolent resistance soul force.
he based his ideas on the teachings of several people.
from the teachings of jesus he learned to love one s enemies.
from writer henry david thoreau he took the concept of civil disobedience the refusal to obey an unjust law.
from labor organizer a philip randolph he learned to organize massive demonstrations.
from mohandas gandhi the leader who helped india throw off british rule he learned to resist oppression without violence.
we will not hate you king said to white racists but we cannot.
obey your unjust laws.
we will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer.
and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process.
civil rights yt y playf king held steadfast to his philosophy even when a wave of racial violence swept through the south after the brown decision.
the violence included the 1955 murder of emmett till a 14 year old african american boy who had allegedly flirted with a white woman.
there were also shootings and beatings some fatal of civil rights workers.
from the grassroots up after the bus boycott ended king joined with ministers and civil rights leaders in 1957 to found the southern christian leadership conference sclc.
its purpose was to carry on nonviolent crusades against the evils of second class citizenship.
using african american churches as a base the sclc planned to stage protests and demonstrations throughout the south.
the leaders hoped to build a movement from the grassroots up and to win the support of ordinary african americans of all ages.
king president of the sclc used the power of his voice and ideas to fuel the movement s momentum.
the nuts and bolts of organizing the sclc was handled by its first director ella baker the granddaughter of slaves.
while with the naacp baker had served as national field secretary traveling over 16 000 miles throughout the south.
from 1957 to 1960 baker used her contacts to set up branches of the sclc in southern cities.
in april 1960 baker helped students at shaw university an african american university in raleigh north carolina to organize a national protest group the student nonviolent coordinating committee or sncc pronounced snick for short.
it had been six years since the brown decision and many college students viewed the pace of change as too slow.
although these students risked a great deal losing college scholarships being expelled from college being physically harmed they were determined to challenge the system.
sncc hoped to harness the energy of these student protesters it would soon create one of the most important student activist movements in the nation s history.
the movement although sncc adopted king s ideas in part its members had ideas of their own.
many people called for a more confrontational strategy and set out to reshape the civil rights movement.
demonstrating for freedom the founders of sncc had models to build on.
in 1942 in chicago the congress of racial equality core had staged the first sit ins in which african american protesters sat down at segregated lunch counters and refused to leave until they were served.
in february 1960 african american students from north carolina s agricultural and technical college staged a sit in at a whites only lunch counter at a woolworth s store in greensboro.
this time television crews brought coverage of the protest into homes throughout the united states.
there was no denying the ugly face of racism.
day after day news reporters captured the scenes of whites beating jeering at and pouring food over students who refused to strike back.
the coverage sparked many other sit ins across the south.

upon his return home the elder king changed his and his sons names to martin.
like luther the younger king became a reformer.
in 1964 he won the nobel peace prize.
yet there was a side of king unknown to most people his inner battle to overcome his hatred of the white bigots.
as a youth he had once vowed to hate all white people as leader of the civil rights movement king said all americans had to be freed negroes from the bonds of segregation and shame whites from the bonds of bigotry and fear evaluating what was the role of the sclc.
706 chapter 21 1 sit in demonstrators such as these at a jackson mississippi lunch counter in 1963 faced intimidation and humiliation from white segregationists.
in the police raised the price of food and removed counter seats.
but the movement continued and spread to the north.
there students formed picket lines around national chain stores that maintained segregated lunch counters in the south.
by late 1960 students had descended on and desegregated lunch counters in some 48 cities in 11 states.
they endured arrests beatings suspension from college and tear gas and fire hoses but the army of nonviolent students refused to back down.
my mother has always told me that i m equal to other people said ezell blair jr one of the students who led the first sncc sit in in 1960.

reverend oliver brown protested that this was unfair to his eight year old daughter linda.
although the browns lived near a white school linda was forced to take a long bus ride to her black school across town.
the ruling the court ruled that segregated public schools were inherently unequal and therefore unconstitutional.
legal reasoning while the correctness of the brown ruling seems obvious today some justices had difficulty agreeing to it.
one reason was the force of legal precedent.
normally judges follow a policy of stare decisis let the decision stand.
the plessy v ferguson decision endorsing segregation see page 290 had stood for over 50 years.
it clearly stated that separate but equal facilities did not violate the fourteenth amendment.
thurgood marshall the naacp lawyer who argued brown spent years laying the groundwork to chip away at jim crow the local laws that required segregated facilities.
marshall had recently won two supreme court decisions in 1950 mclaurin and sweatt see legal sources at right that challenged segregation at graduate schools.
then in 1952 the supreme court agreed to hear the browns case.
the court deliberated for two years deciding how to interpret the fourteenth amendment.
in the end chief justice earl warren carefully sidestepped plessy claiming that segregated schools were not and never could be equal.
on monday may 17 1954 warren read the unanimous decision does segregation of children in public schools.
deprive children of.
equal opportunities.
we believe it does to separate them solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority.
that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.
brown v board of education of topeka linda browns name headed a list of five school desegregation cases heard by the supreme court.

sweatt v painter 1950 required the university of texas to admit an african american student to its previously all white law school.
708 chapter 21 why it mattered the court s decision in brown had an immediate impact on pending rulings.
in a series of cases after brown the supreme court prohibited segregation in housing at public beaches at recreation facilities and in restaurants.
later decisions extended equal access to other groups including women and resident aliens.
the decision encountered fierce resistance however.
it awakened the old battle cry of states rights.
directly following brown some congress members circulated the southern manifesto claiming the right of the states to ignore the ruling.
in taking a stand on a social issue they said the court had taken a step away from simply interpreting legal precedents.
critics charged that the warren court had acted as legislators and even as sociologists.
the brown case strengthened the civil rights movement however and paved the way for the end of jim crow.
the naacp had fought and won the legal battle and had gained prestige and momentum.
americans got the strong message that the federal government now took civil rights seriously.
historical impact three of the parties involved in brown delaware kansas and the district of columbia began to integrate schools in 1954.
topeka county informed the court that 123 black students were already attending formerly all white schools.
even so the supreme court was well aware that its decision would be difficult to enforce.
in a follow up ruling brown ii 1955 the court required that integration take place with all deliberate speed.
to some this meant quickly.
others interpreted deliberate to mean slowly.
only two southern states even began to integrate classrooms in 1954 texas and arkansas opened one and two districts respectively.
by 1960 less than one percent of the south s students attended integrated schools.
many school districts were ordered to use aggressive means to achieve racial balance.
courts spent decades supervising forced busing a practice that often pitted community against community.
still despite the resistance and the practical difficulties of implementation brown stands today as a watershed the single point at which breaking the color barrier officially became a federal priority.

they hoped that this would convince the kennedy administration to enforce the law.
the violence was not long in coming.
at the alabama state line white racists got on bus one carrying chains brass knuckles and pistols.
they brutally beat african american riders and white activists who tried to intervene.

when a new band of freedom riders rode into birmingham policemen pulled them from the bus beat them and drove them into tennessee.
defiantly they returned to the birmingham bus terminal.
their bus driver however feared for his life and refused to transport them.
in protest they occupied the whites only waiting room at the terminal for eighteen hours until a solution was reached.
after an angry phone call from u s attorney general robert kennedy bus company officials convinced the driver to proceed.
the riders set out for montgomery on may 20.
arrival of federal marshals although alabama officials had promised kennedy that the riders would be protected a mob of whites many carrying bats and lead pipes fell upon the riders when they arrived in montgomery.

president kennedy arranged to give the freedom riders direct support.
the justice department sent 400 u s marshals to protect the rid ers on the last part of their journey to jackson mississippi.
in addition the attorney general and the interstate commerce commission banned segregation in all interstate travel facilities including waiting rooms restrooms and lunch counters.

birmingham a city known for its strict enforcement of total segregation in public life also had a reputation for racial violence including 18 bombings from 1957 to 1963.
reverend fred shuttlesworth head of the alabama christian movement for human rights and secretary of the sclc decided something had to be done about birmingham and that it would be the ideal place to test the power of nonviolence.
he invited martin luther king jr and the sclc to help desegregate the city.
on april 3 1963 king flew into birmingham to hold a planning meeting with members of the african american community.
this is the most segregated city in america he said.

civil rights kennedy takes a stand on june 11 1963 the president sent troops to force governor george wallace to honor a court order desegregating the university of alabama.
that evening kennedy asked the nation are we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this is the land of the free except for the negroes.
he demanded that congress pass a civil rights bill.
a tragic event just hours after kennedy s speech highlighted the racial tension in much of the south.
shortly after midnight a sniper murdered medgar evers naacp field secretary and world war ii veteran.
police soon arrested a white supremacist byron de la beckwith but he was released after two trials resulted in hung juries.

714 chapter 21 4 in the summer of 1964 college students volunteered to go to mississippi to help register that states african american voters.
fighting for voting rights i main idea analyzing motives why did civil rights groups organize freedom summer.
meanwhile the right of all african americans to vote remained elusive.
in 1964 core and sncc workers in the south began registering as many african americans as they could to vote.
they hoped their campaign would receive national publicity which would in turn influence congress to pass a voting rights act.
focused in mississippi the project became known as freedom summer.
freedom summer to fortify the project civil rights groups recruited college students and trained them in nonviolent resistance.
thousands of student volunteers mostly white about one third female went into mississippi to help register voters.
for some the job proved deadly.
in june of 1964 three civil rights workers disappeared in neshoba county mississippi.
investigators later learned that klansmen and local police had murdered the men two of whom were white.
through the summer the racial beatings and murders continued along with the burning of businesses homes and churches.
g a new political party african americans needed a voice in the political arena if sweeping change was to occur.
in order to gain a seat in mississippi s all white democratic party sncc organized the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp.
fannie lou hamer the daughter of mississippi sharecroppers would be their voice at the 1964 democratic national convention.
in a televised speech that shocked the convention and viewers nationwide hamer described how she was jailed for registering to vote in 1962 and how police forced other prisoners to beat her.
a personal voice fannie lou hamer the first prisoner began to beat me and i was beat by the first until he was exhausted.
the second prisoner began to beat.
i began to scream and one white man got up and began to beat me in my head and tell me to hush.
all of this on account we want to register to become first class citizens and if the freedom democratic party is not seated now i question america.
quoted in the civil rights movement an eyewitness history pmain idea in response to hamer s speech telegrams and telephone calls poured in to the hev i convention in support of seating the mfdp delegates.
president johnson feared historical8 losing the southern white vote if the democrats sided with the mfdp so his perspective administration pressured civil rights leaders to convince the mfdp to accept a why did young compromise.
the democrats would give 2 of mississippi s 68 seats to the mfdp people m sncc witla a promise to ban discrimination at the 1968 convention.
betraye y ome when hamer learned of the compromise she said we didn t come all this way civil rights lead for no two seats.
the mfdp and supporters in sncc felt that the leaders had ers.
betrayed them.
g civil rights the selma campaign at the start of 1965 the sclc conducted a major voting rights campaign in selma alabama where sncc had been working for two years to register voters.
by the end of 1965 more than 2 000 african americans had been arrested in sclc demonstrations.
after a demonstrator named jimmy lee jackson was shot and killed king announced a protest march from selma to montgomery the state capital.
on march 7 1965 about 600 protesters set out for montgomery.
that night mayhem broke out.
television cameras captured the scene.
the nation watched in horror as police swung whips and clubs through clouds of tear gas.
demonstrators poured into selma by the hundreds.
ten days later president johnson presented congress with a new voting rights act and asked for its swift passage.
on march 21 3 000 marchers again set out for montgomery this time with federal protection.
soon the number grew to an army of 25 000.
voting rights act of 1965 that summer congress finally passed johnson s voting rights act of 1965.
the act eliminated the so called literacy tests that had disqualified many voters.
it also allowed federal examiners to enroll voters who had been denied suffrage by local officials.
in selma the proportion of african americans registered to vote rose from 10 percent in 1964 to 60 percent in 1968.
overall the percentage of registered african american voters in the south tripled.
another step toward ensuring voting rights for african americans had occurred on january 24 1964 when south dakota became the 38th state to ratify the twenty fourth amendment to the u s constitution.
the key clause of the amendment reads the right of citizens of the united states to vote in any primary or other election.
shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or any state by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.
poll taxes were often used to keep poor african americans from voting and five southern states still had such laws on the books in 1964.
by making these laws unconstitutional the twenty fourth amendment guaranteed millions the right to vote.
together the twenty fourth amendment and the voting rights act marked significant federal policy changes.
these actions abolished many of the barriers that had prevented african americas from exercising their constitutionally protected right to vote.
however some felt that the laws did not go far enough.
anger over social and economic inequalities produced by centuries of discrimination led to a series of violent disturbances in the cities of the north.

alice walker the prize winning novelist became aware of the civil rights movement in 1960 when she was 16.
her mother had recently scraped together enough money to purchase a television.
a personal voice alice walker like a good omen for the future the face of dr martin luther king jr was the first black face i saw on our new television screen.
and as in a fairy tale my soul was stirred by the meaning for me of his mission at the time he was being rather ignomin iously dumped into a police van for having led a protest march in alabama and i fell in love with the sober and determined face of the movement.
in search of our mothers gardens the next year walker attended the all black spelman college.
in 1963 walker took part in the march on washington and then traveled to africa to discover her spiritual roots.
after returning home in 1964 she worked on voter registration taught african american history and writing and wrote poetry and fiction.
walker s interest in her heritage was part of a growing trend among african americans in the mid 1960s.
but millions of african americans were still living in poverty.
angry and frustrated over the difficulty in finding jobs and decent housing some participated in riots that broke out between 1964 and 1966.
alice walker during an interview in new yorks central park in august 1970 african americans seek greater equality what civil rights groups had in common in the early 1960s were their calls for a newfound pride in black identity and a commitment to change the social and economic structures that kept people in a life of poverty.
however by 1965 the civil rights 7 j h leading civil rights groups began to drift apart.
new leaders emerged as the movement turned its attention to the north where african americans faced not legal segregation but deeply entrenched and oppressive racial prejudice.
northern segregation the problem facing african americans in the north was de facto segregation segregation that exists by practice and custom.
de facto segregation can be harder to fight than de jure de joor e segregation or segregation by law because eliminating it requires changing people s attitudes rather than repealing laws.
activists in the mid 1960s would find it much more difficult to convince whites to share economic and social power with african americans than to convince them to share lunch counters and bus seats.
de facto segregation intensified after african americans migrated to northern cities during and after world war ii.
this began a white flight in which great numbers of whites moved out of the cities to the nearby suburbs.
by the mid 1960s most urban african americans lived in decaying slums paying rent to landlords who didn t comply with housing and health ordinances.
the schools for african american children deteriorated along with their neighborhoods.
unemployment rates were more than twice as high as those among whites.
in addition many blacks were angry at the sometimes brutal treatment they received from the mostly white police forces in their communities.
in 1966 king spearheaded a campaign in chicago to end de facto segregation there and create an open city.
on july 10 he led about 30 000 african americans in a march on city hall.
in late july when king led demonstrators through a chicago neighborhood angry whites threw rocks and bottles.
on august 5 hostile whites stoned king as he led 600 marchers.
king left chicago without accomplishing what he wanted yet pledging to return.
main idea comparing how were civil rights problems in northern cities similar to those in the south.
urban violence erupts in the mid 1960s clashes between white authority and black civilians spread like wildfire.
in new york city in july 1964 an encounter between white police and african american teenagers ended in the death of a 15 year old student.
this sparked a race riot in central harlem.
on august 11 1965 only five days after president johnson signed the voting 718 chapter 21 main idea analyzing causes what were some of the causes of urban rioting in the 1960s.
background see islam on page 9 main idea synthesizing why did some americans find malcolm xs views alarming.
rights act into law one of the worst race riots in the nation s history raged through the streets of watts a predominantly african american neighborhood in los angeles.
thirty four people were killed and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property was destroyed.
the next year 1966 saw even more racial disturbances and in 1967 alone riots and violent clashes took place in more than 100 cities.
the african american rage baffled many whites.
why would blacks turn to violence after winning so many victories in the south.
they wondered.
some realized that what african americans wanted and needed was economic equality of opportunity in jobs housing and education.
even before the riots in 1964 president johnson had announced his war on poverty a program to help impoverished americans.
but the flow of money needed to fund johnson s great society was soon redirected to fund the war in vietnam.
in 1967 dr king proclaimed the great society has been shot down on the battlefields of vietnam.
new leaders voice discontent the anger that sent rioters into the streets stemmed in part from african american leaders who urged their followers to take complete control of their communities livelihoods and culture.
one such leader malcolm x declared to a harlem audience if you think we are here to tell you to love the white man you have come to the wrong place.
african american solidarity malcolm x born malcolm little went to jail at age 20 for burglary.
while in prison he studied the teachings of elijah muhammad the head of the nation of islam or the black muslims.
malcolm changed his name to malcolm x dropping what he called his slave name and after his release from prison in 1952 became an islamic minister.
as he gained a following the brilliant thinker and engaging speaker openly preached elijah muhammad s views that whites were the cause of the black condition and that blacks should separate from white society.
malcolm s message appealed to many african americans and their growing racial pride.
at a new york press conference in march 1964 he also advocated armed self defense.
va y playr malcolm x 1925 1965 malcolm xs early life left him alienated from white society.
his father was allegedly killed by white racists and his mother had an emotional collapse leaving malcolm and his siblings in the care of the state.
at the end of eighth grade malcolm quit school and was later jailed for criminal behavior.
in 1946 while in prison malcolm joined the nation of islam.
he developed a philosophy of black superiority and separatism from whites.
in the later years of his life he urged african americans to identify with africa and to work with world organizations and even progressive whites to attain equality.
although silenced by gunmen malcolm x is a continuing inspiration for many americans.
a personal voice malcolm x concerning nonviolence it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks.
it is legal and lawful to own a shotgun or a rifle.
we believe in obeying the law.
t he time has come for the american negro to fight back in self defense whenever and wherever he is being unjustly and unlawfully attacked.
quoted in eyewitness the negro in american history the press gave a great deal of publicity to malcolm x because his controversial statements made dramatic news stories.
this had two effects.
first his call for armed self defense frightened most whites and many moderate african americans.
second reports of the attention malcolm received awakened resentment in some other members of the nation of islam.
civil rights ballots or bullets.
in march 1964 malcolm broke with elijah muhammad over differences in strategy and doctrine and formed another muslim organization.
one month later he embarked on a pilgrimage to mecca in saudi arabia a trip required of followers of orthodox islam.
in mecca he learned that orthodox islam preached racial equality and he worshiped alongside people from many countries.
wrote malcolm i have prayed.
with fellow muslims whose eyes were the bluest of blue whose hair was the blondest of blond and whose skin was the whitest of white.
when he returned to the united states his attitude toward whites had changed radically.
he explained his new slogan ballots or bullets to a follower well if you and i don t use the ballot we re going to be forced to use the bullet.
so let us try the ballot.
because of his split with the black muslims malcolm believed his life might be in danger.
no one can get out without trouble he confided.
on february 21 1965 while giving a speech in harlem the 39 year old malcolm x was shot and killed.
black power in early june of 1966 tensions that had been building between sncc and the other civil rights groups finally erupted in mississippi.
here james meredith the man who had integrated the university of mississippi set out on a 225 mile walk against fear.
meredith planned to walk all the way from the tennessee border to jackson but he was shot by a white racist and was too injured to continue.
martin luther king jr of the sclc floyd mckissick of core and stokely carmichael of sncc decided to lead their followers in a march to finish what meredith had started.
but it soon became apparent that sncc and core members were quite militant as they began to shout slogans similar to those of the black separatists who had followed malcolm x.
when king tried to rally the marchers with the refrain of we shall overcome many sncc workers bitter over the violence they d suffered during freedom summer began singing we shall overrun.
police in greenwood mississippi arrested carmichael for setting up a tent on the grounds of an all black high school.
when carmichael showed up at a rally later his face swollen from a beating he electrified the crowd.
stokely carmichael 1968.
the slogan black power became the battle cry of militant civil rights activists.
a personal voice stokely carmichael this is the twenty seventh time i have been arrested and i aint going to jail no more.
we been saying freedom for six years and we aint got nothin.
what were gonna start saying now is black power.
quoted in the civil rights movement an eyewitness history black power carmichael said was a call for black people to begin to define their own goals and to lead their own organizations king urged him to stop using the phrase because he believed it would provoke african americans to violence and antagonize whites.
carmichael refused and urged sncc to stop recruiting whites and to focus on developing african american pride.
black panthers later that year another development demonstrated the growing radicalism of some segments of the african american community.
in oakland california in october 1966 huey newton and bobby seale founded a political party known as the black panthers to fight police brutality in the ghetto.
the party advocated self sufficiency for african american communities as well as full employment and decent housing.
members maintained that african americans should be exempt from military service because an unfair number of black youths had been drafted to serve in vietnam.
j main idea analyzing motives why did some leaders of sclc disagree with sncc tactics.
720 1 main idea making inferences jy why was the public reaction to the black panthers mixed.
vocabulary polarization separation into opposite camps dressed in black leather jackets black berets and sunglasses the panthers preached self defense and sold copies of the writings of mao zedong leader of the inese communist revolution.
several police shootouts occurred between the panthers and police and the fbi conducted numerous investigations of group members sometimes using illegal tactics.
even so many of the panthers activities the establishment of daycare centers free breakfast programs free medical clinics assis tance to the homeless and other services won support in the ghettos.
jey 1968 a turning point in civil rights martin luther king jr objected to the black power movement.
he believed that preaching violence could only end in grief.
king was planning to lead a poor people s march on washington d c.
however this time the people would have to march without him.
kings death dr king seemed to sense that death was near.
on april 3 1968 he addressed a crowd in memphis where he had gone to support the city s striking garbage workers.
i may not get there with you but we as a people will get to the promised land.
he added i m not fearing any man.
mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord.
the next day as king stood on his hotel balcony james earl ray thrust a high powered rifle out of a window and squeezed the trigger.
king crumpled to the floor.
reactions to kings death the night king died robert f kennedy was campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination.
fearful that kings death would spark riots kennedy s advisers told him to cancel his appearance in an african american neighborhood in indianapolis.
kennedy attended anyway making a plea for nonviolence.
a personal voice robert f kennedy for those of you who are black considering the evidence that there were white people who were responsible you can be filled with bitterness with hatred and a desire for revenge.
we can move in that direction as a country in great polarization black people amongst black white people amongst white filled with hatred toward one another.
or we can make an effort as martin luther king did to understand and comprehend and to replace that violence that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to understand with compassion and love.
a eulogy for dr martin luther king jr despite kennedy s plea rage over king s death led to the worst urban rioting in united states history.
over 100 cities exploded in flames.
the hardest hit cities included baltimore chicago kansas city and washington d c then in june 1968 robert kennedy himself was assassinated by a jordanian immigrant who was angry over kennedy s support of israel.
the poor people s campaign went ahead but without king s eloquence and leadership it failed to clearly express its goals and ended in disaster.
the sclc and its role in the civil rights movement declined.
civil rights legacy of the civil rights movement on march 1 1968 the kerner commission which president johnson had appointed to study the causes of urban violence issued its 200 000 word report.
in it the panel named one main cause white racism.
said the report this is our basic conclusion our nation is moving toward two societies one black one white separate and unequal.
the report called for the nation to create new jobs construct new housing and end de facto segregation in order to wipe out the destructive ghetto environment.
however the johnson administration ignored many of the recommendations because of white opposition to such sweeping changes.
so what had the civil rights movement accomplished.
historical spotlight shirley chisholm african american women such as shirley chisholm exemplified the advances won in the civil rights movement.
in 1968 chisholm became the first african american woman in the united states house of representatives.
in the mid 1960s chisholm served in the new york state assembly representing a district in new york city.
while there she supported programs to establish public day care centers and provide unemployment insurance to domestic workers.
in 1972 chisholm gained national prominence by running for the democratic presidential nomination.
despite the fact that she never won more than 10 of the vote in the primaries she controlled 152 delegates at the democratic convention in miami.
civil rights gains the civil rights movement ended de jure segregation by bringing about legal protection for the civil rights of all americans.
congress passed the most important civil rights legislation since reconstruction including the civil rights act of 1968 which ended discrimination in housing.
after school segregation ended the numbers of african americans who finished high school and who went to college increased significantly.
this in turn led to better jobs and business opportunities.
another accomplishment of the civil rights movement was to give african americans greater pride in their racial identity.
many african americans adopted african influenced styles and proudly displayed symbols of african history and culture.
college students demanded new black studies programs so they could study african american history and literature.
in the entertainment world the color bar was lowered as african americans began to appear more frequently in movies and on television shows and commercials.
in addition african americans made substantial political gains.
by 1970 an estimated two thirds of eligible african americans were registered to vote and a significant increase in african american elected officials resulted.
the number of african americans holding elected office grew from fewer than 100 in 1965 to more than 7 000 in 1992.
many civil rights activists went on to become political leaders among them reverend jesse jackson who sought the democratic nomination for president in 1984 and 1988 vernon jordan who led voter registration drives that enrolled about 2 million african americans and andrew young who has served as un ambassador and atlanta s mayor.
unfinished work the civil rights movement was successful in changing many discriminatory laws.
yet as the 1960s turned to the 1970s the challenges for the movement changed.
the issues it confronted housing and job discrimination educational inequality poverty and racism involved the difficult task of changing people s attitudes and behavior.
some of the proposed solutions such as more tax monies spent in the inner cities and the forced busing of schoolchildren angered some whites who resisted further changes.
public support for the civil rights movement declined because some whites were frightened by the urban riots and the black panthers.
by 1990 the trend of whites fleeing the cities for the suburbs had reversed much of the progress toward school main idea evaluating jy what were some accomplishments of the civil rights movement.
722 chapter 21 1 2008 changes in poverty and education vocabulary quota requirement that a certain number of positions are filled by minorities integration.
in 1996 1997 28 per cent of blacks in the south and 50 percent of blacks in the northeast were attending schools with fewer than 10 percent whites.
lack of jobs also remained a serious problem for african americans who had a poverty rate three times that of whites.
to help equalize education and job opportunities the government in the 1960s began to promote affirmative action.
affirmative action programs involve making special efforts to hire or enroll groups that have suffered discrimination.
many colleges and almost all companies that do business with the federal government adopted such programs.
but in the late 1970s some people began to criticize affirmative action programs as reverse discrimination that set minority hiring or enrollment quotas and deprived whites of opportunities.
in the 1980s republican administrations eased affirmative action requirements for some government contractors.
the fate of affirmative action is still to be decided.
today african americans and whites interact in ways that could have only been imagined before the civil rights movement.
in many respects dr king s dream has been realized yet much remains to be done.

civil rights tracing themes civil rights thomas jefferson asserted in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal and are endowed with the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
with these words a new nation was founded on the principle that citizens have certain fundamental civil rights.
these include the right to vote the right to enjoy freedom of speech and religion and others.
for more than 200 years the united states has stood as a worldwide example of a country committed to securing the rights of its people.
however throughout the nation s history some americans have had to struggle to obtain even the most basic civil rights.
laws or customs prevented certain people from voting freely from speaking their minds on political issues and from living and going where they wish.
over time many of these barriers have been torn down.
in recent years the united states has tried to promote human rights in other countries through its foreign policy.
even as it does so the united states continues to struggle to fulfill for all americans the lofty ideals established by the nation s founders.
bill of rights during the constitutional convention the question of a bill of rights arose but none was included.
