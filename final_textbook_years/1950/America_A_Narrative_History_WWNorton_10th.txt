1310 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 the new frontier in his 1960 speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination john f kennedy showcased the muscular language that would characterize his rontier campaign and his presidency we stand today on the edge of a new f the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats kennedy and his staff fastened upon the frontier metaphor as the label for their proposed domestic program because they believed that americans had always been adventurers eager to conquer and exploit new frontiers.
kennedy promised that if elected he would get the country moving again and be a more aggressive cold warrior than dwight eisenhower.
kennedy versus nixon in 1960 the presidential election featured two c andidates vice president richard m nixon and massachusetts senator john f kennedy jfk of similar ages but contrasting personalities and backgrounds.
as eisenhowers partner over successive terms nixon was assured the republican nomination in 1960 although president eisenhower himself had grave misgivings.
when asked by reporters to name a single major accomplishment of his vice president ike replied if you give me a week i might think of one the presidents snide comment undercut nixons claim of significant executive experience as vice president.
the two republicans had long had a testy relationship.
nixon once called his presidential boss a goddamned old fool while eisenhower dismissed his fiercely ambitious vice president as a man who couldnt think of anything but politics on more than one occasion eisenhower clumsily sought to dump his vice president in favor of other republicans whom he respected.
a native of california the forty seven year old nixon had come to washington after the second world war eager to reverse the tide of new deal liberalism.
his visibility among republicans benefited from his leadership of the anti communist hearings in congress during the mccarthy hysteria.
all his life nixon had clawed and struggled to reach the top.
now he had the presidency within his grasp.
but nixon graceless awkward and stiff proved to be one of the most complicated and most interesting political figures in american history.
kennedy told an aide that nixon doesnt know who he is.
so every time he makes a speech he has to decide which nixon he is and that will be very exhausting forty three year old john kennedy had not distinguished himself in the house or the senate.
more pragmatic than principled he was handsome articulate and blessed with energy and wit.
friends said his charisma was magical.
the new frontier 1311 the kennedy nixon debates nixons decision to debate his less prominent opponent on television backfired.
one of lifes great pleasures his b rother in law said was spending time with that man kennedy lit up a room with his inviting smile athletic presence and infectious zest for life.
coolly analytical and dangerously s elf absorbed he was a contradictory and elusive personality.
even his wife jacqueline was unsure about him.
he may be a fine politician she told a dinner guest but do we know if hes a fine person this much is certain kennedy had a bright agile mind a quick wit a harvard education a record of heroism in the second world war a rich and powerful roman catholic family and a beautiful and accomplished young wife.
in the words of a southern senator kennedy combined the best qualities of elvis presley and franklin d roosevelt a combination that played well in the first ever televised presidential debate as he began the process of seducing a nation.
some 70 million people tuned in to the debate and saw an obviously uncomfortable nixon perspiring heavily and looking pale.
by contrast kennedy looked 1312 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 tanned and confident.
he offered crisp answers that made him appear to be qualified for the nations highest office.
the morning after the debate his approval ratings skyrocketed.
kennedys political rise owed much to the public relations campaign engineered by his father joseph a self made tycoon with a genius for promotion.
in joseph kennedys view image was much more important than substance.
cant you get it into your head he told john that its not important what you really are.
the only important thing is what people think you are he assured family and friends that he would sell jack like soap flakes to j ump start his political career.
the elder kennedy hired talented writers to produce his sons two books paid a publisher to print them purchased tens of thousands of copies to make them best sellers and helped engineer his sons elections to the house and senate.
john kennedy was a relentless presidential campaigner traveling 65 000 miles visiting t wenty five states and making more than 350 speeches including an address to protestant ministers in texas in which he neutralized concerns about his being a roman catholic by stressing that the pope in rome would never tell the president should he be a catholic how to act in speech after speech kennedy said he was tired of waking up and reading about what soviet and cuban leaders were doing.
instead he wanted to read about what the u s president was doing to combat communism.
he wanted to develop a foreign policy that would break out of the confining assumptions of the cold war but as yet had no clear plan for doing so.
kennedy also worked to increase the registration of african american voters across the nation.
his response to the growing civil rights movement was ambivalent however.
like eisenhower kennedy believed racial unrest needed to be handled with caution rather than boldness.
to him racial justice was less an urgent moral crusade than a potential barrier to his election.
he understood the injustices of bigotry and segregation but he needed the votes of southern whites to win the presidency.
during the campaign kennedy won the hearts of many black voters by helping to get martin luther king jr out of a georgia jail after king had been unjustly convicted of trespassing in an a ll white restaurant.
ive got a suitcase of votes said kings appreciative father and im going to take them to mr kennedy and dump them in his lap on the sunday before election day a million leaflets describing kennedys effort to release king from prison were distributed in african american churches across the nation.
in november kennedy and his running mate powerful texas senator lyndon b johnson won one of the closest presidential elections in history.

m29 1 proof how did john f kennedy win the election in spite of winning fewer states first than richard m nixon.
margin was only 118 574 votes out of more than 68 million cast.
nixon won more states than kennedy but the democrat captured 70 percent of the black vote which proved decisive in at least three key states.
a vigorous new administration john f kennedy was the youngest person and first roman catholic elected president.
he had promised to get america moving again and he was eager to begin that effort.
at times he seemed s elf assured to the point of cockiness.
sure its a big job he told a reporter.
but i dont know anybody who can do it any better than i can that he had been elected by the narrowest of margins and had no working majority in congress did not faze him.
in his mind he was destined to be a great president.
1314 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 kennedys inauguration ceremony on a cold sunny blustery january day introduced the nation to his distinctive elegance and flair.
in his speech the new president focused almost entirely on foreign affairs.
he accepted the responsibility of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger and promised to keep america strong while seeking to reduce friction with the soviet union let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate kennedy claimed that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace and he dazzled listeners with uplifting words let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.
and so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country such steely optimism heralded a presidency of fresh promise and new beginnings.
yet much of the glamour surrounding kennedy was cosmetic.
despite his athletic interests and robust appearance he suffered from serious medical problems addisons disease a withering of the adrenal glands venereal disease chronic back pain resulting from a birth defect and fierce fevers.
he took powerful prescription medicines or injections daily sometimes hourly to manage a degenerative bone disease to deal with anxiety to help him sleep and to control his allergies.
like franklin d roosevelt kennedy and his associates hid his physical ailments as well as his often reckless sexual dalliances in the white house with a galaxy of women including actress marilyn monroe and judith campbell exner the girlfriend of a chicago mob boss.
when kennedy met british prime minister harold macmillan he told him that i dont know about you harold but if i dont have a woman every three days i get these terrible headaches.
how about you kennedy was determined to bring together the best and the brightest minds to fashion a vigorous new era in political achievement.
he represented a new generation of political figures who had fought in the second world war.
known as the pragmatic generation they were decisive and bold and prized the manly virtues especially courage and conviction in the face of the cold war and the threat of nuclear conflict.
the new secretary of defense robert mcnamara the whiz kid president of ford motor company displayed the cult of activism surrounding the kennedy administration when he stressed that it was better to have a wrong decision made than no decision at all with at times an almost dismissive arrogance kennedy frequently complained about academics who spent all their time criticizing statesmen without exercising responsibility themselves.
in the white house he observed he and others could not afford to be professorial.
the oval office was where decisions have to be made the new frontier 1315 jack and jackie young dashing wealthy and culturally sophisticated the kennedys were instant celebrities.
women imitated the first ladys famous hairdo while men craved jfks effortless cool and youthful energy.
yet kennedy had a difficult time launching his new frontier domestic program.
his narrow election victory gave him no mandate and he faced a congressional roadblock in the form of conservative southern democrats who joined with republicans to oppose his efforts to increase federal aid to education provide medical insurance for the aged and create a c abinet level department of urban affairs and housing to address i nner city poverty.
in his first year kennedy submitted 355 legislative requests congress approved only half of them.
he suffered so many defeats that he complained he couldnt get a mothers day resolution through the goddamned congress legislators did approve increasing the minimum wage a housing act that earmarked nearly 5 billion for new public housing projects in p overty stricken inner city areas the peace corps created in 1961 to recruit idealistic young volunteers who would provide educational and technical service abroad and the alliance for progress a financial assistance program to latin american countries intended to blunt the appeal of communism in those nations.
but the presidents efforts to provide more assistance for educational programs and medical care for the elderly never got out of committees.
perhaps kennedys greatest legislative success was in convincing congress to commit 40 billion to put an american on the moon within ten years.
1316 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 it would happen in 1969.
what spurred the start of the program was the news that the soviets had launched the first manned space flight in 1961.
former president eisenhower said that kennedys race to the moon for national prestige is nuts but vice president lyndon johnson assured the president that dramatic accomplishments in space are being increasingly identified as a major indicator of world leadership kennedy explained that he had decided to shoot for the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills civil rights the most important developments in domestic life during the sixties occurred in civil rights.
throughout the south racial segregation remained firmly in place.
signs outside public restrooms distinguished between whites and colored restaurants declared colored not allowed or colored served only in rear stores prohibited african americans from trying on clothes before buying them.
despite the brown v board of education ruling in 1954 many public schools across the south remained segregated and unequal in quality.
like franklin d roosevelt president kennedy celebrated racial equality but did little to promote it until forced to do so.
his caution reflected his narrow election margin in 1960.
he was reluctant to challenge conservative southern democrats on the explosive issue of segregation.
both he and his brother robert bobby the attorney general and his closest adviser had to be dragged into actively supporting the civil rights movement.
after appointing harris wofford a white law professor and experienced campaigner for racial equality as the special presidential assistant for civil rights president kennedy told him to make substantial headway against.
the nonsense of racial discrimination but to do so with minimum civil rights legislation and maximum executive action such actions led martin luther king jr to comment that kennedy had great political skill but no moral passion about the need to end racial injustice.
catastrophe in cuba kennedys performance in foreign relations was spectacularly mixed.
although he had told a reporter that he wanted to break out of the confines of the cold war he quickly found himself reinforcing its confining assumptions.
while still a senator kennedy had blasted president eisenhower for not being tough enough with the soviets and for allowing fidel castro and his communist followers to take over cuba just ninety miles from the southern tip of florida.
soon after his inauguration kennedy learned that a secret cia operation which had been approved by eisenhower was training 1 500 a nti castro cubans in guatemala texas and florida to invade their homeland in hopes the new frontier 1317 walk of shame captured anti castro cubans after the failed invasion at the bay of pigs.
of triggering a mass uprising against castro.
u s military leaders assured kennedy that the invasion plan operation trinidad was feasible cia analysts predicted that news of the invasion would inspire anti castro cubans to rebel against their communist dictator.
in reality the covert operation had little chance of succeeding.
its assumptions were flawed its strategy faulty its tactics bungled and the forces and weapons used inadequate.
kennedy seemed to realize it might fail when he callously said if we have to get rid of those 800 men actually 1 400 it is much better to dump them in cuba than in the united states when the ragtag force of right wing cubans transported on american ships landed before dawn at the bay of pigs on cubas south shore on april 17 1961 castros forces were waiting for them.
kennedy panicked when he realized the operation was failing and refused desperate pleas from the rebels for promised support from u s warplanes.
general lyman lemnitzer chair of the joint chiefs of staff said that kennedys pulling out the rug on the cuban invaders was.
absolutely reprehensible almost criminal some 1 200 rebels were captured the rest were killed.
kennedy later paid 53 million to ransom the captured rebels.
1318 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 the clumsy effort to overthrow the cuban government was a complete failure.
it humiliated kennedy and elevated castro in the eyes of the world.
to his credit kennedy admitted that the bay of pigs invasion was a colossal mistake only later did he learn that the planners of the operation had assumed that he would commit american forces once the invasion effort had failed.
he said that after the initial disastrous reports from the bay of pigs we all looked at each other and asked how could we have been so stupid after the failed invasion kennedy never again trusted his trigger happy military and intelligence leaders.
the vienna summit just weeks after the bay of pigs invasion kennedy met soviet premier nikita khrushchev at a summit conference in vienna austria.
khrushchev badgered and bullied the young president bragged about the superiority of communism and threatened to take control of all of berlin the divided city inside communist east germany.
a stunned kennedy told the british prime minister that khrushchev was much more of a barbarian than he had expected.
he confided to a journalist that the summit was awful.
worst thing of my life.
he rolled right over m e he thinks im a f ool he thinks im weak when asked what he planned to do next kennedy replied i have to confront them the soviets someplace to show that were tough the first thing kennedy did upon returning to the white house was to request an estimate of how many americans might be killed in a nuclear war with the soviet union.
the answer was chilling 70 million.
kennedy desperate not to appear weak in the face of khrushchevs aggressive actions in germany asked congress for additional spending on defense and called up 156 000 members of the army reserve and national guard to protect west berlin.
he also ordered an armed military convoy to travel from west germany across east germany to west berlin to show the soviets that he would protect the city with force.
the soviets responded on august 13 1961.
they stopped all traffic between east and west berlin and began erecting the t wenty seven mile long berlin wall to separate east berlin from west berlin where thousands of refugees were fleeing communism each week many of them the best and the brightest engineers doctors scientists and writers.
for the united states the wall became a powerful propaganda weapon in the cold war.
as kennedy said freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put up a wall to keep our people in the berlin wall demonstrated the soviets willingness to challenge american resolve in europe.
in response kennedy and secretary of defense robert mcnamara embarked upon the most intensive arms race in history increasing the number of nuclear missiles fivefold adding 300 000 men to the armed the new frontier 1319 severed ties two west berliners climb the newly constructed berlin wall to talk with a family member at an open window.
forces and creating the u s special forces green berets an elite group of commandos who specialized in guerrilla warfare and could provide a more flexible response than nuclear weapons to hot spots around the world.
the cuban missile crisis soon after taking office president kennedy predicted that we shall have to test anew whether a nation such as ours can endure it was an accurate prediction.
in the fall of 1962 nikita khrushchev and the soviets decided to challenge kennedy again.
to protect communist cuba from another american backed invasion and to show critics at home that he was not afraid of the americans khrushchev approved the secret installation of soviet missiles on the island nation.
the soviets felt they were justified in doing so because kennedy after the bay of pigs invasion had ordered that u s missiles with nuclear warheads be installed in turkey along the soviet border.
on october 16 1962 kennedy learned that photos taken two days earlier by u s spy planes showed some forty soviet missile sites and twenty five jet bombers in cuba.
we have some big trouble he alerted his brother bobby by phone.
over the next thirteen days perhaps the most dangerous two weeks in history kennedy and the national security council nsc considered several 1320 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 possible responses ranging from doing nothing to invading cuba.
the world held its breath as the nsc discussed the unthinkable possibility of a nuclear exchange with the soviets.
the commander of the u s marines at one point reminded the group that the missiles in cuba were not a true strategic threat the soviet union he said has a hell of a lot better way to attack us than to attack us from cuba secretary of defense robert mcnamara agreed noting that it makes no difference whether you are killed by a missile fired from the soviet union or from cuba yet the group insisted that the missiles be removed for symbolic reasons.
eventually the nsc fastened on two options 1 a surgical air strike on the missiles followed if necessary by an invasion or 2 a naval blockade of cuba in which u s warships would stop soviet vessels and search them for missiles.
although most of the military advisers supported the first option kennedy chose the blockade prompting a general to shout youre screwed.
youre screwed kennedy however had been burned by overconfident military advisers during the bay of pigs operation and was not going to let it happen again.
he also feared that an american attack on cuba would give the soviets an excuse to take control of west berlin.
on monday night october 22 a grim kennedy delivered a televised speech of the highest national urgency to the world announcing that the u s navy was establishing a quarantine of cuba to prevent soviet ships from delivering more weapons to the island nation.
kennedy added that he had directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventuality he closed by urging the soviets to move the world back from the abyss of destruction the world watched as tensions grew and some 200 000 u s soldiers made their way to southern florida.
khrushchev replied that soviet ships would ignore the quarantine and accused kennedy of an act of aggression propelling humankind into the abyss of a world nuclear missile war despite such rhetoric however on wednesday october 24 five soviet ships presumably with more missiles aboard stopped well short of the quarantine line.
two days later khrushchev knowing that the united states still enjoyed a 5 to 1 advantage in nuclear weapons offered a deal.
the soviets would agree to remove the missiles already in cuba in return for a public pledge by the united states never to invade c uba and a secret agreement to remove u s missiles from turkey.
kennedy agreed.
secretary of state dean rusk stressed to a newscaster remember when you report this say that eyeball to eyeball they the soviets blinked first the air force chief of staff general curtis lemay the new frontier 1321 who had urged an air attack on cuba called the deal the greatest defeat in our history in the aftermath of the cuban missile crisis tensions between the united states and the soviet union subsided in part because of several symbolic steps an agreement to sell the soviet union surplus american wheat the installation of a hotline telephone between washington and moscow to provide instant contact between the heads of government and the removal of u s missiles from turkey italy and britain.
peace for all time going to the edge of nuclear war led kennedy and others in the administration to soften their cold war rhetoric and pursue other ways to reduce the threat of atomic warfare.
as kennedy told his advisers it is insane that two men sitting on opposite sides of the world should be able to decide to bring an end to civilization he told an audience at american university on june 10 1963 that his new goal was not merely peace in our time but peace for all time which would require reducing the risk of nuclear warfare.
we all inhabit this small planet he explained.
we all breathe the same air what kind of peace did he seek.
not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave.
i am talking about.
the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope the cuban missile crisis photographs taken from a u s surveillance plane on october 14 1962 revealed both soviet missile launchers and missile shelters near san cristbal cuba.
1322 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 and build a better life for their c hildren not merely peace for americans but peace for all men and women not merely peace in our time but peace for all time soon after delivering this speech the president began discussions with soviet and british leaders to reduce the risk of nuclear war.
the discussions resulted in the test ban treaty ratified in september 1963 which banned the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere.
it was the first joint agreement of the cold war and an important move toward improved relations with the soviet union.
as kennedy put it using an ancient chinese proverb a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step vietnam as tensions with the soviet union eased a new crisis was growing in southeast asia where events were moving toward what would eventually become the greatest american f oreign policy calamity of the century.
throughout the fifties u s officials increasingly came to view the preservation of south vietnam as the critical test of american willpower in the cold war.
in 1956 then senator john f kennedy described south vietnam as the cornerstone of the free world in southeast asia yet the situation in south vietnam had worsened under the corrupt leadership of premier ngo dinh diem and his family.
diem had backed away from promised social and economic reforms and his repressive tactics directed not only against communists but also against the buddhist majority and other critics played into the hands of his enemies.
president eisenhower had provided over 1 billion in aid to diems government during the late fifties.
kennedy sent even more weapons money and some 16 000 military advisers to south vietnam to help shore up the government.
they were called advisers to avoid the impression that u s soldiers were doing the fighting.
in the countryside of south vietnam the national liberation front nlf a left wing nationalist movement backed by communist vietnam had launched a violent insurgency in which guerrilla fighters known as the viet cong vc were winning the fight against the south vietnamese government.
american military advisers began relocating vietnamese peasants to strategic hamlets new villages ringed by barbed wire where the vc could not receive assistance.
by the fall of 1963 kennedy agreed with his top advisers that diem was out of touch with his people and had to be removed in large part because he refused to follow american orders.
on november 1 vietnamese generals with the approval of u s officials took control of the saigon government.
they then took a step that kennedy had neither intended nor expected they murdered diem and his brother.
the rebel generals however soon fell to fighting the new frontier 1323 one another leaving vietnam even more vulnerable to the communist insurgency.
thereafter unstable south vietnam essentially became an american colony.
the united states put the generals in power gave the orders and provided massive financial support much of which was diverted into the hands of corrupt politicians.
by september 1963 kennedy had developed doubts about the ability of the united states to defend the south vietnamese.
in the final analysis he told aides its their war.
theyre the ones who have to win it or lose it.
we can help them as advisers but they have to win it yet only a week later in a televised interview kennedy reiterated the domino theory endorsed by presidents truman and eisenhower saying that if south vietnam fell to communism the rest of southeast asia would soon follow.
he stressed that we should stay in south vietnam.
we should use our influence in as effective a way as we can but we should not withdraw kennedys assassination what kennedy would have done in vietnam has remained a matter of endless discussion because on november 22 1963 while riding in an open car through dallas texas he was shot and killed by lee harvey oswald a twenty four year old ex marine turned communist.
oswald who had lived for a time in the soviet union idolized fidel castro and hated the united states and its capitalist system.
as he fled the scene after shooting kennedy he also shot and killed a dallas policeman.
debate still swirls about whether oswald acted alone or as part of a conspiracy because he did not live long enough to tell his story.
as he was being transported to a court hearing jack ruby a dallas nightclub owner distraught over kennedys death shot and killed the handcuffed oswald as a nationwide television audience watched.
kennedys shocking assassination and heartrending funeral enshrined the president in the public imagination as a martyred leader cut down in the prime of his life.
he came to have a stronger reputation after his death than he enjoyed in life.
that debonair touch that shock of chestnut hair that beguiling grin that shattering understatement these are what we shall remember wrote newspaper columnist mary mcgrory.
kennedys drama filled thousand day presidency had flamed up and out like a comet hitting the earths atmosphere.
americans wept in the streets and the world was on edge as the wounded nation buried its fallen president.
roy wilkins a prominent civil rights leader noted that the bullet that killed kennedy paralyzed the civil rights movement as the world welcomed a new and very different president lyndon johnson.
1324 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 president shot dead commuters react to the news of president kennedys assassination on november 22 1963.
civil rights after the montgomery bus boycott of 1955 1956 martin luther king jr s philosophy of militant nonviolence stirred others to challenge the deeply entrenched patterns of racial segregation in the south.
during the sixties king became the face and heart of the civil rights movement.
his goal was integration and equality and he was an uplifting example of fortitude and dignity in confronting brutality and oppression.
by nature he was inspirational and courageous with an astonishing capacity for forgiveness and a deep understanding of the dynamics of political power and social change.
yet he was also immensely complicated and contradictory even hypocritical as the fbi discovered by subjecting him to relentless electronic surveillance and even blackmail.
king was neither a genius nor a saint but his shortcomings pale into insignificance when compared to his achievements.
he was one of the worlds most inspiring examples of courage conviction and dignity in the face of often violent prejudice and persecution.
with the help of those he led and inspired civil rights 1325 king changed the trajectory of american history for the better.
alas he did not live to see the promised land made possible by his actions.
sit ins the civil rights movement gained momentum when four brave african american college students sat down and ordered coffee and doughnuts at an all white woolworths lunch counter in greensboro north carolina on february 1 1960.
the clerk refused to serve them explaining that blacks had to eat standing up or take their food outside.
the greensboro four as the students came to be called waited f orty five minutes and then returned the next day with two dozen more students.
as they sat for hours fruitlessly waiting to be served some read bibles others read henry david thoreaus famous essay on civil disobedience.
they returned every day for a week patiently tolerating being jeered at jostled and spat upon by white hooligans.
within two months similar sit ins involving 50 000 blacks and whites men and women young and old had occurred in more than 100 cities.
black comedian dick gregory participated in several s it ins at w hites only restaurants.
when the managers told him we dont serve negroes he replied no problem i dont eat negroes some 3 600 people were arrested nationwide but the s it ins worked.
by the end of july 1960 officials in greensboro lifted the whites only policy.
the civil rights movement had found an effective new nonviolent tactic against segregation.
in april 1960 some 200 student activists black and white converged in raleigh north carolina to form the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc pronounced snick.
the goal of what they called the movement was to intensify the effort to dismantle segregation.
sncc expanded the sit ins to include kneel ins at all white churches and wade ins at segregated public swimming pools.
in many communities demonstrators were pelted with rocks burned with cigarettes and even killed by white racists.
as a florida hog farmer named holstead hoss manucy told a journalist i aint got no bad habits.
dont smoke.
my only bad habit is fightin niggahs freedom rides in 1961 civil rights leaders decided to focus on integrating public transportation buses and trains.
their larger goal was to force the kennedy administration to engage the cause of civil rights in the south.
on may 4 the new york based congress of racial equality core led by james farmer decided to put the civil rights movement on wheels when a courageous group of eighteen black and white freedom riders as they were 1326 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 civil rights and its peaceful warriors the greensboro four listed from left joseph mcneil franklin mccain billy smith and clarence henderson await service on day two of their sit in at the woolworths in greensboro north carolina.
called boarded two public buses traveling from washington d c through the lower south to new orleans.
they wanted to test a federal court ruling that banned racial segregation on buses and trains and in terminals.
on may 14 a mob of white racists in rural alabama many of them members of the ku klux klan surrounded the greyhound bus carrying the freedom riders after throwing a firebomb into the bus the klan members barricaded its door.
burn them alive one of them yelled.
fry the damned niggers the riders were able to escape only to be battered with metal pipes chains and clubs.
a few hours later freedom riders on a second bus were beaten after entering whites only waiting rooms at the bus terminal in birmingham alabama.
the police as it turned out had encouraged the beatings.
alabamas governor complained that the freedom riders were violating our law and customs but the brutality displayed on television caused national outrage.
the next day the freedom riders wanted to continue their trip but the bus drivers refused.
civil rights 1327 freedom riders on may 14 1961 a white mob in alabama assaulted a freedom bus flinging fire bombs into its windows and beating the activists as they emerged.
here the surviving freedom riders sit outside the burnt shell of their bus.
when diane nash a fearless black college student and sncc leader in nashville tennessee heard about the violence in birmingham she recruited new riders.
president kennedy called her warning that she would get killed if you do this but she refused to back down.
it doesnt matter if were killed she told the president.
others will come others will come on may 17 nash and ten other students took a bus to birmingham where they were arrested.
while in jail they sang freedom songs well never turn back aint gonna let nobody turn me around we shall overcome eugene bull connor the citys notoriously racist police chief grew so frustrated at their joyous rebelliousness that he drove them in the middle of the night to the tennessee state line and dropped them off to walk.
instead of going back to nashville however the gutsy students returned to birmingham.
president kennedy was not inspired by the freedom riders.
to him they were a pain in the ass threatening to embarrass him and the united states on the eve of his summit meeting with soviet leader nikita khrushchev.
after dismissing them as publicity seekers who were putting the administration in a politically painful spot he grabbed a telephone and ordered harris wofford 1328 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 his special assistant on civil rights to end the freedom rides.
cant you get your goddamned friends off those buses.
stop them when kennedy suggested to several civil rights leaders that they allow things to cool off james farmer replied that blacks had been cooling off for a hundred years.
if we got any cooler wed be in the deep freeze louis martin an influential black newspaper publisher explained that negroes are getting ideas about securing equal rights they didnt have before kennedy asked where they were getting such ideas.
martin replied from you the activists finally forced the president to provide another bus which enabled them to renew the journey to new orleans.
when the new group of riders reached montgomery the capital of alabama they too were attacked.
the next night civil rights activists including martin luther king jr gathered at a montgomery church to honor the freedom riders.
but their meeting was interrupted by a rampaging mob of whites armed with rocks and firebombs.
ministers made frantic appeals to the white house.
kennedy responded by urging the alabama governor to intervene.
after midnight national guardsmen arrived to disperse the mob.
the freedom riders continued into mississippi where they were jailed.
they never made it to new orleans.
still the courage and principled resistance of the freedom riders and of federal judges whose rulings supported integration efforts prompted the interstate commerce commission icc in september 1961 to order that all interstate transportation facilities be integrated.
equally important the freedom riders kindled the growth of civil rights groups.
the experience of being assaulted and jailed galvanized the participants to become f ull time members while attracting more recruits.
the freedom rides were thus a crucial turning point in the civil rights movement.
white segregationists however remained violently opposed to racial equality.
in birmingham in september 1962 dr king was speaking at the annual meeting of the southern christian leadership conference when a white member of the american nazi party jumped to the stage and punched him in the face.
king simply dropped his hands and allowed the man to punch him again.
dont touch him king yelled.
we have to pray for him his self control and composure were as remarkable as his bravery.
king was determined as an aide said to love segregation to death his home was bombed three times and he was arrested fourteen times yet he kept telling people to use the weapon of nonviolence the breastplate of righteousness the armor of truth and just keep marching toward justice.
james meredith in the fall of 1962 james meredith an african american student and air force veteran whose grandfather had been a slave civil rights 1329 tried to enroll at the all white university of mississippi in oxford.
ross barnett the governor of mississippi described by time magazine as bitter a racist as inhabits the nation refused to allow meredith to register for classes.
the militantly stubborn barnett breathed scorching defiance he vowed to rot in jail before he will let one negro ever darken the sacred threshold of our white schools attorney general robert f kennedy then dispatched federal marshals to enforce the law.
when the marshals were assaulted with bricks bottles and steel pipes by a white mob shouting go to hell jfk president kennedy sent national guard troops.
their arrival ignited rioting that left two dead and dozens injured.
once the violence subsided however meredith was registered at the university.
only in america a reporter noted would the federal government send thousands of troops to enforce the right of an otherwise obscure citizen to attend a particular university birmingham in early 1963 in conjunction with the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of abraham lincolns emancipation proclamation martin luther king jr defied president kennedys wishes by organizing a bulls dogs eugene bull connor ordered birmingham police to unleash their dogs and clubs on civil rights demonstrators in may 1963.
1330 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 assive series of demonstrations in birmingham.
alabama was now led by m george wallace a feisty racist governor who had vowed to protect segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever king knew that weeks of public demonstrations would result in thousands of arrests and would likely provoke violence but a hard won victory he felt would break the back of segregation all over the nation by revealing southern brutality openly in the light of day with the rest of the world looking on through television cameras.
the birmingham campaign began with s it ins at restaurants picket lines at segregated businesses and a march on city hall.
the police arrested and jailed hundreds of activists.
each day however more demonstrators black and white joined in the efforts.
as king and others led 2 500 demonstrators through birmingham streets on may 7 the all white police force led by bull connor used snarling dogs tear gas electric cattle prods and high pressure fire hoses on the protesters.
millions of americans were outraged when they saw the ugly confrontations on television.
the civil rights movement president kennedy observed owes bull connor as much as it owes abraham lincoln it also owed a lot to the power of television.
more than 3 000 demonstrators were arrested including dr king and several white ministers both men and women who were rushing to the cause of civil rights.
while in jail king was inspired to write a letter from birmingham jail a stirring defense of nonviolent civil disobedience that has become a classic document of the civil rights movement.
one who breaks an unjust law king stressed must do so openly lovingly and with a willingness to accept the penalty in a reference to president kennedys timid support king wrote that the most perplexing foe of equal justice was not the southern white bigot but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice.
who constantly says i agree with you in the goal you seek but i cannot agree with your methods kings efforts prevailed when birmingham officials finally agreed to end their segregationist practices.
white racists did not change overnight however.
one angry alabaman sent a letter to king this isnt a threat but a promise your head will be blown off as sure as christ made green apples throughout 1963 whites in the lower south continued to defy efforts at racial integration while blacks and white liberals organized demonstrations in cities and towns across the nation.
on june 11 1963 alabama governor george wallace theatrically blocked the door at the university of alabama as african american students tried to register for classes.
wallace finally stepped aside in the face of insistent federal marshals.
civil rights 1331 that night president kennedy finally decided he needed to lead.
in a hastily arranged televised speech he announced that he would soon submit to congress a major new civil rights bill that would remove race as a consideration in american life or law he stressed that a great change is at hand and he was determined to make that change that civil rights revolution peaceful and constructive.
we are confronted primarily with a moral issue the president said.
it is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the american constitution.
the heart of the question is whether all americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities he asked every american regardless of where he lives to stop and examine his conscience for america for all its hopes and all its boasts will not be fully free until all its citizens are free that night in mississippi a 37 year old african american civil rights activist medgar evers listened to the presidents speech in his car.
he was so excited by kennedys new commitment to civil rights that he turned the car around and went home so that he could discuss the speech with his children.
when evers arrived at his house in jackson at midnight he was shot in his driveway by a white racist lying in ambush.
he staggered to the carport and collapsed in front of his horrified wife and children.
he died before reaching a hospital.
such violence aroused the nations indignation and reinforced kennedys commitment to make civil rights americas most pressing social issue.
the killing of medgar evers led the president to host his first meeting of civil rights leaders in the white house and helped spur plans for a massive demonstration on the mall in washington d c i have a dream for weeks southern democrats in the house of representatives blocked kennedys civil rights bill.
the standoff in congress led african american leaders to take a bold step.
on august 28 some 250 000 blacks and whites many of them schoolchildren brought in on buses marched arm in arm down the mall in washington d c chanting equality now and singing we shall overcome the march on washington for jobs and freedom was the largest political demonstration in american history.
when you looked at the crowd remembered a u s park service ranger you didnt see blacks or whites.
you saw america for almost six hours prominent entertainers sang protest songs and civil rights activists gave speeches calling for racial justice.
then something remarkable happened.
standing on the steps of the lincoln memorial thirty four year old martin luther king jr came to the podium the tenth and last speaker of the day.
the crowd roared as he prepared 1332 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 i have a dream august 28 1963 protesters in the massive march on washington make their way to the lincoln memorial where martin luther king jr delivered his n ow f amous speech.
he started awkwardly.
noticing his nervousness someone urged him to tell em about the dream martin as if suddenly inspired king set aside his prepared remarks and delivered an extraordinary improvised speech that resonated around the world.
he started slowly and picked up speed as if he were speaking at a revival giving poetic voice to the hopes of millions as he stressed the fierce urgency of now and the unstoppable power of meeting physical force with soul force king then shared his dream for america in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment i still have a dream.
it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.
i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal i have a dream that one day.
the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood.
as if at a massive church service many in the crowd began shouting amen as king summoned a flawed nation to justice so let freedom ring he shouted for when we allow freedom to ring from every town and every ham civil rights 1333 let from every state and every city we will be able to speed up the day when all gods children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at last as king finished there was a startling hush then a deafening ovation.
the crowd spontaneously joined hands and began singing we shall overcome i have never been so proud to be a negro said baseball superstar jackie robinson.
i have never been so proud to be an american president kennedy who had tried to convince organizers to call off the march was watching on tv at the white house just a mile away.
as king spoke the president told an aide that hes damn good but kings dream remained just that a dream.
eighteen days later four klansmen in birmingham detonated a bomb in a black church killing four young girls.
the murders sparked a new wave of indignation across the country and the world.
the editors of the milwaukee sentinel stressed that the bombing should serve to goad the conscience.
the deaths.
in a sense are on the hands of each of us the warren court the civil rights movement depended as much on the courts as it did on the leadership of dr king and others and federal judges kept forcing states and localities to integrate schools and other public places.
under chief justice earl warren the u s supreme court also made landmark decisions in other areas of american life.
in 1962 the court ruled that a school prayer adopted by the new york state board of regents violated the constitutional prohibition against government supported religion.
in gideon v wainwright 1963 the court required that every felony defendant be provided a lawyer regardless of the defendants ability to pay.
in 1964 the court ruled in escobedo v illinois that a person accused of a crime must be allowed to consult a lawyer before being interrogated by police.
two years later in miranda v arizona 1966 the court issued a bitterly criticized ruling when it ordered that an accused person in police custody be informed of certain basic rights the right to remain silent the right to know that anything said to authorities can be used against the individual in court and the right to have a defense attorney present during interrogation since then these requirements have been known as miranda rights in addition the court established rules for police to follow in informing suspects of their legal rights before questioning could begin.
freedom summer during late 1963 and throughout 1964 the civil rights movement grew in scope visibility and power.
racism however 1334 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 remained entrenched in the lower south as blacks continued to be excluded from the political process.
white officials kept african americans from voting by charging them expensive poll taxes forcing them to take difficult literacy tests making the application process inconvenient and intimidating them through the use of arson beatings and lynchings.
in early 1964 h arvard educated robert bob moses a black new yorker who had resigned from the sclc to head the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc office in mississippi decided it would take an army to force the state to give voting rights to blacks.
so he set about recruiting an army of black and white volunteers who would live with rural african americans teach them in freedom schools and help them register to vote.
most of the recruits for what came to be called freedom summer were idealistic white college students many of whom were jewish.
mississippis white leaders prepared for the n igger communist invasion by doubling the state police force and stockpiling tear gas electric cattle prods and shotguns.
writer eudora welty reported from her hometown of jackson mississippi that she had heard that this summer all hell is going to break loose it did.
in m id june the volunteer activists met at an ohio college to learn about southern racial history nonviolent civil disobedience and the likely abuses they would suffer.
on the final evening of the training session moses a freedom school in jackson mississippi a volunteer from brooklyn new york instructs young black students on the arts african american history and civil rights at a freedom school as part of the mississippi summer project in august 1964.
civil rights 1335 pleaded with anyone who feared heading to mississippi to go home several did.
the next day the remaining volunteers boarded buses and headed south fanning out across the state.
in all f orty one freedom schools taught thousands of children math writing and history.
they also tutored black adults about the complicated process of voter registration.
stokely carmichael an african american student from howard university wrote that black mississippians took us in fed us instructed and protected us and ultimately civilized educated and inspired the smartassed college students forty six year old fannie lou hamer was one of the local blacks who worked with the sncc volunteers during freedom summer.
the youngest in a household of twenty children she had spent most of her life working on local cotton plantations.
during the freedom summer of 1963 and after she led gatherings of volunteers in freedom songs and excelled as a lay preacher.
god is not pleased she said at all the murdering and all of the brutality and all the killings for no reason at all.
god is not pleased at the negro children in the state of mississippi suffering from malnutrition.
god is not pleased because we have to go raggedy each day.
god is not pleased because we have to go to the field and work from ten to eleven hours for three lousy dollars in response the ku klux klan local police and other white racists harassed arrested and assaulted many of the volunteers.
on june 21 1964 just two days after congress approved the civil rights act three young sncc workers james earl chaney andrew goodman and michael mickey schwerner disappeared after going to investigate the burning of an african american church.
their decomposed b ullet riddled bodies were found two months later buried in a dam at a cattle pond.
they had been abducted and murdered by klan members.
while searching for the missing men authorities found the bodies of eight black males in rivers white terror young men cruise and swamps who also had been killed.
through a riot zone in chicago in 1966 brandishing a confederate flag and the murders said one volunteer were racist signs.
the end of innocence after which 1336 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 things could never be the same a growing number of blacks began to call into question martin luther kings nonviolent strategy.
black power racism in america was not limited to the south.
by the mid sixties about 70 percent of the nations african americans were living in blighted urban areas and many young blacks in the large cities were losing faith in the strategy of christian nonviolence employed by king and others in the south.
inner city poverty and frustration cried out for its own social j ustice movement.
the fragmentation of the civil rights movement was tragically evident on august 11 1965 when watts the largest black ghetto in los angeles exploded in rioting and looting that left t hirty four dead almost 4 000 in jail and widespread property damage.
dozens of other large cities experienced similar riots in the summer of 1966.
between 1965 and 1968 nearly 300 racial uprisings shattered the peace of urban america.
the violence revealed the growing civil war within the civil rights movement.
as gil s cott heron a black musician sang we are tired of praying and marching and thinking and learning brothers want to start cutting and shooting and stealing and burning what came to be called black power began to compete with the integrationist nonviolent philosophy espoused by dr king and the sclc.
malcolm x the black power movements most influential spokesman.
malcolm x the most visible spokesman for the black power movement was malcolm x born in 1925 in omaha nebraska as malcolm little.
his father a baptist minister and his mother a west indian were supporters of marcus garveys crusade for black nationalism in the 1920s and his childhood home was burned to the ground by white racists.
his father was killed when malcolm was six perhaps the victim of white supremacists.
after her husbands death louise little suffered a breakdown and was institutionalized for the rest of her life.
young civil rights 1337 malcolm was placed in foster care but became an unruly rebel.
after being expelled from school in the ninth grade he drifted from detroit to new york city to boston.
by age nineteen malcolm now known as detroit red had become a thief drug dealer and pimp.
he spent seven years in massachusetts prisons where he experienced a conversion and joined a small chicago based religious sect the nation of islam noi whose members were called black muslims.
the organization had little to do with islam and everything to do with its domineering leader elijah muhammad and the cultlike devotion he required.
muhammad dismissed whites as devils and championed black nationalism racial pride self respect and s elf discipline.
by 1953 a year after leaving prison malcolm little was calling himself malcolm x in tribute to his lost african name and he had become a full time noi minister famous for electrifying speeches attacking white racism and black powerlessness.
malcolm x dismissed martin luther king and other mainstream civil rights leaders as nothing but modern uncle toms who keep you and me in check keep us under control keep us passive and peaceful and nonviolent he insisted that there was no such thing as a nonviolent revolution his militant speeches inspired thousands of mostly urban blacks to join the nation of islam.
more than most black leaders malcolm x expressed the emotions and frustrations of the inner city african american working poor.
yet at the peak of his influence and just as he was moderating his militant message he became embroiled in a conflict with elijah muhammad that proved fatal.
noi assassins killed malcolm x in manhattan on february 21 1965.
black militancy did not end with malcolm x however.
by 1966 black power had become a rallying cry for many young militants.
when stokely carmichael became head of the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc he ousted whites from the organization.
when you talk of black power carmichael shouted you talk of bringing this country to its knees of building a movement that will smash everything western civilization has created having been beaten by whites and having seen fellow volunteers killed carmichael rejected the nonviolent philosophy of the mainstream civil rights movement and urged blacks to defend themselves.
where martin luther king spoke to white americas moral conscience carmichael and other firebrands spoke to the seething rage of the young black underclass.
soon carmichael would move on to the black panther party a group of leather jacketed black revolutionaries founded in oakland california that promoted incendiary strategies and cultural pride.
h rap brown who succeeded carmichael as head of sncc in 1967 urged blacks to get you some guns and kill the honkies whites 1338 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 the effect of black power although widely covered in the media the black power movement never attracted more than a small minority of african americans.
still it forced king and other mainstream black leaders and organizations to shift their focus from the rural south to i nner city ghettos in the north and west.
legal access to restaurants schools and other public accommodations king pointed out meant little to people mired in chronic poverty.
they needed jobs and decent housing.
the time had come king declared while launching his poor peoples campaign in december 1967 for radical new measures to provide jobs and income for the poor yet as he and others stressed the war in vietnam was taking funds away from federal programs serving the poor and black soldiers were dying in disproportionate numbers in southeast asia.
the black power movement also motivated african americans to take greater pride in their racial heritage by pushing for black studies programs in schools and colleges the celebration of african cultural and artistic traditions the organizing of inner city voters to elect black mayors laws forcing landlords to treat blacks fairly and the creation of grassroots organizations and panther power black panthers issue a black power salute outside a san francisco liberation school where activists raised awareness and appreciation of african american history a topic ignored by white mainstream curriculum.
the great society 1339 community centers in black neighborhoods.
it was malcolm x who insisted that blacks call themselves african americans as a symbol of pride in their roots and as a spur to learn more about their history.
as the popular singer james brown urged say it loud im black and im proud the great society growing federal support for civil rights came from an unlikely source a drawling white southerner who succeeded john f kennedy in the white house.
a stunned lyndon baines johnson the towering texan known as lbj took the presidential oath of office on board the plane that brought kennedys body back to washington from dallas.
the fifty five year old johnson the first southern president since woodrow wilson had excelled as senate majority leader before becoming vice president.
his transition to the presidency was not easy however.
he inherited a the oath of office less than 90 minutes after kennedys death johnson took the presidential oath aboard air force one between his wife lady bird left and jacqueline kennedy right before flying out of dallas for washington d c 1340 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 political deadlock between the white house and a congressional alliance of democratic and republican conservatives that had blocked most of kennedys legislative proposals.
johnson had also been kept out of the inner circle of power in the kennedy white house.
the kennedy brothers despised johnson and excluded him from key decisions.
robert kennedy described johnson as vicious an animal in many ways johnson in turn dismissed all those bostons and harvards who knew less about the legislative process than an old maid does about fucking like kennedy johnson was one of the most complex and inexplicable men to occupy the white house.
unlike the wealthy aristocratic kennedy however johnson was a rags to riches story.
with almost superhuman effort and ambition he had worked his way out of rural texas poverty during the great depression to become one of the senates dominant figures.
lbjs ego and insecurities were as massive as his vanity and ambition he could not stand being alone he insisted on being the center of attention wherever he went.
johnson personalized the presidency in press conferences he referred to my vietnam policy my security council my cabinet my legislation and my boys fighting in southeast asia.
george reedy the presidents press secretary said that johnson was a man of too many paradoxes ruthless and often bullying needy and warmhearted he was a contradictory whirlwind of workaholic energy and inspiring hopes a crude idealist and a brutal optimist so t hin skinned that he took all criticism personally.
in his view people were either with him or against him.
there was no middle ground.
johnson yearned to be loved and respected as a transformational leader.
and like kennedy he had a weakness for both political power and attractive women.
his wife lady bird acknowledged that lyndon loved the human race and half of the human race are women few leaders had ever dreamed as big as lyndon johnson.
his outlook was grandiose.
he wanted to be the greatest american president the one who did the most good for the most people by creating the most new programs and agencies.
he promised to help every child get an education to help every negro and every american citizen have an equal opportunity to help every family get a decent home and to help bring healing to the sick and dignity to the old those who dismissed johnson as a traditional southern conservative failed to appreciate his genuine concern for the poor and his embrace of civil rights.
im going to be the best friend the negro ever had johnson bragged to a member of the white house staff.
his commitment to civil rights was in part motivated by politics in part by his desire to bring the south into the mainstream of american life and in part by his life experiences.
his first teaching job the great society 1341 after college was at an elementary school in texas serving mexican american children.
they created in him a lifelong desire to help those poor little kids.
i saw hunger in their eyes and pain in their bodies.
those little brown bodies had so little and needed so much he grew determined to fill their souls with ambition and interest and belief in the future politics and poverty johnson managed legislation through congress better than any president in history.
as a woman in hawaii said johnson is a mover of men.
kennedy could inspire men but he couldnt move them lbj was the consummate wheeler dealer on capitol hill.
it is the politicians task he asserted to pass legislation not to sit around saying principled things in 1964 he set about doing just that taking advantage of widespread public support to push through congress kennedys stalled measures for tax reductions and civil rights.
he later said that he wanted to take kennedys incomplete program and turn it into a martyrs cause the revenue act of 1964 provided a 20 percent reduction in tax rates.
the top rate was then a whopping 91 percent compared to 39 6 today.
it was intended to give consumers more money to spend so as to boost economic growth and create new jobs and it worked.
unemployment fell from 5 2 percent in 1964 to 4 5 percent in 1965 and 3 8 percent in 1966 the civil rights act long thwarted by southern democrats in congress the civil rights act of 1964 finally became law on july 2.
it guaranteed equal treatment under the law for all americans and outlawed discrimination in public places on the basis of race sex or national origin.
it also prohibited discrimination in the buying selling and renting of housing as well as the hiring and firing of employees.
the civil rights movement set the stage and provided the momentum for the new law but johnson pursued its passage with an urgent sense of purpose.
he lobbied key legislators one on one one senator who survived the johnson treatment as it came to be called said that the president would twist your arm off at the shoulder and beat your head with it if you did not agree to vote as he wanted.
soon after becoming president johnson hosted georgia senator richard russell his close friend and an arch segregationist.
over lunch the president warned russell that youve got to get out of my way.
im going to run over you to pass the civil rights act.
you may do that russell replied.
but by god its going to cost you the south and cost you the election of 1964 johnson answered if thats the price ive got to pay ill pay it gladly soon 1342 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 thereafter johnson told congress that we have talked long enough in this country about equal rights.
it is time now to write the next chapter and to write it in the book of law he added that it would be the best way to honor kennedys memory.
many others helped johnson convince congress to pass the civil rights act senator hubert humphrey congressional committee chairs both republicans and democrats labor unions church leaders and civil rights organizations.
their collective efforts produced what is arguably the single most important piece of legislation in the twentieth century.
the passage of the civil rights act after more than a year of congressional delays marked one of those extraordinary moments when the ideals of democracy equal opportunity and human dignity are affirmed by action.
the civil rights act of 1964 dealt a major blow to the deeply entrenched system of racial segregation while giving the federal government new powers to bring lawsuits against organizations or businesses that violated constitutional rights.
it also established the equal employment opportunities commission to ensure that employers treated job applicants equally regardless of race gender or national origin.
down with segregation a worker removes a sign from a greensboro north carolina bus that reads white patrons please seat from front.
colored patrons please seat from rear the great society 1343 on the night after signing the bill johnson knew that conservative white southerners would be furious.
he correctly predicted that we have just delivered the south to the republican party for a long time to come a war on poverty in addition to fulfilling president kennedys legislative priorities that had been stalled in congress lyndon johnson launched an elaborate legislative program of his own by declaring unconditional war on poverty in america americans had rediscovered poverty in 1962 when social critic michael harrington published a powerful expos the other america in which he revealed that more than 40 million people were mired in an invisible culture of poverty poverty led to poor housing conditions which in turn led to such problems as poor health poor attendance at school or work alcohol and drug abuse unwanted pregnancies and single parent families.
harrington added that poverty was much more extensive than people realized because much of it was hidden from view in isolated rural areas or i nner city slums.
he urged the united states to launch a comprehensive assault on poverty president kennedy had read harringtons book and asked his advisers in the fall of 1963 just before his assassination to investigate the problem and suggest solutions.
upon becoming president johnson announced that he wanted an anti poverty legislative package that would hit the nation with real impact he was determined to help the one fifth of all american families with incomes too small to even meet their basic needs they needed better homes better schools better medical care and better job training.
money for the program would come from the tax revenues generated by corporate profits made possible by the tax reduction of 1964 which had led to one of the longest sustained economic booms in history.
johnson knew that the war on poverty would be long and costly.
he said he did not expect to wipe out poverty in my lifetime.
but we can minimize it moderate it and in time eliminate it and he pledged that his war on poverty would not be a struggle to support people by giving them handouts but by opening the door of opportunity for them.
the economic opportunity act of 1964 was the primary weapon in the war on poverty it created an office of economic opportunity oeo to administer eleven new community based programs many of which still exist.
they included a job corps training program for i nner city youths ages sixteen to twenty one a head start educational program for disadvantaged preschoolers a legal services corporation to provide legal assistance for l ow income americans financial aid programs for low income college students grants to small farmers and rural businesses loans to businesses that hired the chronically unemployed the volunteers in service to america program vista 1344 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 to combat i nner city poverty and the community action program which would allow the poor maximum feasible participation in organizing and directing their own neighborhood programs.
in 1964 congress also approved the food stamp act a program to help poor people afford to buy groceries.
the election of 1964 johnsons successes aroused a conservative republican counterattack.
arizona senator barry goldwater a wealthy department store owner emerged as the blunt talking leader of the growing right wing of the republican party.
he was one of only six republican senators to vote against the civil rights act of 1964 and warned that the bill would lead to a federal police state in his best selling book the conscience of a conservative 1960 goldwater had called for ending the income tax and drastically reducing federal entitlement programs such as social security.
conservatives controlled the republican convention when it gathered in san francisco in the early summer of 1964 and they ensured goldwaters nomination.
i would remind you goldwater told the delegates that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice he later explained that his objective was like that of calvin coolidge in the 1920s to reduce the size of government.
not to pass laws but repeal them as a candidate goldwater frightened many voters when he urged wholesale bombing of north vietnam and even suggested using atomic weapons.
he criticized johnsons war on poverty as a waste of money told students that the federal government should not provide any assistance for education and opposed the nuclear test ban treaty.
to republican campaign buttons that claimed in your heart you know hes right democrats responded in your guts you know hes nuts johnson by comparison portrayed himself as a responsible centrist.
he chose as his running mate hubert h humphrey of minnesota a prominent liberal senator who had long promoted civil rights.
in contrast to goldwaters aggressive rhetoric johnson pledged that he was not about to send american boys nine or ten thousand miles from home to do what asian boys ought to be doing for themselves the election was not close.
johnson won 61 percent of the popular vote and dominated the electoral vote by 486 to 52.
goldwater captured only arizona and five states in the lower south.
in the senate the democrats increased their majority by two 68 to 32 and in the house by t hirty seven 295 to 140.
but goldwaters success in the lower south accelerated the regions shift to the republican party and his candidacy proved to be a turning point in the development of the national conservative movement by inspiring a generation of young activists and the formation of conservative organizations that would transform the dynamics of american politics during the 1970s and 1980s.
the great society 1345 their success would culminate in the presidency of ronald reagan the holly wood actor who co chaired the california for goldwater campaign in 1964.
the great society lyndon johnson misread his lopsided victory in 1964 as a mandate for massive changes.
he knew however that his popularity could quickly fade.
every day im in office he told his aides im going to lose votes.
im going to alienate somebody.
weve got to get this legislation fast.
youve got to get it during my honeymoon as johnsons war on poverty gathered momentum his already outsized ambitions grew even larger.
in may 1964 he announced his intention to develop an array of programs intended to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society but upward to the great society which would end poverty and racial injustice and provide abundance and liberty for all it soon became clear that johnson viewed the federal government as the magical lever for raising the quality of life for all a mericans rich and poor.
he would surpass franklin roosevelts new deal in expanding the goals and scope of the federal government to ensure that americans were a people of plenty.
hell were the richest country in the world the most powerful johnson told an aide.
we can do it all soon johnson was working f ull time to gain congressional approval for dozens of new bills and federal programs.
lbj said an aide became a great hurtling locomotive running down the track health insurance housing and higher education johnsons first priorities among his great society programs were federal health insurance and aid for young people to pursue higher education liberal proposals that had first been suggested by president truman in 1945.
for twenty years the steadfast opposition of the physicians making up the american medical association ama had stalled a comprehensive medical insurance program.
now that johnson and the democrats had the votes to pass the measure however the ama joined republicans in supporting a bill serving those over age sixty five.
the act that finally emerged created not just a medicare health insurance program for the elderly but also a medicaid program of federal grants to states to help cover medical expenses for the poor of all ages.
johnson signed the bill on july 30 1965 in independence missouri with e ighty one year old harry truman looking on.
the higher education act of 1965 increased federal grants to universities created scholarships for low income students provided low interest loans for students and established a national teachers corps.
every child johnson 1346 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 war on poverty in 1964 president johnson visited tom fletcher a father of eight children living in a tar paper shack in rural kentucky.
fletcher became a poster father for the war on poverty though as it turned out his life benefited little from its programs.
asserted must be encouraged to get as much education as he has the ability to take the momentum generated by the higher education and medicare acts helped carry 435 more great society bills through congress.
among them was the appalachian regional development act of 1966 which allocated 1 billion for programs in impoverished mountain areas.
the housing and urban development act of 1965 provided 3 billion for urban renewal projects in inner city ghettoes.
funds to help low income families pay their rent followed in 1966 and the same year a new department of housing and urban development appeared headed by robert c weaver the first african american cabinet member.
in implementing the many different great society programs lyndon johnson had in the words of one washington reporter brought to harvest a generations backlog of ideas and social legislation no president reported time magazine was more passionately earnestly and all encompassingly dedicated to and consumed by his work the immigration act little noticed in the stream of great society legislation was the immigration and nationality services act of 1965 the great society 1347 which johnson signed in a ceremony on liberty island in new york harbor.
it abolished the discriminatory annual quotas based upon an immigrants national origin and treated all nationalities and races equally.
the old system greatly favored immigrants from great britain and the countries of western and northern europe over those from southern and eastern europe asia and africa.
in place of quotas it created hemispheric ceilings on visas issued 170 000 for persons from outside the western hemisphere 120 000 for persons from within.
it also stipulated that no more than 20 000 people could come from any one country each year.
voting rights legislation building upon the successes of freedom summer martin luther king jr organized an effort in early 1965 to register the 3 million unregistered african american voters in the south.
on february 6 the white house announced that it would urge congress to enact a voting rights bill.
to keep the pressure on the president and congress activists converged on selma alabama where only 250 of the 15 000 blacks of voting age were registered voters.
king told his staff on february 10 that to get the voting rights bill passed we need to make a dramatic statement.
that drama occurred three weeks later.
on sunday march 7 some 600 black and white civil rights protesters assembled near the edmund pettus bridge to begin a fi fty four mile march to the state capitol in montgomery.
before reaching the bridge however the marchers were assaulted by 500 state troopers and local police using billy clubs tear gas and bullwhips.
in what came to be called bloody sunday the violence was televised for all to see.
fifty injured marchers were hospitalized.
the news from selma reported the washington post will shock and alarm the whole nation it did.
dr king torn between congressional appeals to call off the march and the demands of militants that it continue announced that a second march would be held.
a federal judge agreed to allow the marchers to continue once president johnson agreed to provide soldiers and federal marshals for their protection.
by march 25 when the demonstrators reached montgomery some 25 000 people were with them and king delivered a rousing address in which he said the battle is in our hands.
and we can answer with creative nonviolence the call to higher ground to which the new directions of our struggle summons us several days earlier on march 15 johnson had urged congress to overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice by making the cause of civil rights our cause too he concluded by slowly speaking the words of the movements hymn and we shall overcome 1348 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 the resulting voting rights act of 1965 was one of the most momentous legislative accomplishments of the twentieth century.
it ensured all citizens the right to vote.
it authorized the attorney general to send federal officials to register voters in areas that had long experienced racial discrimination.
in states or counties where fewer than half the adults had voted in 1964 the act banned the various ways like literacy tests that local officials used to keep blacks and hispanics from voting.
by the end of the year some 250 000 african americans were newly registered to vote in several southern states.
by 1968 an estimated 53 percent of blacks in alabama were registered to vote compared to 14 percent in 1960.
in this respect the voting rights act was even more important than the civil rights act because it empowered black voters in the south thereby transforming the white dominated politics in the region and making possible the election of black public officials.
yet by enabling southern blacks most of whom preferred democratic candidates to vote it also helped turn the o nce solidly democratic south into a republican stronghold as many white voters switched parties.
the great society in practice lyndon b johnson sought to give americans a sense of forward movement in troubled times and show them that he could create a great society whereby people would be more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods franklin roosevelt passed fifteen major bills in his first hundred days johnson told an aide in 1966 whereas he had passed two hundred in the last two years a new york times columnist joked that lbj was getting everything through the congress but the abolition of the republican party and he hasnt tried that yet the scope of johnsons great society programs exceeded roosevelts new deal in part because of the nations booming prosperity during the mid 1960s.
this country johnson proclaimed is rich enough to do anything it has the guts to do and the vision to do and the will to do that proved not to be the case however.
as time magazine reported no matter how much lyndon gets he asks for more yet soon there was no more money to spend.
in 1966 johnson warned congress that if taxes were not raised the economy would suffer a ruinous spiral of inflation and brutally higher interest rates the great society and war on poverty never lived up to johnsons grandiose goals in part because the vietnam war soon took priority and siphoned away funding and in part because neither johnson nor his congressional supporters understood the stubborn complexity of chronic poverty.
in many respects the great society generated its own downfall by inspiring a conservative republican backlash that would gain political control during the eighties.
in the con the tragedy of vietnam 1349 gressional elections of 1966 only 38 of the 71 democrats elected to the house in 1964 won reelection.
the political tide was running against johnson.
the great society programs did however include several triumphs.
infant mortality has dropped college completion rates have soared malnutrition has virtually disappeared and far fewer elderly americans live below the poverty line and without access to health care.
the federal guarantee of civil rights and voting rights remains in place.
medicare and medicaid have become two of the most appreciated government programs.
consumers now have a federal agency protecting them.
head start programs providing preschool enrichment activities for poor students have produced l ong term benefits.
the federal food stamp program has improved the nutrition and health of children living in poverty.
finally scholarships for low income college students have been immensely valuable providing access to higher education.
several of johnsons most ambitious programs however were ill conceived others were vastly underfunded and many were mismanaged and even corrupt.
some of the problems they were meant to address actually worsened.
medicare for example removed incentives for hospitals to control costs so medical bills skyrocketed for everyone.
in addition food stamp fraud occurred as people took selfish advantage of a program intended to ensure healthy nutrition.
overall great society programs helped reduce the population living in poverty from 19 percent in 1964 to 10 percent in 1973 but it did so largely by providing federal welfare payments not by finding people decent jobs.
in 1966 middle class resentment over the cost and excesses of the great society programs generated a conservative backlash that fueled the republican resurgence in congress.
by then however the great society had transformed public expectations of the power and role of the federal government.
the tragedy of vietnam in foreign affairs lyndon johnson was like woodrow wilson a novice.
and again like wilson his presidency would become a victim of his crusading idealism.
as racial violence erupted in americas cities the war in vietnam reached new levels of intensity and destruction.
with weapons and supplies from china and the soviet union north vietnam provided massive support to the viet cong vc the guerrillas fighting in south vietnam to overthrow the u s backed government and unify the divided nation under communist control.
johnson inherited a l ong standing u s commitment to prevent a communist takeover in vietnam.
beginning with harry s truman u s presidents 1350 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 had done just enough to avoid being charged with having lost vietnam.
johnson initially sought to do the same fearing that any other course of action would jeopardize his great society programs in congress.
his path however took the united states into a deeper military commitment.
in november 1963 when president kennedy was assassinated there were 16 000 u s military advisers in south vietnam.
early in his presidency johnson doubted that vietnam was worth a more extensive military involvement.
in may 1964 he told his national security adviser mcgeorge bundy that he had spent a sleepless night worrying about vietnam it looks to me like we are getting into another korea.
i dont think its worth fighting for.
and i dont think we can get out.
its just the u s air strikes sustained bombing of biggest damned mess that i ever saw vietnam left 30 to 50 foot wide craters yet johnsons fear of appearing that can still be seen today.
weak abroad outweighed his misgivings.
by the end of 1965 there were 184 000 u s troops in vietnam in 1966 there were 385 000 and by 1969 at the height of the war effort 542 000 escalation in vietnam the official justification for the military e scalation a defense department term favored in the vietnam era was the tonkin gulf resolution passed by the senate on august 7 1964.
on that day president johnson unknowingly acting on false information provided by the secretary of defense reported that on august 2 and 4 north vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked two u s warships in the gulf of tonkin off the coast of north vietnam.
as it turned out the american vessels had actually fired first in support of south vietnamese attacks against two north vietnamese islands attacks planned by american advisers.
whether the american warships were actually fired upon remains in dispute.
the tonkin gulf resolution empowered the president to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the united states the tragedy of vietnam 1351 and to prevent further aggression only two senators voted against the tonkin gulf resolution which johnson interpreted as equivalent to a congressional declaration of war since it allowed him to wage war as he saw fit.
in early 1965 johnson made the crucial decisions that committed america to full scale war in vietnam.
on february 5 1965 viet cong vc guerrillas attacked a u s base near pleiku in south vietnam killing and wounding more than 100 americans.
more attacks that week led johnson to approve operation rolling thunder the first sustained u s bombing of north vietnam.
thereafter there were essentially two fronts in the war one in north vietnam where u s warplanes continued a massive bombing campaign and the other in south vietnam where nearly all the ground combat occurred.
in march 1965 the u s commander general william c westmoreland greeted the first american combat troops in vietnam.
his strategy was focused not on capturing territory but on waging a war of attrition using overwhelming u s firepower to cause so many casualties that the viet cong and north vietnamese would give up their effort to undermine the south vietnamese government.
soon u s forces launched search and destroy operations against vc guerrillas throughout south vietnam reporting the body count on the evening newscasts.
but the viet cong made up of both men and women wore no uniforms and dissolved by day into the villages hiding among civilians.
their elusiveness exasperated american soldiers most of whom were not trained for such unconventional warfare in vietnams dense jungles and intense heat and humidity.
the escalating war brought rising u s casualties the number of killed wounded and missing which were announced each week on the television news.
criticism of the war grew but lbj stood firm.
we will not be defeated he told the nation.
we will not grow tired.
we will not withdraw the context for policy president johnsons decision to americanize the war flowed directly from the assumptions that had long guided u s foreign policy during the cold war.
the commitment to contain the spread of communism initiated by harry truman and continued by dwight eisenhower and john kennedy guided johnson as well.
why are we in vietnam the president asked during a speech in 1965.
we are there because we have a promise to keep.
to leave vietnam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of american commitment what johnson did not say was that he dreaded being blamed for losing vietnam to communism as truman had been accused by republicans of losing china to communists led by mao zedong.
1352 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 johnson and his advisers also believed that u s military force would defeat the viet cong fighting in south vietnam.
yet the president insisted that the american war effort not reach levels that would cause the chinese or soviets to become involved which meant as it turned out that a military victory was never possible.
the united states was not fighting to win the war but to prevent the north vietnamese and viet cong from winning and eventually force them to sign a negotiated settlement.
this meant that the united states would have to maintain a military presence as long as the enemy retained the will to fight.
as the war ground on opposition hidden a vietnamese mother hides her son and herself in the bushes at home grew fierce.
in 1965 three near my lai in 1965 after u s marines dozen college campuses began hosting murdered vietnamese villagers.
teach ins critical of the war effort.
professors would gather in classrooms or outside on the grass to discuss with students a better policy in vietnam.
the times must be a changing wrote the michigan state student newspaper.
in april 1965 some 20 000 students from campuses across the nation converged on washington d c where they picketed the white house before moving to the washington monument where they carried signs saying get out of saigon and into selma freedom now in vietnam war on poverty not people.
the crowd then went to the capitol where it presented congress with a petition demanding that the legislators end not extend the war in vietnam the following year senator j william fulbright of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee began congressional investigations into american policy in vietnam.
george f kennan the former state department diplomat who had inspired the containment policy told the committee that the containment doctrine was appropriate for europe but not for southeast asia which was not vital to american security.
such opposition to the war effort brought out the worst in johnson.
he labeled his political critics and antiwar protesters communists and used government agencies to punish them.
the tragedy of vietnam 1353 still the resistance to the escalating war grew.
by 1967 anti war demonstrations were commonplace.
americans began dividing into hawks who supported the war and doves who opposed it.
nightly television accounts of the fighting vietnam was the first war to receive extended television coverage and hence was dubbed the living room war called into question the accuracy of statements by military and government officials claiming the americans were winning.
johnson admitted that the situation was a mess.
there is no question about that.
i wish it was better too but he dug in his heels and insisted that there would be no withdrawal from vietnam.
between 1965 and 1968 u s warplanes dropped more bombs on vietnam than had fallen on all enemy targets in the second world war.
but johnson and his advisers badly underestimated the strength and determination of the north vietnamese and viet cong.
while the united states fought a limited war for limited objectives the vietnamese communists aided by the soviets and chinese fought an all out war for their very survival.
johnson became preoccupied with the day to day conduct of the war insisting on giving the final approval to bombing targets fretting over logistical details demanding information about enemy movements.
as westmoreland requested more and more soldiers johnson found it impossible to turn him down explaining that doing so would be like hearing the call from the alamo for help and answering that were not coming yet spending so much time dealing with the war was bitterly frustrating to johnson.
how could he be expected to help every child get an education to help every negro and every american citizen have an equal opportunity to help every family get a decent home and to help bring healing to the sick and dignity to the old if the war kept siphoning away the nations resources.
the tet offensive on january 31 1968 the first day of the vietnamese new year tet the viet cong unleashed surprise attacks on u s and south vietnamese forces throughout south vietnam.
within a few days american firepower turned the tables but the damage had been done.
although general westmoreland proclaimed the tet offensive a major defeat for the viet cong the political impact of the surprise attack in the united states was dramatic it decisively turned americans against the war.
the scope and intensity of the tet offensive contradicted upbeat claims by u s commanders.
what the hell is going on cbs newscaster walter cronkite demanded.
i thought we were winning this war after the tet offensive johnsons popularity plummeted as did the presidents confidence in his vietnam policy.
the country is demoralized he admitted.
most of the press is against us.

what was the ho chi minh trail.
wwn64 figure what was the tet offensive.
m29 2 first proof the tragedy of vietnam 1355 civil rights leaders and social activists felt betrayed as they saw federal funds earmarked for the war on poverty spent on vietnam.
by 1968 the united states was spending some 2 billion each month on the war about 322 000 for every vc killed anti poverty programs at home received only 53 per person.
as martin luther king jr pointed out the bombs in vietnam explode at home they destroy the hopes and possibilities for a decent america president johnson under constant assault by critics grew increasingly embittered and isolated.
the president who had accomplished so much could now do nothing right.
a nti war protesters chanted hey hey lbj how many kids in vietnam have you killed today johnson suffered from depression and paranoia as he realized how much that bitch of a war was dividing the nation gobbling up its resources and killing its young men.
clark clifford johnsons new secretary of defense reported in 1968 that a task force of experts had concluded that the united states could not win the war.
it was not what johnson wanted to hear.
robert f kennedy now a new york senator began exploring a run for the presidency to challenge johnsons vietnam policy.
senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota had already announced his own campaign as an anti war candidate.
in new hampshires democratic primary in march 1968 mccarthy won a stunning 42 percent of the vote to johnsons 48 percent.
dove bites hawk one reporter quipped.
johnson now seemed mortally wounded and the results in new hampshire convinced bobby kennedy to enter the race.
lbj hated kennedy dismissing him as a grandstanding little runt being challenged for reelection by members of his own party devastated johnson.
the growing opposition to the vietnam war was even a worse blow.
during a private meeting with military leaders the president acknowledged that the country is demoralized.
most of the press is against us.
we have no support for the war on march 31 1968 a weary johnson appeared on national television to announce a limited halt to the bombing of north vietnam to enable a negotiated cease fire agreement with the communists.
then he made an astounding announcement i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president as his daughter explained the agony of vietnam had engulfed her father.
johnson had become a tragic victim of his grandiose ambitions by promising far more than he could accomplish he raised false hopes stoked violent resentments and fractured society.
although u s troops would remain in vietnam for five more years the quest for military victory ended with johnsons presidency.
america tried to fight a limited war in vietnam.
the problem with the strategy was that the vietnamese communists fought an absolute war in defense of their country.
among other things the war revealed that the 1356 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 whose war.
president johnson lowers his head in disappointment as he listens to a commanders report from vietnam in 1968 resources of the united states including its military power were limited the nation could not have its way around the world.
now there were three candidates for the democratic nomination mccarthy kennedy and vice president hubert humphrey.
many anti war democrats expected mccarthy to drop out in favor of kennedy but the minnesota senator buoyed by his success and convinced of his moral superiority refused to leave the race.
for his part bobby kennedy with long hair and a boyish faith appealed to the idealism of americas youth promising them an end to the vietnam war and a more inclusive and transparent presidency some men see things as they are and ask why.
i dream things that never were and say why not the turmoil of the sixties by the late 1960s traditional notions of authority were under attack as an angry spirit of rebelliousness expanded into a powerful cultural movement.
the spirit of resistance was especially evident among disaffected youth who called into question not only the vietnam war and the credibility of the johnson administration but virtually every aspect of mainstream life including the traditional family structure the m iddle class work ethic universities religion and the nonviolent integrationist philosophy underpinning the civil rights movement.
many alienated young americans often lumped together as hippies felt that they were part of the revolution a magical force that would overthrow a corrupt and outdated way of life.
1968 a traumatic year all of the turbulent elements affecting american life came to a head in 1968 the most traumatic year in a traumatic decade.
as time magazine reported nineteen s ixty eight was a knife blade that severed past from future it was one tragic surprising and perplexing thing after another the turmoil of the sixties 1357 on april 4 james earl ray a petty thief drifter and white racist shot and killed martin luther king jr as the black leader stood outside the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee.
ray had earlier vowed that he was going to get the big nigger kings murder ignited a wave of violence.
riots erupted in more than 100 cities.
forty six people died all but five of them black.
some 20 000 army troops and 34 000 national guardsmen were mobilized across the country and 21 000 people were arrested.
the night that king died robert kennedy was in indianapolis indiana.
upon hearing the news he stood on a flatbed truck to speak to a grieving crowd of african americans.
those of you who are black can be filled with hatred with bitterness and a desire for revenge he said.
we can move toward further polarization.
or we can make an effort as dr king did to understand to reconcile ourselves and to love love was hard to find in 1968.
two months after kings death after midnight on june 6 1968 robert kennedy appeared at the ambassador hotel in los angeles to celebrate his victory over eugene mccarthy in the california presidential primary.
kennedy closed his remarks by pledging that we can end the divisions within the united states end the violence after the applause subsided kennedy walked through the hotel kitchen on his way to the press room for interviews.
along the way a jordanian arab named sirhan sirhan resentful of the senators strong support of israel pulled out a pistol and fired eight shots hitting kennedy in the head and wounding three others.
kennedy died the next morning.
only forty two years old kennedy was buried beside his brother john in arlington national cemetery outside of washington d c.
the assassinations of the kennedys martin luther king and malcolm x came to frame the sixties.
with their deaths a wealth of idealism died t oo the idealism that bobby kennedy had hoped would put a fragmented america back together again.
a growing number of young people felt orphaned from the political system.
having lost the leading voices for real change many of them lost hope in democracy and turned to radicalism and violence or dropped out of society.
chicago and miami in august 1968 the nations social unrest came to a head at the chicago democratic national convention where delegates gathered inside a convention hall to nominate johnsons faithful vice president hubert h humphrey as the partys candidate for president.
outside almost 20 000 police officers and national guard soldiers confronted thousands of passionate anti war protesters who taunted the police with obscenities.
richard j daley chicagos gruff democratic mayor warned 1358 chapter 29 a new f rontier and a great society 1960 1968 that he would not tolerate disruptions.
nonetheless riots broke out and were televised nationwide.
it was war in the streets.
as police used tear gas and clubs to pummel the demonstrators others chanted the whole world is watching as the new york times reported those were our children in the streets and the chicago police beat them up nationally the democratic party began to fragment as a result of the chaos in chicago.
three weeks earlier the republicans had gathered in miami beach to nominate richard nixon.
in 1962 after losing the california governors race nixon had vowed never again to run for public office.
by 1968 however he had changed his mind and become a s elf appointed spokesman for the values the election of 1968 wa or ca mt id nv nd wy ut az co sd ak ia ne ks ok nm tx hi mn nh 4 vt 3 wi ny mi pa oh in 26 wv va mo 7 12 ky 9 nc tn 11 1 ar sc ms al ga 7 10 la fl il me ma 14 ri 4 ct 8 nj 17 de 3 md 10 dc 3 electoral vote popular vote richard m nixon republican 31 700 000 hubert h humphrey democrat 31 200 000 george wallace american independent 10 000 000 how did the riots at the chicago democratic national convention affect the 1968 presidential campaign.
wwn64 what does the electoral map reveal about the support for each of the three figurecandidates.
m29 3 major first proof how was richard nixon able to win enough electoral votes in such a close three way presidential race.
what was george wallaces appeal to 10 million voters.
the turmoil of the sixties 1359 of middle america he and the republicans promised they would bring law and order to the nations streets.
nixon appealed to what he called the silent majority those who viewed the rabble rousing street protesters with contempt.
in accepting the nomination nixon promised to listen to the voice of the great majority of americans the forgotten americans the n on shouters the non demonstrators that are not racists or sick that are not guilty of the crime that plagues the land former alabama governor george wallace an outspoken segregationist dismissed both democrats and republicans as too liberal and ran on the american independent party ticket a party he formed to defend racial segregation.
wallace promised to get tough on scummy anarchists and bring stability to the nation.
he appealed even more forcefully than nixon to voters concerns about a nti war protesters the mushrooming federal welfare system the growth of the federal government forced racial integration and rioting in urban ghettos.
wallace displayed a savage wit once saying that the only four letter words that hippies did not know were w o r k and s o a p he predicted that on election day the nation would realize that there are a lot of rednecks in this country his candidacy generated considerable appeal outside his native south especially among white working class communities where resentment of johnsons great society liberalism flourished.
wallace hoped to deny humphrey and nixon an electoral majority and thereby throw the choice into the house of representatives.
nixon triumphant george wallaces hopes were dashed on election day however as richard nixon and his acid tongued running mate governor spiro agnew of maryland won a narrow victory.
nixon claimed 302 electoral votes to 191 for hubert humphrey.
wallaces 46 electoral votes all came from the lower south.
so at the end of the centurys most turbulent year a divided society looked to richard nixon to fulfill his promises to bring peace with honor in vietnam and to bring us together as a nation.
chapter review summary kennedys new frontier president john f kennedy promised a new frontier in 1961 but many of his domestic policies stalled in congress.
the bay of pigs fiasco led the soviet premier nikita khrushchev to test american resolve by erecting the berlin wall and installing nuclear armed missiles in cuba which provoked the cuban missile crisis.
determined to stand up to the soviets in october 1962 kennedy ordered a naval quarantine of cuba that led khrushchev to withdraw the missiles.
during his presidency kennedy deepened americas commitment in vietnam.
civil rights achievements at the beginning of the decade growing numbers of african americans and whites staged acts of nonviolent civil disobedience to protest discrimination in the south.
in 1960 activists formed the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc to intensify efforts to dismantle desegregation.
in 1961 courageous freedom riders attempted to integrate bus and train stations in the south.
the high point of the early phase of the civil rights movement was the 1963 march on washington for jobs and freedom at which martin luther king jr delivered his famous i have a dream speech.
later on the black power movement emerged and emphasized militancy black nationalism separatism and often violence.
johnsons great society lyndon johnson began his presidency committed to social reform especially civil rights.
he forced the civil rights act of 1964 through congress and then declared war on poverty by persuading congress to pass the economic opportunity act.
after his resounding victory in the 1964 presidential election he pushed his vision for a great society.
hundreds of initiatives expanded federal social welfare programs most noticeably the voting rights act of 1965 medicare and medicaid.
1968 presidential election frustrated by his failures in vietnam and aware that he had lost public support johnson chose not to seek reelection in 1968.
a nti war democrats rallied around senators eugene mccarthy and robert kennedy.
in april martin luther king jr was assassinated setting off violent riots in urban ghettos across the country.
then robert kennedy was assassinated in june.
ultimately the democrats selected johnsons loyal vice president hubert humphrey as their nominee provoking angry protests by anti war demonstrators at the 1968 chicago democratic national convention.
as they had in 1960 the republicans nominated richard nixon who claimed to represent the silent majority in the end nixon narrowly bested humphrey while wallace made one of the best showings ever by a third party candidate.

here a former marine throws his service uniform jacket and medals onto the capitol steps on april 23 1971 as part of a fi ve day protest against the u s invasion of laos.
a s richard m nixon entered the white house in early 1969 he took charge of a nation whose social fabric was in tatters.
the traumatic events of 1968 had been like a knife cutting the past away from the future revealing how deeply divided american society had become and how difficult a task nixon faced in carrying out his campaign pledge to restore social harmony.
ironically many of the same forces that had contributed to the complacent prosperity of the crew cut fifties the baby boom the cold war and the growing consumer culture helped generate the social upheaval of the sixties and early seventies.
the civil rights movement promoting equality for african americans inspired efforts to ensure equal treatment for other minorities including women gays native americans and hispanics.

1260 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 moderate republicanism dwight david eisenhower dominated the political landscape during the 1950s.
the military hero of the second world war was a model of moderation stability and optimism.
he was a soldier who hated war a politician who hated politics.
committed to what he called moderate republicanism eisenhower promised to restore the authority of state and local governments and restrain the federal government from engaging in political and social engineering in the process he sought to renew traditional virtues and inspire americans with a vision of a brighter future.
time for a change by 1952 the truman administration was the target of growing public criticism.
the conflict in korea had stalled the economy was sputtering and truman was put on the defensive by the disclosure that corrupt lobbyists had rigged military contracts.
the scandal led truman to fire nearly 250 employees of the inter nal revenue service but doubts lingered that he would ever finish the housecleaning.
critics charged that the slogan for his administration was plunder at home blunder abroad it was republicans claimed time for a change and public sentiment turned their way as the 1952 election ap proached.
beginning in the late 1940s both republican and democratic leaders including truman recruited eisenhower to be their presidential candidate.
the affable eisenhower known as ike had displayed remarkable organizational and diplomatic skill in coordinating the allied invasion of n azi controlled europe.
in 1952 after serving as president of columbia university he had moved to paris to become supreme commander dwight d eisenhower his many supporters wore i like ike hats pins of nato forces in europe.
his deciand even nylon stockings speaking to sion to run for president as a republican the powerful consumer cultures impact was wildly popular with voters.
bumper on politics.
stickers announced simply i like ike moderate republicanism 1261 eisenhower was nominated on the first ballot.
republican leaders then tried to reassure party conservatives by balancing the ticket with a youthful fiercely ambitious running mate richard m nixon a thirty nine year old california senator distinctive for his shrewd opportunism and combative temperament.
nixon was an aggressive a nti communist focused on exposing l eft wing subversives in the truman administration.
his dogged pursuit of the alger hiss spying case had brought him national prominence.
the republican platform declared that the democratic emphasis on containing communism was negative futile and misguided if elected eisenhower would roll back the communist threat by bringing genuine independence to the captive peoples of eastern europe.
the election of 1952 the presidential campaign featured contrasting personalities.
eisenhower was an international figure and a man of readily acknowledged decency and integrity.
his beaming smile and humble greatness won over the masses.
illinois governor adlai stevenson the democratic candidate was hardly known outside his home state.
eisenhower pledged to clean up the mess in washington then late in the campaign he promised to travel to korea to secure an early and honorable end to the prolonged conflict.
stevenson was outmatched.
although brilliant and witty he came across to most voters as more an intellectual than a leader republicans labeled him an egghead meant to suggest a balding professor with more intellect than common sense.
even truman grumbled that stevenson was too busy making up his mind whether he had to go to the bathroom or not on election night eisenhower triumphed in a landslide gathering nearly 34 million votes to stevensons 27 million.
the electoral vote was much more lopsided 442 to 89.
stevenson even failed to win his home state of illinois.
more important by securing four southern states eisenhower had cracked the solidly democratic south.
yet voters liked eisenhower more than they liked other republican candidates.
in the 1952 election democrats kept control of most governorships lost control in the house by only eight seats and broke even in the senate.
throughout his second presidential term eisenhower would have to work with a democratic congress.
a middle way presidency eisenhower was the first professional soldier elected president since ulysses s grant in 1868.
he promised to pursue a middle way between untrammeled freedom of the individual and the demands of the welfare of the whole nation he saw no need to dismantle all new deal and fair deal programs.
instead he wanted to end the excesses 1262 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 the election of 1952 wa or ca mt id nv nd wy ut az co sd ks ok nm wi mi me ma 16 ny ri 4 ct 8 nj 16 de 3 md 9 ia ne tx mn nh 4 vt 3 pa oh il in 25 wv va 27 13 mo 8 12 ky 10 nc tn 11 ar sc ms al ga 8 11 la fl electoral vote popular vote dwight d eisenhower republican 33 900 000 adlai e stevenson democrat 27 300 000 why was the contest between adlai stevenson and dwight d eisenhower so lopsided.

figure m28 1 first proof that had resulted from twenty years of democratic control of the white house.
he pledged to shrink the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient while restoring the balance between the executive and legislative branches.
eisenhower also promised to reduce the national debt cut military expenses balance the federal budget and trim taxes.
at the same time however he insisted that workers had a right to form unions and bargain with management.
he added that employees needed to be paid enough to afford the comforts of a good life.
we a ll workers and farmers foremen and financiers technicians and b uilders all must produce produce more and produce yet more he said to make the american dream a reality and to ensure global stability.
peace would be maintained not by weapons of war but by wheat and cotton moderate republicanism 1263 by milk and wool by meat and by timber and by rice he hated the growing arms race because every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed eisenhowers cautious personality and genial public face fit the prevailing mood of most voters.
he was a unifier not a divider he inspired trust sought consensus and avoided confrontation.
he also championed the nineteenth century view that congress should make policy and the president should carry it out.
dynamic conservatism at home eisenhower labeled his domestic program dynamic conservatism by which he meant being conservative when it comes to money and liberal when it comes to human beings he kept intact the basic structure of the new deal even convincing congress to establish a new federal department of health education and welfare and working with democrats in congress to extend social security benefits to millions of workers formerly excluded w hite collar professionals maids and sales clerks farmworkers and members of the armed forces.
eisenhower also approved increases in the minimum wage and additional public housing projects for low income occupants.
conservative republicans charged that he was being too liberal.
he told his brother edgar in 1954 that if the stupid right wing of the republican party tried to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history transportation improvements under eisenhower the federal government launched two huge construction projects the st lawrence seaway and the interstate highway system both of which resembled the huge public works projects constructed under the new deal during the 1930s.
the st lawrence seaway project in partnership with canada opened the great lakes to oceangoing ships.
the federal aid highway act 1956 created a national network of interstate highways to serve the needs of commerce and defense as well as the public.
the interstate highway system funded largely by federal gasoline taxes took twenty five years to construct and was the largest federal project in history.
it stretched for 47 000 miles and required 55 512 bridges.
highway construction generated what economists call multiplier effects it created jobs stimulated economic growth and spurred the tourism motor hotel motel billboard fast food and long haul trucking industries.
interstates transformed the way people traveled and where they lived and it 1264 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 even created a new form of m iddle c lass leisure the family vacation by car.
in 1956 writer bernard de voto exclaimed that a new highway is not only a measure of progress but a true index of our culture the car culture the amer ican the mississippi writer william faulkner observed in 1948 really loves drive in cash in founded by brothers nothing but his automobile americans maurice and richard mcdonald in had always cherished personal freedom southern california this hugely successful fast food chain started and mobility rugged individualism and as a carhop drive in and did not have masculine force.

ied these qualities and more.
thanks to the highway system said president eisenhower cars would provide greater convenience greater happiness and greater standards of living by 1958 57 million americans out of the national population of 175 million owned an automobile.
cars became much more than a form of transportation they provided social status and personal freedom.
they granted more people a wider range of choices where to travel where to work and live where to seek pleasure and recreation.
the car culture soon transformed social behavior prompting the creation of convenience stores drive in movies and fast food restaurants.
the end of mccarthyism republicans thought their presidential victory in 1952 would curb the often unscrupulous efforts of wisconsin senator joseph r mccarthy to ferret out communist spies in the federal government.
instead the p ublicity seeking senators behavior grew even more outlandish in part because reporters were dazzled by his theatrics.
president eisenhower despised mccarthy but refused to criticize him in public explaining that he did not want to get into a pissing contest with that skunk in march 1954 the president indirectly chastised mccarthy when he told a press conference that we are defeating ourselves if we use methods in opposing communism that do not conform to the american sense of justice mccarthy finally committed political suicide when he made the absurd charge that the u s army itself was soft on communism.
for thirty six days in the spring of 1954 the army mccarthy hearings provided 80 million television viewers with a fantastic spectacle.
mccarthy was at his worst hounding witnesses seeking publicity and producing little evidence to back up his charges.
he was finally outwitted by the deliberate reasoned counterattacks of a people of plenty 1265 the armys legal counsel joseph welch.
when mccarthy tried to smear one of welchs associates the attorney was outraged until this moment senator i think i never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.
have you no sense of decency sir at long last when the audience burst into applause the confused senator was reduced to whispering what did i do on december 2 1954 the senate voted 67 to 22 to condemn mccarthy.
soon thereafter his political influence collapsed.
his crusade against communists in government had catapulted him into the limelight and captured the nations attention but in the process he had trampled upon civil liberties.
now with unexpected suddenness his crusade was over.
his rapid demise helped the democrats capture control of both houses of congress in the 1954 elections.
in 1957 at the age of forty eight he died of liver inflammation brought on by years of alcohol abuse.
his successor william proxmire declared that mccarthy was a disgrace to wisconsin to the senate and to america a people of plenty what most distinguished the united states from the rest of the world after the second world war was what one journalist called americas screwball materialism after a brief postwar recession in 1945 1946 the economy soared to record heights as businesses shifted from wartime production to the construction of new housing and the manufacture of mass produced consumer goods.
in 1953 eisenhowers first year in office the united states with 6 percent of the worlds population was producing two thirds of the worlds manufactured goods.
in 1957 u s news and world report magazine declared that never had so many people anywhere been so well off postwar prosperity several factors created the nations prosperity.
first huge federal expenditures during the second world war and korean war propelled the economy out of the great depression.
high government spending continued in the 1950s thanks to the relentless construction of highways bridges airports and ports and the global arms race.
the military budget after 1945 represented the single most important stimulant to the economy.
the superior productivity of american industries also contributed to economic growth.
no sooner was the war over than the federal government turned over to civilian owners many war related plants giving them a boost as they retooled for peacetime manufacturing.
military related research helped stimulate new glamour industries chemicals including plastics electronics and aviation.
by 1957 the aircraft industry was the nations largest employer.
1266 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 postwar consumerism booming chain stores such as the super giant supermarket shown above began to dot the suburbs of 1950s america offering an outlet for the pent up consumerism of the postwar years.
the economy also benefited from the emergence of new technologies including the first generation of computers.
factories and industries became increasingly automated at the same time the oil boom in texas wyoming and oklahoma continued to provide low cost fuel to heat buildings and to power cars and trucks.
another reason for the r ecord breaking economic growth was the lack of foreign competition.
most of the other major industrial nations great britain france germany japan and the soviet u nion had been physically devastated during the second world war leaving american manufacturers with a virtual monopoly on international trade that lasted well into the 1950s.
the consumer culture the major catalyst for economic expansion after 1945 however was the unleashing of p ent up consumer demand from the depression and the war years.
what differentiated the postwar era from earlier periods of prosperity was the large number of people who shared in the rising standard of living.
between a people of plenty 1267 1947 and 1960 the average income for the working class increased by as much as it had in the previous fifty years.
more and more blue collar americans especially automotive and steel workers moved into the middle class.
george meany the leading union spokesman during the 1950s declared in 1955 that his members never had it so good americans had money to spend during the fifties and they did so with gusto becoming famous around the world for their carefree consumption.
in 1955 a marketing consultant stressed that the nation had come to view consumption a way of life the new economy required that we convert the buying and use of goods into religious rituals that we seek our spiritual satisfaction our ego satisfaction in consumption a buying spree innovations in financing made it easier to buy things.
the first credit card appeared in 1949 soon buying with plastic had become the new norm for millions of people.
personal indebtedness doubled in part because people were so confident about their economic future.
frugality became unpatriotic.
as television personality hugh downs remembered those were exciting days.
of hope and optimism.
when the sky was the limit what most americans wanted to buy after the second world war was a new house.
in 1945 only 40 percent of americans owned homes by 1960 the family modified the dynamics of american family life changed with the onslaught of new affordable products.
in this 1959 advertisement for tv dinners the family eats out of disposable containers in front of the television.
1268 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 number had increased to 60 percent.
new homes featured the latest electrical appliances refrigerators dishwashers washing machines vacuum cleaners electric mixers carving knives even shoe polishers.
the use of electricity tripled in part because of the popularity of television which quickly displaced listening to the radio or going to the movies as the most popular way to spend free time.
between 1948 and 1952 the number of homes with tv sets jumped from 172 000 to 15 3 million.
in 1954 grocery stores began selling frozen tv dinners to be heated and consumed while watching popular shows such as father knows best i love lucy and the adventures of ozzie and harriet all of which idealized the child centered world of suburban white families.
in 1955 u s news and world report magazine noted that the biggest of the new forces in american life today is television the popularity of television provided a powerful new medium for advertisers to promote a powerful new phase of the consumer culture that reshaped the contours of postwar life the nature of work where people lived and traveled how they interacted and what they valued.
it also affected class structure race relations and gender roles.
jack metzgar the son of a pennsylvania steelworker remembered that in 1946 we did not have a car a television set or a refrigerator.
by 1952 we had all those things the gi bill of rights in 1944 as americans grew confident of victory in the second world war fear that a sudden influx of veterans into the civilian workforce would produce widespread unemployment led congress to pass the servicemens readjustment act also called the veterans act and nicknamed the gi bill of rights.
gi meant government issue a phrase stamped on military uniforms and equipment that became slang for serviceman the gi bill boosted upward social mobility in postwar america.
its package of benefits for veterans included unemployment pay for one year preference to those applying for federal government jobs loans for home construction or starting a business access to government hospitals and generous subsidies for education.
some 5 million veterans bought homes with the assistance of gi bill mortgage loans which required no down payment.
almost 8 million took advantage of 14 5 billion in gi bill benefits to attend college or enroll in j ob t raining programs.
before the second world war about 160 000 americans had graduated from college each year.
by 1950 the figure had risen to 500 000.
in 1949 veterans accounted for 40 percent of college enrollments and the united states could boast the worlds best educated workforce largely because of the gi bill.
one example joe shi an army veteran from macon georgia was able to attend graduate school at the university of pennsylvania thanks to the gi bill.
a people of plenty 1269 overall the gi bill was one of the most successful federal programs in history.
for african american veterans however most colleges and universities remained racially segregated and refused to admit blacks.
those that did often discriminated against them.
african americans attending white colleges or universities were barred from playing on athletic teams attending social events and joining fraternities or sororities.
black veterans were also often prevented from buying homes in white neighborhoods.
although women veterans were eligible for gi bill benefits there were so few of them that the program had the unintended effect of widening the income gap between men and women.
the suburban frontier the second half of the twentieth century brought a mass migration to a new frontier the suburbs.
the acute postwar housing shortage 98 percent of cities reported shortages of houses and apartments in 1945 sparked the suburban revolution.
people were eager to escape from inner cities to the sprawling suburbs emerging in the countryside just outside of city or town limits.
of the 13 million homes built between 1948 and 1958 there were 11 million constructed in the suburbs.
many among the exploding m iddle class white population moved to what were called the sunbelt states california arizona florida texas and the southeast region where rapid population growth and new highways generated an economic boom.
as air conditioning became common in the sunbelt it greatly enhanced the appeal of living in warmer climates.
california led the way.
in 1940 it was the fifth most populous state by 1963 it was first.
suburbia met an acute need affordable housing and fulfilled a common dream personal freedom and family security within commuting distance of cities.
in the half century after the second world war the suburban good life included a big home with a big yard on a big lot accessed by a big c ar or two.
during the 1950s suburbs grew six times as fast as cities and by 1970 more people lived in suburbs than in cities.
a brassy new york real estate developer william levitt led the suburban levittown identical mass produced revolution.
he had made a fortune houses in levittown new york and other suburbs across the country during the war building housing units provided veterans and their families on new navy bases and around defense with affordable homes.
plants and after the war he put his 1270 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 expertise to use in the suburbs.
between 1947 and 1951 on 6 000 acres of long island farmland forty miles east of new york city he built 17 447 small 750 square feet sturdy two bedroom homes to house more than 82 000 mostly lower middle class people.
levitt believed he was enabling the american dream.
no man who owns his own lot and his own house can be a communist he said.
the planned community called levittown included schools swimming pools shopping centers and playing fields.
levitt encouraged and even enforced uniformity and conformity.
the lookalike houses came in different colors but only three s tyles the cape cod the rancher and the colonial.
all sold for the same low price 6 990 with no down payments for veterans and featured the same floor plan and accessories.
each had a living room with a picture window and a television set a bathroom two bedrooms and a kitchen equipped with an electric refrigerator oven and washing machine.
trees were planted every t wenty eight feet in the former potato fields homeowners were required to cut their grass once a week and prohibited from hanging laundry on outside clothes lines during weekends.
when the first houses in levittown went on sale people stood in long lines to buy one.
in seven days levitt sold 707 houses.
he soon built three more levittowns in pennsylvania new jersey and puerto rico.
they and other planned suburban communities benefited greatly from government assistance.
federal and state tax codes favored homeowners over renters and local governments paid for the infrastructure the subdivisions required roads water and sewer lines fire and police protection.
by insuring loans for up to 95 percent of the value of a house the federal housing administration fha made it easy for builders to construct low cost homes and for people to purchase them.
levitt and other suburban developers created lily white communities outside mostly black populated cities.
initially the contracts for houses in levittown specifically excluded members of other than the caucasian race as levitt explained we can solve a housing problem or we can try to solve a racial problem.
but we cant combine the two it wasnt long however before the u s supreme court ruled in shelley v kraemer 1948 that such racial restrictions were illegal.
the court ruling however did not end segregated housing practices it simply made them more discreet.
in 1953 when levittowns population reached 70 000 it was the largest community in the nation without a single african american resident.
although jewish himself levitt also discouraged jews from living in his communities.
as a jew he explained i have no room in my heart for racial prejudice.
but the plain fact is that most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities.
this attitude may be wrong morally and someday it may change.
i hope it will other developers across the country soon mimicked levitts efforts building suburban communities with rustic names such as lakewood streamwood a people of plenty 1271 the second great migration african american families such as the new jersey bound family pictured here moved to northern urban centers in droves following the end of world war ii.
elmwood cedar hill park forest and deer park.
in 1955 house and garden magazine could declare that suburbia had become the national way of life by 1960 however only 5 percent of african americans lived in suburbs.
minorities on the move the mass migration of rural southern blacks to the urban north midwest and west after the second world war was much larger than the migration that occurred after the first world war and its social consequences were even more dramatic.
after 1945 more than 5 million blacks left the south in search of better jobs higher wages decent housing and greater civil rights.
by 1960 for the first time in history more african americans were living in urban areas than in rural areas.
as blacks moved into northern cities many white residents moved to the suburbs leaving behind racial ghettos.
between 1950 and 1960 some 3 6 million whites left the nations largest cities for suburban neighborhoods while 4 5 million blacks moved into the cities.
deeply entrenched racial attitudes outside the south forced blacks to work to counter the hostility they confronted.
through organizations such as the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp the congress of racial equality core and the national urban league they sought to change 1272 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 the hearts and minds of their white neighbors.
however for all of the racism that black migrants encountered most found their new lives preferable to the enforced segregation and often violent racism in the south.
southern blacks still faced voting discrimination and segregation in theaters parks schools colleges hospitals buses cinemas libraries restrooms beaches bars and prisons.
just as african americans were on the move so too were mexicans and puerto ricans.
congress renewed the bracero program begun during the second world war which enabled mexicans to work as wage laborers in the united states often as migrant workers moving from farm to farm as needed.
mexicans streamed across the nations southwest border.
by 1960 los angeles had the largest concentration of mexican americans in the nation.
mexican americans puerto ricans and other hispanic latino minorities who served in the military also benefited from the gi bill.
many of them and their families were able to relocate to the mainland united states because of the educational and housing programs provided veterans through the federal government.
between 1940 and 1960 nearly a million puerto ricans mostly small farmers and agricultural workers moved into american cities especially new york city.
by the late 1960s more puerto ricans lived in new york city than in san juan the capital of puerto rico.
shifting womens roles during the second world war millions of women had assumed traditionally male jobs in factories and mills.
after the war those women were encouraged to return to their traditional roles as loving wives caring mothers and happy homemakers.
a 1945 article in house beautiful magazine informed women that the returning war veteran was head man again.
your part in the remaking of this man is to fit his home to him understanding why he wants it this way forgetting your own preferences advertisements in popular magazines often targeted m iddle class women depicting them happily bound to the house at work in the kitchen in dresses adorned with jewelry usually pearl necklaces and high heel shoes conversing with children serving dinner cleaning and otherwise displaying the joy of a clean home or the latest kitchen appliance.
the prevailing images of middle class life featured tree lined suburban streets kids riding their bikes through beautiful neighborhoods and women as devoted servants to their husbands.
idealized images of the happy homemaker and suburban life in popular television programs like the donna reed show or leave it to beaver also supported the cold war campaign to portray the superiority of capitalism democracy freedom and religion over communism.
russian women were depicted toiling in drudgery in drab factories or on government farms.

female college students were encouraged to take such courses as home economics interior decoration and family finance.
lynn white president of mills college argued that the curriculum for female students should prepare women to foster the intellectual and emotional life of her family and community despite this version of the nineteenth centurys cult of domesticity many women did work outside the home usually out of necessity.
in 1950 women comprised 29 percent of the workforce and that percentage rose steadily throughout the decade.
some 70 percent of employed women worked in clerical positions as secretaries bank tellers or sales clerks or on assembly lines or in the service industry waitresses laundresses maids.
less than 15 percent were employed in a professional capacity teachers nurses accountants social workers.
women represented only 3 5 percent of attorneys and 6 percent of physicians.
african american and other minority women had even fewer 1274 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 vocational choices and were mostly delegated to low paying service jobs such as maids and cooks.

the record number of americans born during the postwar period roughly 1941 1964 composed what came to be known as the baby boom generation which would shape the nations social and cultural life throughout the second half of the twentieth century and after.
the fifties was the ideal decade to be a child.
the horrors of the second world war were over the economy was surging and social life became centered on the needs of children because there were so many of them.
between 1946 and 1964 the birth of 76 million americans reversed a century long decline in the nations birthrate and created a demographic upheaval whose repercussions are still being felt.
the baby boom peaked in 1957 when a record 4 3 million births occurred one every seven seconds.
a majority of brides during the fifties were pregnant within seven months of their wedding and they didnt stop at one child.
from 1940 to 1960 the number of families with three children doubled and the number with four quadrupled.
dr benjamin spocks the common sense book of baby and child care sold more than a million copies per year during the fifties.
postwar babies initially created a surge in demand for diapers washing ma chines and baby food then required a people of plenty 1275 the construction of thousands of new schools and the hiring of teachers to staff them.
childrens needs drove much of the economys growth creating a huge market for toys candy gum records clothes and other items.

president eisenhower promoted a patriotic religious crusade.
recognition of the supreme being he declared is the first the most basic expression of americanism.
without god there could be no american form of government nor an american way of life in 1954 congress added the phrase one nation under god to the pledge of allegiance.
in 1956 it made the statement in god we trust the nations official motto.
eisenhower ordered that the motto be displayed on all currency.
today in the united states time magazine claimed in 1954 the christian faith is back at the center of things the prevailing tone of the religious revival was upbeat and soothing.

poverty amid prosperity uncritical praise for the throwaway culture of consumption masked the chronic poverty amid americas mythic plenty.

poverty afflicted nearly half of the african american population compared to only a quarter of whites.
although by 1950 blacks were earning on average more than four times their 1940 wages they and other minority groups lagged well behind whites in their rate of improvement.
at least 40 million people remained poor during the 1950s but their plight was largely ignored.
cracks in the picture window 1277 family on relief many black families who migrated from the south to the midwest became a part of a marginalized population in chicago dependent on public housing and experiencing the norths forms of racism.
the promised land in the north was not perfect.
because those who left the south were often undereducated poor and black they were regularly denied access to good jobs good schools and good housing.
although states in the north midwest and far west did not have the same blatant forms of racial discrimination as the south african americans still encountered prejudice and discrimination in workplace hiring housing schools and social life.
literature as social criticism one of the most striking aspects of the fifties was the sharp contrast between the happy public mood and the increasingly bitter social criticism from intellectuals theologians novelists playwrights poets and artists who questioned the prevailing attitude about the superiority of the american way of life.
playwright thornton wilder labeled the young adults of the fifties the silent generation because of the smug complacency prevalent among upper middle class whites.
writer norman mailer was equally disdainful.

as novelist john updike observed he and other writers felt estranged from a government that extolled business and mediocrity the most enduring novels of the postwar period emphasized the individuals struggle for survival amid the smothering forces of mass society.

neither contentment nor respect in an uninterested world.
the upper middle class white suburbs and the culture of comfortable conformity they created were frequent literary targets.
writer john cheever located most of his short stories in suburban n eighborhoods cesspools of conformity where democratic equality created a social life that was mindless and hollow.

they were known as the beats a term with multiple meanings to be beat was likened to cracks in the picture window 1279 being upbeat and even beatific as well as being on the beat in real cool jazz music.

at heart the beats were romantics searching for an authentic sense of self in a nation absorbed in consumerism conformism and a nti communism.
their tortured rebelliousness set the stage for the more widespread youth revolt of the 1960s.
rock n roll the millions of children making up the first wave of the baby boomers became adolescents in the 1950s.
there were so many of them that people began calling them teenagers.
a distinctive teen subculture began to emerge as did a wave of juvenile delinquency.
by 1956 more than a million teens were being arrested each year.
one contributing factor was access to automobiles which enabled teens to escape parental control and in the words of one journalist provided a private lounge for drinking and for petting embracing and kissing or sex episodes many blamed teen delinquency on rock n roll a new form of music that emerged during the 1950s.
alan freed a cleveland disc jockey known as moondog coined the term rock n roll in 1951.
he had noticed that white teenagers buying rhythm and blues r b records preferred the livelier recordings by african americans and hispanic americans.
freed began playing r b records on his radio show but he called the music rock n roll a phrase used in african american communities to refer to dancing and sex.
by 1954 freed had moved to new york city where his popular program helped bridge the gap between white and black music.
african american singers such as chuck berry little richard and ray charles as well as hispanic american performers such as ritchie valens richard valenzuela captivated young white middle class audiences.
at the same time sam phillips a radio disk jockey in memphis tennessee was searching for a particular type of pop singer.
if i could find a white man with a negro sound phillips said i could make a billion dollars he found his singer in elvis presley the lanky son of poor mississippi farmers.
in 1956 the twenty one year old presley by then a regional star famous for his long unruly hair sullen yet sensual sneer and swiveling hips released his smash hit recording heartbreak hotel over the next two years he emerged as the most popular musician in american history carrying rock n roll across the race barrier and assaulting the bland conformity of fifties culture.
presleys gyrating performances his nickname was elvis the pelvis and incomparably rich and raw baritone voice drove young people wild and earned him millions of fans around the world.
his movements said one music critic suggest in a word sex the civil rights movement 1281 cultural conservatives were outraged and urged parents to destroy presleys records because they promoted a pagan concept of life a roman catholic official denounced presley as a vile symptom of a teenage creed of dishonesty violence lust and degeneration patriotic groups claimed that rock n roll music was part of a communist plot to corrupt americas youth.

the gangster of tomorrow is the elvis presley type of today yet rock n roll flourished in part because it was so controversial.
it gave teenagers a self conscious sense of belonging to a tribal social group.
more important it brought together on equal terms musicians and their audiences of varied races and backgrounds.
the civil rights movement soon after the cold war began soviet diplomats began to use americas racial discrimination against african americans as a propaganda tool to illustrate the defects of the american way of life.
under the jim crow system in the southern states blacks still risked being lynched if they registered to vote.
they were forced to use separate facilities water fountains restrooms hotels theaters parks and to attend segregated schools.
in the north discrimination was not as official but it was equally real especially in housing and employment.
president eisenhower had an opportunity to exercise transformational leadership in race relations his unwillingness to do so was his greatest failure.
as time magazine noted in 1958 eisenhower overlooked the fact that the u s needed his moral leadership in fighting segregation eisenhower and race eisenhower had entered the white house committed to civil rights in principle and he pushed for improvements in 1282 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 some areas.
during his first three years public facilities parks playgrounds libraries restaurants in washington d c were desegregated and he intervened to end discrimination at military bases in virginia and south carolina.
he also appointed the first african american to an executive office e frederic morrow who was named administrative officer for special projects.
beyond that however eisenhower refused to make civil rights for african americans a moral crusade.
pushing too hard he believed would raise tempers and increase prejudices doing more harm than good.
two aspects of eisenhowers political philosophy limited his commitment to racial equality his preference for state or local action over federal involvement and his doubt that laws could change attitudes.
i dont believe you can change the hearts of men with laws or decisions he insisted.
his passive attitude meant that governmental leadership on civil rights would come from the judiciary more than from the executive or legislative branches.
in 1953 eisenhower appointed former republican governor earl warren of california as chief justice of the u s supreme court a decision he later said was the biggest damn fool mistake i ever made warren who had seemed safely conservative while in elected office displayed a social conscience and a streak of libertarianism on the bench.
under warrens leadership 1953 1969 the supreme court became a powerful force for social and political change.
african american activism the m ost crucial leaders of the civil rights movement came from those whose rights were most often violated african americans hispanic americans asian americans and other minorities.
courageous blacks led what would become the most important social movement in twentieth century american history.
with intelligence bravery and dignity they fought in the courts at the ballot box and in the streets.
although many african americans moved to the north and west during and after the second world war a majority remained in the south where they still faced a rigidly segregated society.
in the 1952 presidential election for example only 20 percent of eligible african americans were registered to vote.
in addition the public schools especially in the south were supposedly racially separate but equal in quality.
in fact however many a ll black schools were underfunded understaffed and overcrowded.
in the m id 1930s the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp challenged the separate but equal judicial doctrine that had preserved racial segregation since the plessy decision by the supreme court in 1896.
it took almost fifteen years however to convince the courts that racial segregation must end.
finally in sweatt v painter 1950 the supreme court ruled that a separate black law school in texas was not equal in quality to the the civil rights movement 1283 fountains of truth an alabama motel offers its white patrons chilled water from a cooler while its african american guests must use a simple drinking fountain.
states whites only schools.
the court ordered the state to remedy the situation.
it was the first step toward dismantling americas tradition of racial segregation.
the brown decision by the early 1950s people were challenging state laws mandating racial segregation in the public schools.
five such cases from kansas delaware south carolina virginia and the district of columbia usually cited by reference to the first brown v board of education of topeka k ansas went to the supreme court in 1952.
president eisenhower told the attorney general that he hoped the justices would postpone dealing with the explosive case until the next administration took over when it became obvious that the court was moving forward eisenhower urged chief justice warren to side with segregationists.
warren was not swayed you mind your business he told the president and ill mind mine warren wrote the pathbreaking opinion delivered on may 17 1954 in which the court declared that in the field of public education the doctrine of separate but equal has no place the justices used a variety of sociological and psychological findings to show that even if racially separate schools were equal in quality the very practice of separating students by race caused feelings of inferiority among black children.
a year later the court directed that the process of racial integration should move with all deliberate speed eisenhower refused to endorse or enforce the courts ruling.
privately he grumbled that the supreme court decision set back progress in the south at 1284 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 least fifteen years anyone who thinks you can do these things by force is just plain nuts he said.
eisenhower had little faith in the ability of law to change the human heart or eliminate prejudice while token racial integration began as early as 1954 in kentucky and missouri hostility mounted in the lower south and virginia.
the alabama state senate and the virginia legislature both passed resolutions nullifying the supreme courts decision arguing that racial integration was an issue of states rights.
arkansas governor orval faubus insisted that the federal government is a creature of the states.
we must either choose to defend our rights or else surrender in 1954 harry f byrd a virginia senator and former governor supplied a rallying cry for diehard white racists when he called for massive resistance against federal efforts to enforce integration in the south.
senator james o eastland of mississippi a state where african americans made up 45 percent of the population pledged that integration will never come to mississippi and denounced the brown decision as an illegal immoral and sinful doctrine he told the senate that the negro race is an inferior race and that the south was determined to maintain white supremacy the grassroots opposition among southern whites to the brown case was led by newly formed citizens councils middle class versions of the ku klux klan separate but not equal african american children pose outside their segregated schoolhouse in selma alabama in 1965.
the civil rights movement 1285 that spread quickly and eventually enrolled 250 000 members.
instead of physical violence the councils used economic coercion against blacks who crossed racial boundaries.
the citizens councils grew so powerful in some communities that membership became almost a necessity for an aspiring white politician.
the opponents of court ordered integration were militantly defiant.
in 1956 a declaration of constitutional principles southern manifesto was signed by 101 members of congress deploring the brown decision as a clear abuse of judicial power that had created an explosive and dangerous condition in the south.
only three southern democrats refused to sign.
one of them senator lyndon b johnson of texas would become president seven years later.
in six southern states at the end of 1956 two years after the brown ruling no black children attended school with whites.
some southern politicians threatened to shut down white schools rather than allow racial integration.
the montgomery bus boycott the brown case did much more than mobilize white resistance.
it inspired many blacks and white activists by suggesting that the federal government was finally beginning to confront racial discrimination.
yet the essential role played by the naacp and the courts in the civil rights movement often overshadows the courageous contributions of individual african americans who took great personal risks to challenge segregation.
for example in montgomery alabama on december 1 1955 mrs rosa parks a forty two year old black seamstress who was a fiercely determined activist for racial justice refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man.
by doing so she launched the modern civil rights movement.
like many southern communities montgomery the cradle of the confederacy required blacks to sit in the rear seats of buses or trains.
they could sit in the front seats designated for whites only if there were empty seats.
if a white rider asked a black to move they were expected to go to the back of the bus parks however was tired of giving in when the bus driver told her that niggers must move back or he would have her arrested she replied with quiet courage you may do that police then arrested her.
the next night black community leaders met at dexter avenue baptist church to organize a long planned boycott of the citys bus system most of whose riders were african americans.
student and faculty volunteers from alabama state university stayed up all night to distribute 35 000 flyers denouncing the arrest of rosa parks and urging support for the montgomery bus boycott.
martin luther king jr.
in the dexter avenue churchs twenty six year old pastor martin luther king jr the boycott movement found a 1286 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 rosa parks parks is fingerprinted by a montgomery policeman on february 22 1956 along with about 100 others who joined the bus boycott.
brave and charismatic leader.
born in atlanta the grandson of a slave and son of a prominent minister king was intelligent courageous and an eloquent and passionate speaker.
we must use the weapon of love king told supporters.
we must realize so many people are taught to hate us that they are not totally responsible for their hate to his foes king warned we will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process king preached nonviolent civil disobedience the tactic of defying unjust laws through peaceful actions but he also valued militancy for without crisis and confrontation with those in power there would be no negotiation or progress.
the montgomery bus boycott was a stunning s uccess but it was not easy.
for 381 days african americans women and men organized carpools used black owned taxis hitchhiked or simply walked.
white supporters also provided rides.
a few boycotters rode horses or mules to work.
the unprecedented mass protest infuriated many whites police harassed and ticketed black carpools and white thugs attacked black pedestrians.
ku klux klan the civil rights movement 1287 members burned black churches and bombed houses owned by king and other boycott leaders.
king himself was arrested twice.
in trying to calm an angry black crowd he urged restraint dont get panicky.
dont get your weapons.
we want to love our enemies on december 20 1956 the montgomery boycotters won a federal case they had initiated against racial segregation on public buses.
the supreme court affirmed that the separate but equal doctrine can no longer be safely followed as a correct statement of the law the next day king and other african americans boarded the city buses.
the success of the boycott showed that well coordinated nonviolent black activism could trigger major changes in public policy.
among african americans hope replaced resignation and action supplanted passivity.
the boycott also catapulted king into the national spotlight.
and what of rosa parks.
she and her husband lost their jobs and hate mail as well as death threats and firebombings forced them to leave alabama eight months after her arrest.
they moved to detroit where they remained fully engaged in the evolving civil rights movement.
the civil rights acts of 1957 and 1960 president eisenhowers timidity in the area of race relations emerged again when he was asked to protect the right of african americans to vote.
in 1956 hoping to exploit civil disobedience martin luther king jr is roughly arrested for loitering in 1958.
he would be arrested thirty times in his life for defying racist laws.
1288 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 divisions between northern and southern democrats and reclaim some of the black vote for republicans congressional leaders agreed to support what became the civil rights act of 1957.
the first civil rights law passed since 1875 it finally got through the senate after a years delay with the help of majority leader lyndon b johnson a texas democrat who knew that he could never be elected president if he was viewed as just another racist white southerner.
the bill was intended to ensure that all americans regardless of race or ethnicity were allowed to vote.
johnson won southern acceptance of the bill by watering down its enforcement provisions.
eisenhower reassured johnson that the final version represented the mildest civil rights bill possible the civil rights act established the civil rights commission and a new civil rights division in the justice department intended to prevent interference with the right to vote.
yet by 1959 the law had not resulted in a single southern black voter being added to the rolls.
neither did the civil rights act of 1960 which provided for federal courts to register african americans to vote in districts where there was a pattern and practice of racial discrimination.
this bill too lacked teeth and depended upon vigorous presidential enforcement to achieve any tangible results.
desegregation in little rock a few weeks after the civil rights act of 1957 was passed arkansass democratic governor orval eugene faubus a rabid segregationist eager to win a third term called a special session of the state legislature to pass a series of bills designed to give him sweeping new powers to close public schools threatened with integration and to transfer funds from public schools facing federally enforced integration to private segregation academies faubus defied a federal court order by using the states national guard to prevent nine black students from enrolling at little rocks central high school.
the national guard commanders orders were explicit no niggers in the building when one of the students fi fteen year old elizabeth eckford tried to enter the school a surging mob of jeering whites shrieked lynch her.
lynch her local authorities removed the black students and the mayor of little rock frantically called the white house to request federal troops explaining that faubus was creating tensions where none existed at that point eisenhower who had resisted all appeals for federal action reluctantly dispatched 1 000 army paratroopers of the 101st airborne division to protect the brave black students as they entered the school.
mob rule he told the nation cannot be allowed to overrule the decisions of our courts it was one of the nations most painful and momentous confrontations the first time since the 1870s that federal troops had been sent to the south to protect the civil rights movement 1289 lynch her fifteen year old elizabeth eckford endures the hostile screams of future classmates as she enters central high school in little rock arkansas.
the rights of african americans.
dunbar ogden a presbyterian minister in little rock found a ray of hope in the ugly confrontation this may be looked back upon by future historians as the turning point for g ood of race relations in this country faubus claimed that arkansas was now an occupied territory with television cameras sending images across the country seasoned paratroopers used bayonets and rifle butts to disperse the angry crowd.
inside central high school the nine black students attended their first classes with soldiers patrolling the halls.
during lunch hour two white pupils saw a black student eating alone.
they asked would you like to come over to our table the grateful boy replied gosh id love to the soldiers stayed in little rock through the school year.
to a man unyielding southern governors and congressmen furiously lashed out at eisenhower 1290 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 charging that he was violating states rights.
eisenhower had lit the fires of hate claimed senator james eastland.
a south carolina moderate took a different tack those who believed that integration could be accomplished gradually and peacefully are now convinced that eisenhower will have to use force all the way eisenhower was quick to stress that his use of federal troops had little to do with the integration or segregation question and everything to do with maintaining law and order.
in his view the gleaming bayonets in little rock showed that the united states was a government of law that the constitution remained the supreme law of the land and that the u s supreme court was the final interpreter of the constitution.
martin luther king jr who had earlier criticized eisenhowers tepid support of civil rights told the president that the overwhelming majority of southerners negro and white stand behind your resolute action to restore law and order in little rock many southern politicians called for the presidents impeachment and removal.
in the summer of 1958 governor faubus supported by the state legislature closed the little rock high schools rather than allow racial integration.
the governor of virginia did the same in his state.
their actions led jonathan daniels editor of the raleigh north carolina news observer to write that closing public schools is something beyond secession from the union it is secession from civilization court proceedings in arkansas dragged into 1959 before the schools re opened.
resistance to integration in virginia collapsed when state and federal courts struck down state laws that had cut off funds to integrated public schools.
thereafter massive resistance to racial integration was confined mostly to the lower south where five states from south carolina westward through louisiana still opposed even token integration.
faubus went on to serve six terms as governor of arkansas.
southern christian leadership conference after little rock progress toward greater civil rights seemed agonizingly slow.
frustrated african americans began blaming the naacp for relying too much on the courts.
the negro masses are angry and restless tired of prolonged legal battles that end in paper decrees reported black journalist louis lomax.
the widespread sense of disappointment gave martin luther kings nonviolent civil rights movement even greater visibility.
as king explained we were confronted with blasted hopes and the dark shadow of a deep disappointment settled upon us.
so we had no alternative except that of preparing for direct action whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and national community foreign policy in the fifties 1291 on january 10 1957 dr king invited about sixty black ministers and leaders to ebenezer church in atlanta.
their goal was to form an organization to coordinate and support nonviolent direct action as a method of desegregating bus systems across the south.
after a f ollow up meeting in new orleans on february 15 a new organization emerged the southern christian leadership conference sclc with dr king as its president.
unlike the naacp which recruited individual members sclc coordinated activities on behalf of a cluster of organizations mostly individual churches or community groups.
because dr king pushed for direct action against the segregated south only a few african american ministers were initially willing to affiliate with sclc for fear of a white backlash.
king persisted however and over time sclc grew into a powerful organization.
the activists knew that violence awaited them.
roy wilkins head of the naacp noted that the negro citizen has come to the point where he is not afraid of violence.
he no longer shrinks back.
he will assert himself and if violence comes so be it thus began the second phase of the civil rights movement a phase that would come to fruition in the 1960s as king and other african american activists showed the nation the courage to resist injustice the power to love everyone and the strength to endure discouragement and opposition.
foreign policy in the fifties the truman administrations commitment to contain communism focused on the soviet threat to western europe.
during the 1950s the eisenhower administration especially secretary of state john foster dulles expanded americas objective in the cold war.
containment was no longer enough the united states must develop a dynamic foreign policy that would roll back communism around the world.
dulless goal was to liberate those people under communist rule rather than merely contain communist expansion.
as a cold warrior dulles expected every nation to choose sides.
for us he said there are two kinds of people in the world.
there are those who are christians and support free enterprise and there are the others he soon discovered however that the complexities of world affairs and the realities of soviet and communist chinese power made his moral commitment to manage the destiny of the world unrealistic and costly.
concluding an armistice in korea eisenhower who had a unique understanding of the relationship between diplomacy and military force faced three choices increase the war effort continue the military 1292 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 stalemate or pursue a negotiated settlement.
eisenhower chose the third option but he first had to convince dulles that negotiations were warranted.
dulles did not want peace until the chinese had suffered one hell of a licking and the two koreas had been reunited.
in april 1953 eisenhower told dulles that he was not willing to prolong the military effort but he was comfortable using the threat of nuclear weapons and other actions to break the impasse in the stalled negotiations.
in may 1953 eisenhower took the bold step of intensifying the aerial bombardment of north korea.
the president let it be known that he would dont be a fraid i can always pull use nuclear weapons if a truce were you back secretary of state john not forthcoming.
thereafter negotifoster dulles pushes a reluctant america to the brink of war.
ations moved quickly toward a c ease fire agreement called an armistice on july 26 1953.
it ended all acts of armed force and reaffirmed the historical border between the two koreas just above the 38th parallel until both sides could arrive at a final peaceful settlement other factors in bringing about the armistice were chinas rising military losses in the conflict and the spirit of uncertainty and caution felt by the soviet communists after the death of josef stalin on march 5 1953 six weeks after eisenhowers inauguration.
the korean war had effects far beyond the divided nations borders.
it was the first war in which helicopters were used in combat and it ushered in the era of jet fighters.
the conflict transformed the united states into the worlds policeman by convincing american political and military leaders that communism was indeed a global threat.
within a few years the united states would create scores of permanent military bases around the world and organize a permanent national security apparatus in washington to manage its new responsibilities not the least of which was a growing stockpile of nuclear weaponry.
dulles and massive re taliation like woodrow wilson secretary of state dulles was a presbyterian ministers son whose favorite hymn was onward christian soldiers s elf righteous and humorless he believed foreign policy in the fifties 1293 that the united states was born with a sense of destiny and mission to defeat communism.
his british counterparts however were not im pressed with his sermonizing monologues calling them dull duller dulles dulles insisted that the democratic policy of containing communism was immoral because it did nothing to free people from oppression.
america he argued should work toward the liberation of the captive peoples of eastern europe and china.
when state department analyst george f kennan architect of the containment doctrine dismissed dulless rhetoric as lunacy dulles fired him.
eisenhower however understood kennans objections.
he was quick to explain that the liberation doctrine would not involve military force.
instead he would promote the removal of communist control by every peaceful means but only by peaceful means yet he did nothing to temper dulless rhetoric and praised his secretary of states moral fervor.
dulles and eisenhower knew that the united states could not win a ground war against the soviet union or communist china whose armies had millions more soldiers than did the united states.
nor could the administration afford politically or financially to sustain military expenditures at the levels required during the korean war.
so dulles and eisenhower crafted a strategy that came to be called massive retaliation which meant using the threat of nuclear warfare massive retaliatory power to prevent communist aggression.
the strategy they argued would provide a maximum deterrent at bearable cost massive retaliation had major weaknesses however.
by the mid 1950s both the united states and the soviet union had developed hydrogen bombs which were 750 times as powerful as the atomic bombs dropped on japan in 1945.
a single hydrogen bomb would have a devastating global impact yet war planners envisioned using hundreds of them.
the necessary art dulles explained was in the brinkmanship the ability to get to the verge without getting into war.
if you are scared to go to the brink you are lost the milwaukee journal found dulless brinkmanship strategy terrifying it is like saying that the closer you get to war the better you serve peace.
it is like saying that the destiny of the human race is something to gamble with the cias foreign interventions while eisenhower and dulles were publicly promoting the liberation of communist nations and massive retaliation as a strategy against the soviets they were secretly using the new central intelligence agency cia to manipulate world politics in covert ways that produced unintended consequences all of them bad.
the a nti colonial independence movements unleashed by the second world war placed the united states in the awkward position of watching 1294 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 nationalist groups around the globe revolt against british and french rule.
in iran in may 1951 the parliament seized control of the nations b ritish run oil industry.
the following year a newly elected prime minister mohammed mossadegh cut all diplomatic ties with great britain and insisted that iran not britain should own sell and profit from iranian oil.
dulles predicted that iran was on the verge of falling under communist control.
the cia and the british intelligence service mi6 then launched operation ajax designed in the words of the agencys head allen dulles the secretary of states brother to bring about the fall of mossadegh in 1954 the cia bribed iranian army officers and hired iranian agents to arrest mossadegh who was convicted of high treason.
he was imprisoned for three years then put under house arrest until his death in 1967.
in return for access to iranian oil the u s government thereafter provided massive support for the anti communist and increasingly authoritarian regime of the shah king of iran mohammad reza pahlavi who consolidated power after the removal of mossadegh.
in the end operation ajax proved to be a disaster by reinstating the incompetent and indecisive shah.
the success of the cia engineered coup in iran emboldened eisenhower to authorize other secret operations to undermine unfriendly government re gimes even if it meant aligning with corrupt dictatorships.
in 1954 the target was guatemala a desperately poor c entral american country led by colonel jacobo arbenz guzman.
arbenzs decision to take over u s owned property and industries convinced dulles that guatemala was falling victim to international communism dulles per suaded eisenhower to approve a cia operation to organize a secret guatemalan army in honduras.
on june 18 1954 aided by cia piloted warplanes 150 paid liberators crossed the border and forced arbenz guzman into exile in mexico.
the united states then installed a new ruler in guatemala who eliminated all political opposition.
by secretly overthrowing elected governments to ensure that they did not join the soviet bloc however the cia operations destabilized iran and guatemala and created problems in the middle east and central america that would eventually come back to haunt the united states.
indochina during the 1950s the united states also became embroiled in southeast asia.
indochina created by french imperialists in the nineteenth century out of the old kingdoms of cambodia laos and vietnam offered a distinctive case of a nti colonial nationalism.
during the second world war after japanese troops occupied the region the viet minh league for the independence of vietnam waged a guerrilla resistance movement led by ho chi minh a seasoned revolutionary and passionate nationalist.
foreign policy in the fifties 1295 uncle ho a wispy man weighing barely 100 pounds worked sixteen hours each day toward a single goal independence for his country.
at the end of the war against japan the viet minh controlled part of northern vietnam.
on september 2 1945 ho chi minh proclaimed the creation of a democratic republic of vietnam with its capital in hanoi.
the french like the americans would later underestimated the determination of ho and the vietnamese nationalists to maintain their independence.
in 1946 the first indochina war began when hos fighters resisted french efforts to restore the colonial regime.
french forces quickly regained control of the cities while the viet minh controlled the countryside.
ho predicted that his forces would absorb more losses but the french would give ho chi minh though a ruthless leader he cultivated a public image of himself in first.
when the korean war ended as the humble gentle uncle ho a man the united states continued its efforts of the people.
to strengthen french control of vietnam.
by the end of 1953 the eisenhower administration was paying nearly 80 percent of the cost of the french military effort.
in december 1953 some 12 000 french soldiers parachuted into dien bien phu a cluster of villages in a valley ringed by mountains in northwestern vietnam.
their plan was to build a w ell fortified base to lure viet minh guerrillas into the open and then overwhelm them with superior firepower.
the french assumed that the surrounding forested hills were impassable.
but slowly more than 55 000 viet minh fighters equipped with chinese communist weapons took up positions atop the ridges overlooking the french military base.
they laboriously dismantled cannons and carried them in pieces up the hills then dug trenches and tunnels down into the valley.
by march 1954 the french paratroopers found themselves surrounded.
as the weeks passed the french government pleaded with the united states to relieve the pressure on dien bien phu.
the national security council dulles vice president nixon and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff urged eisenhower to use atomic bombs to aid the trapped french force.
1296 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 dien bien phu viet minh soldiers march french captives to a prisoner camp in dien bien phu on may 7 1954.
eisenhower snapped back you boys must be crazy.
we cant use those awful things against asians for the second time in less than ten years.
my god the president opposed u s intervention unless the british joined the effort.
when they refused eisenhower told the french that u s military action in vietnam was politically impossible on may 7 1954 the viet minh fighters overwhelmed the last french resistance.
the catastrophic defeat caused the collapse of the french government and signaled the end of french colonial rule in asia.
on july 20 1954 representatives of france britain the soviet union the peoples republic of china and the viet minh signed the geneva accords which gave laos and cambodia their independence and divided vietnam in two at the 17th parallel.

american and south vietnamese representatives refused to sign the geneva accords arguing that the treaties legitimized the communist victory.
after 1954 ho chi minh took complete control of the government in north vietnam executing thousands of vietnamese he deemed opponents.
in south vietnam power gravitated to a new premier chosen by the french at american urging ngo dinh diem a catholic nationalist who had opposed both the french and the viet minh.
in 1954 eisenhower began providing military and economic aid to diem.
yet diems autocratic efforts to eliminate all opposition played into the hands of the communists who found eager recruits among the discontented south vietnamese.
by 1957 communist guerrillas known as the viet cong were launching attacks on the diem government.
as the warfare intensified the eisenhower administration concluded that its only option was to sink or swim with diem in 1954 eisenhower had used what he called the falling domino theory to explain why the united states needed to fight communism in vietnam you have a row of dominos set up you knock over the first one and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly if south vietnam were to fall to communism he predicted the rest of southeast asia would soon follow.
the domino analogy assumed that communism was a monolithic global movement directed by soviet leaders in moscow.
yet anti colonial insurgencies such as those in southeast asia were animated as much by nationalist motives as by communist ideology.
the domino analogy also meant that the united states was assuming that it must police the entire world to ensure that the dominoes no matter how small did not begin falling.
as a consequence every insurgency around the world mushroomed into a strategic crisis.
reelection and foreign crises as a new presidential campaign unfolded in 1956 dwight eisenhower still enjoyed widespread public support.
but his health was beginning to deteriorate.
in september 1955 he suffered a heart attack the first of three major illnesses that would affect the rest of his presidency.
in 1956 the republicans eagerly renominated eisenhower and vice president richard nixon.
the party platform endorsed eisenhowers moderate republicanism meaning balanced budgets reduced government intervention in the economy and an internationalist foreign policy.
the democrats turned again to the liberal illinois leader adlai stevenson.
repression in hungary during the last week of the presidential campaign fighting erupted along the suez canal in egypt and in the streets of foreign policy in the fifties 1299 budapest hungary.
on october 23 1956 hungarian nationalists encouraged by american propaganda broadcasts through radio free europe revolted against communist troops in budapest.
the soviets responded with a massive attack killing 2 000 hungarian freedom fighters and forcing nearly 200 000 more to flee before installing a new puppet government.
the revolution had been smothered in twelve days.
eisenhower offered his sympathy for the hungarian people but nothing more.
his strategy in dealing with such crises was as he later said take a hard l ine and bluff although he avoided war over hungary eisenhower had allowed administration officials especially dulles to make reckless pledges about rolling back communism and liberating eastern europe.
to all those suffering under communist slavery dulles promised let us say you can count on us in hungary the soviets called the eisenhower administrations bluff.
the hungarian freedom fighters having been led to expect u s support paid with their lives.
as the soviets crushed the uprising hungarian rebels asked when are the americans coming richard nixon cynically reassured eisenhower that the soviet crackdown would be beneficial in showing the world the ruthlessness of communism.
the president however felt guilty telling dulles that we have excited hungarians for all these years and are now turning our backs on them when they are in a jam dulles showed little concern reminding the president that we always have been against violent rebellion the suez war eisenhower was more successful in handling an unexpected international crisis in egypt.
in 1952 an egyptian army officer gamal abdel nasser had overthrown the monarchy of king farouk and set out to become the leader of the arab world.
to do so he promised to destroy the new israeli nation created in 1948 and vowed to end british and french imperialism in the region.
nasser with soviet support first sought to take control of the suez canal the internationally managed waterway in egypt connecting the mediterranean and red seas.
the canal had opened in 1869 as a joint french egyptian venture.
from 1882 on british troops had protected the canal as the british empires lifeline to oil in the middle east and to india and its other asian colonies.
when nassers regime pressed for the withdrawal of the british forces eisenhower and dulles supported the demand.
in 1954 an anglo egyptian treaty provided for the withdrawal of british troops within twenty months.
in 1955 nasser adept at playing both sides in the cold war announced a huge arms deal with the soviet union.
the united states countered by offering to help egypt finance a massive hydroelectric dam at aswan on the nile river.
in 1956 when nasser increased trade with the soviet bloc and recognized the peoples republic of china dulles abruptly cancelled the aswan dam offer.
1300 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 unable to retaliate directly against the united states nasser seized control of the f rench based suez canal company and denied i srael bound ships access through the canal.
the british and french were furious but they needed a pretext for military action.
israel soon provided one.
on september 30 1956 israeli british and french officials secretly hatched a plan israel would invade egypt and race west to the suez canal.
the french and british would then send troops to the canal zone posing as peacekeepers to keep egypt and israel separated.
on october 29 1956 israeli paratroopers dropped into egypt.
the british and french governments then issued an ultimatum demanding that the fighting cease.
when egypt rejected the ultimatum british warplanes began bombing egyptian airfields.
on november 5 british and french soldiers invaded the canal zone.
nasser responded by sinking all forty of the international ships then in the suez canal.
a few days later anglo french commandos and paratroopers took control of the canal.
eisenhower was furious that the three nations had hatched their scheme and attacked egypt without informing the american government.
he bluntly told anthony eden the british prime minister that he flatly reject ed the thought of using force in egypt.
and he resolved to put a stop to the invasion.
how could we possibly support britain and france he asked if in doing so we lose the whole arab world eisenhower demanded that the british and french withdraw and that the israelis evacuate the sinai peninsula or face severe economic sanctions.
that the three aggressor nations grudgingly complied on november 7 testified to eisenhowers strength influence and savvy.
the suez debacle caused the downfall of the british government and hastened the process of independence among its remaining colonies.
but perhaps its major result was that the british government realized that never again would it be able to act independently of the united states.
egypt reopened the suez canal and as eisenhower had predicted operated it in a professional nonpolitical manner.
the suez crisis and the hungarian revolt led democrat adlai stevenson to declare the administrations foreign policy bankrupt eleanor roosevelt complained that eisenhowers opposition to our oldest and strongest allies.
is an ironic strange and horrible situation most americans however reasoned that the crises actually affirmed the nations status as the global superpower.
voters handed eisenhower an even more lopsided victory than the one in 1952.
in carrying louisiana eisenhower became the first republican to win a lower south state since reconstruction nationally he carried all but seven states and won the electoral vote 457 to 73.
eisenhowers decisive victory however failed to swing a congressional majority for his party in either house.

wwn64 figure m28 3 first proof sputnik on october 4 1957 the soviets shocked the united states by launching the first communications satellite called sputnik a polished aluminum sphere the size of a beach ball.
americans panicked at the news believing that if the soviets could put a satellite in orbit they could also fire a rocket with a nuclear warhead across the pacific ocean and detonate it on the west coast.
it was a frightful blow said a radio commentator.
america had grown soft and complacent assuming that it was number one in everything yet now the united states had been bested in space by its soviet rival.
senator lyndon b johnson warned that the russians would soon be dropping bombs on us from space like kids dropping rocks on cars from freeway overpasses 1302 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 the soviet success in space dealt a severe blow to the prestige of american science and technology which had seemed unquestionably preeminent since the second world war.
it also changed the military balance of power.
if the soviets were so advanced in rocketry many people reasoned then perhaps they could hit u s cities with nuclear missiles.
democrats charged that the soviets had humiliated the united states and launched a congressional investigation to assess the new threat to the nations security.
sputnik mania led the united states to increase defense spending and establish a crash program to enhance science education.
in 1958 congress created the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to coordinate research and development related to outer space.
the same year congress with eisenhowers support enacted the national defense education act ndea which authorized large federal grants to colleges and universities to enhance education and research in mathematics science and modern languages as well as for student loans and fellowships.
the ndea provided more financial aid to higher education than any other previous legislation.
the eisenhower doctrine in the aftermath of the suez crisis eisenhower decided that the united states must replace great britain and france as the guarantor of western interests in the middle east.
in 1958 congress approved what came to be called the eisenhower doctrine a resolution that promised to extend economic and military aid to arab nations and to use armed force if necessary to assist any such nation against communist aggression.
when lebanon appealed to the united states to help fend off an insurgency eisenhower ordered 5 000 marines into the country.
in october 1958 once the situation had stabilized u s forces up to 15 000 at one point withdrew.
crisis in berlin since the second world war west berlin had become an oasis of western democracy and prosperity in communist east germany while east berlin continued to be administered by the soviet union.
west berlin also served as an enticing alternative to life behind the iron curtain each year thousands of east germans escaped to west berlin.
nikita khrushchev the unpredictable soviet leader called west berlin a bone in my throat on november 10 1958 khrushchev threatened to give east germany control of east berlin and of the air lanes into west berlin.
after the deadline he set may 27 1959 western authorities would have to deal with the s oviet controlled east german government in effect officially recognizing it or face the possibility of another blockade of the city.
foreign policy in the fifties 1303 nikita khruschev a fiery speaker the soviet premier addresses journalists at a press conference in 1959.
eisenhower told khrushchev that he would hit the russians with every weapon in the american arsenal if they persisted in their efforts to intimidate west berlin.
at the same time however eisenhower also sought a settlement.
there was little hope of resolving the conflicting views on berlin but the negotiations distracted attention from the may 27 deadline which passed almost unnoticed.
in september 1959 khrushchev and eisenhower agreed that the time was ripe for a summit meeting.
the u 2 summit the summit meeting literally crashed and burned however when on sunday morning may 1 1960 a soviet rocket brought down a u s spy plane called the u 2 flying over the soviet union.
khrushchev embarrassed by the ability of american spy planes to enter soviet airspace then sprang a trap on eisenhower.
the soviets announced only that the plane had been shot down.
the u s government not realizing that the soviets had captured the pilot said it was missing a weather plane over turkey.
it was a lie.
khrushchev announced that the soviets had american pilot francis gary powers alive and kicking and also had the photographs powers had taken of soviet military installations.
on may 11 eisenhower abandoned u s efforts to cover up the incident.
rather than blame others he took personal responsibility for the spying 1304 chapter 28 cold war america 1950 1959 rogram explaining that such illep gally obtained intelligence information was crucial to national security.
at the testy summit meeting in paris five days later khrushchev lectured eisenhower for forty five minutes before walking out.
the u 2 incident set back efforts to reduce cold war tensions.
later in 1962 francis gary powers would be exchanged for a captured soviet spy.
communist cuba of all of eisenhowers crises in foreign affairs the greatest embarrassment was fidel castros new communist regime in cuba which came to power on january 1 1959 after two years of guerrilla warfare against the corrupt u s supported fidel castro castro center became dictator fulgencio batista.
castro a cubas communist premier in 1959 after fiery young lawyer readily embraced three years of guerrilla warfare that soviet support leading a cia agent overthrew the batista regime.
to predict were going to take care of castro just like we took care of arbenz in guatemala the soviets warned that any american intervention in cuba would trigger a military response.
one of eisenhowers last acts as president on january 3 1961 was to suspend diplomatic relations with castros cuba.
eisenhower also set in motion a secret cia operation to train a force of cuban refugees to oust castro.
it would be up to eisenhowers successor john f kennedy to launch the invasion.
evaluating the eisenhower presidency during president eisenhowers second term congress added alaska and hawaii as the forty ninth and fiftieth states 1959 while the nation experienced its worst economic slump since the great depression.
volatile issues such as civil rights defense policy and corrupt aides including white house chief of staff sherman adams compounded the administrations troubles.
the presidents desire to avoid divisive issues and maintain public goodwill led him at times to value harmony and popularity over justice.
one observer called the eisenhower years the time of the great postponement during which foreign policy in the fifties 1305 the president left domestic and foreign policies about where he found them in 1953 opinion of eisenhowers presidency has improved with time however.
he presided with steady self confidence over a prosperous nation.
in dealing with crises he displayed unusually good judgment and firmness of purpose.
he fulfilled his pledge to end the war in korea refused to intervene militarily in indochina and maintained the peace in the face of explosive global tensions.
eisenhowers greatest decisions were the wars he chose to avoid.
after the truce in korea not a single american soldier died in combat during his two administrations something no president since has achieved.
for the most part he acted with poise restraint and intelligence in managing an increasingly complex cold war.
if eisenhower refused to take the lead in addressing social and racial problems he did balance the budget while sustaining the major reforms of the new deal.
if he tolerated unemployment of as much as 7 percent he saw to it that inflation remained minimal.
even adlai stevenson admitted that ikes victory in 1952 had been good for america.
i like ike too he said.
eisenhowers january 17 1961 farewell address focused on the threat posed to government integrity by an immense military establishment and a large arms industry it was all the more striking for eisenhower a celebrated military leader to highlight the dangers of a large military industrial complex exerting unwarranted influence in congress and the white house.
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist he warned.
eisenhower confessed that his greatest disappointment was that he could affirm only that war has been avoided not that a lasting peace is in sight despite the combative language of secretary of state john foster dulles eisenhower never promoted warfare as an instrument of foreign policy.
instead he pledged to do anything to achieve peace within honorable means.
ill travel anywhere.
ill talk to anyone his successors were not as successful in keeping war at bay.
chapter review summary eisenhowers dynamic conservatism president eisenhower promoted moderate republicanism or dynamic conservatism while critical of excessive government spending on social programs he expanded social security coverage and launched ambitious public works programs such as the federal aid highway act that constructed the interstate highway system.
growth of the u s economy high levels of federal government spending continued during the postwar period.
the gi bill of rights boosted home buying and helped many veterans attend college and enter the middle class.
consumer demand for homes cars and household goods fueled the economy.
critics of mainstream culture the beats and many other writers and artists rebelled against what they claimed was the suffocating conformity of m iddle class life.
adolescents rebelled through acts of juvenile delinquency and a new form of sexually provocative music called rock n roll.
pockets of chronic poverty persisted despite record breaking economic growth and minorities did not prosper to the extent that white americans did.
civil rights movement during the early 1950s the naacp mounted legal challenges in federal courts to states requiring racially segregated public schools.
in brown v board of education 1954 the u s supreme court nullified the separate but equal doctrine.
many white southerners adopted a strategy of massive resistance against court ordered desegregation.
in response civil rights activists used nonviolent civil disobedience to force local and state officials to allow integration as demonstrated in the montgomery bus boycott in alabama and the forced desegregation of public schools in little rock arkansas.
martin luther king organized the southern christian leadership conference sclc after white violence against activists in little rock.
in 1957 the u s congress passed a civil rights act intended to stop discrimination against black voters in the south but it was rarely enforced.
american foreign policy in the 1950s eisenhowers first major foreign policy accomplishment was to end the fighting in korea.
thereafter he kept the united states out of war and relied on secret central intelligence agency cia intervention financial and military aid and threats of massive retaliation to stem the spread of communism.
though american aid was not enough to save the french at dien bien phu eisenhowers belief in the falling domino theory deepened u s support for the government in south vietnam in its war with north vietnam and the communist viet cong insurgents.

a new frontier and a great society 1960 1968 the dove 1964 african american artist romare beardens collage presents a disjointed vision of a contemporary urban street scene fragments of black bodies appear in a surreal clash of flesh and pavement reflecting the upheaval and violence of african american life in the 1960s.
at the same time though the titular dove presides over the scene suggesting that a life of peace could still be in reach.
f or those who considered the social and political climate of the fifties dull the following decade provided a striking contrast.
the sixties were years of extraordinary social turbulence and liberal activism tragic assassinations and painful trauma cultural conflict and youth rebellion.
assassins killed four of the most important leaders of the time john f kennedy malcolm x martin luther king jr and robert f kennedy.
the politics of expectation that a british journalist said shone brightly in kennedys short tenure as president did not die with him in november 1963.
instead kennedys idealistic commitment to improving americas quality of life for e veryone was given new meaning and momentum by his successor texan lyndon b johnson whose war on poverty and great society programs outstripped franklin roosevelts new deal in their scope and promises.
johnsons energy and legislative savvy resulted in a blizzard of new federal programs as many social issues that had been ignored or postponed for decades civil rights for minorities equality for women gay rights medical insurance federal aid to the p oor forced their way to the forefront of national concerns.
in the end however johnson promised too much.
the great society programs fell victim to unrealistic hopes poor execution and the nations deepening involvement in vietnam.
the deeply entrenched assumptions of the cold war led the nation into the longest most controversial and least successful war in its history to that point.
focus questions 1.
what were president john f kennedys efforts to contain communism abroad and pursue civil rights and other social programs at home.
what were the strategies and achievements of the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
what divisions emerged among its activists during the decade.
what were lyndon b johnsons major war on poverty and great society initiatives.
how did they impact american society.
what were presidents kennedy and johnsons motivations for deepening americas military involvement in the vietnam war.
what were the issues that propelled richard nixon to victory in the 1968 presidential election.
1416 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 promised to unleash the capitalist spirit restore national pride and regain international respect.
he did all of that and more.
during his two terms as president he inspired a conservative resurgence in politics helped restore prosperity and raise the nations morale and accelerated the forces that would cause the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war.
the carter presidency james jimmy earl carter jr won the 1976 election because he convinced voters that he was a common man of pure motives who would restore integrity and honesty to the presidency in the aftermath of the watergate scandal.
he represented a new generation of moderate southern democrats who were committed to restraining big government spending.
in his inaugural address carter stressed americas limitations rather than its power we have learned that more is not necessarily better that even our great nation has its recognized limits and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems that may have been true but it was not what many americans wanted to hear.
like gerald ford before him jimmy carter was honest and forthright.
but his public modesty masked a complex and at times contradictory personality.
no modern president was as openly committed to his christian faith as carter.
at the same time few presidents were as tough on others as carter.
the former governor of georgia who came out of nowhere to win the presidential campaign jimmy who was both blessed and cursed by a surplus of self confidence.
all his life he had displayed a fierce d etermination to succeed.
he expected those around him to show the same tenacity.
i am pretty rigid carter admitted.
as he entered the white house in early 1977 carter the former naval officer nuclear engineer efficiency expert and business executive stressed that he wanted to be a strong aggressive president who would reshape the federal government by eliminating waste and providing expert management.
carter faced difficult economic problems and formidable international challenges.
he was expected to cure the stubborn recession and reduce inflation at a time when industrial economies around the world were struggling.
carter was also expected to restore u s stature abroad and lift the national spirit in the wake of the watergate scandal.
meeting such expectations would the carter presidency 1417 be miraculous but carter displayed a sunburst smile flinty willpower and an almost arrogant self confidence as time magazine described it.
as it turned out however he was no miracle worker.
early success during the first two years of his presidency carter enjoyed several successes both symbolic and real.
he reduced the size of the white house staff by a third and told cabinet officers to give up their government cars.
his administration included more african americans and women than any before.
he fulfilled a controversial campaign pledge by offering amnesty forgiveness to the thousands of young men who had fled the the carters after his inauguration in country rather than serve in vietnam.
1977 president jimmy carter forgoes he reorganized the executive branch the traditional limousine and walks down pennsylvania avenue with his and reduced government red tape.
wife rosalynn.
carter also pushed through the d emocratic controlled congress several significant environmental initiatives including stricter controls over the strip mining of coal the creation of a 1 6 billion superfund to clean up toxic chemical waste sites and a bill protecting more than 100 million acres of alaskan land from development.
at the end of his first 100 days in office carter enjoyed a 75 percent public approval rating.
carters limitations but president carters successes were short lived.
more than most presidents he faced difficulties beyond his control including ongoing inflation and a global energy crisis.
carter however contributed to the perception that he was not up to the challenges by failing to display two qualities necessary for presidential success forcefulness and optimism.
he was less an inspiring leader than an e fficiency minded bureaucrat a compulsive micromanager who failed to establish a compelling vision for the nations future.
carter tried to do too much too fast deciding disastrously that he needed no chief of staff to help manage his schedule and implement his decisions.
his senior aides were often more a burden than a blessing.
the outsider president saw little need to consult with democratic leaders in 1418 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 congress which helps explain why many of his legislative requests were voted down.
ultimately carters mismanagement of the economy crippled his presidency.
he first tried to attack unemployment authorizing some 14 billion in federal spending to trigger job growth while cutting taxes by 34 billion.
his actions helped generate new jobs but also caused a spike in inflation.
annual inflation increases in consumer prices jumped from 5 percent when he took office to as much as 13 percent during 1980.
the result was a deepening recession and rising unemployment.
what made carters efforts to restore prosperity more challenging was the worsening global energy crisis since the arab oil embargo in 1973 the price of imported oil had doubled while u s dependence on foreign oil had grown from 35 percent to 50 percent of its annual needs.
in april 1977 carter presented congress with a comprehensive energy proposal designed to cut oil consumption.
however the final energy bill the national energy act of 1978 was so gutted by oil gas and automobile industry lobbyists that one presidential aide said it looked like it had been nibbled to death by ducks in 1979 the energy crisis grew more troublesome when islamic fundamentalists took over the government in oil rich iran and shut off the supply of iranian oil to the united states creating shortages of gasoline and much higher prices.
warning that the growing scarcity in energy would paralyze the u s economy carter asked the democratic controlled congress for a new and much more comprehensive energy bill.
but legislators again turned down its most important energy conservation provisions intended to reduce dependence on foreign oil.
a crisis of confidence by july 1979 carter had grown so discouraged by his failures that he took an unusual step for two weeks he holed up at camp david the presidential retreat in the maryland mountains.
there he met privately with leaders from all walks of life business labor education religion even psychiatry.
then on july 15 he returned to the white house and delivered a televised speech in which he admitted that the people had lost confidence in his leadership.
carter then made a crucial mistake when he blamed americans for the nations problems.
all the legislation in the world cant fix whats wrong with america he said sounding more like an angry preacher than an uplifting president.
people had become preoccupied with owning and consuming things at the expense of hard work strong families close knit communities and our faith in god the nation was at a crossroads he concluded.
americans could choose continued s elf indulgence and political stalemate or they could revive traditional values such as thrift mutual aid simple living and the carter presidency 1419 spirituality.
we can take the first step down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem.
energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation americans were not inspired by the presidents sad and worried speech.
an arizona newspaper expressed the feelings of many when it said that the nation did not tune in carter to hear a sermon.
it wanted answers.
it did not get them carters new energy proposals got nowhere in congress and by the end of the summer his negative ratings were the highest in history.
our greatest single failure said hamilton jordan carters chief of staff is that we have not communicated effectively a description of the countrys problems or a pertinent solution to those problems it did not help matters when carter took the unusual step two days after the speech of asking over thirty government officials including his entire cabinet to resign.
he accepted the resignations of five cabinet officers.
in doing so he reinforced the public image of a white house out of control.
carters foreign policy carters greatest success was facilitating a 1978 peace agreement between prime minister menachem begin of israel and president anwar sadat of egypt.
when negotiations between the enemies stalled carter invited begin and sadat to camp david.
for twelve days in september the three leaders engaged in non stop discussions.
at times the discussions to end the t hirty year state of war between the two nations grew so heated that the talks seemed doomed to fail.
thanks to carters tireless efforts however the two sides persevered.
the u s president played a crucial role in coaxing sadat and begin to compromise on key issues.
their efforts resulted in two landmark treaties thereafter called the camp david accords.
the first provided the framework for an eventual peace treaty.
the israelis pledged to end their military occupation of the sinai region of egypt and the egyptians promised to restore israeli access to the suez canal.
the second treaty called for a comprehensive settlement of the a rab israeli tensions based on israels willingness to allow the palestinians living in the israeli controlled west bank and gaza strip to govern themselves.
sadats willingness to recognize the legitimacy of the israeli nation and sign the two treaties sparked waves of violent protests across the arab world.
the arab league expelled egypt and announced an economic boycott and the israelis later backtracked on aspects of the agreements.
sadat however paid the highest price.
most arab nations condemned him as a traitor and islamic extremists assassinated him in 1981.
still carters high level diplomacy made an all out war between israel and the arab world less likely.
1420 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 the camp david accords egyptian president anwar el sadat left jimmy carter center and israeli prime minister menachem begin right at the announcement of the camp david accords september 1978.
carter was also caught in a political crossfire when he vowed that the soul of our foreign policy should be an absolute commitment to human rights abroad drawing a direct contrast between his international idealism and the geopolitical realism practiced by richard nixon and henry kissinger.
carter created an office of human rights within the state department and selectively cut off financial assistance to some repressive governments.
america did not invent human rights he stressed.
in a very real sense human rights invented america critics however noted that the united states had its own human rights issues including the plight of native americans and african americans and that carter ignored abuses occurring among key allies such as the shah of iran.
others asserted that carters definition of human rights was so vague and sweeping that few nations could satisfy it.
critics on the right argued that he was sacrificing americas global interests to promote an impossible standard of international moral purity while critics on the left highlighted his seeming hypocrisy in pursuing human rights in a few nations but not everywhere.
similarly carters controversial decision to turn over control of the ten mile wide panama canal zone to the panamanian government aroused intense criticism.
the president argued that panamas deep resentment of the carter presidency 1421 americas having taken control of the canal zone during the presidency of theodore roosevelt left him no choice but to transfer management of the canal to panama.
conservatives blasted carter for surrendering u s control of such a strategic asset.
former california governor and presidential candidate ronald reagan repeatedly lambasted carters giveaway claiming that the canal was americas forever we bought it we paid for it its ours legal scholars and the panamanian government disagreed however.
no panamanian had ever signed the 1903 document granting the united states perpetual control of the strategic waterway instead a french engineer signed it.
the new agreement between panama and the united states called for the canal zone to be transferred to panama at the end of 1999.
carter said the exchange reflected the american belief that fairness not force should lie at the heart of our dealings with the world in late december 1979 carter faced another crisis when 100 000 soviet soldiers invaded afghanistan a remote mountainous country where a faltering communist government was being challenged by islamist jihadis holy warriors and ethnic warlords.
it was the first soviet army deployment outside of europe since the second world war and the forces soon found themselves mired in what some called the soviet vietnam.
they have taken the ultimate step said a u s diplomat.
theyve finally grasped the tar baby president carter responded with a series of steps in january 1980 he refused to sign a strategic arms limitation talks treaty with the soviets salt ii suspended grain shipments to the soviet union began supplying afghan freedom fighters with weapons smuggled through pakistan requested large increases in military spending required all nineteen year old men to register for the military draft and called for an international boycott of the 1980 olympic games which were to be held that summer in moscow.
some sixty nations joined the united states in boycotting the olympic games.
still the soviets persisted in their intervention for nine years.
it ultimately cost 15 000 soviet lives.
the soviet invasion of afghanistan also prompted carter to announce what came to be called the carter doctrine in which he threatened to use military force to prevent any nation from gaining control of the persian gulf waterways through which most of the oil from the middle east made its way to foreign ports.
crisis in iran then came the iranian hostage crisis a series of dramatic events that illustrated the inability of the united states to control world affairs.
in january 1979 islamic revolutionaries had ousted the p ro american 1422 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 g overnment led by the shah of iran mohammad reza pahlavi who owed his rule to a cia intervention in 1953 that overthrew the elected iranian government.
the rebel leaders executed hundreds of the shahs former officials.
thousands more iranians were imprisoned tortured or executed for refusing to abide by strict islamic social codes.
the turmoil led to a sharp drop in oil production driving gasoline prices up worldwide.
by the spring of 1979 americans were again waiting in long lines to pay record prices for limited amounts of gas.
in october the carter administration allowed the deposed shah to receive medical treatment for cancer at an american hospital.
this humanitarian decision enraged iranian revolutionaries millions of whom took to the streets to demand that the united states return the shah to iran.
on november 4 1979 a frenzied mob stormed the u s embassy in tehran and seized sixty six diplomats and staff including fifty two american citizens.
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini endorsed the mob action and demanded the return of the hated shah along with all his wealth in exchange for the release of the hostages.
nightly television coverage of the taunting iranian rebels generated among viewers a near obsession with the fate of the hostages.
a kings ransom an iranian militant holds a group of u s embassy staff members hostage in tehran iran in 1979.
the rise of ronald reagan 1423 angry americans including many in congress demanded a military response to the kidnappings.
carter however believed his options were limited he wanted to keep the hostages alive.
he appealed to the united nations but khomeini scoffed at un efforts.
carter then froze all iranian financial assets in america and asked europe to join the united states in a trade embargo of iran including its oil.
the trade restrictions were only partially effective because americas allies were not willing to lose access to iranian oil.
as the crisis continued and gasoline prices rose to record levels carter authorized a risky rescue attempt by u s commandos on april 24 1980.
his decision caused his secretary of ayatollah khomeini religious figure state cyrus vance to resign in pro and leader of the iranian revolution who test.
the raid had to be cancelled when overthrew the iranian monarchy in 1979 three of the eight helicopters developed mechanical problems it ended with eight u s deaths when a helicopter collided with a transport plane in the iranian desert.
for fourteen months the iranian hostage crisis paralyzed carters ability to lead the nation.
for many the prolonged standoff became a symbol of his failed presidency.
for the first time in its history business week magazines editors observed the united states is no longer growing in power and influence among the nations of the world the crisis finally ended after 444 days on january 20 1981 when carter just hours before leaving office released several billion dollars of iranian assets to ransom the hostages.
the rise of ronald reagan no sooner had carter been elected in 1976 than conservative republicans the new right began working to ensure that he would not win a second term.
their plans centered on the popularity of tall square shouldered plain speaking ronald reagan the hollywood actor t wo term california 1424 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 governor and prominent political commentator.
reagan was not a deep thinker but he was a superb reader of the public mood an outspoken patriot and a committed champion of conservative principles.
the actor turned president born in the town of tampico illinois in 1911 the son of an o ften drunk irish catholic shoe salesman and a devout b ible quoting mother who preached a prairie protestantism centered on individual freedom ronald reagan grew up in a household short of money and frequently on the move.
a football scholarship enabled him to ronald reagan the great attend tiny eureka college during the communicator flashes his charming great depression he washed dishes trademark smile.
in the dining hall to pay for his meals.
after graduation reagan worked as a radio sportscaster before starting a movie career in hollywood.
he served three years in the army during the second world war making training films.
at that time as he recalled he was a democrat a new dealer to the core who voted blindly for franklin d roosevelt four times.
after the war reagan became president of the acting professions union the screen actors guild sag where he honed his negotiating skills and fended off communist efforts to infiltrate the union.
reagan supported democrat harry s truman in the 1948 presidential election but during the fifties he decided that federal taxes were too high.
in 1960 he campaigned as a democrat for richard nixon and two years later he joined the republican party.
reagan achieved political stardom in 1964 when he delivered a rousing speech on national television on behalf of barry goldwaters presidential candidacy.
wealthy admirers convinced him to run for governor of california in 1966 and he won by a landslide.
as the republican presidential nominee in 1980 reagan set about drawing a vivid contrast between his optimistic vision of americas future and jimmy carters bleak outlook.
reagan insisted that there was nothing wrong with the american people and that there were simple answers to the complex the rise of ronald reagan 1425 problems facing the country although they were not easy answers.
he pledged to slash s ocial welfare programs increase military spending to win the cold war dismantle the bloated federal bureaucracy restore states rights reduce taxes and government regulation of businesses get the government off our backs and release the energies of free enterprise and appoint conservative judges to the federal courts.
he also promised to affirm old time religious values by banning abortions and reinstituting prayer in public schools.
he ended up achieving neither.
reagans popularity resulted in part from his skill as a speaker journalists dubbed him the great communicator and his steadfast commitment to a few basic principles and simple themes.
blessed with a reassuring baritone voice and a wealth of entertaining stories he charmed audiences while rejecting carters assumption that americans needed to start getting along with less to accept a decline in our standard of living he instead promised boundless economic expansion.
the rise of the new right by 1980 social developments had made ronald reagans a nti liberal stance a major asset.
an increase in the number of senior citizens a group that tends to be more politically and socially conservative and the steady migration of people especially older americans to the conservative sunbelt states were shifting the political balance of power.
fully 90 percent of the nations population growth during the eighties occurred in southern or western sunbelt states while the northeast and industrial states of the midwest ohio michigan and illinois called the rust belt experienced economic decline and population losses.
a related development was a growing grassroots tax revolt.
as consumer prices and home values rose so did property taxes.
in california reagans home state skyrocketing property taxes threatened to force many working class people from their homes.
this led to efforts to cut back on the size and cost of government to enable reductions in property taxes.
in june 1978 tax rebels with reagans support succeeded in putting an initiative known as proposition 13 on the state ballot.
an overwhelming majority of voters approved the measure which slashed property taxes by 57 percent and amended the state constitution to make it more difficult to raise taxes.
the prop 13 tax revolt soon spread across the nation leading the new york times to call it a modern boston tea party the religious right the california tax revolt fed into a national conservative resurgence led by the religious right religious conservatives 1426 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 pushing a f aith based political agenda formed the strongest grassroots movement of the late twentieth century.
by the eighties catholic conservatives and protestant evangelicals owned television and radio stations operated their own schools and universities and organized mega churches from which such televangelists as the reverend jerry falwell launched a cultural crusade against the demonic forces of liberalism at home and communism abroad.
in 1979 falwell formed a group he called the moral majority later renamed the liberty alliance to campaign for the major political and social goals of the religious right the economy should operate without interference by the government which should be reduced in size the supreme court decision in roe v wade 1973 legalizing abortion should be reversed darwinian evolution should be replaced in school textbooks by the biblical story of creation prayer should return to public schools women should submit to their husbands and communism should be opposed as a form of pagan totalitarianism.
that ronald reagan became the hero of the religious right was a tribute to his political skills for he rarely attended church and had no strong religious affiliations.
president carter though famous as a b orn again baptist sunday school teacher lost the support of religious conservatives because he was not look on the right side the rise of the religious right saw protests against supreme court rulings that reinforced the separation of church and state.
here in a 1984 rally organized by the moral majority students chant kids want to pray in support of an amendment to reinstate prayer in public schools.
the effort failed.
the rise of ronald reagan 1427 willing to ban abortions or restore prayers in public schools.
his push for state ratification of the e qual rights constitutional amendment era also cost him the support of anti feminist conservatives.
anti feminist backlash by the late seventies a well organized and w ell financed backlash against the feminist movement reinforced the rise of the new right activists like republican phyllis schlafly a conservative catholic attorney from illinois campaigned successfully to keep the era from being ratified by the required thirty eight states.
schlaflys stop stop taking our privileges era organization warned that the era would allow husbands to abandon their wives force women into military service and give gay perverts the right to marry.
she and others stressed that the gender equality promised by the proposed amendment violated biblical teachings about womens god given roles as nurturers and helpmates.
by the late seventies the effort to gain ratification of the era had failed largely because no states in the conservative south and west had ratified it.
many of schlaflys supporters also participated in the growing anti abortion or pro life movement.
the national right to life committee supported by the national conference of catholic bishops denounced abortion as murder and the emotional intensity of the issue made it a powerful political force.
reagan highlighted his support for traditional family values gender roles and the rights of the unborn which helped persuade many northern d emocrats mostly w orking class catholics to support him.
financing conservatism the business community as well had become a source of revitalized conservative activism.
in 1972 the leaders of the nations largest corporations formed the business roundtable to promote their interests in congress.
within a few years many of them had created political action committees pacs to distribute money to p ro business political candidates.
corporate donations also helped fund conservative think tanks such as the american enterprise institute the cato institute and the heritage foundation.
by 1980 the conservative insurgency had become a powerful political force with substantial financial resources carefully crafted ideas and grassroots energy.
the election of 1980 ronald reagans supporters during the 1980 campaign loved his simple solutions upbeat personality and folksy humor and they responded passionately to his recurring question are you better off than you were four years ago their answer was a resounding no on election day reagan swept to a lopsided victory with 489 electoral votes to 49 1428 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 for jimmy carter who carried only six states.
it was the second worst defeat of an incumbent president in the twentieth century behind william howard taft in 1912.
the popular vote was 44 million 51 percent for reagan to carters 35 million 41 percent with 7 percent going to john anderson a moderate republican who ran as an independent.
reagans resounding victory signaled a major realignment of voters in which many so called reagan democrats conservative white southern protestants and blue collar northern catholics crossed over to the republican party.
the reagan era had begun.
the reagan revolution democrats who dismissed s ixty nine year old ronald reagan the oldest man to assume the presidency as a third rate actor and mental lightweight underrated his many virtues.
few people in public life had reagans stage presence or confidence.
he may have been a mediocre actor but no one played the part of president better.
his remarkable ability to make americans believe again in the greatness of their country won him two presidential elections in 1980 and 1984 and ensured the victory of his anointed successor vice president george h w bush in 1988.
just how revolutionary the reagan era was remains a subject of debate but it cannot be denied that reagans actions and beliefs set the tone for the decades political and economic life.
reagans first term fellow conservatives president reagan said in a speech in 1981 our moment has arrived he and others were determined to get america moving again in his inaugural address he promised to help americans renew our faith and hope in their nation as a shining city on a hill for the rest of the world to emulate.
reagan helped restore the prestige of the presidency through the force of his personality and the appeal of his ideas and ideals.
he succeeded for three main reasons.
first he focused on a few priorities slowing the rate of inflation lowering tax rates reducing the scope of the federal government increasing military spending and conducting an anti soviet foreign policy and he pursued those goals with what an aide called a warmly ruthless intensity.
second reagan unlike carter was skilled at negotiating with congressional leaders and foreign heads of states.
he also recognized that politics is a profession built on compromises.
because the democrats controlled congress reagan was forced to convince the public to pressure their legislators to support his initiatives.
as a former union leader reagan was a masterful the reagan revolution 1429 the election of 1980 wa or ca mt id nv nd wy ut az co sd ks ok nm wi mi ny ia ne tx hi mn nh 4 vt 3 pa oh il in 25 wv va 26 13 mo 6 12 ky 9 nc tn 10 ar sc ms al ga la fl me ma 14 ri 4 ct 8 nj 17 de 3 md 10 dc 3 electoral vote popular vote ak ronald reagan republican 44 000 000 jimmy carter democrat 35 000 000 why wwn64 was ronald reagan such an appealing candidate in 1980.
m31 1 whatfigure factors contributed to reagans overwhelming victory.
first proof negotiator with congress willing to modify his positions while sustaining his overarching goals accepting a partial success and then going back again and again for the rest of what he wanted.
third reagans infectious optimism gave people a sense of renewed confidence.
voters wanted to believe his insistent claim that america could do no wrong.
an uncommon politician he avoided both the arrogance and s elf importance that often accompany the highest office.
public affection for reagan spiked just two months into his presidency when an assassination attempt left him with a punctured lung and a bullet lodged near his heart.
the witty reagan told doctors as they prepared for surgery please tell me youre republicans his gritty response to his injuries created an outpouring of support that gave added momentum to his presidency.
the democratic speaker of the house tip oneill told colleagues that reagan has become a hero.
we cant argue with a man as popular as he is 1430 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 reagan inherited an economy in shambles the annual rate of inflation had reached 13 percent and unemployment hovered at 7 5 percent.
none of this fazed him however.
his philosophy was simple government is not the solution to our problem.
government is the problem at the same time the cold war was heating up again.
the soviet union had just invaded afghanistan and had placed missiles with nuclear weapons in the nations of central and eastern europe under its control which threatened all of europe.
but reagan refused to be intimidated.
he discarded the earlier policies of containment and dtente in favor of a confrontational posture against the soviet union which he summarized as we win you lose he convinced congress to support a huge increase in the military budget deployed u s missiles in europe and sought to root out communist insurgencies in central america.
reaganomics on august 1 1981 president reagan signed the economic recovery tax act erta which cut personal income taxes by 25 percent lowered the maximum rate from 70 to 50 percent for 1982 and offered a broad array of tax concessions.
the bill was the centerpiece of what reagan called his common sense economic plan.
while theorists called the philosophy behind the plan supply side economics journalists dubbed the presidents proposals reaganomics.
simply put reaganomics argued that the stagflation of the seventies had resulted from excessive corporate and personal income taxes which weakened incentives for individuals and businesses to increase productivity save money and reinvest in economic expansion.
the reaganomics solution was to slash tax rates especially on the wealthy in the belief that they would spend their tax savings on business expansion and consumer goods the supply side of the economy.
such spending advocates believed would provide trickle down benefits to the masses.
by generating economic growth reaganomics promised to produce enough new tax revenues from rising corporate profits and personal incomes to pay for the tax cuts.
in the short term however erta did not work as planned.
the federal budget deficit grew and by november 1981 the economy was officially in recession.
managing the budget to offset the loss of government tax revenues david stockman president reagans budget director proposed sharp reductions in federal spending including social security and medicare the two most expensive and most popular federal programs.
liberal democrats howled at stockmans proposal and reagan responded that he was committed to maintaining the safety net of government services for the truly the reagan revolution 1431 a miss for reaganomics a throng of more than 5 000 senior citizens staged a demonstration in downtown detroit against reagans decision to make cuts in social security and other federal programs supporting the elderly in 1982 needy according to stockman reagan was too kind gentle and sentimental to make the drastic cuts needed to balance the budget.
the reagan administration also continued huge federal subsidies to corporations and agribusinesses what critics called welfare for the rich in the end reagan never dismantled the major new deal programs that he had savagely criticized.
conservative political columnist george will explained reagans failure to make substantial cuts in federal spending by noting that americans are conservative.
what they want to conserve is the new deal within a year stockman realized that the cuts in domestic spending approved by reagan had fallen far short of what would be needed to balance the budget in four years as the president had promised.
massive increases in military spending greatly complicated the situation.
in essence reagan gave the defense department a blank check.
over the next five years the administration would spend some 1 2 trillion on military expenses.
something had to give.
in the summer of 1981 stockman warned that were heading for a crash landing on the budget.
were facing potential deficit numbers so big that they could wreck the presidents entire economic program the fast growing federal deficit which had helped trigger the worst economic recession since 1432 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 the 1930s was reagans greatest failure as he himself admitted.
during 1982 an estimated 10 million americans were unable to find jobs.
stockman and other aides finally convinced the president that the government needed revenue enhancements tax increases.
with reagans support congress passed a tax bill in 1982 that would raise almost 100 billion but the economic slump persisted for a time.
in the 1982 congressional midterm elections democrats picked up twenty six seats in the house of representatives.
but reagans determination to stay the course with his economic program began to pay off.
by the summer of 1983 a major economic recovery was under way in part because of increased government spending and lower interest rates and in part because of lower tax rates.
inflation subsided as did unemployment.
reaganomics was not helping to balance the budget however.
in fact the federal deficits had grown l arger so much so that the president had in fact run up an accumulated debt larger than that of all his predecessors combined.
reagan was willing to tolerate the deficits in part because he believed that they would force more responsible spending behavior in congress and in part because he was so committed to increased military spending as a way to intimidate the soviets.
reagans a nti liberalism during reagans presidency organized labor suffered severe setbacks even though reagan himself had been a union leader.
in 1981 he fired members of the professional air traffic controllers organization who had participated in an illegal strike intended to shut down air travel air traffic controllers were deemed essential to public safety and therefore were prohibited from striking.
reagans actions broke the political power of the american federation of labor congress of industrial organizations afl cio the national confederation of labor unions that traditionally supported democratic candidates.
his criticism of unions reflected a general trend in public opinion.
although record numbers of jobs were created sandra day oconnor her supreme during the eighties union membercourt confirmation hearing in ship steadily dropped.
by 1987 unions september 1981 was picketed by represented only 17 percent of the conservatives who decried her p ro nations full time workers down from abortion stance.
24 percent in 1979.
the reagan revolution 1433 reagan also went on the offensive against feminism.
he opposed the equal rights amendment legal abortion and proposals to require equal pay for jobs of comparable worth.
he did name sandra day oconnor as the first woman supreme court justice but critics labeled it a token gesture.
in addition he cut funds for civil rights enforcement and the equal employment opportunity commission and he opposed renewal of the voting rights act of 1965 before being overruled by congress.
the election of 1984 by 1983 prosperity had returned the stock market was soaring and president reagans supply side economic program was at last working as advertised except for the growing budget deficit.
like the l iberal presidents he often criticized reagan was a big spender especially when it came to military growth.
at the same time his decision to remove price controls on oil and natural gas and his efforts to pressure saudi arabia to increase oil production produced a decline in energy prices that helped to stimulate economic growth.
by 1984 reporters had begun to speak of the reagan revolution the slogan at the republican national convention was america is back and standing tall the democrats presidential nominee walter mondale jimmy carters vice president struggled to present a competing vision.
endorsed by the afl cio the national organization for women now and many prominent african americans mondale was viewed as the candidate of liberal special interest groups.
he set a precedent by choosing as his running mate geraldine ferraro a new york congresswoman who was quickly placed on the defensive by the need to explain her husbands complicated business dealings.
a bit of frankness in mondales acceptance speech ended up hurting his campaign.
reagan will raise taxes and so will i he told the convention.
he wont tell you.
i just did reagan responded by vowing never to approve a tax increase a promise he could not keep and by chiding mondale for his stance.
reagan also repeated a theme he had used against carter the future according to mondale and the democrats was dark and getting darker reagans vision of americas future however was bright.
as his campaign ads claimed its morning again in america and record numbers of americans were headed to work.
in the end reagan took 59 percent of the popular vote and lost only minnesota mondales home state and the district of columbia.
reagans second term spurred by his overwhelming victory ronald reagan called for a second american revolution of hope and opportunity he dared democrats to raise taxes his veto pen was ready.
go ahead and make my day he said echoing a 1434 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 popular line from a clint eastwood movie.
through much of 1985 the president drummed up support for a tax simplification plan.
after vigorous debate congress passed a comprehensive tax reform act in 1986.
the measure cut the number of federal tax brackets from fourteen to two and reduced rates from the maximum of 50 percent to 15 and 28 percent the lowest since calvin coolidge was president in the twenties.
reagans half hearted revolution although ronald reagan had promised to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment the number of federal employees actually grew during his two terms as president.
neither the social security system nor medicare the two largest federal social programs were overhauled and the federal agencies that reagan had threatened to abolish such as the department of education not only survived but saw their budgets grow.
the federal deficit almost tripled during reagans two terms.
he blamed congress for the problem since only congress can spend money but in fact the legislators essentially approved the budgets that reagan submitted to them and he never submitted a balanced budget.
as dick cheney a future republican vice president quipped reagan showed that deficits dont matter the cost of social security the most expensive entitlement program grew by 27 percent under reagan as some 6 000 americans each day turned 65.
moreover reagan failed to fulfill his campaign promises to the religious right such as reinstituting daily prayer in public schools and a ban on abortions.
but he did follow through on his pledge to reshape the federal court system.
he appointed 368 mostly conservative judges three of them to the u s supreme court sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony kennedy.
martin anderson reagans domestic policy adviser stressed that it was a mistake to think that there ever was a reagan revolution or that reagan gave it life it was the grassroots conservative revolution that caused r eagan and the same forces will continue to the end of the century what reagan did accomplish was to end the prolonged period of stagflation and set in motion what economists called the great expansion an unprecedented twenty year burst of productivity and prosperity.
true reagans presidency left the nation with a massive debt burden that would eventually cause major problems but the great communicator also renewed the nations strength self confidence and soaring sense of possibilities.
ronald reagan was a transformational president.
while restoring the stature of the presidency and reviving the economy he transformed political life by accelerating the nations shift toward conservatism and by revitalizing the republican party.
he put the democrats on the defensive and forced conven an a nti soviet foreign policy 1435 tional new deal liberalism into a panicked retreat.
for the next twenty years or so reagans anti government anti tax conservative agenda would dominate the national political landscape.
an a nti s oviet foreign policy on a flight to detroit michigan to accept the republican partys presidential nomination in the summer of 1980 ronald reagan was asked why he wanted to be president.
he answered to end the cold war as president reagan systematically promoted what he called his peace through strength strategy.
through a series of bold steps he would build up u s military strength to the point it would overwhelm the soviet union both financially and militarily.
reagan also launched a war of ideas by charging that the soviet union was the focus of evil in the modern world what came to be called the reagan doctrine pledged to combat soviet adventurism throughout the world even if it meant partnering with brutal dictatorships.
reagan believed that aggressive cia led efforts to stymie soviet expansionism would eventually cause the unstable soviet system to implode on the ash heap of history a massive defense buildup reagans conduct of foreign policy reflected his belief that trouble in the world stemmed mainly from moscow the capital of what he called the evil empire reagan had long believed that nixon and ford following the advice of henry k issinger had been too soft on the soviets.
kissingers emphasis on dtente he said had been a one way street favoring the soviets.
reagan first wanted to reduce the risk of nuclear war by convincing the soviets that they could not win such a conflict.
to do so he and secretary of defense caspar weinberger embarked upon a major buildup of nuclear and conventional weapons.
under reagan defense spending came to represent a fourth of all federal government expenditures.
reagan claimed that the defense allocations had another purpose to bankrupt the soviets by forcing them to spend much more on their own military budgets.
to critics who complained about the defense spending reagan replied it will break the soviets first it did.
star wars on march 23 1983 just two weeks after denouncing the soviet union as the focus of evil in the modern world reagan escalated the nuclear arms race when he announced in a televised address that he was authorizing the defense department to develop the controversial strategic defense initiative sdi.
it featured a complex a nti missile defense system that would 1436 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 strategic defense initiative president reagan addresses the nation on march 23 1983 promoting the development of a space age shield to intercept soviet missiles.
make nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete he described a defensive shield provided by satellites equipped with laser weapons in outer space that would intercept and destroy all soviet missiles in flight before they could harm the united states.
the expensive program was controversial from the start because it relied upon untested technology and violated a 1972 u s soviet treaty banning such anti missile defensive systems.
despite skepticism among the media scientists and even government officials that such a defense system dubbed star wars by the media could be built congress approved the first stage of funding eventually allocating 30 billion to the fanciful program.
in the end sdi was never implemented but it did fulfil reagans pledge to change the course of history because it forced the soviets to launch an expensive research and development effort of their own which helped bankrupt their economy.
confronting the evil empire reagan also borrowed the rhetoric of harry s truman john foster dulles and john f kennedy to express resolve in the face of communist aggression anywhere in the world when the polish government declared martial law during the winter of 1981 reagan forcefully protested and imposed economic sanctions against polands communist government.
he also worked behind the scenes to support the polish protest movement solidarity which sought independence from soviet control.
an a nti soviet foreign policy 1437 the americas president reagans foremost international concern however was central america where he detected the most serious communist threat.
the tiny nation of el salvador caught up since 1980 in a brutal struggle between communist supported revolutionaries and right wing militants received u s economic and military assistance.
critics argued that u s involvement ensured that the revolutionary forces would gain favor by capitalizing on anti yankee sentiment.
reagans supporters countered that a victory by the revolutionaries would lead all of central america into the communist camp a new domino theory.
by 1984 the u s backed government of president jos napolen duarte had brought some stability to el salvador.
more troubling to reagan was the situation in nicaragua.
the state department claimed that the c uban sponsored sandinista socialist government which had seized power in 1979 was sending arms to leftist salvadoran rebels.
in response the reagan administration ordered the cia to train anti communist nicaraguans or contras short for contrarevolucionarios or counterrevolutionaries who staged attacks on sandinista bases from sanctuaries in honduras.
in supporting these freedom fighters reagan sought not only to impede the traffic in arms to salvadoran rebels but also to replace the sandinistas with a democratic government.
critics accused the contras of being mostly r ight wing fanatics who killed indiscriminately.
they also feared that the united states might eventually commit its own combat forces leading to a v ietnam like intervention.
reagan warned that if the communists prevailed in central america our credibility would collapse our alliances would crumble and the safety of our homeland would be jeopardized the middle east the middle east remained a tinderbox of conflict during the 1980s.
no peaceable end seemed possible in the prolonged bloody iran iraq war entangled as it was with the passions of islamic fundamentalism.
in 1984 both sides began to attack tankers in the persian gulf a major source of the worlds oil.
the main international response was the sale of arms to both sides.
nor was any settlement in sight in afghanistan where the soviet occupation forces had bogged down as badly as the americans had in vietnam.
american administrations continued to see israel as the strongest and most reliable ally in the volatile region all the while seeking to encourage moderate arab groups.
but the forces of moderation were dealt a blow during the mid 1970s when lebanon long an enclave of peace despite its ethnic complexity collapsed into an anarchy of warring groups.
the capital beirut became a battleground for sunni and shiite muslims the druze the palestine liberation 1438 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 organization plo arab christians syrian invaders cast as peacekeepers and israelis responding to plo attacks across the border.
in 1982 israeli forces pushed the plo from southern lebanon all the way north to beirut and then began shelling plo strongholds in beirut.
the united states sent a special ambassador to negotiate a settlement.
israeli troops moved into beirut and looked the other way when christian militiamen slaughtered muslim women and children in palestinian refugee camps.
french italian and u s forces then moved into lebanon as peacekeepers but in such small numbers as to become targets themselves.
angry muslims kept them constantly harassed.
american warships and planes responded by shelling and bombing muslim positions in the highlands behind beirut thereby increasing muslim resentment.
by 1983 israel had driven the plo from beirut but it made the capital city even more unstable.
in april 1983 islamic suicide bombers drove a truck laden with explosives into the u s embassy compound in beirut detonated it and killed forty people including seventeen americans.
on october 23 1983 an islamic suicide bomber attacked the u s marine headquarters at the beirut airport the explosion left 241 americans and 58 frenchmen dead.
in early 1984 reagan announced that the u s marines remaining in lebanon would be redeployed to warships offshore.
the israeli forces pulled back to southern lebanon while the syrians remained in eastern lebanon.
bloody anarchy remained a way of life in a formerly peaceful country.
grenada fortune as it happened presented reagan the chance for an easy triumph closer to home a rescue mission that eclipsed news of the debacle in lebanon.
on the tiny caribbean island of grenada the smallest independent country in the western hemisphere a leftist government had admitted cuban workers to build a new airfield and signed military agreements with communist countries.
in 1983 an even more radical military council seized power.
appeals from the governments of neighboring islands led reagan to order 1 900 marines to invade the island depose the new government and evacuate a small group of american students at grenadas medical school.
the un general assembly condemned the action but it was popular among grenadans and their neighbors and immensely popular in the united states.
although a lopsided affair the decisive action served as notice to latin american revolutionaries that reagan might use military force elsewhere in the region.
the iran contra affair during the fall of 1986 democrats regained control of the senate with a 55 to 45 majority.
they also picked up 6 seats in the house to increase their already comfortable margin to 259 to 176.
an a nti soviet foreign policy 1439 these results were less a referendum on reagan than they were a response to the qualities of the particular candidates and particular local and state issues.
whatever the reason the 1986 elections meant that reagan would face an oppositional congress during the last two years of his presidency.
what boded worse reports surfaced in late 1986 that the united states had been secretly selling arms to u s hating iran which reagan had called an outlaw state in the hope of securing the release of american hostages held in lebanon by extremist groups sympathetic to iran.
such action contradicted reagans insistence that his administration would never negotiate with terrorists.
the disclosures angered americas allies as well as many americans who vividly remembered the 1979 iranian takeover of the embassy in tehran.
over the next several months revelations emerged of a complicated series of covert activities carried out by administration officials.
at the center of what came to be called the i ran contra affair was marine lieutenant colonel oliver north a national security council aide who specialized in counterterrorism.
working from the basement of the white house north had been secretly selling military supplies to iran and using the proceeds to support the contra rebels in nicaragua at a time when congress had voted to ban such aid.
norths illegal activities it turned out had been approved by national security adviser robert mcfarlane mcfarlanes successor admiral john poindexter and cia director william casey.
both secretary of state george shultz and secretary of defense caspar weinberger criticized the arms sales to iran but their objections were ignored and they were thereafter kept in the dark about what was going o n as was reagan.
after information about the secret dealings surfaced north and others erased incriminating computer files and destroyed documents.
mcfarlane attempted suicide before being convicted of withholding information from congress poindexter resigned north described by the white house as a loose cannon was fired.
casey who denied any connection to the clumsy operation left the cia and died shortly thereafter from a brain tumor.
facing a barrage of criticism reagan appointed a three member commission led by former republican senator john tower to investigate the iran contra hearings admiral john scandal.
the tower commission issued poindexter listens warily to a question from the congressional investigation a devastating report early in 1987 that committee on july 21 1987 placed much of the responsibility for 1440 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 the iran contra cover up in paul szeps 1987 cartoon political figures including president ronald reagan robert mcfarlane lieutenant colonel oliver north and irans ayatollah khomeini attempt to deflect blame for the i ran contra affair.
the iran contra affair on reagans loose management style.
when asked if he had known of colonel norths illegal actions the president simply replied i dont remember he was stunned that for the first time in my life people didnt believe me during the spring and summer of 1987 a joint house senate committee began holding hearings into the i ran contra affair.
in his own testimony oliver north claimed that he thought he had received authority from the president the investigations led to six indictments in 1988.
north was found guilty of three relatively minor charges but innocent of nine more serious counts apparently reflecting the jurys reasoning that he acted as an agent of higher ups.
his conviction was later overturned on appeal.
of those involved only john poindexter received a jail s entence six months for obstructing justice and lying to congress.
a historic treaty the most positive achievement at the end of reagans second term was a surprising a rms reduction agreement with the an a nti soviet foreign policy 1441 soviet government.
under the charming mikhail gorbachev who came to power in 1985 the soviets pursued three dramatic initiatives.
they renewed the policy of dtente encouraging a reduction of tensions with the united states so that they could reduce military spending and focus on more pressing problems especially a notoriously inefficient economy and a losing war in afghanistan.
gorbachev also instituted what he called perestroika restructuring an ambitious effort to streamline the clunky soviet government bureaucracy and make it more efficient.
and third gorbachev encouraged glasnost openness a radical reappraisal of the soviet system that allowed for open debate and shared information.
in the end however the modernization forces that gorbachev helped unleash would end up dismantling the soviet union itself.
the reykjavik summit in october 1986 reagan and gorbachev met for the first time in reykjavik iceland to discuss ways to reduce the threat of nuclear war.
at one point during a private one on one meeting reagan shocked gorbachev and the soviets by saying it would be fine with me if we eliminated all nuclear weapons equally shocking was gorbachevs reply we can do that by the end of the meeting however the two sides were still far apart and gorbachev privately called reagan a feebleminded cave man the main sticking point was reagans refusal to call off the strategic defense initiative sdi or star wars.
reagans arms control director kenneth adelman privately admitted that sdi was unworkable little more than pie in the colorful sky of ronald reagans imagination but it became a dazzling bluff in the standoff with the soviet union.
the inf treaty the logjam in the disarmament negotiations suddenly broke in 1987 when gorbachev announced that he was willing to consider mutual reductions in nuclear weaponry.

the u s president he explained takes you by the arm walks you to the cliff s edge and invites you to step forward for the good of humanity after nine months of strenuous negotiations reagan and gorbachev met amid much fanfare in washington d c on december 9 1987 and signed the intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty an agreement to eliminate intermediate range 300 to 3 000 mile missiles.
the treaty marked the first time that the two nations had agreed to destroy a whole class of weapons systems and produced the most sweeping cuts in nuclear weaponry in history.
gorbachevs successful efforts to liberalize soviet domestic life and improve east west relations cheered americans.
in the middle east the soviets urged the palestine liberation organization founded in 1964 to represent the palestinian people to recognize israels right to exist and advocated a greater role for the united nations in the volatile persian gulf.
perhaps the most dramatic symbol of the thawing cold war was the phased withdrawal of 115 000 soviet troops from afghanistan which began in 1988 reagans global legacy ronald reagan achieved the unthinkable by helping to end the cold war.
although his massive defense buildup almost bankrupted the united states it forced the soviet union to the bargaining table.
by negotiating the nuclear disarmament treaty and lighting the fuse of democratic freedom in soviet controlled east germany hungary poland and czechoslovakia reagan set in motion events that would cause the collapse of the soviet union.
in june 1987 reagan visited the berlin wall in east germany and in a dramatic speech called upon the soviet union to allow greater freedom within the countries under its control.
general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate.
mr gorbachev open this gate.
mr gorbachev tear down this wall it was great theater and good politics.
the changing economic and s ocial landscape during the eighties the u s economy went through a wrenching transformation in adapting to an increasingly interconnected global marketplace.
the nations that had been devastated by the second world war france germany the soviet union japan and c hina had now developed formidable economies with higher levels of productivity than the united states.
more and the changing economic and social landscape 1443 more american companies shifted their production overseas accelerating the transition of the economy from its once dominant industrial base to a more services oriented approach.
driving all of these changes were the impact of the computer revolution and the development of the internet.
the computer revolution the idea of a programmable machine that would rapidly perform mental tasks had been around since the eighteenth century but it took the second world war to marshal the intellectual and financial resources needed to create such a computer in 1946 a team of engineers at the university of pennsylvania developed eniac electronic numerical integrator and computer the first all purpose all electronic digital computer.
it was so primitive that it required 18 000 vacuum tubes to operate.
the following year researchers at bell telephone laboratories invented the transistor which replaced the bulky vacuum tubes and enabled much smaller yet more powerful computers as well as new devices such as hearing aids and transistor radios.
the next major breakthrough was the invention in 1971 of the microprocessor virtually a tiny computer on a silicon chip.
functions once performed by huge computers that filled entire rooms could now be performed by a microchip the size of a postage stamp.
the microchip made possible the introducing macintosh.
for the rest of us personal computers are introduced to the masses in this 1980s apple advertisement.

in 1975 an engineer named ed roberts developed the altair 8800 the prototype of the personal computer.
its potential excited a harvard university sophomore named bill gates who improved the software of the altair 8800 dropped out of college and formed a company called microsoft.
during the 1980s ibm international business machines using a microprocessor made by the intel corporation and an operating system provided by microsoft had helped transform the personal computer into a mass consumer product.
in 1963 a h alf million computer chips were sold worldwide by 1970 the number was 300 million.
computer chips transformed a variety of electronic products televisions calculators wristwatches clocks ovens and automobiles while also facilitating american efforts to land astronauts on the moon and launch satellites in space.
the development of the internet electronic mail e mail and cell phone technology during the eighties and nineties allowed for instantaneous communication thereby accelerating the globalization of the economy and dramatically increasing productivity in the workplace.
debt and the stock market plunge in the late seventies jimmy carter had urged americans to lead simpler lives cut back on conspicuous consumption reduce energy use and invest more time in faith and family.
during the eighties ronald reagan promoted very different behavior he reduced tax rates so people would have more money to spend.
americans preferred reagans emphasis on prosperity rather than carters focus on propriety for it endorsed entrepreneurship as well as an increasingly consumption oriented and hedonistic leisure culture.
but reagan succeeded too well in shifting the public mood back to the more is more bigger is better tradition of heedless consumerism.
during the age of reagan marketers and advertisers celebrated instant gratification at the expense of the future.
michelob beer commercials began assuring americans that you can have it all and many consumers went on a s elf indulgent spending spree.
the more they bought the more they wanted.
in 1984 hollywood producers launched a new tv show called lifestyles of the rich and famous that exemplified the decades runaway materialism.

the federal debt more than tripled from 908 billion in 1980 to 2 9 trillion at the end of the 1989 fiscal year.
then on october 19 1987 the bill collector suddenly arrived at the nations doorstep.
on that black monday the stock market experienced a tidal wave of selling reminiscent of the 1929 crash as investors worried that the united states would never address the federal governments massive budget deficits.
the dow jones industrial average plummeted an astounding 22 6 percent.
the market plunge nearly doubled the record 12 8 percent fall on october 28 1929.
wall streets selling frenzy reverberated throughout the capitalist world sending stock prices plummeting in tokyo london paris and toronto.
in the aftermath of the calamitous selling spree on black monday fears of an impending recession led business leaders and economists to attack president reagan for allowing such huge budget deficits.
reagan responded by agreeing to work with congress to develop a d eficit reduction package.
for the first time the president indicated a willingness to include increased taxes in such a package to reduce the deficit.
but the eventual compromise plan was so modest that it did little to restore investor confidence.
as one republican black monday a 508 point plunge devastated the stock market on october 19 1987 and sent traders on the floor of the new york stock exchange into a panic selling frenzy.
1446 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 senator lamented there is a total lack of courage among those of us in the congress to do what we all know has to be done the poor the eighties were years of vivid contrast.
despite unprecedented prosperity homelessness became the most acute social issue.
a variety of causes had led to a shortage of low cost housing.
the government had given up on building public housing u rban renewal programs had demolished blighted areas but provided no housing for those who were displaced and owners had abandoned unprofitable buildings in poor neighborhoods or converted them into expensive condominiums a process called gentrification.
in addition after new medications allowed for the release of some mentally ill patients from institutions many of them ended up on the streets because the promised m ental health services failed to materialize.

protest a new orleans convention center where president reagan was scheduled to speak in 1988.
the protester in the front holds a sign which reads he kills me still another group of outcasts included those suffering from a newly identified disease called aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
at the beginning of the eighties public health officials had reported that gay men and intravenous drug users were especially at risk for developing aids.
people contracted the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which causes aids by coming into contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person.
those infected with the virus showed signs of extreme fatigue developed a strange combination of infections and soon died.
the reagan administration showed little interest in aids in part because it was initially viewed as a gay disease.
the presidency of george h w bush 1447 patrick buchanan who served as reagans director of communications said that homosexuals had declared war on nature and now nature is extracting an awful retribution buchanan and others convinced reagan not to engage the hiv aids issue.
by 2000 aids had claimed almost 300 000 american lives.
nearly 1 million americans were carrying the deadly virus and it had become the leading cause of death among men ages twenty five to forty four.
the presidency of george h w bush during 1988 ronald reagans final year in office his influence waned.
his claim that government is the problem not the solution was losing its appeal and people were ready for a new approach to governing.
kevin phillips a republican strategist explained that during the 1986 congressional elections voters chose candidates who promised to make the government work for the public good.
even conservatives had come to realize that hey we need something from government after all reagans t wo term vice president george h w bush won the republican presidential nomination in 1988 because he pledged to insist on ethical government be a more hands on president than reagan and promote a more compassionate conservatism the prominent republican mayor of indianapolis indiana william hudnut observed that republicans were moving away from the laissez faire approach of ronald reagan to one that takes a more active more compassionate approach to those in need it was time to move away from s elf congratulation and deal more seriously with the thorny problems of i nner city poverty homelessness and drug abuse.

after his distinguished military service bush graduated from yale university and became a wealthy oil executive in texas before entering government service.
he served first as a member of the u s house of representatives then as u s ambassador to the united nations chair of the republican national committee a diplomat in china and director of the cia before becoming reagans loyal vice president patiently waiting his turn.
in all of those roles bush had displayed intelligence integrity and courage.
but he lacked reagans charm and eloquence.
one democrat described bush as a man born with a silver foot in his mouth a centrist republican who had never embraced right wing conservatism bush promised to use the white house to fight bigotry illiteracy and homelessness.
i want a kinder gentler nation bush said in accepting the republican nomination.
but his most memorable line in his acceptance speech was a defiant statement ruling out any tax increases the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no and theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again.
and ill say to them read my lips.
no new taxes in the end bush won a decisive victory over the democratic nominee massachusetts governor michael dukakis.
dukakis carried only ten states plus the district of columbia.
bush won with a margin of about 54 percent to 46 percent in the popular vote and 426 to 111 in the electoral college but the democrats retained control of the house and senate.
bush sought to consolidate the initiatives that reagan had put in place rather than launch his own array of programs and policies.
we dont need to remake society he announced.
as an example of his compassionate conservatism bush supported the democratic proposed americans with disabilities act 1990 which strengthened the civil rights of the physically or mentally disabled in areas such as employment public transportation and housing.
the act also required organizations for profit non profit and governmental to ensure that people with disabilities could access facilities by providing amenities such as mechanized doors wheelchair ramps and elevators.
the federal debt and recession the biggest problem facing the bush administration was the huge national debt which stood at 2 6 trillion in 1989 nearly three times its 1980 level.
bushs pledge not to increase taxes mainly meaning income taxes made it more difficult to reduce the deficit or trim the debt.
likewise bush was not willing to make substantial cutbacks in spending on defense or s ocial welfare programs like social security medicare and food stamps.
as a result by 1990 the country faced a fiscal mess during the summer of 1990 bush agreed with congressional democrats that the size of the deficit required tax revenue increases which he had sworn the presidency of george h w bush 1449 the election of 1988 wa or ca mt id nv nd wy ut az co sd ks ok nm ak wi mi ia ne tx hi mn nh 4 vt 3 ny pa oh il in 23 wv va 24 12 mo 6 12 ky 9 nc tn 11 ar sc ms al ga la fl me ma 13 ri 4 ct 8 nj 16 de 3 md 10 dc 3 electoral vote popular vote george h w bush republican 47 900 000 michael dukakis democrat 41 000 000 how did george h w bush overtake michael dukakis in the campaign.

his decision set off a revolt among conservative republicans from which he never recovered.
increasing the top tax rate from 28 to 31 percent raised federal revenue but eroded bushs political support in part because the tax increases coincided with a prolonged economic recession.
the economy barely grew at all during the first three years of the bush a dministration the worst record since the end of the second world war.
the democracy movement abroad george h w bush entered the white house with more foreign policy experience than most presidents and like nixon before him preferred to deal with international relations rather than the deficit drug abuse and the problems of the inner cities.
in the soviet union amazing changes were under way.
with his nations economy failing mikhail gorbachev accelerated the implementation of his policies designed to democratize soviet life.
and his foreign policy sought 1450 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 harmony and trade with the west staking the soviet unions future on cooperation and trade with its cold war enemies.
early in 1989 soviet troops left afghanistan after nine years.
gorbachev then renounced the right of the soviet union to intervene in the internal affairs of other communist countries.
his foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told the soviet legislature that the nations of eastern europe had absolute freedom to choose their own form of governments.
soon thereafter the communist regimes in eastern europe fell with surprisingly little bloodshed first in poland and hungary then in czechoslovakia and bulgaria.
in romania the year of peaceful revolution ended when the people joined the army in a bloody uprising against nicolae ceauescu the countrys brutal dictator.
he and his wife were captured and tried then executed on christmas day.
although all of the new democratic governments faced immense economic and social challenges europe had at last been born anew.
the destruction of the berlin wall the most spec a hammer to the soviet empire a west german demonstrator pounds away at the berlin wall on november 11 1989 while east german border guards look on.
two days later all the crossings between east and west germany were opened.
tacular event in the collapse of the soviet empire came on november 9 1989 when tens of thousands of east germans gathered at the berlin wall and demanded that the border guards open the gates to west berlin.
sensing the fierce determination of the crowds the guards reluctantly did so and soon germans on both sides of the wall began tearing it down.
because the wall divided not only a city but a nation its destruction symbolized a revolutionary change.
what germans called the peaceful revolution had occurred with dramatic suddenness.
with the borders to west germany now fully open the communist government of east germany collapsed and germans rushed to reunify their divided nation.
on october 3 1990 the five states of east germany were united with west germany.
the presidency of george h w bush 1451 the reform impulse that gorbachev helped unleash in the eastern bloc countries sped out of control within the soviet union itself however.
gorbachev had proven unusually adept at political restructuring and building a new presidential system that gave him if anything increased powers.
his skills however could not salvage an antiquated economy that resisted change.
communist coup fails gorbachevs popularity shrank in the soviet union as it grew abroad.
communist hard liners saw in his reforms the unraveling of their bureaucratic and political empire.
on august 18 1991 a group of old guard political and military leaders accosted gorbachev at his vacation retreat in crimea and demanded that he proclaim a state of emergency and transfer his powers to them so that they could restore the supremacy of the communist party.
he replied go to hell whereupon he was placed under house arrest.
the coup however was poorly planned and clumsily implemented.
the plotters failed to arrest popular leaders such as boris yeltsin the feisty president of the russian republic.
they also neglected to close the airports or cut off telephone and television communications and they were opposed by key elements of the military and kgb the soviet secret police.
on august 20 president bush responded favorably to yeltsins request for support and persuaded other leaders to join him in refusing to recognize the new soviet government.
the next day word began to seep out that the plotters had given up and were fleeing.
several committed suicide and a newly released gorbachev ordered the others arrested.
although gorbachev reclaimed the title of president he was forced to resign as head of the communist party and admit that he had made a grave mistake in appointing the men who had turned against him.
yeltsin emerged as the most popular political figure in the country.
what had begun as a reactionary coup turned into a powerful accelerant for astonishing changes in the soviet union or the soviet disunion as one journalist termed it.
most of the fifteen republics proclaimed their independence from russia with the baltic states of latvia lithuania and estonia regaining the status of independent nations.
the communist party was dismantled prompting celebrating crowds to topple statues of lenin and other communist heroes.
panama the end of the cold war did not spell the end of international tensions however.
since the collapse of the soviet union the world has experienced numerous wars violent turbulence and fractious fundamentalisms of all sorts religious ethnic and imperial.
before the close of 1989 u s troops 1452 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 were engaged in battle in panama where a petty tyrant provoked the first of americas military engagements under president bush.
in 1983 general manuel noriega had become the ruthless leader of the panamanian defense forces which made him head of the government in fact if not in title.
in 1988 federal grand juries in florida indicted noriega and fifteen others on charges of conspiring with colombias illegal drug lords to ship cocaine trough panama to the united states.
the next year the panamanian president tried to fire noriega but the national assembly ousted the president instead and named noriega maximum leader the legislators then declared panama in a state of war with the united states.
on december 16 1989 a u s marine in panama was killed.
bush thereupon ordered an invasion operation just cause to capture noriega and install a government to be headed by guillermo endara who had won the presidency in an election that was nullified by noriega.
in the early morning of december 20 u s troops struck at strategic targets.
noriega surrendered within hours.
twenty three u s servicemen were killed estimates of panamanian casualties were as high as 4 000 including civilians.
in april 1992 noriega was convicted in the united states on eight counts of racketeering and drug distribution.
the gulf war months later saddam hussein dictator of iraq focused u s attention back upon the middle east when his army suddenly invaded its tiny neighbor kuwait on august 2 1990.
kuwait had increased its production of oil contrary to agreements with the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec.
the resulting drop in global oil prices offended the iraqi regime which was deeply in debt and heavily dependent upon oil revenues.
president bush condemned iraqs naked aggression and dispatched warplanes and troops to saudi arabia on a wholly defensive mission to protect saudi arabia.
british forces soon joined in as did arab units from egypt morocco syria oman the united arab emirates and qatar.
iraq refused to yield and on january 12 1991 congress authorized the use of u s armed forces.
four days later more than thirty nations including ten islamic countries launched operation desert storm.
during the next six weeks iraqi soldiers surrendered by the thousands and on february 28 bush called for a cease fire.
the iraqis accepted.
there were 137 american fatalities.
the lowest estimate of iraqi deaths civilian and military was 100 000.
but although coalition forces occupied about a fifth of iraq husseins tyrannical regime remained intact.
what came to be called the first gulf war was thus a triumph without victory.
hussein had been defeated but he was allowed to escape to foster greater the presidency of george h w bush 1453 operation desert storm allied soldiers patrol the southern iraqi town of salman on february 27 1991.
on the side of a building is a propaganda mural of dictator saddam hussein in military uniform.
the consequences of the brief but intense war would be played out in the future as arabs humiliated by the american triumph began plotting revenge that would spiral into a new war of terrorism.
bushs new world order for months after the first gulf war george bush seemed unbeatable his public approval rating soared to 91 percent.
but the aftermath of desert storm was mixed with saddam husseins iron grip on iraq still intact.
the soviet union meanwhile stumbled to its surprising end.
on december 25 1991 the soviet flag over the kremlin was replaced by the flag of the russian federation.
the cold war had ended with the dismemberment of the soviet union and its fifteen republics.
containment of the communist soviet union the bedrock of u s foreign policy for more than four decades had suddenly become irrelevant.
for all of its potential horrors the cold war had brought stability the two superpowers the united states and the soviet union had restrained themselves from an all out war using nuclear weapons.
now the world would witness a growing number of unresolved crises and unstable regimes some of which had access to weapons of mass destruction nuclear as well as chemical and biological weapons.
1454 chapter 31 conservative revival 1977 1990 bush struggled to understand the fluid new international scene.
he spoke of a new world order but never defined it admitting he had trouble with the vision thing he faced a challenge in the republican primary from patrick buchanan the conservative commentator and former white house aide who adopted the slogan america first and called on bush to bring home the boys the excitement over the victory in the gulf war also gave way to anxiety over the depressed economy.
in addressing the recession bush tried a clumsy balancing act on the one hand acknowledging that people are hurting while on the other telling americans that this is a good time to buy a car by 1991 the public approval rating of his economic policy had plummeted to 18 percent.
the election of 1992 at the 1992 republican national convention patrick buchanan who had won about a third of the votes in the partys primaries blasted bush for breaking his pledge not to raise taxes and for becoming the biggest spender in american history as the 1992 election unfolded however bushs real problem proved to be his failed effort to improve the economy.
a popular bumper sticker reflected the growing public frustration saddam hussein still has his job.
what about you in contrast the democrats at their convention presented an image of moderate forces in control.
for several years the democratic leadership council led by arkansas governor william jefferson clinton had been pushing the party from the liberal left to the center.

clintons evasive denials could not dispel a lingering mistrust of his character.
after a series of bruising primaries clinton won the democratic presidential nomination and promised to restore the hopes of the forgotten middle class he chose senator albert al gore jr of tennessee as his running mate.

t he united states entered the final decade of the twentieth century triumphant.
american persistence in fighting and financing the cold war had contributed to the collapse of the soviet union and the birth of democracy and capitalism in eastern europe.
by the end of the century the united states was the worlds only superpower.
yet no sooner did the century come to an end than americas sense of physical security and material comfort was shattered by terrorist attacks in 2001 on new york city and washington d c.
the attacks killed thousands plunged the economy into recession and raised profound questions about national security.
in leading the fight against global terrorism the united states became embroiled in long costly and controversial wars in iraq and a fghanistan.
opposition to the wars would provide much of the momentum for democrat barack obama to win election in 2008 as the nations first african american president.

1364 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s forever young the youth revolt the greensboro sit ins in 1960 not only launched a decade of civil rights activism but also signaled an end to the carefree complacency that had characterized the fifties.
rennie davis a sophomore at ohios oberlin college in 1960 remembered that the greensboro student activists inspired him and many others to work for social reform and political change here were four students from greensboro who were suddenly all over life magazine.
there was a feeling that they were us and we were them and a recognition that they were expressing something we were feeling as well the sit ins marches protests ideals and sacrifices associated with the civil rights movement inspired other minority g roups women native americans hispanics gays and the d isabled to demand justice freedom and equality.
many idealistic young people decided that they could no longer turn a blind eye to the growing evidence of injustice and inequality staining the american dream.
a full fledged youth revolt erupted during the m id sixties.
your sons and your daughters are beyond your command sang bob dylan in the times they are a changin.
by 1970 more than half of americans were under thirty years of age and almost 8 million of them were attending college.
the baby boomers who unlike their parents had experienced neither an economic depression nor a major war during their young lifetimes were now attending colleges and universities in record numbers enrollment quadrupled between 1945 and 1970.
many universities had become gigantic institutions dependent upon huge research contracts from corporations and the federal government especially the defense department.
as these multiversities grew larger and more bureaucratic they became targets for a generation of students wary of involvement in what president dwight d eisenhower had labeled the m ilitary industrial complex as criticism of u s military involvement in vietnam mounted young people disillusioned with the government and authority of all kinds flowed into two distinct yet frequently overlapping movements the new left and the counterculture.
the new left the political arm of the youth revolt originated when tom hayden and alan haber two university of michigan students formed students for a democratic society sds a campus based organization influenced by the tactics and successes of the civil rights movement.
in 1962 hayden and haber called a meeting of sixty young men and women activists at port huron michigan.
their goal was to remake the united states into a forever young the youth revolt 1365 more democratic society.
several of the participants were the children of former leftists or communists even more were jewish.
hayden drafted an impassioned document known as the port huron statement.
it began we are the people of this generation bred in at least moderate comfort housed in universities looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit only by giving power to the people the manifesto insisted could america restore its founding principles.
hayden called for political reforms racial equality and workers rights.
inspired by the example of african american civil rights activists hayden declared that college students should engage in participatory democracy by snatching control of the educational process from the administrative bureaucracy hayden and others adopted the term new left to distinguish their efforts at grassroots democracy from those of the old left of the thirties which had embraced an orthodox marxism.
sds grew quickly forming chapters on more than 1 000 campuses.
in the fall of 1964 students at the university of california at berkeley took haydens new left program to heart.
several had spent the summer working with the student nonviolent coordinating committees sncc voter registration project in mississippi where three volunteers had been killed and the free speech movement mario savio a founder of the f ree speech movement speaks at a rally at the university of california at berkeley.
1366 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s many others arrested or harassed.
they were eager to bring changes to campus life.
when the universitys chancellor announced that political demonstrations would no longer be allowed on campus thousands of students staged a sit in.
after a tense t hirty two hour standoff the administration relented.
student groups then formed the free speech movement fsm.
led by mario savio who had participated in freedom summer in mississippi the fsm became the first major student revolt of the sixties.
the fsm initially protested on behalf of students rights but it quickly mounted more general criticisms of the university and what savio called the depersonalized unresponsive bureaucracy smothering american life.
in 1964 savio led hundreds of students into sproul hall uc berkeleys administration building and organized another s it in.
at 4 a m 600 state police arrested the protesters.
but their example lived on.
some 7 000 students filled sproul plaza that morning circulating leaflets and joining folk singer joan baez in singing we shall overcome finally the universitys president gave in and revoked the ban on political demonstrations.
the fsm succeeded savio explained because it was so obvious to everybody that it was right anti war protests all that rises must converge this protesters sign at a washington d c demonstration bridged the civil rights and anti war movements which pursued many of the same racial and political goals.
the goals and tactics of fsm and sds soon spread across the country.
by 1965 however the growing u s involvement in vietnam had changed the rebellious students agenda.
millions of young men suddenly faced the grim prospect of being drafted to fight in the increasingly unpopular conflict.
the vietnam war was primarily a poor mans fight.
most college students were able to postpone military service until they received their degree or reached the age of twenty four in 1965 1966 college students made up only 2 percent of military inductees.
african americans and hispanics were twice as likely to be drafted as whites.
forever young the youth revolt 1367 as the war dragged on americans divided into hawks and doves those who supported the war and those who opposed it.
some 200 000 young men ignored their draft notices and some 4 000 served prison sentences for doing so.
another 56 000 qualified for conscientious objector status.
others ceremoniously burned their draft cards in front of television cameras while shouting hell no we wont go still others fled to canada or sweden to avoid military service.
the most popular means of escaping the draft was to find a way to flunk the physical examination.
whatever the method many college students succeeded in avoiding military service.
of the 1 200 men in harvards class of 1970 only 56 served in the military and just 2 of them went to vietnam.
rising violence throughout 1967 and 1968 the anti war movement grew more violent as inner city ghettos in cleveland detroit newark and other large cities were exploding in flames fanned by racial injustice.
frustration over deeply entrenched patterns of discrimination in employment and housing as well as staggering rates of joblessness among inner city african american youths ignited the rage.
there was a sense everywhere in 1968 journalist garry wills wrote that things were giving way.
that man had not only lost control of his history but might never regain it during the eventful spring of 1968 when lyndon johnson announced that he would not run for reelection and martin luther king jr and robert f kennedy were assassinated campus unrest boiled over.
the turmoil reached a climax at columbia university where sds student radicals and black militants occupied the presidents office and classroom buildings.
they renamed the administration building malcolm x hall.
mark rudd the campus sds leader called his parents to report that we took a building his father jacob rudd a retired army officer and a real estate investor replied well give it back he did not and after a failed attempt by professors to negotiate an end to the takeover the universitys president cancelled classes and called in the new york city police.
more than 100 students were injured 700 were arrested and the leaders of the uprising were expelled.
part of the problem with sds and other militant organizations is that they were much more effective at criticizing the status quo than they were at creating a blueprint for an alternative future.
if there is a road to power sds president todd gitlin acknowledged we have no map for it the events at columbia inspired similar clashes at harvard cornell and san francisco state among dozens of other universities.
student radicals adopted a tough macho style dismissing traditional approaches to reform and protest as wimpy and rooted in white skin privilege 1368 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s columbia riots mark rudd leader of sds at columbia university speaks to the media during student protests on campus in april 1968.
most americans viewed the student radicals with fear and loathing.
vice president spiro agnew dismissed them as impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals richard nixon declared that the campus unrest represented the first major skirmish in a revolutionary struggle to seize the universities the weather underground a small group of radical militants called the revolutionary youth movement rym surged into prominence during the summer of 1969.
they wanted to move political radicalism from protest to resistance at the sds convention in chicago on june 18 1969 rym members distributed a position paper titled you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows a line from bob dylans song subterranean homesick blues 1965.
the document called for a white fighting force to ally with the black panthers and other radical movements to pursue the destruction of u s imperialism and achieve a classless world world communism by embracing revolutionary violence however the so called weathermen essentially committed revolutionary suicide.
they killed sds by abandoning the pacifist principles forever young the youth revolt 1369 that had originally inspired participants and given the movement moral legitimacy.
members of the weather underground took to the streets of chicago in october 1969 to assault police and trash the city.
their goal was to lead white kids into armed revolution almost 300 were arrested.
during the so called days of rage between september 1969 and may 1970 there were 250 bombings of draft board offices rotc buildings providing military training on university campuses federal government facilities and corporate headquarters.
in march 1970 three members of the weather underground in new york city died when a bomb they were making exploded prematurely.
the weathermen and other radical groups were forced underground by the aggressive efforts of federal law enforcement agencies and their energy diminished as nixon ended the draft and withdrew u s troops from vietnam.
mark rudd one of the organizers of the weather underground later confessed that their totally failed strategy was designed to destroy sds because it wasnt revolutionary enough for us.
i am not proud of this history his own conversion to revolutionary violence he explained had something to do with an exaggerated sense of my own importance.
i wanted to prove myself as a man a motive exploited by all armies and terrorist groups rudd called the intentional destruction of sds by the weathermen a crime their hyper militancy and bombings weakened the larger a nti war movement and demoralized many good people blowing things up got us isolated by the media and smashed by the fbi.
the counterculture looking back over the 1960s tom hayden the founder of sds recalled that most rebellious young americans were not narrowly political.
most were not so interested in attaining elected office but in changing lifestyles.
they were not interested in being opinion makers as in changing the climate of opinion hayden acknowledged that the shocking events of 1968 led disaffected young rebels so called h ippies to embrace the counterculture an unorganized rebellion against mainstream institutions values and behavior that focused more on cultural change than political activism.
hippies rejected the pursuit of wealth and careers and embraced plain living authenticity friendship peace and especially freedom.
in a 1967 cover story the editors of time magazine suggested that in their independence of material possessions and their emphasis on peacefulness and honesty hippies lead considerably more virtuous lives than the great majority of their fellow citizens.
in the end it may be that the hippies have not so much dropped out of american society as given it something to think about 1370 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s flower power hippies let loose at a 1967 love in one of many such gatherings that celebrated peace free love and nontheological spirituality often as a gesture of protest.
both the counterculture and the new left fiercely rejected the status quo but most hippies preferred to drop out of mainstream society rather than try to change the political system.
their preferred slogan was make love not war like the beats of the fifties hippies created their own subculture that promoted personal freedom from virtually all traditional constraints.
they were at once defiant innocent egalitarian optimistic and indulgent as they rejected the authority of the nations core institutions the family government political parties corporations the military and colleges and universities.
the idea was to liberate yourself from the confining conventions of life and to celebrate the irrational side of your nature kind of let yourself go explained a student at the university of chicago.
do your own thing became the unofficial motto of the counterculture.
the counterculture lifestyle included an array of popular ideals and activities peace love harmony rock music mystical religions mind altering drugs casual sex and communal living.
hippie fashion featured defiantly long hair for both women and men and clothing that was striking unusual or god forbid comfortable flowing cotton dresses granny gowns ragged bell bottom blue jeans t ie dyed t shirts love beads tibetan bells peace symbols black forever young the youth revolt 1371 flower power author ken kesey and his posse the merry pranksters held acid test graduation parties throughout the san francisco area that celebrated the psychedelic drug lsd also known as acid.
boots or sandals.
young men grew beards and women stopped wearing makeup.
underground newspapers celebrating the counterculture appeared in every large city many of them with defiant names such as fuck you a magazine of the arts.
a hippie magazine published in boston in 1967 1968 called avatar asked who is the underground its answer was you are if you think dream work and build towards the improvements and changes in your life your social and personal environments towards the expectations of a better existence.
think look around maybe in a mirror maybe inside do your own thing the countercultural rebels were primarily middle class whites deeply alienated by the vietnam war racism political corruption and parental authority.
they were determined to break away from conventional behavior.
for many the preferred pathway to freedom was that recommended by former harvard psychology professor timothy leary tune in turn on drop out he added that your only hope is dope if it had not been for marijuana said one hippie id still be wearing a crew cut and saluting the flag 1372 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s eight miles high illegal drugs marijuana amphetamines cocaine peyote hashish heroin and lsd the acid test were common within the counterculture.
said todd gitlin a former sds president more and more to get access to youth culture in the late 1960s you had to get high the byrds sang about getting eight miles high and bob dylan proclaimed that everybody must get stoned in fact getting stoned was one of the favorite activities of the millions who participated in the 1967 summer of love a series of events protesting the vietnam war and celebrating the youth revolt.
the initial event was actually held april 15 when a peace march in new york city attracted 300 000 participants the most ever assembled for a single event up to that time.
perhaps the most publicized activity of the summer of love occurred in san francisco where more than 100 000 hippies flower children converged.
the loosely organized council for the summer of love intended the gathering to be the first step in a grassroots revolution opposing the war by celebrating alternative lifestyles listening to rock music experimenting with mind altering drugs wearing psychedelic clothing and indulging in casual sex.
the yippies the countercultural alternative to sds and the new left was the zany youth international party better known as the yippies founded by two irreverent pranksters jerry rubin and abbie hoffman.
often calling themselves groucho marxists the yippies were bent on thumbing their noses at conventional laws and behavior and mocking capitalism and the consumer culture.
abbie hoffman explained that their conception of revolution is that its fun they wanted to form an alliance between hippies and weathermen a blending of pot and politics and to overthrow the power structure.
rubin claimed that the first part of the yippie program is to kill your parents since they are our first oppressors he added that the widespread use of psychedelic drugs among young americans signifies the total end of the protestant ethic screw work we want to know ourselves the yippie platform called for peace in vietnam absolute personal freedom free birth control and abortions and legalization of marijuana and lsd.
hoffman had no interest in making the yippies a traditional political organization.
we shall not defeat amerika by organizing a political party he declared.
we shall do it by building a new nation a nation as rugged as the marijuana leaf the anarchistic yippies organized marijuana smoke ins threw pies in the faces of political figures nominated a squealing pig for the presidency urged voters to cast their ballots for none of the above and forever young the youth revolt 1373 threatened to put lsd in the city of chicagos water supply during the 1968 democratic national convention.
communes for some the counterculture involved experimenting with alternative living arrangements especially intentional communities or communes communal living in urban areas such as san franciscos h aight ashbury district new yorks greenwich village chicagos uptown and atlantas 14th street neighborhood were popular for a time as were rural communes.
thousands of hippie romantics flocked to the countryside eager to liberate themselves from parental and institutional restraints live in harmony with nature and coexist in love and openness.
the participants in the back to the little house on the commune this land movement as it became known photograph of the members of the were seeking to deepen their sense of family of the mystic arts commune in oregon was featured on the cover of life self and forge authentic community magazines july 18 1969 edition.
out here one of the rural communalists reflected weve got the earth and ourselves and god above.
we came for simplicity and to rediscover god yet all but a handful of the back to the land experiments collapsed within a few months or years.
almost none of those attracted by rural life actually knew how to farm and many were not willing to do the hard work that living off the land required.
the hippies will not change america a journalist predicted because change means pain and the hippie subculture is rooted in the pleasure principle newsweek magazine reported trouble in hippieland in 1968 noting that most of the flower children were seriously disturbed youngsters incapable of sustaining an alternative to mainstream life.
in a candid reflection a young hippie confessed that we are so stupid so unable to cope with anything practical a resident of paper farm in northern california which started in 1968 and collapsed a year later said of its participants they had no commitment to the land a big problem.
all would take food from the land but 1374 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s few would tend it.
we were entirely open.
we did not say no to anyone.
we felt this would make for a more dynamic group.
but we got a lot of sick people woodstock the sixties counterculture thrived on music initially folk protest songs and later psychedelic rock music.
during the early sixties pete seeger joan baez peter paul and mary and bob dylan among others produced powerful songs intended to spur social reform.
in dylans the times they are a changin first sung in 1963 he warns theres a battle outside and its ragin itll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls for the times they are a changin within a few years however the hippies favorite performers were those under the influence of m ind altering drugs especially the san f rancisco based acid rock bands jefferson airplane big brother and the holding company and the grateful dead.
huge outdoor concerts were wildly popular.
the largest was the sprawling woodstock music and art fair aquarian exposition.
in mid august 1969 more than 400 000 mostly young people converged on a 600 acre farm near the tiny rural town of bethel new york for what was called the worlds largest happening three days of peace and music the festival boasted an a ll star cast of musicians among them jimi hendrix the jefferson airplane janis joplin santana the who joan baez and crosby stills nash.
for three days amid heat rain storms and rivers of mud the assembled flower children grooved on good music beer and booze cheap marijuana and casual sex.
there were overdoses bad trips but no robberies assaults or rapes.
baez said that woodstock was a technicolor mud splattered reflection bob dylan born robert allen zimmerman in northern minnesota of the 1960s dylan helped transform the new york woodstocks carefree spirit of folk music scene penning the a nti love was s hort lived however.

the rolling stones hired the hells angels motorcycle gang to provide security for their show.
during the bands performance of under my thumb a drunken hells angel stabbed to death an eighteen year old african american man wielding a gun in front of the stage.
three other spectators were accidentally killed.
much of the vitality and innocence of the counterculture died with them.
after 1969 the hippie phenomenon began to fade as the spirit of liberation ran up against the hard realities of growing poverty drug addiction crime and mental and physical illness among the flower children social activism spreads the same liberationist ideals that prompted young people to revolt against mainstream values and to protest against the vietnam war also led many of them to embrace other causes.
the success of the civil rights movement inspired other g roups women mexican americans and native americans gays the elderly and the physically and mentally d isabled to demand equal opportunities and equal rights.
still others joined the emerging environmental movement or groups working on behalf of consumers.
the new feminism the womens movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had focused on gaining the right to vote.
the feminist movement of the sixties and seventies aimed to challenge the conventional ideal of female domesticity and ensure that women were treated equally in the workplace.
most women in the early sixties however did not view gender equality as possible or even desirable.
in 1962 more than two thirds of women surveyed agreed that the most important family decisions should be made by the man of the house although the equal pay act of 1963 had made it illegal to pay women less than men for doing the same job discrimination and harassment continued in the workplace and throughout society.
women who were 51 percent of the nations population and held 37 percent of the jobs were paid 42 percent less than men.
betty friedan a forty two year old journalist and mother of three from peoria illinois emerged as the leader of the womens movement.
her i nfluential book the feminine mystique 1963 helped launch the new phase of female protest.
friedan claimed that something was very wrong with the way american women are trying to live their lives today her generation 1376 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s of white college educated women she did not discuss working class or african american women had actually lost ground after the second world war when many left wartime employment and settled in suburbia as f ull time wives and mothers only to suffer from the happy homemaker s yndrome which undermined their intellectual capacity and public a spirations.
college educated women she observed seemed suddenly incapable of any ambition any vision any passion except the pursuit of a w edding ring friedan blamed a massive propaganda campaign by advertisers and womens magazines for brainwashing betty friedan author of the feminine women to embrace the feminine mysmystique and the first president of now.
tique of blissful domesticity in which fulfillment came only with marriage and motherhood.
women friedan claimed were being duped into believing homemaking was their natural destiny the feminine mystique an immediate best seller forever changed american society by defining the problem that has no name friedans analysis of the feminine mystique inspired many w ell educated unfulfilled m iddle and upper class white women who felt trapped by a suffocating suburban ideal of household drudgery.
moreover friedan discovered that there were far more women working outside the home than she had assumed.
many of them were frustrated by the demands of holding two full time jobs instead of just one underpaid clerical worker and unpaid housekeeper perhaps most important friedan helped empower women to achieve their full human capacities in the home in schools in offices on college campuses and in politics.
in 1966 friedan and other activists founded the national organization for women now.
they chose the acronym now because it was part of a popular civil rights chant what do you want protesters yelled.
freedom when do you want it now now was formed to promote true equality for all women in america.
as part of the w orld wide revolution of human rights now taking place it social activism spreads 1377 sought to end gender discrimination in the workplace and spearheaded efforts to legalize abortion and obtain federal and state support for c hild care centers.
change came slowly however.
by 1970 there was still only one woman in the u s senate ten in the house of representatives and none on the supreme court or in the presidents cabinet.
in the early seventies members of congress the supreme court and now advanced the cause of gender equality.
title ix of the educational amendments of 1972 barred discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance most notably applied to athletics title ix has enabled female participation in high school sports to increase nearly tenfold and almost double at the college level.
congress also overwhelmingly approved an e qual rights amendment era to the u s constitution which if ratified by the states would have required equal treatment for women throughout society and politics.
by mid 1973 twenty eight states had approved the amendment ten short of the t hirty eight needed for approval.
in 1973 the supreme court in its roe v wade decision made history by striking down state laws forbidding abortions during the first three months of pregnancy.
the court ruled that women have a fundamental right to choose whether to bear a child or not since pregnancy necessarily affects a womans health and w ell being.
the roe v wade decision and the ensuing success of nows efforts to liberalize local and state abortion laws generated a powerful conservative backlash especially among roman catholics and evangelical protestants who mounted a potent right to life crusade that helped fuel the conservative political resurgence in the seventies and thereafter.
radical feminism during the late sixties a new wave of younger and more radical feminists emerged.
they sought womens liberation from all forms of sexism also called male chauvinism or male oppression.
the new feminists often called womens libbers were more militant than those who had established now.
many were veterans of the civil rights movement and the a nti war crusade who had come to realize that male revolutionaries could be sexists too.
the women began meeting in small groups to discuss their opposition to the war and racism only to discover at such consciousness raising sessions that what bound them together was their shared grievances as women in a mans world to gain true liberation many of them decided required exercising sexual politics whereby women would organize into a political movement based on their common problems and goals.
writer robin morgan captured this newly politicized feminism in the slogan the personal is political a radical 1378 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s notion that betty friedan rejected.
when lesbians demanded a public role in the womens movement friedan deplored the lavender menace of lesbianism as a divisive distraction that would only enrage their opponents.
by 1973 however now had endorsed gay rights.
friedan could not dampen or deflect the younger generation of women activists just as martin luther king jr had failed to control the black power movement.
the goal of the womens liberation movement said susan brownmiller was to go beyond a simple concept of equality.
nows emphasis on legislative change left the radicals cold for women to be truly equal brownmiller and others believed required transforming every aspect of society child rearing entertainment domestic duties business and the arts.
feminists demanded that their hidden history the story of womens rights advocates over the centuries be taught in schools and colleges.
they also took direct action such as picketing the 1968 miss america pageant burning copies of playboy and other mens magazines and tossing their bras and high heeled shoes into freedom cans they also formed militant organizations like witch womens international terrorist conspiracy from hell wrap womens radical action project keep on truckin sisters and the redstockings whose manifesto proclaimed that they were tired of being exploited by men as sex objects breeders domestic servants and cheap labor members sported buttons proclaiming their collective nickname uppity women fractured feminism what women want the womens strike for equality brought tens of thousands of women together on august 26 1970 to march for gender equality and celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the nineteenth amendment.
by the end of the seventies sharp disputes between moderate and radical feminists had fractured the womens movement in ways similar to the fragmentation experienced by civil rights organizations a decade earlier.
the movements failure to broaden its appeal much beyond the confines of the white middle class also caused reform efforts to stall.
ratification of the equal rights amendment which had once seemed social activism spreads 1379 a straightforward assertion of equal opportunity equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex was stymied in several state legislatures by conservative groups.
by 1982 it had died three states short of ratification.
yet the successes of the womens movement endured.
the women fighting for equal rights focused on several basic issues gender discrimination in the workplace equal pay for equal conservative women speak the work an equal chance at jobs tradition antifeminist campaign stop era ally reserved for men the availability of stop taking our privileges equal h igh quality government subsidized rights amendment found its most child care centers and easier access outspoken activist in phyllis schlafly a constitutional lawyer and staunch to birth control devices prenatal care conservative.
and abortion.
feminists also helped win improvements in divorce laws.
feminists called attention to issues long hidden or ignored.
in 1970 for example 36 percent of the nations poor families were headed by women as were most urban families dependent on federal welfare services.
nearly 3 million poor children needed access to day care centers but there were places for only 530 000.
the feminist movement helped women achieve mass entry into the labor market and enjoy steady improvements toward equal pay and treatment.
in 1960 some 38 percent of women were working outside the home by 1980 some 52 percent were doing so.
their growing presence in the labor force brought women a greater share of economic and political influence.
by 1976 more than half of married women and nine of ten female college graduates were employed outside the home a development that one economist called the single most outstanding phenomenon of this century women also enrolled in graduate and professional schools in record numbers.
during the 1970s women began winning elected offices at the local state and national levels.
the sexual revolution and the pill the feminist movement coincided with the so called sexual revolution.
americans became more tolerant of premarital sex and women became more sexually active.
between 1380 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s 1960 and 1975 the number of college women engaging in sexual intercourse doubled to 50 percent.
enabling this change in large part was a scientific breakthrough the b irth control pill approved for public use by the food and drug administration in 1960.
widespread access to the pill gave women a greater sense of sexual freedom and led to m ore open discussion of birth control reproduction and birth control to spread the word sexuality in general.
by 1990 the world about birth control options planned would have 400 million fewer people as parenthood in 1967 displayed posters a result of the pill.
like this one in new york city buses.
although the birth control pill contributed to a rise in sexually transmitted diseases many women viewed it as an inexpensive nonintrusive way to gain better control over their bodies and their futures.
it was a savior recalled eleanor smeal president of the feminist majority foundation.
hispanic rights the activism of student revolts the civil rights movement and the crusade for womens rights soon spread to various ethnic minority groups.
the word hispanic referring to people who trace their ancestry to spanish speaking latin america or spain came into increasing use after 1945 in conjunction with growing efforts to promote economic and social justice.
although frequently used as a synonym for hispanic the term latino technically refers only to people of latin american descent.
labor shortages during the second world war had led defense industries to offer hispanic americans their first significant access to skilled labor jobs.
and as with african americans service in the military helped to heighten an american identity among hispanic americans and increase their desire for equal rights and social opportunities.
social equality however remained elusive.
after the second world war hispanic americans still faced widespread discrimination in hiring housing and education and in 1960 the median income of a mexican american family was only 62 percent of the national average.
hispanic american activists denounced segregation called for improved public schools and struggled to increase hispanic political influence economic opportunities and visibility in the curricula of schools and colleges.
social activism spreads 1381 hispanic civil rights leaders also faced an awkward dilemma what should they do about the continuing stream of undocumented mexican immigrants flowing across the border into the united states.
many mexican americans argued that their hopes for economic advancement and social equality were threatened by the influx of mexican laborers willing to accept l ow paying jobs.
mexican american leaders thus helped end the bracero program in 1964 which trucked in contract day laborers from mexico during harvest season.
the united farm workers in the early sixties mexican american workers formed their own civil rights organization the united farm workers ufw.
its founder was the charismatic cesar chavez.
born in 1927 in yuma arizona the son of mexican immigrants chavez served in the u s navy during the second world war and afterward worked as a migrant laborer and community organizer focused on registering latinos to vote.
then along with dolores huerta he created the ufw a union for migrant lettuce workers and grape pickers many of them undocumented immigrants who could be deported at any time.
up and down california chavez led nonviolent protest marches that had the energy of religious pilgrimages.
he staged hunger strikes and managed nationwide boycotts.
cesar chavez the usually energetic chavez is visibly weakened from what would be a twenty five day hunger strike in support of the united farm workers union in march 1968.
robert f kennedy a great admirer of chavez is seated to his right.
1382 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s the united farm workers gained national attention in september 1965 when the union organized a strike la huelga against the corporate grape growers in californias san joaquin valley.
as huerta explained we have to get farmworkers the same type of benefits the same type of wages and the respect that they deserve because they do the most sacred work of all.
they feed our nation every day chavezs relentless energy and deep catholic faith his insistence upon nonviolent tactics his reliance upon college student volunteers his skillful alliance with organized labor and religious groups and the life of poverty he chose for himself all combined to attract media interest and popular support.
however the chief strength of the hispanic rights movement lay less in the tactics of sit ins and protest marches than in the rapid growth of the hispanic american population.
in 1970 hispanics in the united states numbered 9 million 4 8 percent of the total population by 2000 their numbers had increased to 35 million 12 5 percent and in 2015 they numbered 55 million making them the nations largest minority group 17 percent.
the voting power of hispanics and their concentration in states with key electoral votes has helped give the hispanic point of view significant political clout.
native american rights american indians many of whom had begun calling themselves native americans also emerged as a political force in the late sixties.
two conditions combined to make indian rights a priority.
first many whites felt guilty for the destructive actions of their ancestors toward a people who had after all been here first.
second native americans faced desperate times indian unemployment was ten times the national rate life expectancy was twenty years lower than the national average and the suicide rate was a hundred times higher than the rate for whites.
although president lyndon johnson attempted to funnel federal anti poverty program funds to reservations militants within the indian community grew impatient with the pace of change.
those promoting red power organized protests and demonstrations against local state and federal agencies.
on november 20 1969 fourteen red power activists occupied alcatraz island near san francisco which until 1963 had hosted a federal prison.
over the next several months they were joined by hundreds of others mostly students.
the nixon administration responded by cutting off electrical service and telephone lines.
stranded without electrical power and fresh water most social activism spreads 1383 of the protesters left the island.
finally on june 11 1971 the government removed the remaining fifteen native americans from the island.
in 1968 the year before the alcatraz occupation two chippewas or ojibwas living in minneapolis george mitchell and dennis banks founded the american indian movement aim.
in october 1972 aim organized the trail of broken treaties caravan which traveled by bus and car from the west coast to washington d c drawing attention to the federal governments broken promises.
when nixon administration officials refused to meet with them the protesters occupied the federal bureau of indian affairs.
the s it in ended when government negotiators agreed to renew discussions of native american grievances about the government programs intended to improve their quality of life.
in 1973 aim led 200 sioux in the occupation of the tiny south dakota village of wounded knee where the u s.
seventh cavalry had massacred a sioux village in 1890.
outraged by the light sentences given a group of local whites who had killed a sioux in 1972 the organizers sought to draw attention to the plight of the indians.
after the militants took eleven hostages federal marshals and fbi agents surrounded the encampment.
when aim leaders tried to bring in food and supplies a s hoot out erupted with one indian killed and another wounded.
the confrontation ended with a government promise to reexamine indian treaty rights.

1384 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s indian protesters subsequently discovered a more effective tactic they went into federal courts armed with copies of old treaties and demanded that the documents become the basis for financial restitution for the lands taken from them.
in alaska maine south carolina and massachusetts they won substantial settlements that officially recognized their tribal rights and awarded monetary compensation at levels that upgraded the standard of living on several reservations.
gay rights the liberationist impulses of the sixties also encouraged homosexuals to assert their right to equal treatment.
throughout the sixties gay men and lesbians were treated with disgust cruelty and violence.
on saturday night june 28 1969 new york city vice police raided the stonewall inn a popular gay bar in greenwich village.
instead of dispersing the patrons fought back and the struggle spilled into the streets.
hundreds of other gays and their supporters joined the fracas.
the stonewall riots lasted throughout the weekend during which the stonewall inn burned down.
when the turmoil ended gays had forged a sense gay pride in the seventies gay rights activists march in the fifth annual gay pride day demonstration commemorating the fifth anniversary of the stonewall riots which jumpstarted the modern gay rights movement in the united states.
nixon and the revival of conservatism 1385 of solidarity embodied in two new organizations the gay liberation front and the gay activists alliance both of which focused on ending discrimination and harassment against gay and transgender people.
gay is good for all of us proclaimed one of its members.
the artificial categories heterosexual and homosexual have been laid on us by a sexist society as news of the stonewall rebellion spread the gay rights movement grew.
by 1973 almost 800 gay organizations had been formed across the country.
that year the american psychiatric association removed homosexuality from its official manual of mental illnesses colleges and universities began offering courses and majors in gay studies also called queer studies and groups began pushing for official government recognition of same sex marriages.
as with the civil rights and womens movements however the campaign for gay rights soon suffered from internal divisions and a conservative counterattack.
nixon and the revival of conservatism the turmoil of the sixties spawned a cultural backlash among what richard nixon called the great silent majority of m iddle class americans that propelled him to a narrow election victory in 1968.
he had been elected president as the representative of middle america voters fed up with liberal politics hippies radical feminism and affirmative action programs giving preferential treatment to minorities and women to atone for past injustices.
the conservative backlash alabamas democratic governor george wallace led the conservative counterattack.
he was a fierce champion of states rights and the voice of the white backlash against civil rights and cultural rebellion.
liberals intellectuals and long hairs he shouted have run the country for too long wallace repeatedly lashed out at welfare queens unmarried women he claimed were breeding children as a cash crop to receive federal c hild support checks.
wallace became the voice for many working class whites fed up with political liberalism and social radicalism.
all in the family the most popular television show in the 1970s was created to showcase the decades cultural wars.
in the m uch celebrated situation comedy the bunker family lived in a state of perpetual conflict in a working class suburb of new york city.
semi literate archie bunker played by carroll oconnor a p olish american loading dock worker was the gruff but l ovable head of the family a proud republican nixon supporter and 1386 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s t alkative member of the silent majority who was a bundle of racial ethnic and political prejudices.
enthroned in his easy chair archie railed against blacks jews italians gays feminists hippies and liberals including his live in daughter and her hippie husband.
at one point he says i aint no bigot.
im the first guy to say it aint your fault that youse are colored the producer of the series norman lear sought to provoke viewers to question their own prejudices.
in fact however many of the 50 million people watching each saturday night identified with archies narrow minded values.
richard nixon richard nixon appealed to the working and m iddle class whites who feared that america was being corrupted by permissiveness anarchy and the tyranny of the rebellious minority.
he explicitly appealed to voters who did not break the law people who pay their taxes and go to work people who send their children to school who go to their churches people who are not haters people who love this country above all he promised to restore law and order in 1952 senator robert a taft of ohio known as mr.
republican had characterized young senator nixon as a little man in a big hurry with a mean and vindictive streak a grocers son from whittier california nixon was a humorless man of fierce ambition and extraordinary perseverance.
raised in a family that struggled with poverty he had to claw and struggle to the top and he nursed a deep resentment of people who had an easier time of it the moneyed class.
nixon was smart shrewd cunning and doggedly determined to succeed in politics.
he was also famously hard to get to know.
republican senator barry goldwater described nixon as the most complete loner ive ever known throughout his career nixon displayed violent mood swings punctuated by raging temper tantrums profanity and anti semitic outbursts.
he was driven as much by anger and resentment as by civic duty.
critics nicknamed him tricky dick because he was a good liar.
in his speech accepting the republican nomination in 1968 nixon pledged to find the truth to speak the truth and live with the truth in fact however he often did the opposite.
one of his presidential aides admitted that we did often lie mislead deceive try to use the media and to con them nixons appointments in his first term nixon selected for his cabinet and staff only white men who would blindly carry out his orders.
john mitchell the gruff attorney general who had been a senior partner in nixons nixon and the revival of conservatism 1387 new york law firm was his closest confidant.
h r bob haldeman a former advertising executive served as chief of staff.
as haldeman explained every president needs a son of a bitch and im nixons john ehrlichman a seattle attorney and college schoolmate of haldeman was chief domestic policy adviser.
john w dean iii an associate deputy in the office of the u s attorney general became the white house legal counsel.
nixon tapped as secretary of state his old friend william rogers who had served as attorney general under dwight d eisenhower.
nixon however had no intention of making rogers the nations chief diplomat.
instead the president virtually ignored rogers while forging an unlikely partnership with dr henry kissinger a brilliant german born harvard political scientist who had become the nations leading foreign policy expert.
kissingers thick accent owlish appearance and outsized ego had helped to make him an international celebrity courted by presidents of both parties.
in 1969 nixon named kissinger his national security adviser and in 1973 kissinger became secretary of state.
nixon and kissinger formed an odd but effective diplomatic team.
both were outsiders who preferred operating in secret both were insecure and even paranoid at times and both mistrusted and envied the others power and prestige.
nixon would eventually grow tired of kissingers efforts at self promotion and his frequent threats to resign if he did not get his way.
for his part kissinger lavished praise on nixon in public while in private dismissing the presidents meatball mind and criticizing his excessive drinking.
yet for all of their differences they worked well together in part because they both loved intrigue power politics and diplomatic flexibility and in part because of their shared vision of a multipolar world order beginning to replace the bipolar cold war as the united states slowly withdrew from vietnam.
the southern strategy a major reason for nixons election victories in 1968 and 1972 was his shrewd southern strategy designed to win over white southern democrats upset by the civil rights revolution.
of all the nations regions the south had long been the most conservative.
the majority of white southern voters were religious and patriotic fervently a nti c ommunist and a nti union and skeptical of s ocial welfare programs.
for a century whites in the solid south had steadfastly voted for democrats.
this trend reflected lingering resentments dating to the civil war and reconstruction against abraham lincoln and his republican successors for imposing northern ways of life on the south including racial integration.
during the late sixties and seventies however a surging economy and a spurt of population growth transformed the south.
1388 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s between 1970 and 1990 the souths population grew by 40 percent more than twice the national average.
the regions warm climate low cost of living absence of labor unions low taxes and government incentives for economic development convinced waves of businesses to relocate there.
during the seventies job growth in the south was seven times greater than in new york and pennsylvania.
southern redneck culture suddenly became all the rage as the nation embraced stock car racing cowboy boots pickup trucks barbecue and country music.
rapid population g rowth and the continuing spread of a ir conditioning brought the sunbelt states of the south the southwest and california more congressional seats and more electoral votes.
every president elected between 1964 and 2008 had roots in the sunbelt.
nixons favorite singer country star merle haggard crooned in his smash hit okie from muskogee we dont smoke marijuana in muskogee we dont take our trips on lsd we dont burn our draft cards down on main street we like livin right and bein free haggards conservative working class fans bristled at anti war protesters hippies rising taxes social welfare programs and civil rights activism.
the alienation of many blue collar whites from the democratic party the demographic changes transforming sunbelt states and the white backlash against court ordered integration created an opportunity to gain southern votes that the republican party eagerly exploited.
in the 1968 presidential campaign nixons southern strategy won over traditionally democratic white voters.
he shrewdly played the race card assuring white conservatives that he would appoint justices to the supreme court who would undermine federal enforcement of civil rights laws such as mandatory school busing to achieve racial integration and affirmative action programs that gave minorities priority in hiring decisions and the awarding of government contracts.
nixon also appealed to the economic concerns of middle class southern whites by promising lower tax rates and less government regulation.
in the 1972 election nixon carried every southern state by whopping majorities.
the republican takeover of the once solid democratic south was the greatest realignment in american politics since franklin d roosevelts election in 1932 nixons domestic agenda as president richard nixon shared with his predecessors john kennedy and lyndon johnson an urge to increase presidential power.
they believed that the presidency had become the central source of governmental action that foreign policy should be managed from nixon and the revival of conservatism 1389 the white house rather than the state department and that the president had the authority to wage war without a congressional declaration of war.
nixon was less a rigid conservative ideologue than a crafty politician.
forced to deal with a congress controlled by democrats he chose his battles carefully and showed surprising flexibility leading journalist tom wicker to describe him as at once liberal and conservative generous and begrudging cynical and idealistic choleric and calm resentful and forgiving nixons focus during his first term was developing policies and programs that would help him be reelected.
to please republicans and recruit conservative democrats he touted his new federalism whereby he sent federal monies to state and local governments to spend as they saw fit.
he also disbanded the core agency of lyndon johnsons war on p overty the office of economic opportunity and cut funding to several great society programs.
at the same time the democrats in congress passed significant legislation that nixon signed the right of eighteen year olds to vote in national elections 1970 and in all elections under the twenty sixth amendment 1971 increases in social security benefits and food stamp funding the occupational safety and health act 1970 to ensure safer workplace environments and the federal election campaign act 1971 which modified the rules governing corporate financial donations to political campaigns.
nixon and civil rights during his first term president nixon followed through on campaign pledges to blunt the momentum of the civil rights movement.
he appointed no african americans to his cabinet and refused to meet with the all democratic congressional black caucus.
weve had enough social programs forced integration education housing he told his chief of staff.
people dont want more people on welfare.
they dont want to help the working poor and our mood needs to be harder on this not softer nixon also launched a concerted effort to block congressional renewal of the voting rights act of 1965 and to delay implementation of federal court orders requiring the racial desegregation of school districts in mississippi.
sixty five lawyers in the justice department signed a letter protesting nixons stance.
the d emocratic controlled congress then extended the voting rights act over nixons veto.
the supreme court also thwarted nixons efforts to slow desegregation.
in its first decision under the new chief justice warren b urger a nixon appointee the court ordered the racial integration of the mississippi public schools in alexander v holmes county board of education 1969.
during nixons first term more schools were desegregated under court order than 1390 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s off to school because of violent protests by whites against forced desegregation school buses in south boston are escorted by police in october 1974 in all the k ennedy johnson years combined.
nixons efforts to block desegregation in urban areas also failed.
the burger court ruled unanimously in swann v charlotte mecklenburg board of education 1971 that school systems must bus students out of their neighborhoods if necessary to achieve racially integrated schools.
protests over busing erupted in the north the midwest and the southwest as white families denounced the destruction of the neighborhood school angry white parents in pontiac michigan were so determined to stop mandatory busing that they firebombed empty school buses.
nixon and environmental protection during the seventies dramatic increases in the price of oil and gasoline fueled a major energy crisis in the united states.
natural resources grew l imited and increasingly precious.
nixon recognized that the public mood had shifted in favor of greater federal environmental protections especially after two widely publicized environmental events in 1969.
the first was a massive oil spill off the coast of santa barbara california when an enormous slick of crude oil contaminated 200 miles of california beaches killing thousands of sea birds and marine animals.
six months later on june 22 1969 the cuyahoga river an eighty mile long stream that slices through cleveland ohio spontaneously caught fire.
fouled with oil and grease bubbling with subsurface gases and littered with debris the river burned for five days its flames leaping fifty feet into the air.
as with the santa barbara oil spill the images of the burning river helped raise environmental awareness.
a 1969 survey of college campuses by the new york times revealed that many young people were transferring their attention and idealism from the anti war m ovement to the environmental movement.
nixon and the revival of conservatism 1391 nixon knew that if he vetoed legislative efforts to improve environmental quality the democratic majorities in congress would overrule him so he chose not to stand in the way.
in late 1969 he signed the amended endangered species preservation act and the national environmental policy act.
the latter became effective on january 1 1970 the year that environmental groups established an annual earth day celebration.
in 1970 nixon by executive order created two new federal environmental agencies the environmental protec environmental awareness an earth day demonstration dramatizing the tion agency epa and the national dangers of air pollution april 1972.
oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa.
the same year he signed the clean air act.
two years later he vetoed a new clean water act only to see congress override his effort.
he also undermined many of the new environmental laws by refusing to spend money appropriated by congress to fund them.
stagflation the major domestic development during the nixon administration was a floundering economy.
the accumulated expense of the vietnam war and the great society programs helped quadruple the annual inflation rate from 3 percent in 1967 to 12 percent in 1974.
meanwhile unemployment at 3 3 percent when nixon took office nearly doubled to 6 percent by the end of 1970.
economists coined the term stagflation to describe the simultaneous problems of stalled economic growth stagnation rising inflation and high unemployment.
consumer prices usually rose with a rapidly growing economy and rising employment.
now it was just the reverse and there were no easy ways to fight the unusual combination of recession and inflation.
stagflation had at least three d eep rooted causes.
first the johnson administration had financed both the great society social welfare programs and the vietnam war without a major tax increase thereby generating larger federal deficits a major expansion of the money supply and price inflation.
second u s companies were now facing stiff international competition from west germany japan and other emerging international industrial p owers.
the 1392 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s technological and economic s uperiority that the united states had enjoyed since the second world war was no longer unchallenged.
third americas prosperity since 1945 had resulted in part from the ready availability of cheap sources of energy.
no other nation was more dependent upon the automobile and the automobile industry and no other nation was more wasteful in its use of fossil fuels.
during the seventies however oil and gasoline became scarcer and costlier.
high energy prices and oil shortages took their toll on the economy.
oil crisis 1973 the scarcity of just as domestic petroleum reserves imported arab oil forced the rationing began to dwindle and dependence of gasoline.
gas stations such as this upon foreign sources increased the one in colorado closed on sundays to organization of petroleum exportconserve supplies.
ing countries opec decided to use its huge oil supplies as a political and economic weapon.
in 1973 the united states sent massive aid to israel after ad evastating syrian egyptian attack launched on yom kippur the holiest day on the jewish calendar.
opec responded by announcing that it would not sell oil to nations supporting israel and that it was raising its oil prices by 400 percent.
the arab oil embargo caused gasoline shortages and skyrocketing prices.
american motorists suddenly faced m ile long lines at gas stations and factories cut production because of spiking fuel costs.
another condition leading to stagflation was the flood of new workers mainly baby boomers and women.
from 1965 to 1980 the workforce grew by almost 30 million a number greater than the total labor force of france or west germany.
the number of new jobs could not keep up with the growth of the workforce leaving many unemployed.
the nixon administration responded erratically and ineffectively to stagflation.
first the president sought to reduce the federal deficit by raising taxes and cutting the budget.
when the democratic congress refused to cooperate he encouraged the federal reserve board to reduce the nations money supply by raising interest rates.
the stock market immediately n ose dived and the economy plunged into the nixon recession peace with honor ending the vietnam war 1393 peace with honor ending the vietnam war by the time richard nixon entered the white house in january 1969 he and henry kissinger had developed a comprehensive vision of a new world order.
the result was a dramatic transformation of u s foreign policy.
since 1945 the united states had lost its monopoly on nuclear weapons its overwhelming economic dominance and much of its geopolitical influence.
the rapid rise of competing power centers in europe china and japan further complicated the cold war as well as international relations in general.
nixon and kissinger envisioned defusing the cold war by pursuing peaceful coexistence with the soviets and chinese.
after a period of confrontation nixon explained in his 1969 inaugural address we are entering an era of negotiation preoccupied with secrecy nixon and kissinger bypassed the state department and congress in their efforts to take advantage of shifting world events.
their immediate task was ending the war in vietnam.
until all troops had returned home the nation would find it difficult to achieve the social harmony that nixon had promised.
privately he had decided theres no way to win the war so he sought what he called peace with honor that is the united states needed to withdraw in a way that upheld the credibility of its military alliances around the world.
peace however was long in coming not very honorable and shockingly brief.
gradual withdrawal the vietnam policy implemented by president nixon and henry kissinger moved along three fronts.
first u s negotiators in paris demanded the withdrawal of viet cong forces from south vietnam and the preservation of the u s backed government of president nguyen van thieu.
the north vietnamese and viet cong negotiators for their part insisted on retaining a communist military presence in the south and reunifying the vietnamese people under a government dominated by the communists.
hidden from public awareness and from americas south vietnamese allies were secret meetings between kissinger and the north vietnamese.
on the second front nixon sought to defuse the anti war movement by reducing the number of u s troops in vietnam justifying the reduction as the natural result of vietnamization the equipping and training of south vietnamese soldiers and pilots to assume the burden of combat.
the president began withdrawing troops while expanding the american bombing of north vietnam to buy time for the transition.
from a peak of 560 000 troops in january 1969 only 50 000 remained in vietnam by 1973.
1394 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s in 1969 nixon also established a draft lottery whereby the birthdates of nineteen year old men were randomly selected and assigned a number between 1 and 366.
those with low lottery numbers would be the first drafted into military service.
the lottery system eliminated many inequities and clarified the likelihood of being drafted.
four years later in 1973 the president did away with the draft altogether by creating an all volunteer military.
these initiatives coupled with the troop withdrawals defused the anti war movement.
opinion polls showed strong support for nixons war policies.
weve got those liberal bastards on the run now the president gloated and were going to keep them on the run on the third front nixon and kissinger greatly expanded the bombing of north vietnam in hopes of pressuring the communist leaders to end the war.
kissinger felt that a fourth rate power like north vietnam must have a breaking point nixon agreed suggesting that they let the north vietnamese leaders know that he was so obsessed about communism that he might use the nuclear button if necessary.
in march 1969 the united states began a f ourteen month long bombing campaign aimed at communist forces using neighboring cambodia as a base for raids into south vietnam.
the total tonnage of bombs dropped was four times that dropped on japan during the second world war.
still hanois leaders did not flinch.
then on april 30 1970 nixon announced an incursion into neutral cambodia to clean out hidden communist military bases.
privately nixon told kissinger who strongly endorsed the decision if this doesnt work itll be your ass henry nixon knew that sending troops into cambodia would reignite the anti war movement.
secretary of state william rogers predicted that this will make the anti war students puke divisions at home strident public opposition to the war and nixons slow withdrawal of combat forces had a devastating effect on the militarys morale and reputation.
no one wants to be the last grunt to die in this lousy war said one soldier.
between 1969 and 1971 there were 730 reported fragging incidents efforts by troops to kill or injure their own officers.
drug abuse became a major problem in 1971 four times as many troops were hospitalized for drug overdoses as for combat related wounds.
revelations of atrocities committed by u s soldiers caused even the staunchest supporters of the war to wince.
late in 1969 the story of the my lai massacre plunged the country into two years of exposure to the tale of william l rusty calley a t wenty six year old army lieutenant who ordered the murder of 347 vietnamese civilians in the village of my lai in 1968.
one peace with honor ending the vietnam war 1395 soldier described it as point blank murder and i was standing there watching it as newsmagazines published gruesome photos of the massacre americans debated the issues it raised.
a father in northern california grumbled that calley would have been a hero in the second world war.
his son shot back yeah if you were a nazi twenty five army officers were charged with complicity in the massacre and subsequent c over up but only calley was convicted.
nixon later granted him parole.
just as nixon had expected the escalation of the air war in vietnam and the extension of the war into cambodia triggered widespread a nti war demonstrations.
the president however was unmoved.
as far as this kind of activity is concerned he gruffly explained we expect it however under no circumstances will i be affected whatever by it in the spring of 1970 news of the secret cambodian incursion by u s forces set off explosive demonstrations on college campuses.
at kent state university the ohio national guard was called in to control rioting on may 4.
as radicals hurled insults and rocks at the soldiers the poorly trained guardsmen panicked and opened fire.
thirteen students were hit and four of them all bystanders were killed.
the killings at kent state added new fury to the anti war and anti nixon movements.
that spring demonstrations occurred on more than 350 campuses.
a presidential commission charged with investigating the kent state shootings concluded that they were unnecessary and unwarranted not all agreed.
a resident of kent told a reporter that anyone who appears on the streets of a city like kent with long hair dirty clothes or barefooted deserves to be shot.
it would have been better if the guard had shot the whole lot of them singer neil young had a different view.
shortly after the killings he composed a song called ohio tin soldiers and nixons coming.
were finally on our own.
this summer i hear the drumming.
four dead in ohio.
the ohio governor banned radio stations from playing the song which only made it more popular.
america again seemed at war with itself.
eleven days after the kent state tragedy on may 15 mississippi highway patrolmen riddled a dormitory at jackson state college with bullets killing two students who were protesting the war.
in new york city a nti war demonstrators who gathered to protest the student deaths and the invasion of cambodia were attacked by conservative hard hat construction workers shouting america love it or leave it 1396 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s shooting at kent state mary ann vecchio a teenage runaway participating in the anti war demonstration decries the murder of a kent state student after the national guard fired into the crowd.
who forced the protesters to disperse and then marched on city hall to raise the u s flag which had been lowered to half staff in mourning for the kent state victims.
thank god for the hard hats nixon exclaimed.
the following year in june 1971 the new york times began publishing excerpts from the history of the u s decision making process of vietnam policy a secret defense department study commissioned by robert mcnamara before his resignation as secretary of defense in 1968.
the so called pentagon papers leaked to the press by daniel ellsberg a former defense department official who had been one of henry kissingers students at harvard confirmed what many critics of the war had long suspected congress and the public had not received the full story about the gulf of tonkin incident of 1964 and contingency plans for u s entry into the war were being drawn up even as president johnson was promising that combat troops would never be sent to vietnam.
although the pentagon papers dealt with events only up to 1965 the nixon administration blocked their publication arguing that their release would endanger national security and prolong the war.
by a vote of 6 to 3 the supreme court ruled against the government.
newspapers throughout the country began publishing the documents the next day.
nixon was furious.
he peace with honor ending the vietnam war 1397 ordered the fbi to find out who had leaked the pentagon papers to the media.
when the agency identified ellsberg as the culprit the president launched a crusade to destroy him including a botched effort to break in to his psychiatrists office.
war without end in the summer of 1972 henry kissinger renewed private meetings with the north vietnamese negotiators in paris.
he now dropped his insistence upon the removal of all north vietnamese troops from south vietnam before the withdrawal of the remaining u s troops.
on october 26 only a week before the u s presidential election kissinger announced that peace is at hand as it turned out however this was a cynical ploy to win votes.
several days earlier the thieu regime in south vietnam had rejected the kissinger plan for a cease fire fearful that allowing north vietnamese troops to remain in the south would virtually guarantee a communist victory.
the peace talks broke off on december 16 and two days later the newly reelected nixon ordered massive bombings of hanoi and haiphong the two largest cities in north vietnam.
nixon told kissinger that he now would stop at nothing to bring the enemy to his knees.
we have the power.
the only question is whether we have the will to use that power.
what distinguishes me from johnson is that i have the will in spades the so called christmas bombings and the simultaneous u s mining of north vietnamese harbors aroused worldwide protest.
yet the talks in paris soon resumed and on january 27 1973 the united states north and south vietnam and the viet cong signed an agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in vietnam known as the paris peace accords.
in fact it was a carefully disguised surrender that enabled the united states to end its combat role.
while nixon and kissinger claimed that the bombings had brought north vietnam to its senses in truth the north vietnamese never altered their basic stance they kept 150 000 troops in south vietnam and remained committed to the reunification of vietnam under one government.
what had changed was the willingness of the south vietnamese who were never allowed to participate in the negotiations to accept the agreement on the basis of nixons promise that the united states would respond with full force to any communist violation of the agreement.
by the time the paris peace accords were signed in 1973 another 20 000 americans had died since nixon had taken office in 1969 the morale of the u s military had been shattered and millions of southeast asians had been killed or wounded.
fighting soon broke out again in both vietnam and cambodia.
in the end nixon and kissingers diplomatic efforts gained noth 1398 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s ing the president could not have accomplished in 1969 by ending the war on similar terms.
the collapse of south vietnam on march 29 1973 the last u s combat troops left vietnam.
the same day almost 600 american prisoners of war most of them downed pilots were released from hanoi.
within months however the cease fire collapsed the war between north and south resumed and communist forces gained the upper hand.
in cambodia renamed the khmer republic after a 1970 military coup and laos where fighting had been sporadic a communist victory also seemed inevitable.
in 1975 the north vietnamese launched a full scale invasion of south vietnam sending the south vietnamese army and civilians into headlong panic.
president thieu desperately appealed to washington for the u s assistance promised in the paris peace accords.
but congress weary of spending dollars and lives in vietnam refused.
on april 21 thieu resigned and flew to taiwan.
in the end peace with honor had given the united states just enough time to remove itself before the collapse of the south vietnamese government.
on april 30 1975 americans watched on television as north vietnamese tanks rolled into saigon soon to be renamed ho chi minh city and military helicopters lifted desperate u s embassy and south vietnamese officials and their families to warships waiting offshore.
the longest most controversial and least successful war in american history to that point was finally over.
it left a bitter legacy.
during the period of u s involvement the combined death count for combatants and civilians reached nearly 2 million.
north vietnam absorbed incredible losses some 600 000 soldiers and countless civilians.
south vietnam lost 240 000 soldiers and more than 500 000 vietnamese became refugees in the united states.
more than 58 000 americans died in vietnam another 300 000 were wounded 2 500 were declared missing and almost 100 000 returned missing one or more limbs.
the united states spent more than 699 billion on the war.
the vietnam war was the defining life event for the baby boomers the generation that provided most of the u s troops as well as most of the anti war protesters.
the controversial war divided them in ways that would be felt for years.
the loss of the war combined with news of atrocities committed by american soldiers eroded respect for the military so thoroughly that many young people came to regard military service as corrupting and dishonorable.
vietnam combat veterans average age nineteen compared to twenty six among servicemen in the second world war had lost a war in which their country had lost interest.
when they returned many found that even their families were unwilling to talk about what the soldiers had experienced peace with honor ending the vietnam war 1399 leave with honor hundreds of thousands of terrified south vietnamese tried to flee the communist forces with evacuating americans.
here a u s official punches a vietnamese man trying to join his family in an overflowing airplane at nha trang.
or were embarrassed about their involvement in the war.
i went over there thinking i was doing something right and came back a bum said larry langowski from illinois.
i came back decked with medals on my uniform and i got spit on by a hippie girl the vietnam war initially described as a crusade for democratic ideals revealed that democracy was not easily transferable to regions of the world that lacked any historical experience with democratic government.
fought to contain the spread of communism the war instead fragmented the national consensus that had governed foreign affairs since 1947 when president truman developed policies to contain communism around the world.
as opposition to the war undermined lyndon b johnsons presidency it also created enduring fractures within the democratic party.
said george mcgovern the anti war senator and 1972 democratic presidential nominee the vietnam tragedy is at the root of the confusion and division of the democratic party.
it tore up our souls not only had a decade of american effort in vietnam proved futile but the khmer rouge the insurgent cambodian communist movement had also 1400 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s won a resounding victory over the government of the u s backed khmer republic plunging that country into a bloodbath.
the maniacal khmer rouge leaders renamed the country kampuchea and organized a genocidal campaign to destroy all of their opponents killing almost a third of the total population.
the nixon doctrine and a thawing cold war despite the frustrations associated with his efforts to end the vietnam war richard nixon like john f kennedy greatly preferred foreign policy over domestic policy which he compared to building sewer projects and his greatest successes were in international relations.
nixon was an expert in foreign affairs and had traveled abroad frequently as dwight eisenhowers vice president during the 1950s.
as president nixon benefited greatly from the expertise and strategic vision of henry kissinger.
their grand design for u s foreign policy after the vietnam war centered on developing friendly relations with the soviet union and communist china.
nixon envisioned a post cold war world an era of negotiation rather than confrontation he and kissinger pressed for a return to an e isenhower era approach that entailed reducing l arge scale military interventions around the world and using the central intelligence agency cia to pursue americas strategic interests covertly.
the cia in chile ever since fidel castro and his supporters gained control of cuba in 1959 american presidents had been determined to prevent any more communist insurgencies in the western hemisphere.
in 1970 salvador allende a marxist socialist party leader and friend of castro was a leading presidential candidate in chile on the southwest coast of south america.
president nixon and henry kissinger knew that if elected allende planned to nationalize chilean industries including those owned by u s corporations.
they did not want another castro in latin america.
in september 1970 nixon urged the cia to do anything to prevent an allende presidency.
although cia agents provided campaign funds to his opponents allende was elected on october 24 1970.
the cia then encouraged chilean military leaders to oust him.
in september 1973 the army took control allende either committed suicide or was murdered and general augusto pinochet a ruthless military dictator supposedly friendly to the united states declared himself head of the government.
in consolidating control over chile pinochet executed thousands.
it was yet another example of the united states being so obsessed by anti communism the nixon doctrine and a thawing cold war 1401 and protecting american business interests that it was willing to interfere in the democratic process of other nations.
the nixon doctrine in july 1969 while announcing the first troop withdrawals from vietnam president nixon unveiled what came to be called the nixon doctrine a new approach to americas handling of international crises.
unlike john f kennedy who had declared that the united states would pay any price bear any burden to win the cold war nixon explained that america cannot and will n ot conceive all the plans design all the programs execute all the decisions and undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world those nations experiencing communist insurgencies must in the future assume primary responsibility for their own defense.
the united states would provide weapons and money but not soldiers.
at the same time nixon announced that the united states would pursue partnerships with communist countries in areas of mutual interest.
that nixon a republican with a history of rabid a nti communism would pursue such a policy of dtente a french word meaning easing of relations with americas communist archenemies shocked many and demonstrated yet again his pragmatic flexibility.
the peoples republic of china richard nixon had a genius for surprise.
in 1971 without informing secretary of state william rogers nixon told henry kissinger to make a secret trip to beijing to explore the possibility of u s recognition of communist china the most populous nation in the world with over 800 million people.
kissinger was flabbergasted.
he had earlier told his staff that our leader has taken leave of reality.
he thinks this is the moment to establish normal relations with communist china since 1949 when mao zedongs revolutionary movement established control the united states with richard nixons hearty support had refused even to recognize the peoples republic of china preferring to regard chiang kai sheks exiled regime on taiwan as the legitimate chinese government.
now however the time seemed ripe to nixon for a bold renewal of ties.
both the united states and communist china were exhausted from intense domestic strife anti war protests in america the cultural revolution in china and both were eager to resist soviet expansionism.
nixon also relished the shock effect of his action.
his reaching out to communist china he told aide john ehrlichman would discombobulate the god damned liberals it would just kill them for him to be the one reaching out to a communist enemy.
nixons bombshell announcement on july 15 1971 that kissinger had just returned from beijing and that the president himself would be going to china 1402 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s the following year sent shock waves around the world.
nixon became the first u s president to use the term peoples republic of china an important symbolic step in normalizing relations.
the nationalist chinese on taiwan felt betrayed and the japanese historic enemies of china were furious.
in october 1971 the united nations voted to admit the peoples republic of china and expel taiwan.
on february 21 1972 during the week that changed the world president nixon arrived in beijing with nixon goes to china president nixon almost a hundred journalists to report and chinese premier zhou enlai toast on his dramatic visit to communist each other at the lavish farewell banquet china.
americans watched on televiin shanghai celebrating the historic sion as the president shook hands and visit.
drank toasts with prime minister zhou enlai and communist party chairman mao zedong.
in one simple but astonishing stroke nixon and kissinger had ended two decades of diplomatic isolation of the peoples republic of china.
during the presidents w eek long visit the two nations agreed to s cientific and cultural exchanges steps toward resuming trade and the eventual reunification of taiwan with the mainland.
a year after nixons visit liaison offices that served as unofficial embassies were established in washington and beijing.
in 1979 diplomatic recognition was formalized.
as a conservative anti communist nixon had accomplished a diplomatic feat that his democratic predecessors could not have attempted for fear of being branded soft on communism.
nixon and kissingers bold move had the added benefit of giving them leverage with the soviet union which was understandably nervous about a u s chinese alliance.
embracing the soviet union in truth china welcomed the breakthrough in relations because of tensions with the soviet union with which it shared a long but contested border.
by 1972 the chinese leadership had become more fearful of the soviet union than the united states.
the soviets troubled by the agreements between china and the united states were also eager to ease tensions with the americans.
once again president nixon surprised the world by announcing that he would visit moscow in the nixon doctrine and a thawing cold war 1403 1972 for discussions with leonid brezhnev the soviet premier.
the high drama of the china visit was repeated in moscow with toasts and elegant dinners attended by world leaders who had previously regarded each other as incarnations of evil.
what became known as dtente with the soviets offered the promise of less intense competition between the superpowers.
nixon and brezhnev signed the pathbreaking strategic arms limitation treaty salt i which negotiators had been working on since 1969.
the salt agreement did not end the nuclear arms race but it did limit the number of missiles with nuclear warheads and prohibited the construction of m issile defense systems.
the moscow summit also produced new trade agreements including an arrangement whereby the united states sold almost a quarter of its wheat crop to the soviets at a favorable price.
critics called it the great grain robbery.
the summit resulted in the dramatic easing of tensions between the two superpowers.
as nixon told congress upon his return never before have two adversaries so deeply divided by conflicting ideologies and political rivalries been able to limit the armaments upon which their survival depends for nixon and kissinger the agreements with china and the soviet union represented monumental changes in the global order.
over time dtente with the soviet union would help end the cold war altogether by lowering soviet hostility to western influences which in turn slowly eroded communist rule from the inside.
shuttle diplomacy the nixon kissinger initiatives in the middle east were less dramatic and less conclusive than those in china and the soviet union but they did show that the united states at last recognized the legitimacy of arab interests in the region and its own dependence upon middle eastern oil.
in the six day war of 1967 israeli forces had routed the armies of egypt syria and jordan and seized territory from all three nations.
moreover the number of palestinian refugees many of them homeless since the creation of israel in 1948 increased after the israeli victory.
the middle east remained a tinderbox of tensions.
on october 6 1973 the jewish holy day of yom kippur syria and egypt backed by saudi a rabia and armed with soviet weapons attacked israel igniting what became the yom kippur war.
it created the most dangerous confrontation between the united states and the soviet union since the cuban missile crisis.
when the israeli army with weapons supplied by the united states launched a fierce counterattack that appeared likely to overwhelm egypt the soviets threatened to intervene militarily.
nixon whose presidency was at risk because of the ongoing watergate investigations was bedridden because he 1404 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s was drunk according to henry kissinger and other aides so kissinger as secretary of state presided over a national security council meeting that placed americas military forces on full alert.
on october 20 kissinger flew to moscow to meet with soviet premier brezhnev.
kissinger skillfully negotiated a cease fire agreement and exerted pressure on the israelis to prevent them from taking additional arab territory.
in an attempt to broker a lasting settlement kissinger made numerous flights among the capitals of the middle east.
his shuttle diplomacy won acclaim from all sides though he failed to find a comprehensive formula for peace.
he did however lay the groundwork for an important treaty between israel and egypt in 1977.
watergate nixons foreign policy achievements allowed him to stage the presidential campaign of 1972 as a triumphal procession.
early on the main threat to his reelection came from george wallace who had the potential as a t hird party candidate to deprive the republicans of conservative southern votes and thereby throw the election to the democrats.
that threat ended however on may 15 1972 when wallace was shot in an assassination attempt.
although he survived he was left paralyzed below the waist and had to withdraw from the campaign.
meanwhile the democrats nominated senator george mcgovern of south dakota an anti war liberal who had been a decorated bomber pilot during the second world war.
bobby kennedy once called mcgovern the most decent man in the senate yet he was a poor campaigner.
one journalist mused that the democratic campaign was so inept that it must have been planned by the republicans.
a growing number of voters viewed mcgovern as a left wing extremist whose campaign speeches seemed lifeless.
his high school debate coach acknowledged that georges colorfulness was his colorlessness on election day mcgovern was trounced.
nixon won the greatest victory of any republican presidential candidate in history capturing 520 electoral votes to only 17 for mcgovern.
the popular vote was equally decisive 46 million to 28 million a proportion of the total vote 60 8 percent that was second only to lyndon johnsons victory over barry goldwater in 1964.
for all of his abilities and accomplishments however nixon was chronically insecure.
he nursed grudges and took politics personally and he could be ruthless in attacking his opponents.
as president he began keeping a secret enemies list and launched numerous efforts to embarrass and punish those on the list.
little did he know that such behavior would bring him crashing down.
watergate 1405 dirty tricks by the spring of 1972 senior nixon aide john ehrlichman was overseeing a secret team of agents who performed various acts of sabotage against democrats such as falsely accusing democratic senators hubert h humphrey and henry jackson of sexual improprieties forging press releases setting off stink bombs at democratic campaign events and planting spies on george mcgoverns campaign plane.
charles chuck colson one of the most active dirty tricksters admitted that we did a hell of a lot of things and never got caught during the campaign mcgovern had complained about the dirty tricks orchestrated by members of the nixon administration.
nixon it turned out had ordered illegal wiretaps on his opponents as well as on his own aides tried to coerce the internal revenue service to intimidate democrats and told his chief of staff bob haldeman to break into the safe at the brookings institution a washington research center with democratic ties.
mcgovern was especially disturbed by an incident on june 17 1972 when five men were caught breaking into the democratic national committee headquarters in the exclusive watergate apartment and office complex in washington d c four of the burglars were right wing cuban exiles who had worked for the cia and one james w mccord worked for nixons campaign.
at the time mcgoverns complaints about the break in seemed like sour grapes from a candidate running far behind in the polls.
few people paid any attention to the burglary.
nixon denied any involvement in this very bizarre incident privately however he and his senior aides began feverish efforts to cover up the watergate affair.
the president told alexander haig his chief of staff that we will cover up until hell freezes over they secretly provided 400 000 to the jailed burglars to buy their silence and tried to keep the fbi out of the investigation.
they also discussed using the cia to derail the justice departments investigation.
they lied to journalists and destroyed evidence related to the case.
bob haldeman nixons chief of staff developed a plan for the jailed cubans to take the fall suggesting that they claim they acted solely on their own.
he also told the fbi to quit investigating the incident because it involved a super secret cia operation a lie.
nixon encouraged such efforts stressing that the main concern is to keep the white house out of it what nixon and his aides failed to account for was the dogged efforts of two washington post reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward to uncover the facts of the watergate break in.
on september 16 1972 they reported that a grand jury was about to indict the watergate burglars along with two other men gordon liddy and howard hunt who had been connected to the scheme.
liddy would be the first white house aide ever indicted.
then on october 10 bernstein and woodward revealed that the fbi had discovered a 1406 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s direct connection between the watergate burglary and the committee to r e elect the president.
seventeen days later cbss walter cronkite the nations most popular news reporter announced that watergate has escalated into charges of a high level campaign of political sabotage and espionage apparently unparalleled in american history uncovering the cover up during the trial of the accused watergate burglars in january 1973 relentless questioning by federal judge john j sirica led one of the accused to tell the full story of the nixon administrations involvement.
james w mccord security chief of the committee to re elect the president creep was the first in what would become a long line of informers to reveal the systematic efforts of nixon and his aides to create an imperial presidency by the time of the watergate b reak in money to finance dirty tricks was being illegally collected through creep and controlled by the white house staff.
the trail of evidence pursued first by sirica then by a grand jury and then by a senate committee headed by democrat samuel j ervin jr of north carolina led directly to what white house legal counsel john dean called a cancer close to the presidency nixon was personally involved in the cover up using his power to discredit and block the investigation.
he ordered the cia to keep the fbi off the case and even coached his aides how to lie under oath.
most alarming as it turned out the watergate burglary was merely part of a larger pattern of corruption and criminality sanctioned by the nixon white house.
the cover up unraveled further later that year when l patrick gray acting director of the fbi resigned after confessing that he had destroyed several incriminating documents.
on april 30 1973 ehrlichman and haldeman resigned they would later serve time in prison as did attorney general richard kleindienst.
a few days later nixon nervously assured the public in a television address i am not a crook then dean whom nixon had dismissed because of his cooperation with prosecutors shocked the nation by testifying before the ervin committee that there had been a cover up approved by the president.
nixon thereafter became preoccupied with legal self defense and political survival.
he refused to provide ervins committee with documents it requested citing executive privilege to protect national security.
in another shocking disclosure a white house aide told the committee that nixon had installed a secret taping system in the white house and that many of the conversations about the watergate burglary and cover up had been recorded.
the bombshell news set off a legal battle for the nixon tapes harvard law professor archibald cox whom nixons new attorney general elliot richardson had appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the watergate case took watergate 1407 the president to court in october 1973 to obtain the tapes.
nixon refused to release the recordings and ordered cox fired.
on october 20 in what became known as the saturday night massacre richardson and deputy attorney general william ruckelshaus resigned rather than fire cox.
solicitor general robert bork finally fired him.
coxs dismissal produced a firestorm of pub john ehrlichman ehrlichman aide to president nixon addresses the senate lic indignation.
numerous newspaper watergate committee on july 24 1973 and magazine editorials as well as a growing chorus of legislators called for the president to be impeached for obstructing justice.
a gallup poll revealed that nixons approval rating had plunged to 17 percent the lowest level any president had ever received.
the new special prosecutor leon jaworski also took the president to court.
in march 1974 the watergate grand jury indicted ehrlichman haldeman and former attorney general john mitchell for obstruction of justice and named nixon an unindicted co conspirator on april 30 nixon still refusing to turn over the actual tapes released 1 254 pages of transcribed recordings that he had edited himself often substituting the phrase expletive deleted for his vulgar language and a nti semitic rants.
the transcripts revealed a president whose oval office conversations were so petty s elf serving bigoted and profane that they degraded the stature of the office and fueled growing demands for nixon to resign.
by the summer of 1974 nixon was in full retreat.
he became alternately combative melancholy and petty.
henry kissinger found him increasingly unstable and drinking heavily.
nixons efforts to orchestrate the c over up obsessed unbalanced and unhinged him.
after meeting with the president senator barry goldwater reported that nixon jabbered incessantly often incoherently he seemed to be cracking americans watched the ervin committee hearings as if they were episodes in a soap opera.
on july 24 1974 the supreme court ruled unanimously in united states v richard m nixon that the president must surrender all of the tape recordings.
a few days later the house judiciary committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment obstruction of justice through the payment of hush money to witnesses and the withholding of evidence abuse of power through the use of federal agencies to deprive citizens of their constitutional rights and defiance of congress by withholding the tapes.
1408 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s before the house of representatives could vote on impeachment nixon grudgingly handed over the complete set of white house tapes.
the drama continued however when investigators learned that sections of certain key recordings were missing including eighteen minutes of a conversation in june 1972 during which nixon first mentioned the watergate burglary.
the presidents loyal secretary took the blame for the erasure claiming that she had accidentally pushed the wrong button but technical experts later v for victory before boarding the concluded that the missing segments white house helicopter following his had been intentionally deleted.
the resignation nixon flashes a bright smile other recordings however provided and his trademark v for victory sign to more than enough evidence of nixons the world on august 9 1974 involvement in the cover up.
at one point he had yelled at aides who were asking what they and others should say to watergate investigators i dont give a shit what happens.
i want you all to stonewall it let them plead the fifth amendment cover up or anything else the recordings led republican leaders to urge nixon to quit rather than face an impeachment trial in the senate.
on august 9 1974 the embattled president resigned from office the only president to do so.
in 1969 he had begun his presidency hoping to heal america to bring people together now he left the white house for a s elf imposed exile at his home in san clemente california having deeply wounded the nation.
nixon was one of the strangest most complicated and most interesting political figures in american history.
he never understood why the watergate affair could have ended his presidency in his view his only mistake was getting caught.
nixon claimed that a presidents actions could not be illegal he was wrong.
the watergate affairs clearest lesson was that not even a president is above the law.
but the fact that the system worked by calling a president to justice did not prevent many americans from losing faith in the credibility of elected officials.
the new york times reported that people across the country think and feel differently from what they once did as a result of the watergate crisis.
they ask questions they reject assumptions they doubt what they are told watergate 1409 watergate and the presidency if there was a silver lining in the dark cloud of watergate it was the vigor and resilience of the institutions that had brought a rogue president to j ustice the press congress the courts and public opinion.
in the aftermath of the scandal congress passed several pieces of legislation designed to curb executive power.
nervous about possible efforts to renew military assistance to south vietnam the democratic congress passed the war powers act 1973 which requires a president to inform congress within forty eight hours if u s troops are deployed in combat abroad and to withdraw troops after sixty days unless congress specifically approves their stay.
to correct abuses in the use of campaign funds congress enacted legislation in 1974 that set new ceilings on political contributions and expenditures.
and in reaction to the nixon claim of executive privilege as a means of withholding evidence congress strengthened the 1966 freedom of information act to require prompt responses to requests for information from government files and to place on government agencies the burden of proof for classifying information as secret.
an unelected president during richard nixons last year in office the watergate crisis so dominated national politics that major domestic and foreign problems received little attention.
vice president spiro agnew had himself been forced to resign in october 1973 for accepting bribes from contractors before and during his term in office.
the vice president at the time of nixons resignation was gerald rudolph ford a s quare jawed plain speaking former house minority leader from michigan whom nixon had appointed to succeed agnew under the provisions of the twenty fifth amendment.
an honest decent man ford had played football at the university of michigan before getting a law degree at yale.
but none of his accomplishments had prepared him for his unexpected role as an accidental president called upon to restore stability to a nation reeling from one crisis after another.
on august 9 1974 ford was sworn in as the nations first politically appointed chief executive the only person in history to serve as both vice president and president without having been elected to those offices.
i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots ford said in a nationally televised address.
so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers he then assured the people that our long national nightmare watergate is over but it wasnt.
restoring public confidence in elected leaders was not easy.
less than a month after taking office ford reopened the wounds of watergate by issuing nixon a full free and absolute pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office.
many americans were not in a forgiving mood and 1410 chapter 30 rebellion and reaction 1960s and 1970s fords pardon unleashed a storm of controversy.
he was grilled by a house subcommittee wanting to know whether nixon had made a secret deal for the pardon.
ford vigorously denied the charge but the pardon hobbled his presidency.
doing what he had thought was the right thing made him suspect in the eyes of many voters.
his approval rating plummeted from 71 percent to 49 percent in one day the steepest drop ever recorded.
even his press secretary resigned in protest of the nixon pardon the ford years as president gerald ford soon adopted the posture he had developed as the minority leader in the house of representatives naysaying head of the opposition who believed that the federal government exercised too much power.
in his first fifteen months as president he vetoed thirty nine bills passed by the democratic controlled congress outstripping herbert hoovers all time veto record in less than half the time.
by far the most important development during fords brief presidency was the struggling economy.
during the fall of 1974 the nation had entered its deepest recession since the great depression.
unemployment jumped to 9 percent in 1975 the annual rate of inflation reached double digits and the federal budget deficit soon hit a record.
ford announced that inflation had become public enemy no.
