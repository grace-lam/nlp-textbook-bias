2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 england and england and the new world ireland englands long struggle to conquer and pacify ireland which lasted well into the seventeenth century absorbed money and energy that might have been directed toward the new world.
in subduing ireland whose catholic population was deemed a threat to the stability of protestant rule in england the government employed a variety of approaches including military conquest the slaughter of civilians the seizure of land and introduction of english economic practices and the dispatch of large numbers of settlers.
rather than seeking to absorb the irish into english society the english excluded the native population from a territory of settlement known as the pale where the colonists created their own social order.
just as the reconquest of spain from the moors established patterns that would be repeated in spanish new world colonization the methods used in ireland anticipated policies england would undertake in america.
some sixteenth century english writers directly compared the allegedly barbaric wild irish with american indians.
like the indians the irish supposedly confused liberty and license.
they refused to respect english authority and resisted conversion to english protestantism.
the early english colonies in north america and the west indies were known as plantations that is communities planted from abroad among an alien population the same term was originally used to describe protestant settlements in ireland.
england and north america not until the reign of elizabeth i did the english turn their attention to north america although sailors and adventurers still showed more interest in raiding spanish cities and treasure fleets in the caribbean than establishing settlements.
the government granted charters grants of exclusive rights and privileges to sir humphrey gilbert and sir walter raleigh authorizing them to establish colonies in north america at their own expense.
with little or no support from the crown both ventures failed.
gilbert who had earned a reputation for brutality in the irish wars by murdering civilians and burning their crops established a short lived settlement on newfoundland in 1582.
three years later raleigh dispatched a fleet of five ships with some 100 colonists many of them his personal servants to set up a base on roanoke island off the north carolina coast partly to facilitate continuing raids on spanish shipping.
but the colonists mostly young men under military leadership abandoned the venture in 1586 and returned to england.
a second group of 100 settlers composed of families who hoped to establish a permanent colony was dispatched that year.
their fate remains a mystery.
when a ship bearing supplies arrived in 1590 the sailors found the colony abandoned with the inhabitants evidently having moved to live among the indians.
the word croaton the indian name for a nearby island or tribe had been carved on a tree.
raleigh by now nearly bankrupt lost his enthusiasm for colonization.
to establish a successful colony it seemed clear would require more planning and economic resources than any individual could provide.
what were the main contours of english colonization in the seventeenth century.
spreading protestantism as in the case of spain national glory profit and religious mission merged in early english thinking about the new world.
the reformation heightened the english governments sense of catholic spain as its mortal enemy a belief reinforced in 1588 when a spanish naval armada unsuccessfully attempted to invade the british isles.
just as spain justified its empire in part by claiming to convert indians to catholicism england expressed its imperial ambitions in terms of an obligation to liberate the new world from the tyranny of the pope.
by the late sixteenth century anticatholicism had become deeply ingrained in english popular culture.
reports of the atrocities of spanish rule were widely circulated.
english translations of bartolom de las casass writings appeared during elizabeths reign.
one using a common protestant term for the catholic church bore the title popery truly displayed although atrocities were hardly confined to any one nation as englands own conduct in ireland demonstrated the idea that the empire of catholic spain was uniquely murderous and tyrannical enabled the english to describe their own imperial ambitions in the language of freedom.
in a discourse concerning western planting written in 1584 at the request of sir walter raleigh the protestant minister and scholar richard hakluyt listed twenty three reasons why queen elizabeth i should support the establishment of colonies.
among them was the idea that english settlements would strike a blow against spains empire and therefore form part of a divine mission to rescue the new world and its inhabitants from the influence of catholicism and tyranny.
tied as slaves under spanish rule he wrote the indians of the new world were crying out to us.
to come and help they would welcome english settlers and revolt clean from the spaniard crying with one voice liberta liberta as desirous of liberty and freedom england would repeat much of spains behavior in the new world.
but the english always believed that they were unique.
in their case empire and freedom would go hand in hand.
motives for colonization but bringing freedom to indians was hardly the only argument hakluyt marshaled as england prepared to step onto the world stage.
national power and glory were never far from the minds of the eras propagandists of empire.
through colonization hakluyt and other writers argued england a relatively minor power in europe at the end of the sixteenth century could come to rival the wealth and standing of great nations like spain and france.
other considerations also weighed heavily in their arguments.
spanish claims to the south and french explorations in the area of present day canada left to england the middle part of north america a region deemed worthless by other powers because it lacked an engraving by theodor de bry depicts colonists hunting and fishing in virginia.
promotional images such as this emphasized the abundance of the new world and suggested that colonists could live familiar lives there.
2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 england and the new world precious metals and was unsuitable for sugar cultivation the two paths to riches in early american empires.
this did not however prevent promoters of colonization from painting a portrait of a fertile land of great plenty its animals were supposedly so abundant and its climate and soil so favorable that colonists could enrich the mother country and themselves by providing english consumers with goods now supplied by foreigners and opening a new market for english products.
unlike early adventurers such as raleigh who thought of wealth in terms of deposits of gold hakluyt insisted that trade would be the basis of englands empire.

hogarth was particularly concerned about the abuse of alcohol.

social crisis equally important america could be a refuge for englands surplus population benefiting mother country and emigrants alike.
the late sixteenth century was a time of social crisis in england with economic growth unable to keep pace with the needs of a population that grew from 3 million in 1550 to about 4 million in 1600.
for many years english peasants had enjoyed a secure hold on their plots of land.
but in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries landlords sought profits by raising sheep for the expanding trade in wool and introducing more modern farming practices such as crop rotation.
they evicted small farmers and fenced in commons previously open to all.
while many landlords farmers and town merchants benefited from the enclosure movement as this process was called thousands of persons were uprooted from the land.
many flooded into englands cities where wages fell dramatically.
others denounced by authorities as rogues vagabonds and vagrants wandered the roads in search of work.
their situation grew worse as prices throughout europe rose buoyed by the influx of gold and silver from the mines of latin america into spain.
a pioneering study of english society conducted at the end of the seventeenth century estimated that half the population lived at or below the poverty line.
the cost of poor relief fell mainly on local communities.
all our towns wrote the puritan leader john winthrop in 1629 shortly before leaving england for massachusetts complain of the burden of poor people and strive by all means to rid any such as they have england he added somberly grows weary of her inhabitants the government struggled to deal with this social crisis.
under henry viii those without jobs could be whipped branded forced into the army or hanged.
during elizabeths reign a law authorized justices of the peace to regulate hours and wages and put the unemployed to work.
vagrants were required to accept any job offered to them and could be punished if they sought to change employment.
another solution was to encourage the unruly poor to leave for the new world.
richard hakluyt wrote of the advantages of settling in america such needy people of our country who now what were the main contours of english colonization in the seventeenth century.
trouble the commonwealth and.
commit outrageous offenses as colonists they could become productive citizens contributing to the nations wealth.
masterless men as early as 1516 when thomas more published utopia a novel set on an imaginary island in the western hemisphere the image of america as a place where settlers could escape from the economic inequalities of europe had been circulating in england.
this ideal coincided with the goals of ordinary englishmen.
although authorities saw wandering or unemployed masterless men as a danger to society and tried to force them to accept jobs popular attitudes viewed economic dependence as itself a form of servitude.
working for wages was widely associated with servility and loss of liberty.
only those who controlled their own labor could be regarded as truly free.
indeed popular tales and ballads romanticized the very vagabonds highwaymen and even beggars denounced by the propertied and powerful since despite their poverty they at least enjoyed freedom from wage work.
the image of the new world as a unique place of opportunity where the english laboring classes could regain economic independence by acquiring land and where even criminals would enjoy a second chance was deeply rooted from the earliest days of settlement.
john smith had scarcely landed in virginia in 1607 when he wrote that in america every man may be the master and owner of his own labor and land in 1623 the royal letter approving the recruitment of emigrants to new england promised that any settler could easily become lord of 200 acres of land an amount far beyond the reach of most englishmen.
the main lure for emigrants from england to the new world was not so much riches in gold and silver as the promise of independence that followed from owning land.
economic freedom and the possibility of passing it on to ones children attracted the largest number of english colonists.
the coming of the english english emigrants seventeenth century north america was an unstable and dangerous environment.
diseases decimated indian and settler populations alike.
colonies were racked by religious political and economic tensions and drawn into imperial wars and conflict with indians.
they remained dependent on the mother country for protection and economic assistance.
without sustained immigration most settlements would have collapsed.
with a population of between 4 million and 5 million about half that of spain and a quarter of that of france england produced a far larger number of men women and children willing to brave the dangers of emigration to the new world.
in large part this was because economic conditions in england were so bad.
between 1607 and 1700 more than half a million people left england.
a pamphlet published in 1609 promoting emigration to virginia.
2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 the coming of the english north america was not the destination of the majority of these emigrants.
approximately 180 000 settled in ireland and about the same number migrated to the west indies where the introduction of sugar cultivation promised riches for those who could obtain land.
nonetheless the population of englands mainland colonies quickly outstripped that of their rivals.
the chesapeake area where the tobacco producing colonies of virginia and maryland developed a constant demand for cheap labor received about 120 000 settlers most of whom landed before 1660.
new england attracted 21 000 emigrants nearly all of them arriving before 1640.
in the second part of the seventeenth century the middle colonies new york new jersey and pennsylvania attracted about 23 000 settlers.
although the arrivals to new england and the middle colonies included many families the majority of newcomers were young single men from the bottom rungs of english society who had little to lose by emigrating.
many had already moved from place to place in england.
colonial settlement was in many ways an extension of the migration at home of an increasingly mobile english population.
indentured an indenture a contract for labor for a period of years signed by james mahoney who emigrated from ireland to north america in 1723.
servants settlers who could pay for their own passage government officials clergymen merchants artisans landowning farmers and members of the lesser nobility arrived in america as free persons.
most quickly acquired land.
in the seventeenth century however nearly two thirds of english settlers came as indentured servants who voluntarily surrendered their freedom for a specified time usually five to seven years in exchange for passage to america.
like slaves servants could be bought and sold could not marry without the permission of their owner were subject to physical punishment and saw their obligation to labor enforced by the courts.
to ensure uninterrupted work by female servants the law lengthened the term of their indenture if they became pregnant.
many negroes are better used complained elizabeth sprigs an indentured servant in maryland who described being forced to work day and night.
then tied up and whipped but unlike slaves servants could look forward to a release from bondage.
assuming they survived their period of labor servants would receive a payment known as freedom dues and become free members of society.
for most of the seventeenth century however indentured servitude was not a guaranteed route to economic autonomy.
given the high death rate many servants did not live to the end of their terms.
freedom dues were sometimes so meager that they did not enable recipients to acquire land.
many servants found the reality of life in the new world less appealing than they had anticipated.
employers constantly complained of servants running away not working diligently or being unruly all manifestations of what one commentator called their fondness for freedom land and liberty access to land played many roles in seventeenth century america.
land english settlers believed was the basis of liberty.
owning land gave men what obstacles did the english settlers in the chesapeake overcome.
control over their own labor and in most colonies the right to vote.
the promise of immediate access to land lured free settlers and freedom dues that included land persuaded potential immigrants to sign contracts as indentured servants.
land in america also became a way for the king to reward relatives and allies.
each colony was launched with a huge grant of land from the crown either to a company or to a private individual known as a proprietor.
some grants if taken literally stretched from the atlantic ocean to the pacific.
land was a source of wealth and power for colonial officials and their favorites who acquired enormous estates.
without labor however land would have little value.
since emigrants did not come to america intending to work the land of others except temporarily in the case of indentured servants the very abundance of free land eventually led many property owners to turn to slaves as a workforce.
englishmen and indians land in north america of course was already occupied.
and the arrival of english settlers presented the native inhabitants of eastern north america with the greatest crisis in their history.
unlike the spanish english colonists did not call themselves conquerors they wanted land not dominion over the existing population.
they were chiefly interested in displacing the indians and settling on their land not intermarrying with them organizing their labor or making them subjects of the crown.
the marriage between john rolfe and pocahontas the daughter of virginias leading chief discussed below is well known but almost unique.
no such mixed marriage took place in seventeenthcentury massachusetts and only two more in virginia before the legislature outlawed the practice in 1691.
the english exchanged goods with the native population and indians often traveled through colonial settlements.
fur traders on the frontiers of settlement sometimes married indian women partly as a way of gaining access to native societies and the kin networks essential to economic relationships.
most english settlers however remained obstinately separate from their indian neighbors.
despite their insistence that indians had no real claim to the land since they did not cultivate or improve it most colonial authorities in practice recognized indians title based on occupancy.
they acquired land by purchase often in treaties forced upon indians after they had suffered military defeat.
colonial courts recorded numerous sales of indian land to governments or individual settlers.
to keep the peace some colonial governments tried to prevent the private seizure or purchase of indian lands or they declared certain areas off limits to settlers.
but these measures were rarely enforced and ultimately proved ineffective.

2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 the coming of the english new settlers and freed servants sought land for themselves and those who established families in america needed land for their children.
the seventeenth century was marked by recurrent warfare between colonists and indians.
these conflicts generated a strong feeling of superiority among the colonists and left them intent on maintaining the real and imagined boundaries separating the two peoples.
in the initial stages of settlement english colonists often established towns on sites indians had cleared planted indian crops and adopted indian technology such as snowshoes and canoes which were valuable for travel in the american wilderness.
but over time the english displaced the original inhabitants more thoroughly than any other european empire.
the the only known contemporary portrait of a new england indian this 1681 painting by an unnamed artist was long thought to represent ninigret ii a leader of the narragansetts of rhode island.
it has been more recently identified as david an indian who saved the life of john winthrop ii a governor of colonial connecticut.
apart from the wampum beads around his neck everything the indian wears is of english manufacture.
transformation of indian life many eastern indians initially welcomed the newcomers or at least their goods which they appreciated for their practical advantages.
items like woven cloth metal kettles iron axes fishhooks hoes and guns were quickly integrated into indian life.
indians also displayed a great desire for goods like colorful glass beads and copper ornaments that could be incorporated into their religious ceremonies.
as indians became integrated into the atlantic economy subtle changes took place in indian life.
european metal goods changed their farming hunting and cooking practices.
men devoted more time to hunting beaver for fur trading.
older skills deteriorated as the use of european products expanded and alcohol became increasingly common and disruptive.
indians learned to bargain effectively and to supply items that europeans desired.
later observers would describe this trade as one in which indians exchanged valuable commodities like furs and animal skins for worthless european trinkets.
in fact both europeans and indians gave up goods they had in abundance in exchange for items in short supply in their own society.
but as the colonists achieved military superiority over the indians the profits of trade mostly flowed to colonial and european merchants.
growing connections with europeans stimulated warfare among indian tribes and the overhunting of beaver and deer forced some groups to encroach on territory claimed by others.
and newcomers from europe brought epidemics that decimated indian populations.
changes in the land traders religious missionaries and colonial authorities all sought to reshape indian society and culture.
but as settlers spread over the land they threatened indians ways of life more completely than any company of soldiers or group of bureaucrats.
as settlers fenced in more and more land and introduced new crops and livestock the natural environment changed in ways that undermined traditional indian agriculture and hunting.
pigs and cattle roamed freely trampling indian cornfields and gardens.
the need for wood to build what obstacles did the english settlers in the chesapeake overcome.
and heat homes and export to england depleted forests on which indians relied for hunting.
the rapid expansion of the fur trade diminished the population of beaver and other animals.
since you are here strangers and come into our country one group of indians told early settlers in the chesapeake you should rather conform yourselves to the customs of our country than impose yours on us but it was the indians whose lives were most powerfully altered by the changes set in motion in 1607 when english colonists landed at jamestown.
settling the chesapeake the jamestown colony ch by 1650 english settlement in the the early history of jamestown was to say the least not promising.
the chesapeake had spread well beyond the colonys leadership changed repeatedly its inhabitants suffered an extraorinitial colony at jamestown as tobacco dinarily high death rate and with the company seeking a quick profit supplanters sought fertile land near navigable plies from england proved inadequate.

the only portrait of pocahontas during her lifetime was engraved by simon van de passe in england in 1616.
after converting to christianity pocahontas took the name rebecca.
company to society the virginia company slowly realized that for the colony to survive it would have to abandon the search for gold grow its own food and find a marketable commodity.
it would also have to attract more settlers.
with this end in view it announced new policies in 1618 that powerfully shaped virginias development as a functioning society rather than an outpost of london based investors.
instead of retaining all the land for itself the company introduced the headright system awarding fifty acres of land to any colonist who paid for his own or anothers passage.
thus anyone who brought in a sizable number of servants would immediately acquire a large estate.
in place of the governors militaristic regime a charter of grants and liberties was issued including the establishment of a house of burgesses.
when it convened in 1619 this became the first elected assembly in colonial america.
the house of burgesses was hardly a model of democracy only landowners could vote and the company and its appointed governor retained the right to nullify any measure the body adopted.
but its creation established a political precedent that all english colonies would eventually follow.
also in 1619 the first twenty blacks arrived in virginia on a dutch vessel.
the full significance of these two events would not be apparent until years later.
but they laid the foundation for a society that would one day be dominated economically and politically by slaveowning planters.
powhatan and pocahontas when the english arrived at jamestown they landed in an area inhabited by some 15 000 to 25 000 indians living in numerous small agricultural villages.
most acknowledged the rule of wahunsonacock a shrewd and forceful leader who had recently consolidated his authority over the region and collected tribute from some thirty subordinate tribes.
called powhatan by the settlers after the indian word for both his tribe and his title of paramount chief he quickly realized the advantages of trade with the newcomers.
for its part mindful of las casass condemnation of spanish behavior the virginia company instructed its colonists to treat local indians kindly and to try to convert them to christianity.
realizing that the colonists depended on the indians for food john smith tried to stop settlers from seizing produce from nearby villages lest the indians cut off all trade.
in the first two years of jamestowns existence relations with indians were mostly peaceful and based on a fairly equal give and take.
at one point smith was captured by the indians and threatened with execution by powhatan only to be rescued by pocahontas reputedly the favorite among his many children by dozens of wives.
the incident has come down in legend most recently a popular animated film as an example of a rebellious love struck teenager defying her father.
in fact it was probably part of an elaborate ceremony designed by powhatan to demonstrate his power over the colonists and incorporate them into his realm.
pocahontas subsequently how did virginia and maryland develop in their early years.
became an intermediary between the two peoples bringing food and messages to jamestown.
john smiths return to england raised tensions between the two groups and a period of sporadic conflict began in 1610 with the english massacring villagers indiscriminately and destroying indian crops.
pocahontas herself was captured and held as a hostage by the settlers in 1613.
while confined to jamestown she converted to christianity.
as part of the restoration of peace in 1614 she married the english colonist john rolfe.
two years later she accompanied her husband to england where she caused a sensation in the court of james i as a symbol of anglo indian harmony and missionary success.
but she succumbed to disease in 1617.
her father died the following year.
the uprising of once it became clear that the english were interested in establishing a permanent and constantly expanding colony not a trading post conflict with local indians was inevitable.
the peace that began in 1614 ended abruptly in 1622 when powhatans brother and successor opechancanough led a brilliantly planned surprise attack that in a single day wiped out one quarter of virginias settler population of 1 200.
the surviving 900 colonists organized themselves into military bands which then massacred scores of indians and devastated their villages.
a spokesman for the virginia company explained the reason behind the indian assault the daily fear that.
in time we by our growing continually upon them would dispossess them of this country but by going to war declared governor francis wyatt the indians had forfeited any claim to the land.
virginias policy he continued must now be nothing less than the expulsion of the savages to gain the free range of the country indians remained a significant presence in virginia and trade continued throughout the century.
but the unsuccessful uprising of 1622 fundamentally shifted the balance of power in the colony.
the settlers supremacy was reinforced in 1644 when a last desperate rebellion led by opechancanough now said to be 100 years old was crushed after causing the deaths of some 500 colonists.
virginia forced a treaty on the surviving coastal indians who now numbered less than 2 000 that acknowledged their subordination to the government at jamestown and required them to move to tribal reservations to the west and not enter areas of european settlement without permission.
this policy of separation followed the precedent already established in ireland.
settlers spreading inland into the virginia countryside continued to seize indian lands.
the destruction caused by the uprising of 1622 was the last in a series of blows suffered by the virginia company.
two years later it surrendered its charter and virginia became the first royal colony its governor now appointed by the crown.
virginia had failed to accomplish any of its goals for either the company or the settlers.
investors had not turned a profit and although the company had sent 6 000 settlers to virginia its white population numbered only 1 200 when the king assumed control.
preoccupied with affairs at home the government in london for years paid little attention to virginia.
henceforth the local elite not a faraway company controlled the colonys development.
and that elite was growing rapidly in powhatan the most prominent indian leader in the original area of english settlement in virginia.
this image showing powhatan and his court was engraved on john smiths map of virginia and included in smiths general history of virginia published in 1624.

wealth and power thanks to the cultivation of a crop introduced from the west indies by john rolfe tobacco.
a an advertisement for tobacco includes images of slaves with agricultural implements.
tobacco colony king james i considered tobacco harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs and issued a spirited warning against its use.
but increasing numbers of europeans enjoyed smoking and believed the tobacco plant had medicinal benefits.
as a commodity with an ever expanding mass market in europe tobacco became virginias substitute for gold.
it enriched an emerging class of tobacco planters as well as members of the colonial government who assigned good land to themselves.
the crown profited from customs duties taxes on tobacco that entered or left the kingdom.
by 1624 more than 200 000 pounds were being grown producing startling profits for landowners.
forty years later the crop totaled 15 million pounds and it doubled again by the 1680s.
the spread of tobacco farming produced a dispersed society with few towns and little social unity.
it inspired a get richquick attitude and a frenzied scramble for land and labor.
by the middle of the seventeenth century a new influx of immigrants with ample financial resources sons of merchants and english gentlemen had taken advantage of the headright system and governmental connections to acquire large estates along navigable rivers.
they established themselves as the colonys social and political elite.
the expansion of tobacco cultivation also led to an increased demand for field labor met for most of the seventeenth century by young male indentured servants.
despite harsh conditions of work in the tobacco fields a persistently high death rate and laws mandating punishments from whipping to an extension of service for those who ran away or were unruly the how did virginia and maryland develop in their early years.
abundance of land continued to attract migrants.
of the 120 000 english immigrants who entered the chesapeake region during the seventeenth century three quarters came as servants.
virginias white society increasingly came to resemble that of england with a wealthy landed gentry at the top a group of small farmers mostly former indentured servants who had managed to acquire land in the middle and an army of poor laborers servants and landless former indentured servants at the bottom.
by 1700 the regions white population had grown to nearly 90 000.
women and the fa m i ly virginia however lacked one essential element of english society stable family life.
the colony avidly promoted the immigration of women including several dozen tobacco brides who arrived in 1620 and 1621 for arranged marriages.
but given the demand for male servants to work in the tobacco fields men in the chesapeake outnumbered women for most of the seventeenth century by four or five to one.
the vast majority of women who emigrated to the region came as indentured servants.
since they usually had to complete their terms of service before marrying they did not begin to form families until their mid twenties.
the high death rate unequal ratio between the sexes and late age of marriage for those who found partners retarded population growth and produced a society with large numbers of single men widows and orphans.
although patriarchal ideals remained intact in virginia in practice the traditional authority of husbands and fathers was weakened.
because of their own low life expectancy fathers found it difficult to supervise the careers and marriages of their children.
in the colonies as in england a married woman possessed certain rights before the law including a claim to dower rights of one third of her husbands property in the event that he died before she did.
when the widow processing tobacco was as labor intensive as caring for the plant in the fields.
here scantily clad slaves and female indentured servants work with the crop after it has been harvested.
2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 settling the chesapeake died however the property passed to the husbands male heirs.
english law was far less generous than in spain where a woman could hold independently any property inherited from her parents and a man and wife owned jointly all the wealth accumulated during a marriage.
social conditions in the colonies however opened the door to roles women rarely assumed in england.
widows and the few women who never married took advantage of their legal status as femme sole a woman alone who enjoyed an independent legal identity denied to married women to make contracts and conduct business.
margaret brent who emigrated to the chesapeake in 1638 acquired land managed her own plantation and acted as a lawyer in court.
some widows were chosen to administer their husbands estates or were willed their husbands property outright rather than receiving only the one third dower rights but because most women came to virginia as indentured servants they could look forward only to a life of hard labor in the tobacco fields and early death.
servants were frequently subjected to sexual abuse by their masters.
those who married often found themselves in poverty when their husbands died.
the maryland experiment although it began under very different sponsorship and remained much smaller than virginia during the seventeenth century the second chesapeake colony maryland followed a similar course of development.
as in virginia tobacco came to dominate the economy and tobacco planters the society.
but in other ways marylands history was strikingly different.
maryland was established in 1632 as a proprietary colony that is a grant of land and governmental authority to a single individual.
this was cecilius calvert the son of a recently deceased favorite of king charles i.
the charter made calvert proprietor of the colony and granted him full free and absolute power including control of trade and the right to initiate all legislation with an elected assembly confined to approving or disapproving his proposals.
calvert imagined maryland as a feudal domain.
land would be laid out in manors with the owners paying quitrents to the proprietor.
calvert disliked representative institutions and believed ordinary people should not meddle in governmental affairs.
on the other hand the charter also guaranteed to colonists all privileges franchises and liberties of englishmen.
while these were not spelled out they undoubtedly included the idea of a government limited by the law.
here was a recipe for conflict and maryland had more than its share during the seventeenth century.
religion in maryland further aggravating instability in the colony was the fact that calvert a catholic envisioned maryland as a refuge for his persecuted coreligionists in england especially the younger sons of catholic gentry who had few economic or political prospects in england.
in maryland he hoped protestants and catholics could live in a harmony unknown in europe.
the first group of 130 colonists included a number of catholic gentlemen and two priests.
most appointed officials were also catholic including relatives of the proprietor as were those to whom he awarded the choicest land grants.
but protestants always formed a majority of the settlers.
most as how did virginia and maryland develop in their early years.
in virginia came as indentured servants but others took advantage of marylands generous headright system to acquire land by transporting workers to the colony.
as in virginia the death rate remained very high.
in one county half the marriages during the seventeenth century lasted fewer than eight years before one partner died.
almost 70 percent of male settlers in maryland died before reaching the age of fifty and half the children born in the colony did not live to adulthood.
but at least initially maryland seems to have offered servants greater opportunity for landownership than virginia.
unlike in the older colony freedom dues in maryland included fifty acres of land.
as tobacco planters engrossed the best land later in the century however the prospects for landless men diminished.
t h e n e w e n g l a n d way the rise of puritanism as virginia and maryland evolved toward societies dominated by a small aristocracy ruling over numerous bound laborers a very different social order emerged in seventeenth century new england.
the early history of that region is intimately connected to the religious movement known as puritanism which arose in england late in the sixteenth century.
the term was initially coined by opponents to ridicule those not satisfied with the progress of the protestant reformation in england who called themselves not puritans but godly or true protestants puritanism came to define a set of religious principles and a view of how society should be organized.
puritans differed among themselves on many issues.
but all shared the conviction that the church of england retained too many elements of catholicism in its religious rituals and doctrines.
puritans saw elaborate church ceremonies the rule that priests could not marry and ornate church decorations as vestiges of popery many rejected the catholic structure of religious authority descending from a pope or king to archbishops bishops and priests.
only independent local congregations they believed should choose clergymen and determine modes of worship.
these puritans were called congregationalists all puritans shared many of the beliefs of the church of england and the society as a whole including a hatred of catholicism and a pride in englands greatness as a champion of liberty.
but they believed that neither the church nor the nation was living up to its ideals.
puritans considered religious belief a complex and demanding matter and urged believers to seek the truth by reading the bible and listening to sermons by educated ministers rather than devoting themselves to sacraments administered by priests and to what puritans considered formulaic prayers.
the sermon was the central rite of puritan practice.
in the course of a lifetime according to one estimate the average puritan listened to some 7 000 sermons.
in their religious beliefs puritans followed the ideas of the french born swiss theologian john calvin.
the world calvin taught was divided between the elect and the damned.
all persons sought salvation but whether one was among the elect destined to be saved had already been determined by god.
his will ultimately was unknowable and nothing one did on earth including prayers good works and offerings would make the first book printed in the english mainland colonies the whole book of psalmes faithfully translated into english metre was published in cambridge massachusetts in 1640.
worshipers used it to sing psalms religious songs from the bible sung in massachusetts unaccompanied by music which puritan churches banned.

but while there were no guarantees of salvation worldly success leading a good life prospering economically might well be indications of gods grace.
idleness and immoral behavior were sure signs of damnation.
moral a portrait of john winthrop first governor of the massachusetts bay colony painted in the 1640s.
liberty puritanism however was not simply a set of ideas but a state of mind a zealousness in pursuing the true faith that alienated many who held differing religious views.
a minority of puritans such as those who settled in plymouth colony became separatists abandoning the church of england entirely to form their own independent churches.
most however hoped to purify the church from within.
but in the 1620s and 1630s as charles i seemed to be moving toward a restoration of catholic ceremonies and the church of england dismissed puritan ministers and censored their writings many puritans decided to emigrate.
they departed england not so much due to persecution but because they feared that popish practices had grown to such an intolerable height as one minister complained that the consciences of gods saints.
could no longer bear them by the same token puritans blamed many of englands social problems on the wandering poor whom they considered indolent and ungodly.
when puritans emigrated to new england they hoped to escape what they believed to be the religious and worldly corruptions of english society.
they would establish a city set upon a hill a bible commonwealth whose influence would flow back across the atlantic and rescue england from godlessness and social decay.
like so many other emigrants to america puritans came in search of liberty especially the right to worship and govern themselves in what they deemed a truly christian manner.
freedom for puritans was primarily a spiritual affair.
it implied the opportunity and the responsibility to obey gods will through self government and self denial.
it certainly did not mean unrestrained action improper religious practices or sinful behavior of which puritans thought there were far too many examples in england.
in a 1645 speech to the massachusetts legislature explaining the puritan conception of freedom john winthrop the colonys governor distinguished sharply between two kinds of liberty.
natural liberty or acting without restraint suggested a liberty to do evil this was the false idea of freedom supposedly adopted by the irish indians and bad christians generally.
genuine moral liberty the christian liberty described in chapter 1 meant a liberty to that only which is good it was quite compatible with severe restraints on speech religion and personal behavior.
true freedom winthrop insisted depended on subjection to authority both religious and secular otherwise anarchy was sure to follow.
to puritans liberty meant that the elect had a right to establish churches and govern society not that others could challenge their beliefs or authority.
the pilgrims at p ly m o u t h the first puritans to emigrate to america were a group of separatists known as the pilgrims.
they had already fled to the netherlands in 1608 believing that satan had begun to sow errors heresies and discords in england.
a decade later fearing that their children were being corrupted by being what made the english settlement of new england distinctive.
drawn into the surrounding culture they decided to emigrate to virginia.
the expedition was financed by a group of english investors who hoped to establish a base for profitable trade.
in september 1620 the mayflower carrying 150 settlers and crew among them many nonpuritans embarked from england.
blown off course they landed not in virginia but hundreds of miles to the north on cape cod.
here the 102 who survived the journey established the colony of plymouth.
before landing the pilgrim leaders drew up the mayflower compact in which the adult men going ashore agreed to obey just and equal laws enacted by representatives of their own choosing.
this was the first written frame of government in what is now the united states.
a century earlier when giovanni da verrazano explored the atlantic coast of north america he encountered thickly settled villages and saw the smoke of innumerable indian bonfires.
by the time the pilgrims landed hundreds of european fishing vessels had operated off new england landing to trade with indians and bringing as elsewhere epidemics.
the pilgrims arrived in an area whose native population had recently been decimated by smallpox.
they established plymouth on the site of an abandoned indian village whose fields had been cleared before the epidemic and were ready for cultivation.
nonetheless the settlers arrived six weeks before winter without food or farm animals.
half died during the first winter.
the colonists only survived through the help of local indians notably squanto who with twenty other indians had been kidnapped and brought to spain in 1614 by the english explorer thomas hunt who planned to sell them as slaves.
rescued by a local priest squanto somehow made his way to london where he learned english.
he returned to massachusetts in 1619 only to find that his people the patuxet had succumbed to disease.
he served as interpreter for the pilgrims taught them where to fish and how to plant corn and helped in the forging of an alliance with massasoit a local chief.
in the autumn of 1621 the pilgrims invited their indian allies to a harvest feast celebrating their survival the first thanksgiving.
the pilgrims hoped to establish a society based on the lives of the early christian saints.
their government rested on the principle of consent and voting was not restricted to church members.
all land was held in common until 1627 when it was divided among the settlers.
plymouth survived as an independent colony until 1691 but it was soon overshadowed by massachusetts bay to its north.
the great migration chartered in 1629 the massachusetts bay company was founded by a group of london merchants who hoped to further the puritan cause and an early seventeenth century engraving shows the english explorer bartholomew gosnold encountering native americans.
gosnold landed at cape cod in 1602 and then established a small outpost on nearby cuttyhunk island.

questions 1.
what does champlains sketch tell us about native american life in new england before the advent of english settlement.
why do you think many europeans claimed that indians did not live in settled communites.
what made the english settlement of new england distinctive.
turn a profit through trade with the indians.
the first five ships sailed from england in 1629 and by 1642 some 21 000 puritans had emigrated to massachusetts.
long remembered as the great migration this flow of population represented less than one third of english emigration in the 1630s.
far more english settlers arrived in ireland the chesapeake and the caribbean.
after 1640 migration to new england virtually ceased and in some years more colonists left the region than arrived.
nonetheless the great migration established the basis for a stable and thriving society.
in many ways the settling of new england was unique.
although servants represented about one quarter of the great migration most settlers arrived in massachusetts in families.
they came for many reasons including the desire to escape religious persecution anxiety about the future of england and the prospect of economic betterment.
compared with colonists in virginia and maryland they were older and more prosperous and the number of men and women more equally balanced.
because of the even sex ratio and new englands healthier climate the population grew rapidly doubling every twenty seven years.
although the region received only a small fraction of the centurys migration by 1700 new englands white population of 91 000 outnumbered that of both the chesapeake and the west indies.
nearly all were descendants of those who crossed the atlantic during the great migration.
the puritan fa m i ly while the imbalance between male and female migrants made it difficult for patriarchal family patterns fully to take root in the chesapeake until the end of the seventeenth century they emerged very quickly in new england.
whatever their differences with other englishmen on religious matters puritans shared with the larger society a belief in male authority within the household as well as an adherence to the common law tradition that severely limited married womens legal and economic rights.
puritans in america carefully emulated the family structure of england insisting that the obedience of women children and servants to mens will was the foundation of social stability.
the fathers authority was all the more vital because in a farming society without large numbers of slaves or servants control over the labor of ones family was essential to a mans economic success.
to be sure puritans deemed women to be the spiritual equals of men and women were allowed to become full church members.
although all ministers were men the puritan belief in the ability of believers to interpret the bible opened the door for some women to claim positions of religious leadership.
the ideal puritan marriage was based on reciprocal affection and companionship and divorce was legal.
yet within the household the husbands authority was virtually absolute.
indeed a mans position as head of his family was thought to replicate gods authority in spiritual matters and the authority of the government in the secular realm.
magistrates sometimes intervened to protect wives from physical abuse but they also enforced the power of fathers over their children and husbands over their wives.
moderate correction was considered appropriate for women who violated their husbands sense of proper behavior.

in his 1645 speech on liberty quoted above john winthrop noted that woman achieved genuine freedom by fulfilling her prescribed social role and embracing subjection to her husbands authority the family was the foundation of strong communities and unmarried adults seemed a danger to the social fabric.
an early law of plymouth declared that no single person be suffered to live of himself the typical new england woman married at twenty two a younger age than her english counterpart and gave birth seven times.
because new england was a far healthier environment than the chesapeake more children survived infancy.
thus much of a womans adult life was devoted to bearing and rearing children.
government the savage family a 1779 painting by the new england artist edward savage depicts several generations of a typically numerous puritan family.
and society in massachusetts in a sermon aboard the arabella on which he sailed for massachusetts in 1630 john winthrop spoke of the settlers binding themselves together in the bond of brotherly affection in order to promote the glory of god and their own common good puritans feared excessive individualism and lack of social unity.
unlike the dispersed plantation centered society of the chesapeake the leaders of massachusetts organized the colony in selfgoverning towns.
groups of settlers received a land grant from the colonys government and then subdivided it with residents awarded house lots in a central area and land on the outskirts for farming.
much land remained in commons either for collective use or to be divided among later settlers or the sons of the towns founders.
each town had its own congregational church.
each according to a law of 1647 was required to establish a school since the ability to read the bible was central to puritan belief.
to train an educated ministry harvard college was established in 1636 nearly a century after the royal university of mexico founded in 1551 and two years later the first printing press in english america was established in cambridge.
the government of massachusetts reflected the puritans religious and social vision.
wishing to rule the colony without outside interference and to prevent non puritans from influencing decision making the shareholders of the massachusetts bay company emigrated to america taking the charter with them and transforming a commercial document into a form of government.
at first the eight shareholders chose the men who ruled the colony.
in 1634 a group of deputies elected by freemen landowning church members was added to form a single ruling body the general court.
ten years later company officers and elected deputies were divided into two legislative houses.
unlike virginia whose governors were appointed first by a faraway company and after 1624 by the crown or maryland where authority rested with a what made the english settlement of new england distinctive.
single proprietor the freemen of massachusetts elected their governor.
the principle of consent was central to puritanism.
church government was decentralized each congregation as one minister put it had complete liberty to stand alone churches were formed by voluntary agreement among members who elected the minister.
no important church decision was made without the agreement of the male members.
towns governed themselves and local officials delegates to the general court and the colonial governor were all elected.
puritans however were hardly believers in equality.
church membership a status that carried great prestige and power was a restrictive category.
anyone could worship at a church or as the puritans preferred to call it meeting house but to be a full member required demonstrating that one had experienced divine grace and could be considered a visible saint usually by testifying about a conversion experience.
although male property holders generally chose local officials voting in colony wide elections was limited to men who had been accepted as full church members.
this requirement at first made for a broad electorate especially compared with england.
but as time went on it meant that a smaller and smaller percentage of the population controlled the government.
puritan democracy was for those within the circle of church membership those outside the boundary occupied a secondary place in the bible commonwealth.
puritan liberties seventeenth century new england was a hierarchical society in which socially prominent families were assigned the best land and the most desirable seats in church.
some must be rich and some poor some high and eminent in power and dignity others mean and in subjection declared john winthrop.
this was part of gods plan reinforced by man made law and custom.
the general court forbade ordinary men and women from wearing the garb of gentlemen ordinary settlers were addressed as goodman and goodwife while the better sort were called gentleman and lady or master and mistress when the general court in 1641 issued a body of liberties outlining the rights and responsibilities of massachusetts colonists it adopted the traditional understanding of liberties as privileges that derived from ones place in the social order.
inequality was considered an expression of gods will and while some liberties applied to all inhabitants there were separate lists of rights for freemen women children and servants.
the body of liberties also allowed for slavery.
the first african slave appears in the records of massachusetts bay in 1640.
massachusetts forbade ministers from holding office so as not to interfere with their spiritual responsibilities.
but church and state were closely interconnected.
the law required each town to establish a church and to an embroidered banner depicting the main building at harvard the first college established in the english colonies.
it was probably made by a massachusetts woman for a husband or son who attended harvard.
2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 new englanders divided levy a tax to support the minister.
there were no separate church courts but the state enforced religious devotion.
the body of liberties affirmed the rights of free speech and assembly and equal protection of the law for all within the colony but the laws of massachusetts prescribed the death penalty for among other things worshiping any god but the lord god practicing witchcraft or committing blasphemy.
new englanders divided the puritans exalted individual judgment hence their insistence on reading the bible.
the very first item printed in english america was a broadside the oath of a freeman 1638 explaining the rights and duties of the citizens of massachusetts and emphasizing that men should vote according to their own conscience.
without respect of persons or favor of any men yet modern ideas of individualism privacy and personal freedom would have struck puritans as quite strange.
they considered too much emphasis on the self dangerous to social harmony and community stability.
in the closely knit towns of new england residents carefully monitored one anothers behavior and chastised or expelled those who violated communal norms.
in the puritan view as one colonist put it the main freedom possessed by dissenters was the liberty to keep away from us towns banished individuals for such offenses as criticizing the church or government complaining about the colony in letters home to england or in the case of one individual abigail gifford for being a very burdensome woman tolerance of difference was not high on the list of puritan values.
roger williams differences of opinion about how to organize a bible commonwealth however emerged almost from the founding of massachusetts.
with its emphasis on individual interpretation of the bible puritanism contained the seeds of its own fragmentation.
the first sustained criticism of the existing order came from the young minister roger williams who arrived in massachusetts in 1631 and soon began to insist that its congregations withdraw from the church of england and that church and state be separated.
soul liberty williams believed required that individuals be allowed to follow their consciences wherever they led.
to most puritans the social fabric was held together by certain religious truths which could not be questioned.
to williams any law abiding citizen should be allowed to practice whatever form of religion he chose.
for the government to molest any person jew or gentile for either professing doctrine or practicing worship violated the principle that genuine religious faith is voluntary.
williams aimed to strengthen religion not weaken it.
the embrace of government he insisted corrupted the purity of christian faith and drew believers into endless religious wars like those that racked europe.
to leaders like john winthrop the outspoken ministers attack on the religious political establishment of massachusetts was bad enough but williams compounded the offense by rejecting the conviction that puritans were an elect people on a divine mission to spread the true faith.
williams denied that god had singled out any group as special favorites.

in a world in which the right of individuals to participate in religious activities without governmental interference barely existed rhode island became a beacon of religious freedom.
it had no established church no religious qualifications for voting until the eighteenth century and no requirement that citizens attend church.
it became a haven for dissenters protestants who belonged to denominations other than the established church and jews persecuted in other colonies.
rhode islands frame of government was also more democratic.
the assembly was elected twice a year the governor annually and town meetings were held more frequently than elsewhere in new england.
religious disagreements in massachusetts generated other colonies as well.
in 1636 the minister thomas hooker established a settlement at date of settlement massachusetts plymouth rhode island connecticut new haven by the mid seventeenth century english settlement in new england had spread well inland and up and down the atlantic coast.
recent h1 voices of freedom from john winthrop speech to the massachusetts general court july 3 1645 john winthrop governor of the massachusetts bay colony describes two very different definitions of liberty in this speech.
the great questions that have troubled the country are about the authority of the magistrates and the liberty of the people.
concerning liberty i observe a great mistake in the country about that.
there is a twofold liberty natural i mean as our nature is now corrupt and civil or federal.
the first is common to man with beasts and other creatures.
by this man as he stands in relation to man simply hath liberty to do what he lists it is a liberty to do evil as well as to do good.
this liberty is incompatible and inconsistent with authority and cannot endure the least restraint of the most just authority.
the exercise and maintaining of this liberty makes men grow more evil and in time to be worse than brute beasts.
this is that great enemy of truth and peace that wild beast which all the ordinances of god are bent against to restrain and subdue it.
the other kind of liberty i call civil or federal it may also be termed moral.
this liberty is the proper end and object of authority and cannot subsist without it and it is a liberty to that only which is good just and honest.
this liberty is maintained and exercised in a way of subjection to authority it is of the same kind of liberty wherewith christ hath made us free.
the womans own choice makes.
a man her husband yet being so chosen he is her lord and she is to be subject to him yet in a way of liberty not of bondage and a true wife accounts her subjection her honor and freedom and would not think her condition safe and free but in her subjection to her husbands authority.
such is the liberty of the church under the authority of christ.
from roger williams l e t t e r t o t h e to w n o f pr o v i d e n c e 1 6 5 5 a pioneer of the idea of religious toleration in the colonies roger williams left massachusetts to found rhode island where unlike in puritan massachusetts he established separation of church and state.
believing his views had been misunderstood by some of the settlers of providence he wrote this letter to explain his understanding of liberty and its extent and limits.
the commander of this ship ought to command the ships course yea and also command that justice peace and sobriety be kept and practiced both among the seamen and all the passengers.

an infinite liberty of conscience is a mistake are not equal in christ therefore no masters nor officers no laws nor orders nor corrections nor punishments i say i never denied but in such and which i have ever disclaimed and abhorred.
to prevent such mistakes i shall at present only cases whatever is pretended the commander or commanders may judge resist compel and punish propose this case there goes many a ship to sea with many hundred souls in one ship whose weal or woe such transgressors.
is common and is a true picture of a commonwealth or a human combination or society.
it hath fallen out sometimes that both papists and protestants jews and turks muslims may be embarked in one ship upon which supposal i affirm that all the liberty of conscience that ever i pleaded for turns upon these two hinges that none of the papists protestants jews or turks be forced to come to the ships prayers or worship nor compelled from their own particular prayers or worship if they practice any.
i further add that i never denied that notwithstanding this liberty questions 1.
why does winthrop consider natural liberty dangerous.
in what ways does williams place limits on liberty.
how do the views of winthrop and williams differ and in what ways are they similar.
2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 new englanders divided hartford.
its system of government embodied in the fundamental orders of 1639 was modeled on that of massachusetts with the significant exception that men did not have to be church members to vote.
quite different was the colony of new haven founded in 1638 by emigrants who wanted an even closer connection between church and state.
in 1662 hartford and new haven received a royal charter that united them as the colony of connecticut.
the trials of anne hutchinson more threatening to the puritan establishment both because of her gender and because she attracted a large and influential following was anne hutchinson.
a midwife and the daughter of a clergyman hutchinson wrote john winthrop was a woman of a ready wit and bold spirit she arrived in massachusetts with her husband in 1634 to join their minister john cotton who had been expelled from his pulpit in england by church authorities.
hutchinson began holding meetings in her home where she led discussions of religious issues among men and women including a number of prominent merchants and public officials.
in hutchinsons view salvation was gods direct gift to the elect and could not be earned by good works devotional practices or other human effort.
most puritans shared this belief.
what set hutchinson apart was her charge that nearly all the ministers in massachusetts were guilty of faulty preaching for distinguishing saints from the damned on the basis of activities such as church attendance and moral behavior rather than an inner state of grace.
in massachusetts where church and state reinforced each other both ministers and magistrates were intent on suppressing any views that challenged their own leadership.
their critics denounced cotton and hutchinson for antinomianism a term for putting ones own judgment or faith above both human law and the teachings of the church.
in 1637 she was placed on trial before a civil court for sedition expressing opinions dangerous to authority.
her position as a public woman made her defiance seem even more outrageous.
her meetings said governor winthrop were neither comely in the sight of god nor fitting to your sex a combative and articulate woman hutchinson ably debated interpretation of the bible with her university educated accusers.
she more than held her own during her trial.
but when she spoke of divine revelations of god speaking to her directly rather than through ministers or the bible she violated puritan doctrine and sealed her own fate.
such a claim the colonys leaders felt posed a threat to the very existence of organized churches and indeed to all authority.
hutchinson and a number of her followers were banished.
her family made its way to rhode island and then to westchester north of what is now new york city where hutchinson and most of her relatives perished during an indian war.
anne hutchinson lived in new england for only eight years but she left her mark on the regions religious culture.
as in the case of roger williams her career showed how the puritan belief in each individuals ability to interpret the bible could easily lead to criticism of the religious and political establishment.
it would take many years before religious toleration which violated the puritans understanding of moral liberty and social harmony came to massachusetts.
what were the main sources of discord in early new england.
puritans and indians along with disruptive religious controversies new england like other colonies had to deal with the difficult problem of relations with indians.
the native population of new england numbered perhaps 100 000 when the puritans arrived.
but because of recent epidemics the migrants encountered fewer indians near the coast than in other parts of eastern north america.
in areas of european settlement colonists quickly outnumbered the native population.
some settlers notably roger williams sought to treat the indians with justice.
williams learned complex indian languages and he insisted that the king had no right to grant land already belonging to someone else.
no town said williams should be established before its site had been purchased.
while john winthrop believed uncultivated land could legitimately be taken by the colonists he recognized the benefits of buying land rather than simply seizing it.
but he insisted that such purchases usually completed after towns had already been settled must carry with them indian agreement to submit to english authority and pay tribute to the colonists.
to new englands leaders the indians represented both savagery and temptation.
in puritan eyes they resembled catholics with their false gods and deceptive rituals.
they enjoyed freedom but of the wrong kind what winthrop condemned as undisciplined natural liberty rather than the moral liberty of the civilized christian.
always concerned that sinful persons might prefer a life of ease to hard work puritans feared that indian society might prove attractive to colonists who lacked the proper moral fiber.
in 1642 the connecticut general court set a penalty of three years at hard labor for any colonist who abandoned godly society to live with the indians.
to counteract the attraction of indian life the leaders of new england also encouraged the publication of captivity narratives by those captured by indians.
the most popular was the sovereignty and goodness of god by mary rowlandson who had emigrated with her parents as a child in 1639 and was seized along with a group of other settlers and held for three months until ransomed during an indian war in the 1670s.
rowlandson acknowledged that she had been well treated and suffered not the least abuse or unchastity but her books overriding theme was her determination to return to christian society.
puritans announced that they intended to bring christian faith to the indians but they did nothing in the first two decades of settlement to accomplish this.
they generally saw indians as an obstacle to be pushed aside rather than as potential converts.
the pequot war indians in new england lacked a paramount chief like powhatan in virginia.
coastal indian tribes their numbers severely reduced by disease initially sought to forge alliances with the newcomers to enhance their own position against inland rivals.
but as the white population expanded and new towns proliferated conflict with the regions indians became unavoidable.
the turning point came in 1637 when a fur trader was killed by pequots a powerful tribe who controlled southern new englands fur trade and exacted tribute from other indians.
a force of connecticut and massachusetts soldiers augmented by narragansett allies surrounded the main pequot the title page of a translation of the bible into the massachusett language published by john eliot in 1663.
2 beginnings of english america 1607 1660 an engraving from john underhills news from america published in london in 1638 shows the destruction of the pequot village on the mystic river in 1637.
the colonial forces firing guns are aided by indian allies with bows and arrows.
new englanders divided fortified village at mystic and set it ablaze killing those who tried to escape.
over 500 men women and children lost their lives in the massacre.
by the end of the war a few months later most of the pequot had been exterminated or sold into caribbean slavery.
the treaty that restored peace decreed that their name be wiped from the historical record.
the destruction of one of the regions most powerful indian groups not only opened the connecticut river valley to rapid white settlement but also persuaded other indians that the newcomers possessed a power that could not be resisted.
the colonists ferocity shocked their indian allies who considered european military practices barbaric.
a few puritans agreed.
it was a fearful sight to see them frying in the fire the pilgrim leader william bradford wrote of the raid on mystic.
but to most puritans including bradford the defeat of a barbarous nation by the sword of the lord offered further proof that they were on a sacred mission and that indians were unworthy of sharing new england with the visible saints of the church.
the new england economy the leaders of the new england colonies prided themselves on the idea that religion was the primary motivation for emigration.
we all came into these parts of america proclaimed an official document of the 1640s with one and the same end and aim namely to advance the kingdom of our lord jesus christ and to enjoy the liberties of the gospel in purity with peace but economic motives were hardly unimportant.
one promotional pamphlet of the 1620s spoke of new england as a place where religion and profit jump together most puritans came to america from east anglia an internationally renowned cloth producing region.
one of the most economically advanced areas of england east anglia in the 1620s and 1630s was suffering from a series of poor harvests and the dislocations caused by a decline in the cloth trade.
a majority of the emigrants from this area were weavers tailors or farmers.
but while they were leaving a depressed region they were relatively well off.
most came from the middle ranks of society and paid for their familys passage rather than indenturing themselves to labor.
they sought in new england not only religious liberty but also economic advancement if not riches then at least a competency the economic independence that came with secure landownership or craft status.
when one preacher proclaimed that the main end of settlement was to honor god a man in the congregation cried out sir you are mistaken.
our main end was to catch fish but to puritans no contradiction existed between piety and profit so long as one did not forget the needs of the larger community.
success in ones calling might be taken as a sign of divine grace.
lacking a marketable staple like sugar or tobacco new englanders turned to fishing and timber for exports.
but the economy centered on family farms producing food for their own use and a small marketable surplus.
although what were the main sources of discord in early new england.
the body of liberties of 1641 as noted above made provision for slavery in the bible commonwealth there were very few slaves in seventeenth century new england.
nor were indentured servants as central to the economy as in the chesapeake.
most households relied on the labor of their own members including women in the home and children in the fields.
sons remained unmarried into their mid twenties when they could expect to receive land from their fathers from local authorities or by moving to a new town.
indeed while religious divisions spawned new settlements the desire for land among younger families and newcomers was the major motive for new englands expansion.
in sudbury massachusetts for example one resident proposed in 1651 that every adult man be awarded an equal parcel of land.
when a town meeting rejected the idea a group of young men received a grant from the general court to establish their own town farther west.
the merchant elite per capita wealth in new england lagged far behind that of the chesapeake but it was much more equally distributed.
a majority of new england families achieved the goal of owning their own land the foundation for a comfortable independence.
nonetheless as in the chesapeake economic development produced a measure of social inequality.
on completing their terms indentured servants rarely achieved full church membership or received grants of land.
most became disenfranchised wage earners.
new england gradually assumed a growing role within the british empire based on trade.
as early as the 1640s new england merchants shipped and marketed the staples of other colonies to markets in europe and africa.
they engaged in a particularly profitable trade with the west indies whose growing slave plantations they supplied with fish timber and agricultural produce gathered at home.
especially in boston a powerful class of merchants arose who challenged some key puritan policies including the subordination of economic activity to the common good.
as early as the 1630s when the general court established limits on prices and wages measures common in england and gave a small group of merchants a monopoly on imports from europe others protested.
indeed merchants were among the most prominent backers of anne hutchinsons challenge to colonial authority.
some left boston to establish a new town at portsmouth in the region eventually chartered as the royal colony of new hampshire.
others remained to fight with increasing success for the right to conduct business as they pleased.
by the 1640s massachusetts had repealed many of its early economic regulations.
although the puritans never abandoned the idea that economic activity should serve the general welfare boston merchants soon came to exercise a decisive influence in public affairs.
the government of massachusetts bay colony actively promoted economic development by building roads and bridges offering bounties to economic enterprises and abandoning laws limiting prices.
eventually the puritan experiment would evolve into a merchant dominated colonial government.

half way religion politics and freedom covenant in the mid seventeenth century some puritan leaders began to worry about their societys growing commercialization and declining piety or declension by 1650 less than half the population of boston had been admitted to full church membership.
massachusetts churches were forced to deal with a growing problem the religious status of the third generation.
children of the elect could be baptized but many never became full church members because they were unable to demonstrate the necessary religious commitment or testify to a conversion experience.
what was the status of their children.
new englanders faced a difficult choice.
they could uphold rigorous standards of church admission which would limit the size and social influence of the congregational church.
or they could make admission easier which would keep the church connected to a larger part of the population but would raise fears about a loss of religious purity.
the half way covenant of 1662 tried to address this problem by allowing for the baptism and a kind of subordinate or half way membership for grandchildren of those who emigrated during the great migration.
in a significant compromise of early puritan beliefs ancestry not religious conversion became the pathway to inclusion among the elect.
but church membership continued to stagnate.
by the 1660s and 1670s ministers were regularly castigating the people for selfishness manifestations of pride violations of the sabbath and a great backsliding from the colonys original purposes.
these warnings called jeremiads after the ancient hebrew prophet jeremiah interpreted crop failures and disease as signs of divine disapproval and warned of further punishment to come if new englanders did not mend their ways.
yet hard work and commercial success in ones chosen calling had always been central puritan values.
in this sense the commercialization of new england was as much a fulfillment of the puritan mission in america as a betrayal.
religion politics and freedom the rights of englishmen even as english emigrants began the settlement of colonies in north america england itself became enmeshed in political and religious conflict in which ideas of liberty played a central role.
the struggle over english liberty in the first half of the seventeenth century expanded the definition of freedom at home and spilled over into early english north america.
by 1600 the traditional definition of liberties as a set of privileges confined to one or another social group still persisted but alongside it had arisen the idea that certain rights of englishmen applied to all within the kingdom.
this tradition rested on the magna carta or great charter of 1215.
an agreement between king john and a group of barons local lords whose private armies frequently fought against each other and the crown the magna carta attempted to put an end to a chronic state of civil unrest.
it listed a series of liberties granted by the king to all the free men of our realm this was a restricted group at the time since a h o w d i d t h e e n g l i s h c i v i l wa r a f f e c t t h e c o l o n i e s i n a m e r i c a.
large part of the english population still lived as serfs peasants working land owned by feudal lords and legally bound to provide labor and other services.
the liberties mentioned in the magna carta included protection against arbitrary imprisonment and the seizure of ones property without due process of law.
the principal beneficiaries of the magna carta were the barons who obtained the right to oversee the kings conduct and even revolt if he violated their privileges.
but over time the document came to be seen as embodying the idea of english freedom that the king was subject to the rule of law and that all persons should enjoy security of person and property.
these rights were embodied in the common law whose provisions such as habeas corpus a protection against being imprisoned without a legal charge the right to face ones accuser and trial by jury came to apply to all free subjects of the english crown.
and as serfdom slowly disappeared the number of englishmen considered freeborn and therefore entitled to these rights expanded enormously.
the english civil war at the beginning of the seventeenth century when english emigrants began arriving in the new world freedom still played only a minor role in englands political debates.
but the political upheavals of that century elevated the notion of english freedom to a central place.
the struggle for political supremacy between parliament and the stuart monarchs james i and charles i culminated in the english civil war of the 1640s.
this longrunning battle arose from religious disputes about how fully the church of england should distance its doctrines and forms of worship from catholicism.
conflict also developed over the respective powers of the king and parliament a debate that produced numerous invocations of the idea of the freeborn englishman and led to a great expansion of the concept of english freedom.
the leaders of the house of commons the elective body that along with the hereditary aristocrats of the house of lords makes up the english parliament accused the stuart kings of endangering liberty by imposing taxes without parliamentary consent imprisoning political foes and leading the nation back toward catholicism.
civil war broke out in 1642 resulting in a victory for the forces of parliament.
in 1649 charles i was beheaded the monarchy abolished and england declared a commonwealth and free state a nation governed by the will of the people.
oliver cromwell the head of the victorious parliamentary army ruled for almost a decade after the execution of the king.
in 1660 the monarchy was restored and charles ii assumed the throne.
but by then the breakdown of authority the court of common pleas.

had stimulated intense discussions of liberty authority and what it meant to be a freeborn englishman englands a 1629 portrait by john aubrey depicts john milton the philosopher of liberty when he attended cambridge university.
religion politics and freedom debate over freedom the idea of freedom suddenly took on new and expanded meanings between 1640 and 1660.
the writer john milton who in 1649 called london the mansion house of liberty called for freedom of speech and of the press.
new religious sects sprang up demanding the end of public financing and special privileges for the anglican church and religious toleration for all protestants.
the levellers historys first democratic political movement proposed a written constitution the agreement of the people which began by proclaiming at how high a rate we value our just freedom at a time when democracy was still widely seen as the equivalent of anarchy and disorder the document proposed to abolish the monarchy and house of lords and to greatly expand the right to vote.
the poorest he that lives in england hath a life to live as the greatest he declared the leveller thomas rainsborough and therefore any man that is born in england.
ought to have his voice in election rainsborough even condemned african slavery.
the levellers offered a glimpse of the modern definition of freedom as a universal entitlement in a society based on equal rights not a function of social class.
another new group the diggers went even further hoping to give freedom an economic underpinning through the common ownership of land.
previous discussion of freedom declared gerard winstanley the diggers leader had been misguided you are like men in a mist seeking for freedom and know not what it is true freedom applied equally to the poor as well as the rich all were entitled to a comfortable livelihood in this their own land even before the restoration of the monarchy the levellers diggers and other radical movements spawned by the english civil war had been crushed or driven underground.
but some of the ideas of liberty that flourished during the 1640s and 1650s would be carried to america by english emigrants.

english liberty these struggles elevated the notion of english liberty to a central place in anglo american political culture.
it became a major building block in the assertive sense of nationhood then being consolidated in england.
the medieval idea of liberties as a collection of limited entitlements enjoyed by specific groups did not suddenly disappear.
but it was increasingly overshadowed by a more general definition of freedom grounded in the common rights of all individuals within the english realm.
by self definition england was a community of free individuals and its past a history of liberty all englishmen were governed by a king but he rules over free men according to the law unlike the autocratic monarchs of france spain russia and other countries.
by 1680 in his book english liberties or the free born subjects inheritance the writer henry care described the english system of government as a qualified monarchy which he considered the best political structure in the world because even though the nobility enjoyed privileges not available to others all citizens were guarded in their persons and properties by the fence of law which renders them freemen not slaves the belief in freedom as the common heritage of all englishmen and the conception of the british empire as the worlds guardian of liberty helped to legitimize english colonization in the western hemisphere and to cast its imperial wars against catholic france and spain as struggles between freedom and tyranny.
the civil war and english america these struggles accompanied by vigorous discussions of the rights of freeborn englishmen inevitably reverberated in englands colonies dividing them from one another and internally.
most new englanders sided with parliament in the civil war of the 1640s.
some returned to england to join the parliamentary army or take up pulpits to help create a godly commonwealth at home.
but puritan leaders were increasingly uncomfortable as the idea of religious toleration for protestants gained favor in england.
it was the revolutionary parliament that in 1644 granted roger williams his charter for the rhode island colony he had founded after being banished from massachusetts.
meanwhile a number of followers of anne hutchinson became quakers one of the sects that sprang up in england during the civil war.
quakers held that the spirit of god dwelled within every individual not just the elect and that this inner light rather than the bible or teachings of the clergy offered the surest guidance in spiritual matters.
when quakers appeared in massachusetts colonial officials had them whipped fined and banished.
in 1659 and 1660 four quakers who returned from exile were hanged including mary dyer a former disciple of hutchinson.
the treatment of quakers gave massachusetts a reputation in england as a hotbed of religious persecution.
when charles ii after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 reaffirmed the massachusetts charter he ordered the colony to recognize the liberty of conscience of all protestants.
but while hangings ceased efforts to suppress the quakers continued as did attacks on baptists whose disdain for a learned ministry also seemed to threaten puritan beliefs.

crisis in religion politics and freedom maryland unlike the new england colonies virginia sided with charles i.
its leaders even proclaimed charles ii king after his fathers execution in 1649 although oliver cromwells government in london soon brought the rebellious colony under control.
in maryland the combination of the religious and political battles of the civil war homegrown conflict between catholic and protestant settlers and anti proprietary feeling produced a violent civil war within the colony later recalled as the plundering time indeed maryland in the 1640s verged on total anarchy with a pro parliament force assaulting those loyal to charles i.
the emerging protestant planter class longed to seize power from the catholic elite created by cecelius calvert.
the assemblys protestant majority rejected laws proposed by the proprietor and claimed the same power to legislate and levy taxes enjoyed by the house of commons in england.
to stabilize the colony and attract more settlers calvert appointed a protestant governor and offered refuge to protestant dissenters being persecuted in virginia where anglicanism was the established religion and laws restricted the religious and political rights of others.
in 1649 maryland adopted an act concerning religion which institutionalized the principle of toleration that had prevailed from the colonys beginning.
all christians were guaranteed the free exercise of religion.
the act did not establish religious liberty in a modern sense since it punished those who denied the divinity of jesus christ or the doctrine of the holy trinity.
indeed a jewish physician was soon arrested under its provisions.
nonetheless the law was a milestone in the history of religious freedom in colonial america.
turmoil however continued.
during the 1650s the commonwealth government in london placed maryland under the control of a protestant council which repealed the toleration act and forbade catholics from openly practicing their religion.
in 1657 however calverts authority was restored and with it marylands experiment in religious freedom.
cromwell and the empire oliver cromwell who ruled england from 1649 until his death in 1658 undertook an aggressive policy of colonial expansion the promotion of protestantism and commercial empowerment in the british isles and the western hemisphere.
his army forcibly extended english control over ireland massacring civilians banning the public practice of catholicism and seizing land owned by catholics.
in the caribbean england seized jamaica a valuable sugar island from spain.
in 1651 as will be related in chapter 3 parliament passed the first navigation act which sought to challenge the dutch hold on international commerce by confining colonial trade to english ships and ports.
thus by the middle of the seventeenth century several english colonies existed along the atlantic coast of north america.
established as part of an ad hoc process rather than arising under any coherent national plan they differed enormously in economic political and social structure.
the seeds had been planted in the chesapeake for the development of plantation societies based on unfree labor and in new england for settlements centered on small towns and family farms.
throughout the colonies many res suggested reading idents enjoyed freedoms they had not possessed at home especially access to land and the right to worship as they desired.
others found themselves confined to unfree labor for many years or an entire lifetime.
the next century would be a time of crisis and consolidation as the population expanded social conflicts intensified and britain moved to exert greater control over its flourishing north american colonies.

l o n the last quarter of the seventeenth century a series of crises rocked the european colonies of north america.
social and political tensions boiled over in sometimes ruthless conflicts between rich and poor free and slave settler and indian and members of different religious groups.
at the same time struggles within and between european empires echoed in the colonies.
aggrieved groups seized upon the language of freedom to advance their goals.
although each conflict had its own local causes taken together they added up to a general crisis of colonial society in the area that would become the united states.
the bloodiest and most bitter conflict occurred in southern new england where in 1675 an indian alliance launched attacks on farms and settlements that were encroaching on indian lands.
it was the most dramatic and violent warfare in the region in the entire seventeenth century.
new englanders described the wampanoag leader metacom known to the colonists as king philip as the uprisings mastermind although in fact most tribes fought under their own leaders.
by this time the white population considerably outnumbered the indians.
but the fate of the new england colonies hung in the balance for several months.
by 1676 indian forces had attacked nearly half of new englands ninety towns.
twelve in massachusetts were destroyed.
as refugees fled eastward the line of settlement was pushed back almost to the atlantic coast.
some how did the english empire in america expand in the mid seventeenth century.
1 000 settlers out of a population of 52 000 and 3 000 of new englands 20 000 indians perished in the fighting.
in mid 1676 the tide of battle turned and a ferocious counterattack broke the indians power once and for all.
although the uprising united numerous tribes others remained loyal to the colonists.
the role of the iroquois in providing essential military aid to the colonists helped to solidify their developing alliance with the government of new york.
together colonial and indian forces inflicted devastating punishment on the rebels.
metacom was captured and executed indian villages destroyed and captives including men women and children killed or sold into slavery in the west indies.
most of the survivors fled to canada or new york.
even the praying indians about 2 000 indians who had converted to christianity and lived in autonomous communities under puritan supervision suffered.
removed from their towns to deer island in boston harbor supposedly for their own protection many perished from disease and lack of food.
both sides committed atrocities in this merciless conflict but in its aftermath the image of indians as bloodthirsty savages became firmly entrenched in the new england mind.
in the long run king philips war produced a broadening of freedom for white new englanders by expanding their access to land.
but this freedom rested on the final dispossession of the regions indians.
g l o b a l c o m p e t i t i o n a n d t h e e x pa n s i o n of englands empire the mercantilist system as the new world became a battleground in european nations endless contests for wealth and power england moved to seize control of atlantic trade solidify its hold on north americas eastern coast and exert greater control over its empire.
by the middle of the seventeenth century it was apparent that the colonies could be an important source of wealth for the mother country.
according to the prevailing theory known as mercantilism the government should regulate economic activity so as to promote national power.
it should encourage manufacturing and commerce by special bounties monopolies and other measures.
above all trade should be controlled so that more gold and silver flowed into the country than left it.
that is exports of goods which generated revenue from abroad should exceed imports which required paying foreigners for their products.
in the mercantilist outlook the role of colonies was to serve the interests of the mother country by producing marketable raw materials and importing manufactured goods from home.
foreign trade declared an influential work written in 1664 by a london merchant formed the basis of englands treasure commerce not territorial plunder was the foundation of empire.
