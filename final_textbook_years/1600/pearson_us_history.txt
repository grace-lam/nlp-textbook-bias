the 2 1 spanish colonization and new spain european colonization of north america 47 2 1 spanish colonization and new spain settlers in st augustine florida in new spain came to town to do business worship and socialize.
mission san francisco de la espada in san antonio texas was one of spains many religious settlements in the americas dedicated to the conversion of the indians to christianity.
pueblos or towns were centers of farming and trade.
in the middle of the town was a plaza or public square.
here townspeople and farmers came to do business or worship at the church.
shops and homes lined the four sides of the plaza.
the spanish took control of indian pueblos and built new towns as well.
in 1598 juan de onate oh nyah tay founded the colony of new mexico among the adobe villages of the pueblo indians.
he used brutal force to conquer the native americans of the region.
don pedro de peralta later founded santa fe as the spanish capital of new mexico.
presidios were forts where soldiers lived.
inside the high thick walls were shops stables and storehouses for food.
soldiers protected the farmers who settled nearby.
the first presidio in the borderlands was built in 1565 at st augustine florida.
st augustine was the first permanent european settlement in what would become the united states.
its founding marked the beginning of the era of colonization in the future territory of the united states which would continue until the united states declared independence in 1776.
the legacy of missions like other europeans in the americas the spanish believed they had a duty to convert indians to christianity.
they set up missions settlements run by catholic priests and friars whose goal was to convert indians to christianity.
they often forced indians to live and work on the missions.
in new mexico the spanish tried to destroy any trace of traditional pueblo indians religious practices and subjected them to severe punishments.
this resulted in the pueblo revolt of 1680.
the pueblo indians rose up against spanish rule.
they killed about 400 spaniards and drove the others out of the region.
the spanish recaptured the region in the mid 1690s.
missions gradually spread across the spanish borderlands.
the first mission in texas was founded in 1659 at el paso.
in 1691 father eusebio francisco kino kee noh crossed into present day arizona.
he eventually set up 24 missions in the area.
the missions were a direct result of early spanish colonization efforts.
over time they had a significant impact in the americas.
by the late 1700s a string of missions dotted the california coast from san diego to san francisco and spanish language and culture gradually spread with them.
ed recall what reasons did spanish colonists have for coming to new spain.
the social order in new spain the laws of the indies also set up a strict social system.
people in spanish colonies were divided into four social classes peninsulares puh nin suh lah rayz creoles kree ohlz mestizos mes tee sohz and indians.
different social classes at the top of the social scale were the peninsulares.
born in spain peninsulares held the highest jobs in government and the church.
they also owned large tracts of land as well as rich gold and silver mines.
below the peninsulares were the creoles people born in the americas to parents of spanish origin.
many creoles were wealthy and well educated.
they owned farms and ranches taught at universities and practiced law.
however they could not hold the jobs that were reserved for peninsulares.
below the creoles were people of mixed spanish and indian background known as mestizos.
mestizos worked on farms and ranches owned by peninsulares and creoles.
in the cities they worked as carpenters shoemakers tailors and bakers.
over the course of spanish colonization mestizos came to be the largest class of people.
the lowest class in the colonies was the indians.
in the early years of spanish colonization indians were the largest class.
the spanish treated them as a conquered people.
under new spains strict social system indians were kept in poverty for hundreds of years.
a blend of spanish and indian cultures the effects of colonization can be seen in the new way of life in new spain that blended spanish and indian ways.
spanish settlers brought their own culture to the colonies.
they introduced their language laws religion and learning.
in 1551 the spanish founded the university of mexico.
native americans also influenced the culture of new spain.
colonists adopted indian foods such as corn tomatoes potatoes and squash.
indian workers used materials they knew well such as adobe bricks to build fine libraries theaters and churches.
sometimes indian artists decorated church walls with paintings of local traditions.
harsh treatment of native americans spanish colonists needed workers for their ranches farms and mines.
to help them the spanish government gave settlers encomiendas en koh mee en dahz land grants that included the right to demand labor or taxes from native americans.
mines in mexico peru and other parts of the americas made spain rich.
treasure ships laden with new spains society was divided into social classes based on birthplace and racial characteristics.
interactive chart thousands of tons of gold and silver sailed regularly across the atlantic.
the spanish forced native americans to work in the gold and silver mines.
in flickering light indians hacked out rich ores in narrow dark tunnels.
many died when tunnels caved in.
these harsh conditions led one priest bartolome de las casas day lahs kah sahs to seek reform.
traveling through new spain las casas witnessed firsthand the deaths of indians due to hunger disease and mistreatment.
what he saw horrified him the indians were totally deprived of their freedom.
even beasts enjoy more freedom when they are allowed to graze in the field.
bartolome de las casas tears of the indians many spanish in new spain did not share las casas view or his values.
so he journeyed to europe and asked the king of spain to protect the indians civil rights.
in the 1540s the royal government passed laws prohibiting the enslavement of native americans.
the laws also allowed indians to own cattle and grow crops.
however few officials in new spain enforced the european colonization of north america 2 1 spanish colonization and new spain european colonization of north america 49 2 1 spanish colonization and new spain new laws or took the time to think about indians basic human needs.
b identify supporting details what were some ways in which peninsulares were powerful.
the transatlantic slave trade the death toll among native americans continued to rise.
faced with a severe shortage of workers spanish colonists looked across the atlantic ocean for a new source of labor.
reasons for the slave trade still seeking to protect native americans bartolome de las casas made a suggestion that had a lasting tragic impact.
his idea was that africans be brought as slaves to replace forced indian laborers.
las casas argued that africans were less likely to die from european diseases.
he also claimed that africans would suffer less because they were used to doing hard farm work in their homelands.
las casass arguments encouraged the atlantic slave trade or the trade of enslaved africans across the atlantic to the americas.
in many parts of africa slavery had existed for centuries.
often war prisoners were enslaved.
eventually these enslaved people or their children might gain freedom.
after the americas were colonized though some africans began to capture and enslave people and sell them to european traders.
the traders then shipped the enslaved men women and children to the americas.
most africans who settled in the americas did so against their will.
by the time he died las casas had come to regret his suggestion.
he saw that enslaved africans suffered as much as the indians.
by that time however it was too late to undo the damage.
slavery had become a key part of the colonial economy.
slave trade expansion the european demand for african labor grew rapidly mainly in spains colonies in the west indies including what are now cuba the dominican republic and puerto rico and in other parts of the americas.
enslaved africans were especially valued on sugar plantations in the west indies and in the portuguese colony of brazil.
a plantation is a large estate farmed by many workers.
sugar could not be grown on small estates because it reguired too much land and labor.
enslaved africans often worked all through the night cutting sugar which was then sold in europe for a large profit.
some scholars estimate that europeans transported more than 10 million enslaved africans across the many africans were captured and shipped to europe and the americas to work as slaves.

reasons for the exploration of north america like columbus europeans continued during the 1500s to look for new ways to reach the riches of asia.
magellans route around south america seemed long and difficult.
europeans wanted to discover a shorter northwest passage or waterway through or around north america.
giovanni caboto an italian sea captain who the english called john cabot set out to find a northwest passage for the english.
he was confident he had found such a passage but he was mistaken.
the newfound land that he thought he had found off the asian coast in fact lay off the coast of north america.
today newfoundland is part of the easternmost province of canada.
french exploration the french sent another italian captain giovanni da verrazano vehr rah tsah noh in search of a northwest passage.
verrazano journeyed along the north american coast from the present day carolinas to canada.

q check understanding what factors contributed to rivalries between english and spanish explorers.
new france is colonized samuel de champlain sham playn founded port royal the first permanent french settlement in north america in 1605.
three years later he led another group of settlers along the route cartier had pioneered.
on a rocky cliff high above the st lawrence river champlain built a trading post known as quebec kwih bek.
the opportunity to create wealth through trade was one of the main reasons for french colonization in america.
the french also wanted to surpass their rivals the english.
many french settlers were looking for adventure and hoped to find their fortune in the new world.
economic activity in new france unlike spains american empire new france had little gold or silver.
native americans board a european trading ship to display their selection of furs.
they will exchange the furs for the goods displayed at the feet of the seated european trader.
instead the french profited from fishing trapping and trading.
french colonists who lived and worked in native f american lands beyond the french settlements became known as coureurs de bois koo ruhr duh bwah or runners of the woods the french brought knives kettles cloth and other items for trade with native americans.
in return the indians gave them beaver skins and other furs that sold for high prices in j europe.
coureurs de bois established friendly relations with native american groups.
unlike the spanish the french did not attempt to conquer the indians.
also because coureurs de bois did not establish farms they i did not interfere with indian lands.
indians taught the i french trapping and survival skills such as how to make snowshoes and canoes.
many coureurs married indian women.
missionary work continues catholic missionaries often traveled with fur traders.
a missionary is a person who goes to another land to win converts for a religion.
french missionaries tried to convert native americans to christianity.
they also drew maps and wrote about the lands they explored.
life was difficult especially in winter.

paul le jeune quoted in d parkman colonization along the mississippi river french trappers followed the st lawrence deep into the heart of north america.
led by indian guides they reached the great lakes.
here indians spoke of a mighty river which they called mississippi or father of the waters a french missionary father jacques marquette mar ket and a fur trader louis joliet joh lee et set out to reach the mississippi in 1673.
led by indian guides they followed the river for more than 700 miles before turning back.
nine years later robert de la salle completed the journey to the gulf of mexico.
la salle named the region louisiana in honor of the french king louis xiv.
to keep spain and england out of louisiana the french built forts in the north along the great lakes.
among them was fort detroit built by antoine cadillac near lake erie.
the french also built new orleans a fort near the mouth of the river.
new orleans grew into a busy trading center.
french control of the network of waterways at the heart of north america gave the french a strategic advantage over the spanish and the english.
french colonists imported thousands of africans to work as slaves on plantations around new orleans.
some enslaved africans however joined with the natchez indians in a revolt against the french.
the french put down the natchez revolt in 1729.
some enslaved africans who fought on the side of the french received their freedom.
in louisiana free and enslaved africans together made up the majority of settlers.
government in new france new france was governed much like new spain.
the french king controlled the government directly and people had little freedom.
a council appointed by the king made all decisions.
louis xiv worried that too few french were moving to new france.
in the 1660s therefore he sent about a thousand people to the colony including many young women.
despite the kings efforts to increase the population new france grew slowly.
winters were harsh and the short growing season made farming difficult.
only about 10 000 settlers lived in the colony by 1680.
of those one third lived on farms along the st lawrence.
others chose to become coureurs de bois living largely free of government control.
fell identify main ideas why was the mississippi river important to the french.
the dutch establish new netherland like the french the dutch hoped to profit from their discoveries in the americas by colonizing.
in 1626 peter minuit min yoo wit led a group of dutch settlers to the mouth of the hudson river.
other dutch colonists had already settled on manhattan island and farther up the hudson river.
minuit bought manhattan island from local indians.
minuit called his settlement new amsterdam.
the entire colony was known as new netherland now known as new york.
new netherland was privately funded by the dutch west india company.
many colonists immigrated to new netherland hoping to profit from the regions active fur trade.
from a tiny group of 30 houses new amsterdam grew into a busy port.
the dutch welcomed people of many nations ethnic groups and religions to their the coureurs de bois fishermen and trappers who settled new france were mostly male.
they gladly welcomed female settlers sent to the new world by the french king.

father isaac jogues quoted in narratives of new netherland 1609 1664 jameson the dutch also built trading posts along the hudson river.
the most important one was fort orange today known as albany.
dutch merchants became known for their good business sense.
the dutch enlarged new netherland in 1655 by taking over the colony of new sweden.
the swedes had established new sweden along the delaware river some 15 years earlier.
trade rivalries in the region dutch traders sent furs to the netherlands.
the packing list for the first native americans trade goods with dutch settlers on manhattan island.

interaction with native americans and the environment dutch and french settlement on the.
east coast of north america brought major changes to native americans and the environment.
as in new spain european diseases killed thousands of indians and rivalry over the fur trade increased between different european countries native american allies.
the scramble for furs also led to overtrapping.

the arrival of europeans affected native americans in other ways.
missionaries tried to convert indians to christianity.
indians eagerly adopted european trade goods such as copper kettles and knives.
they also bought muskets and gunpowder for hunting and warfare.
alcohol sold by european traders had a harsh effect on native american life.
europeans all waged warfare to seize indian lands.
as indians were forced off their lands they moved westward onto lands of other indians which sometimes led to violence between native american groups.
the conflict between native americans and europeans would continue for many years.
b identify what was one reason why the new netherland colony was founded.
roanoke and jamestown england watched with envy as other european countries gained riches from their colonies in the americas.
several ambitious english gentlemen proposed that england settle the americas as well.
with queen elizabeths permission sir walter raleigh raised money to outfit a colony in north america.
in 1585 about 100 men set sail across the atlantic.
the colonists landed on roanoke roh uh nohk an island off the coast of present day north carolina.
within a year however the colonists had run short of food and were quarreling with neighboring indians.
when an english ship stopped in the harbor the weary settlers sailed home.
the lost colony of roanoke in 1587 raleigh sent john white one of the original colonists back to roanoke with a new group of settlers that included women and children.
when supplies ran low white returned to england leaving behind 117 colonists.
he planned to return in a few months.
when he got back to england however he found the country was then preparing for war with spain.
it was three years before he was able to sail back to roanoke.
when white arrived he found the settlement strangely quiet.
houses stood empty.
vines twined through the windows and pumpkins sprouted from the earthen floors.
on a tree someone had carved the word croatoan the name of a nearby island.
no other trace of the colonists remained.
white was eager to investigate but a storm was blowing up and his crew refused to make the trip.
to this day the fate of the lost colony remains a mystery.
the founding of jamestown after the failure of roanoke nearly 20 years passed before england again tried to establish a colony in north america.
in 1606 the virginia company of london a private company received a charter from king james i.
a charter is a legal document giving certain rights to a person or company.
the royal charter gave the virginia company the right to settle lands along the east coast of north america.
the charter also guaranteed that colonists of this land called virginia would have the same rights as english citizens.
in the spring of 1607 a group of 105 colonists funded by the virginia company arrived in virginia.
they sailed into chesapeake bay and began building houses along the james river.
they named their tiny outpost jamestown after their king.
jamestown was the first permanent english settlement in what is now the united states.
in the spring of 1607 english colonists began building a settlement at jamestown virginia.
colonists in jamestown hold religious services under a makeshift tent.
the swampy land would prove challenging for the colonists.
european colonization of north america 56 2 2 the first french dutch and english colonies european colonization of north america 57 2 2 the first french dutch and english colonies reasons for colonization the settlers of jamestown hoped to make a profit by finding gold or other riches.
they also hoped to discover a water route to asia.
furthermore they wanted to claim the region for england.
the colonists soon discovered that jamestown was located in a swampy area.
the water was unhealthy and mosquitoes spread malaria.
many settlers suffered or died from disease.
historians have long debated the reason why the settlers chose the location they did.
one of the main reasons was security they located their settlement in a place where spanish ships would be unlikely to find them.
if the spanish did discover jamestown its location would make it more easily defensible against spanish ships.
governing the colony also proved difficult.
the virginia company had chosen a council of 13 men to rule the settlement.
members of the council quarreled with one another and did little to plan for the colony s future.
by the summer of 1608 the colony was near failure.
the colonists face further difficulties another major problem the jamestown colonists faced was starvation.
their physical environment offered plenty of resources fish to catch plants to gather and animals jamestown colonists constructed buildings such as thisjn the first permanent english settlement in what is united states.
an colonization of north america 58 to hunt.
however many colonists were not used to living in the wilderness and did not know how to take advantage of these resources.
furthermore the colonists did not spend enough time producing food.
captain john smith a young soldier and explorer f observed that the colonists were not planting enough crops.
he complained that people wanted only to dig gold wash gold refine gold load gold.
as they searched in vain for gold the colony ran out of food.
smith helped to save the colony.
he set up stern rules that forced colonists to work if they wished to eat.
he also visited nearby indian villages.
powhatan pow uh tan the most powerful chief in the area agreed to supply corn to the english.
peaceful relations with native americans did not last however.
whenever the indians refused to supply food the colonists used force to seize what they needed.
once smith aimed a gun at powhatan s brother until the indians provided corn to buy his freedom.
such incidents led to frequent and bloody warfare.
peace was restored briefly when the colonist john rolfe married pocahontas daughter of powhatan.
however problems arose soon after john smith returned to england in 1609.
desperate settlers cooked dogs cats snakes and toadstools to survive.
to keep warm they broke up houses to burn as firewood.
the colonists gradually learned to use the sources available in their environment to survive.
tobacco crops help jamestowns economy finally improved after 1612 when colonists began growing tobacco.
europeans had learned about tobacco from native americans.
king james called pipe smoking a vile custom still the new fad caught on quickly.
by 1620 england was importing more than 30 000 pounds of tobacco a year.
at last virginians had found a way to make their colony succeed.
english immigrants to virginia interacted with their environment by cutting down forests and planting the land with tobacco.
their interaction with the environment was different from that of other groups of immigrants to north america such as the dutch and the french whose trading activity led to the near elimination of beaver populations in some areas.

2 2 the first french dutch and english colonies an improved form of government for a time the governors sent by the virginia company ran the colony like a military outpost.
each morning a drumbeat summoned settlers to work at assigned tasks.
harsh laws imposed the death penalty even for small offenses like stealing an ear of corn.
such conditions were unlikely to attract new colonists.
as john smith commented after his return to england no man will go to have less freedom there than here the house of burgesses to attract more settlers the virginia company took steps to establish a more stable government.
in 1619 it sent a new governor with orders to consult settlers on all important matters.
male settlers were allowed to elect burgesses or representatives to the government.
the burgesses met in an assembly called the house of burgesses.
together with the governor and his council they made laws for the colony.
the first session met in the jamestown church in july and august 1619.
in steamy weather the burgesses sat in the church pews while the governor and council took their places in the choir stalls.
the house of burgesses marked the beginning of representative government in the english colonies.
in a representative government voters elect representatives to make laws for them.
political rights and responsibilties the idea that people had political rights was deeply rooted in english history.
in 1215 english nobles had forced king john to sign the magna carta or great charter.
this document said that the king could not raise taxes without first consulting a great council of nobles and church leaders.
over time the rights won by nobles were extended to other people.
the great council grew into a representative assembly called parliament.
parliament was divided into the house of lords made up of nobles and an elected house of commons.
only rich men had the right to vote.
still the english had established the principle that even monarchs had to obey the law.
some virginia settlers can vote at first free virginians had even greater rights than citizens in england.
they did not have to own property in order to vote.
in 1670 however the colony restricted the vote to free white male property owners.
despite these limits representative government remained important.
the idea took root that settlers should have a say in the affairs of the colony.
colonists european colonization of north america 59 2 2 the first french dutch and english colonies the house of burgesses in jamestown virginia was the first elected legislative assembly in the english colonies.
infer how was government in the english colonies different from that in the spanish or french colonies.

the jamestown colony grows during the early years of the jamestown colony only a few women chose to make the journey from england.
nor did enough workers come to raise tobacco and other crops.
women in jamestown the colonys first women arrived in 1608 a mistress forrest and her maid anne burras.
few others followed until 1619 when the virginia company sent about 100 women to help make the men more settled this shipload of women quickly found husbands.
the virginia company profited from the marriages because it charged each man who found a wife 150 pounds of tobacco.
life for women was a daily struggle.
women had to make everything from scratch food clothing even medicines.
many died young from hard work or childbirth.
by 1624 there were still fewer than 300 women in the jamestown colony compared to more than 1 000 men.
africans arrive in virginia enslaved africans were brought to virginia early on.
recently discovered records show that at least 15 black men and 17 black women were already living there by 1619.
that same year a dutch ship arrived with about 20 africans.
the dutch sold the africans to virginians who needed laborers to grow tobacco.
the colonists valued the agricultural skills that the africans brought with them.
from their perspective the arrival of africans meant the arrival of a labor force.
from the enslaved africans perspective this was a journey into a brutal life of forced labor.
about 300 africans lived in virginia by 1644.
some were slaves for life.
others worked as indentured servants or people who were pledged to work for a master for a period until they paid off the cost of their voyage and expected one day to own their own farms.
some africans did become free planters.
anthony johnson owned 250 acres of land and employed five servants to help him work it.
for a time free africans in virginia also had the right to vote.
these newcomers from africa helped colonial settlers origins estimated ethnicity of american colonies 1 in 2 english 1 in 5 african in io scotch irish 1 in 10 german 1 in 25 dutch to transform the environment of virginia by cutting down forests and planting tobacco fields.
bacons rebellion meanwhile english settlers continued to arrive in virginia attracted by the f promise of profits from tobacco.
wealthy planters however controlled the best lands near the coast.
many newcomers were indentured servants.
when they finished their period of service they looked for farmland.
because the best lands along the coast were taken these and other newcomers had to push farther j inland onto indian lands.
j as in new england conflicts over land led to fighting between some white settlers and indians.
after several bloody clashes settlers called on the governor to take action against native americans.
the governor refused.
he was unwilling to act in part because he profited from his own fur trade with indians.
frontier settlers were furious.
finally in 1676 nathaniel bacon an ambitious young planter organized angry men and women on the frontier including both black and white indentured servants.
he raided native american villages regardless of whether the indians there had been friendly to the colonists or not.
then he led his followers to jamestown and burned the capital.

when bacon died suddenly the revolt fell apart.
the governor hanged 23 of bacons followers.
still he could not stop english settlers from moving onto indian lands along the frontier or the edge of the settlement.
wealthy virginians generally supported governor berkeley.
they were alarmed that black and white indentured servants had joined together in a rebellion.
in response virginia set up a system of laws replacing indentured servitude for africans with a condition of lifelong slavery that would be passed on to enslaved africans children.
as slavery expanded free african americans also lost rights.
by the early 1700s free african american property owners could no longer vote.

bradford of plymouth pldwmou unlike the jamestown colonists or the spanish these newcomers sought neither gold nor silver nor great riches.
what they wanted most was to practice their religion freely.
years later the founders of plymouth became known to history as the pilgrims.
access your digital lesson.
62 religion in europe it was not easy for people to practice religion freely in europe during the 1500s.
as you have read after the protestant reformation christians in western europe were divided into protestants and roman catholics.
this division led to fierce religious wars.
in france for example protestants and catholics fought each other for nearly 40 years.
thousands upon thousands of people were killed because of their religious beliefs.
most european rulers believed that they could not maintain order unless everyone followed the rulers religion.
the religion chosen by the ruler was known as the established church.
in england for example the established church was the anglican church or church of england.
in the 1530s parliament passed laws making the english monarch the head of the church of england.
in england and other nations people who did not follow the established religion were often persecuted.
persecution is the mistreatment or punishment of certain people because of their beliefs.
sometimes members of persecuted groups had to worship secretly.
if they were discovered they might be imprisoned or even executed by being burned at the stake.
the pilgrims one religious group in england that faced persecution were the people we now call the pilgrims.
at the time they were known as separatists.
they were called that because although they were protestant they wanted to separate from the church of england.
the english government bitterly opposed the separatists.
william bradford remembered what some separatists had suffered.
were hunted and persecuted on every side.
for some were taken and clapped up in prison others had their houses beset and watched night and day.
and the most were glad to flee and leave their houses.
william bradford of plymouin plantanon in the early 1600s a group of separatists left england for leyden a city in the netherlands.
the dutch allowed the newcomers to worship freely.
still the pilgrims missed their english way of life.
they were also worried that their children were growing up more dutch than english.
identify main ideas why did the pilgrims want to establish their own colony.
the pilgrims crossed the atlantic in search of religious freedom in ships such as this.
a quaker in england stands trial for violating the religious practices of the anglican church.
quakers were also persecuted in new england for their religious beliefs.
european colonization of north america 63 2 3 the new england colonies plymouth colony a group of separatists decided to return to england.
along with some other english people who were not separatists they won a charter to set up a colony in the northern part of virginia.
like the colonists who followed them the pilgrims enterprise was started and funded privately in the hopes that it would earn a profit.
in september 1620 more than 100 men women and children set sail aboard a small ship called the mayflower.
the journey was long and difficult.
at last in november 1620 the mayflower landed on the cold bleak shore of cape cod in present day massachusetts.
the passengers had planned to settle farther south along the hudson river but the difficult sea voyage exhausted them.
the colonists decided to travel no farther.
they called their new settlement plimoth or plymouth because the mayflower had sailed from the port of plymouth england.
a new pledge to govern the colony before going ashore the pilgrims realized that they would not be settling within the boundaries of virginia.
as a result the terms of their charter would not apply to their new colony.
in that case who would govern them.
the question was important because not all colonists on the mayflower were pilgrims.
some of these strangers as in november 1620 english separatists on the mayflower shown here arrived at present day massachusetts to start new lives free of religious oersecution.
pean colonization of north america the pilgrims called them said they were not bound to obey the pilgrims for none had power to command them in response the pilgrims joined together to write a framework for governing their colony on november 11 1620 the 41 adult male passengers both pilgrims j and non pilgrims signed the mayflower compact.
they pledged themselves to unite into a civil body politic or government.
they agreed to make and abide by laws that insured the general good of the colony the mayflower compact established an important tradition.
when the pilgrims found themselves without a government they banded together themselves to make laws.
in time they set up a government in which adult male colonists elected a governor and council.
thus like virginias great charter the mayflower compact strengthened the english tradition of governing through elected representatives.
these representatives were in turn expected to show the religious virtues that the pilgrims valued and to make decisions for the common good.
the colony at plymouth thought that this type of representative government rather than the monarchy that they knew in england would best protect their religious freedom.
religious motivation and religious freedom the i pilgrims were the first of many immigrants who came to north america in order to worship as they pleased.
that did not mean that religious freedom spread quickly through englands colonies.
many settlers who wished to worship as they pleased still believed that only their own religious beliefs should be observed.
most of the english colonies set up their own established churches.
1 still the pilgrims desire to worship freely set an important precedent or example for others to follow in the future.
in time the idea of religious freedom for all would become a cornerstone of american democracy.

elps overcoming hardships in plymouth the pilgrims built their settlement on the site of a native american village that had been abandoned because of disease.
the colonists even found baskets filled with corn that they were able to eat.
64 2 3 the new england colonies i a cold winter in plymouth however the corn was not enough to get the pilgrims through their first winter.
the pilgrims had failed to bring enough food with them and it was too late in the season to plant new crops.
the harsh season was also difficult to survive because the pilgrims had not had enough time to build proper shelters.
during the winter the men worked to build houses onshore while most spent nights aboard the mayflower.
nearly half the settlers had perished of disease or starvation by spring.
among those who died that winter was the colonys first governor.
william bradford was chosen to take his place.
bradfords able leadership helped the colony survive.
reelected many times he would lead plymouth for most of the next 36 years.
despite the great suffering of that winter the pilgrims religious faith remained strong.
they believed that it was gods will for them to remain in plymouth.
what could now sustain them wrote bradford but the spirit of god and his grace native americans offer assistance in the spring the pilgrims began to clear land and plant crops.
they also received help from neighboring native americans.
a pemaquid indian samoset had learned english from earlier explorers sailing along the coast.
he introduced the pilgrims to massasoit mas uh soit chief of the local wampanoag wahm puh noh ahg indians.
the wampanoag who helped the pilgrims most was named squanto.
as a young man squanto had been captured by an english expedition led by john smith.
squanto lived for a time in england where he learned to speak the language.
as a result he could communicate easily with the pilgrims.
squanto brought the pilgrims seeds of native plants corn beans and pumpkins and showed them how to plant them.
he also taught the settlers how to catch eels from nearby rivers.
by treading water he stirred up eels from the mud at the river bottom and then snatched them up with his hands.
the grateful pilgrims called squanto a special instrument sent of god in the fall the pilgrims had a very good harvest.
because they believed that god had given them this harvest they set aside a day for giving thanks.
in later years the pilgrims celebrated after each harvest season with a day of thanksgiving.
americans today celebrate thanksgiving as a national holiday.
identify supporting details how did native americans help the pilgrims.
european colonization of north america if 65 squanto teaches a group of pilgrims how to plant corn using dead fish as fertilizer.
forming massachusetts bay colony the migration to massachusetts bay during the 1630s was led by a religious group known as the puritans.
unlike the pilgrims the puritans did not want to separate entirely from the church of england.
instead they hoped to reform the church by introducing simpler forms of worship.
they wanted to do away with many practices inherited from the roman catholic church such as organ music finely decorated houses of worship and special clothing for priests.
reasons for immigration to massachusetts the puritans were a powerful group in england.
although some were small farmers many were well educated and successful merchants or landowners.
charles i who became king in 1625 disapproved of the puritans and their ideas.
he canceled puritan business charters and even had a few puritans jailed.
by 1629 some puritan leaders were convinced that england had fallen on evil and declining times they persuaded royal officials to grant them a charter to form the massachusetts bay company.
the companys bold plan was to build a new society based on biblical laws and teachings.
john winthrop a lawyer and a devout 2 3 the new england colonies puritan believed that the new colony would set an example to the world.
some settlers joined the massachusetts colonists for economic rather than religious reasons.
in wealthy english families the oldest son usually inherited his father s estate.
with little hope of owning land younger sons sought opportunity elsewhere.
they were attracted to massachusetts bay because it offered cheap land or a chance to start a business.
a greater say in government in 1629 the puritans sent a small advance party to north america.
john winthrop and a party of more than 1 000 arrived the following year.
winthrop was chosen as the first governor of the massachusetts bay colony.
once ashore winthrop set an example for others.
although he was governor he worked hard to build a home clear land and plant crops.
there was discontent among some colonists though.
under the charter only stockholders who had invested money in the massachusetts bay company had the right to vote.
most settlers however were not stockholders.
they resented taxes and laws passed by a government in which they had no say.
winthrop and other stockholders saw that the colony would run more smoothly if a greater number of settlers could take part.

as a result they granted the right to vote for governor to all men who were church members.
later male church members also elected representatives to an assembly called the general court.
under the leadership of winthrop and other puritans the massachusetts bay colony prospered.
between 1629 and 1640 some 15 000 men women and children journeyed from england to massachusetts.
this movement of people is known as the great migration.
many of the newcomers settled in boston which grew into the colonys largest town.
j h check understanding why was the right to vote expanded in the massachusetts bay colony.
new colonies form over i religious differences the puritan leaders did not like anyone to question their religious beliefs or the way the colony was governed.
usually discontented colonists were forced to leave.
some colonists who left massachusetts founded other colonies in new england.
a new colony with limited government in may 1636 a puritan minister named thomas hooker led about 100 settlers out of massachusetts bay.
pushing west they drove their cattle goats and pigs along indian trails that cut through the forests.
when they reached the connecticut river they built a town which they called hartford.
hooker left massachusetts bay because he believed that the governor and other officials had too much power.
he wanted to set up a colony in connecticut with strict limits on government.
the settlers wrote a plan of government called the fundamental orders of connecticut in 1639 it created a government much like that of massachusetts which relied on the virtue of the people to obey the law and seek the common good.
there were however two important differences.
first the fundamental orders gave the vote to all men who were property owners including those who were not church members.
second the fundamental orders limited the governors power.
in this way the fundamental orders expanded the idea of representative government in the english colonies.
connecticut became a separate colony in 1662 with a new charter granted by the king of england.
by then 15 towns were thriving along the connecticut river.
a new relationship between religion and government another puritan who challenged the leaders of massachusetts bay was roger williams.
a young minister in the village of salem williams was gentle and good natured.
william bradford described him as zealous but very unsettled in judgment some puritan leaders probably agreed with this.
most people including governor winthrop liked him.
williamss ideas however alarmed puritan leaders.
williams believed that the puritan church in massachusetts had too much power.
in williamss view the business of church and state should be completely separate since concern with political affairs would corrupt the church.
the role of the state said williams was to maintain order and peace.
it should not support a particular church.
finally williams did not believe that the puritan leaders had the right to force people to attend religious services.
because of these political reasons williams sought to establish a new colony.
williams also believed in religious tolerance.
religious tolerance means a willingness to let others practice their own beliefs.
in puritan massachusetts non puritans were not allowed to worship freely.
puritan leaders viewed williams as a dangerous troublemaker.
in 1635 the general court ordered him to leave massachusetts.
fearing that the court thomas hooker and his followers congregate at the spot in the forest they have chosen for the new settlement of hartford in 1636.
interactive chart would send him back to england williams fled to narragansett bay where he spent the winter with indians.
in the spring of 1636 the indians sold him land for a settlement.
after a few years the settlement became the english colony of rhode island.
in rhode island williams put into practice his ideas about tolerance.
he allowed complete freedom of religion for all protestants jews and catholics.
he did not set up a state church or require settlers to attend church services.
he also gave all white men the right to vote.
before long settlers who disliked the strict puritan rule of massachusetts flocked to providence and other towns in rhode island.
the creation of a colony with freedom of religion thus offered a way to resolve conflicts between people from different religious groups.
a womans voice calls for religious freedom among those who fled to rhode island was anne hutchinson.
a devout puritan hutchinson regularly attended church services in boston where she first lived.
after church she and her friends gathered at her home to discuss the ministers sermon.
often she seemed to question some of the ministers teachings.
hutchinson was very persuasive and neighbors flocked to hear her.
opean colonization of north america 66 2 3 the new england colonies european colonization of north america 2 3 the new england colonies puritan leaders grew angry.
they believed that hutchinsons opinions were full of religious errors.
even worse they said a woman did not have the right to explain gods law.
in november 1637 hutchinson was ordered to appear before the massachusetts general court.
at her trial hutchinson answered the questions put to her by governor winthrop and other members of the court.
each time her answers revealed weaknesses in their arguments.
they could not prove that she had broken any puritan laws or that she had disobeyed any religious teachings.
then after two long days of hostile questioning hutchinson made a serious mistake.
she told the court that god spoke directly to her by the voice of his own spirit to my soul members of the court were shocked.
puritans believed that god spoke only through the bible not directly to individuals.
the court ordered her out of the colony.
in 1638 hutchinson along with her family and some friends went to rhode island.
the puritan leaders had won their case.
for later americans anne hutchinson was tried in puritan massachusetts for disagreeing with church teachings and forced to leave the colony.
analyze information why might the treatment of hutchinson be seen as a violation of human rights today.
however hutchinson became an important symbol of the struggle for religious freedom.
q check understanding what relationship did i roger williams want to see between government and religion.
i war erupts between puritans and native americans from massachusetts bay settlers fanned out across new england.
some built trading and fishing villages along the coast north of boston.
port towns with good harbors were ideal for the fishing industry and also lured trading ships building the areas economy.
in 1680 the king would make some of these coastal settlements into a separate colony called new hampshire.
mistrust and more settlers leads to conflict the i first meetings between english settlers and native j americans did not foreshadow the conflict that would j eventually occur between them.
some colonial leaders such as roger williams tried to treat native americans fairly.
as more colonists settled in new england they began to take over more native american lands.
by 1670 nearly 45 000 english settlers were living in the towns in new england.
land was a resource but as more people lived in the region it became increasingly scarce.
fighting soon broke out between white settlers and indian nations of the region.
king phillips war the largest conflict came in 1675.
metacom also known by his english name king phillip was chief of the wampanoag indians.
he watched for years as english towns were built on wampanoag lands.
i am resolved not to see the day when i have no i country he told an english friend.
metacoms people attacked villages throughout new england.
other indian groups from rhode island to maine soon allied themselves with the wampanoags.
they were determined to drive the english settlers off their land.
metacom and his allies destroyed 12 towns and killed more than 600 european settlers.
after more than a year of fighting however metacom was captured and killed.
the english sold his family and about 1 000 other indians into slavery in the west indies.
other indians were forced from their homelands.

it would continue for many years to come.
fel identify what was a significant cause of king phillips war.
the towns of new england puritans believed that people should worship and tend to local matters as a community.
as a result new england became a land of tightly knit towns.
at the center of many towns was the common an open field where cattle grazed.
nearby stood the meetinghouse where puritans worshiped and held town meetings.
religious practice the puritans took their sabbath or holy day of religious observance and rest very seriously.
on sundays no one was allowed to play games or visit taverns to joke talk and drink.
the law required all citizens to attend sunday church services which would last all day.
during the 1600s women sat on one side of the church and men on the other.
blacks and indians stood in a balcony at the back.
children had separate pews where an adult watched over them.
the importance of local government at town meetings which were normally held in meeting houses where the settlers worshipped settlers discussed and voted on many issues.
what roads should be built.
how much should the schoolmaster be paid.
town meetings gave new englanders a chance to speak their minds.
puritan congregations also discussed and voted on church issues.
they chose their own ministers and members and answered to no other authority.
these early experiences encouraged the growth of democratic ideas in new england.
values such as self government individual choice and the common good took root and thrived.
still puritan laws were strict.
about 15 crimes carried the death penalty.
one crime punishable by death was witchcraft.
in 1692 puritans in salem village executed 20 innocent men and women as witches.
the environment influences economic activity new england was a difficult land for colonists.
the rocky soil was poor for farming and required much labor.

these proprietors were free to divide the land and rent it to others.
they made laws for the colony but had to respect the rights of colonists under english law.
this new system of colonization was different from most that had come before.
proprietary colonies placed vast lands and power in the hands of a few men loyal to the monarch.
earlier colonies had been financed by stock companies made up of a number of investors.

penn came from a wealthy english family and was a personal friend of king charles ii.
at age 22 however penn shocked family and friends by joining the quakers one of the most despised religious groups in england.
the quakers seek religious freedom like pilgrims and puritans quakers were protestant reformers.
their reforms went further than those of other groups however.
quakers believed that all people men and women nobles and commoners were equal in gods sight.
they allowed women to preach in public and refused to bow or remove their hats in the presence of nobles.
quakers spoke out against all war and refused to serve in the army.
to most english people quaker beliefs seemed wicked.
in both england and new england quakers were arrested fined or even hanged for their ideas.
penn became convinced that the quakers must leave england.
he took steps to found a new colony.
together with others penn purchased parts of new jersey from their proprietors.
then he turned to the king for help.
charles ii issued a royal charter naming penn proprietor of a large tract of land in north america.
the european colonization of north america 73 king named the new colony pennsylvania or penns woodlands.
during his time as proprietor penn took steps that aided the development of self government in pennsylvania.

among the new arrivals were large numbers of german speaking protestants.
they became known as pennsylvania dutch because people could not pronounce the word deutsch doich which means german.
many pennsylvania dutch had faced religious persecution in europe including the amish and mennonites.
because of their experiences in europe these german speaking people were naturally attracted to the ideals of penns colony in which people of different ethnicities and religions could live peaceably together.
the ethnic diversity of pennsylvania contributed to a developing american identity based on ethnic diversity.

daily life in the middle colonies the majority of colonists made their living by farming.
farmers found more favorable conditions in the middle colonies than in new england.
the broad hudson and delaware river valleys were rich and fertile.
winters were milder than in new england and the growing season lasted longer.
a thriving economy on such promising land farmers in the eastern counties of the middle colonies cleared their fields.
they mostly chose to raise wheat barley and rye as a way to earn money.
wheat barley and rye were cash crops or crops that were sold for money on the market and not consumed by the farmers family in fact the middle colonies exported so much grain that they became known as the breadbasket colonies.
the pennsylvania dutch tended to settle the fertile interior lands.
they altered the environment by clearing land and starting farms turning these regions into rich fields that are still productive today.
farmers of the middle colonies also raised herds of cattle and pigs.
every year they sent tons of beef pork and butter to the ports of new york and philadelphia.
from there the goods went by ship to new england and the south or to the west indies england and other parts of europe.
farms in the middle colonies were generally larger than those in new england.
landowners hired workers to help with the planting harvesting and other tasks.

although settlers planned to follow farming methods they had used in europe they found the challenge of farming the backcountry more difficult than they had thought it would be.
to farm the backcountry settlers had to clear thick forests.

in 1649 he asked the assembly to pass an act of toleration.
the law provided religious freedom for all christians.
as in many colonies this freedom did not extend to jews.
b identify how did lord baltimore found the maryland colony.
st marys city was the first town built in maryland.
settlement in the carolinas and georgia south of virginia and maryland english colonists settled in a region that they called the carolinas.
in 1663 a group of eight english nobles received a grant of land from king charles ii.
settlement took place in two separate areas one in the north and the other in the south.
the carolinas develop differently in the northern i part of the carolinas settlers were mostly poor tobacco farmers who had spread south from virginia.
they tended to have small farms.
eventually in 1712 the colony became known as north carolina.
farther south the group of eight english nobles set up a larger colony.
the largest settlement charles town sprang up where the ashley and cooper rivers met the atlantic ocean.
later charles towns name was shortened to charleston.
this colony became known as south carolina in 1719.
most early settlers in charleston were english people who had been living in barbados a british colony in the caribbean.
later other immigrants arrived including germans swiss french protestants and spanish jews.
around 1685 a few planters discovered that rice grew well in the swampy lowlands along the coast.
however they were unable to grow rich crops until africans from rice growing areas of africa arrived in the colony.
before long carolina rice was a profitable crop traded around the world.
settlers farther inland in south carolina later learned to raise indigo a plant used to make a valuable blue dye.
georgia offers a second chance the last of englands southern colonies was carved out of the southern part of south carolina.
james oglethorpe a respected english soldier and energetic social reformer helped to found georgia in 1732.
he and the other trustees started and funded the colony privately.
they hoped it would solve an english social problem as well as defend the english colonies to the north from spanish florida to the south.
oglethorpe wanted the new colony to be a place where debtors or people who owed money they could not pay back could make a fresh start.
penn had established pennsylvania as a refuge for people of different religions.
similarly oglethorpe established georgia mainly for social reasons as a refuge for debtors.
under english law the government could imprison debtors until they paid what they owed.
if they ever got out of jail debtors often had no money and no place to live.
oglethorpe offered to pay for debtors and other poor people to travel to georgia.
in america he said there are enough fertile lands to feed all the poor of england in 1733 oglethorpe and 120 colonists built the colonys first settlement at savannah along the savannah river.
oglethorpe set strict rules for the colony.
farms could be no bigger than 500 acres and slavery was forbidden.
at first georgia grew slowly.
later however oglethorpe changed the rules to allow large plantations and slave labor.
after that the colony grew more quickly.
h check understanding why did south carolinas economy come to depend on rice crops.
two regions develop differently the plantation system developed in the southern colonies because of the headright.
the headright was a grant of land for each settler who came to a colony or for the person who paid to bring a settler.
wealthy settlers saw a chance to gain even more wealth by paying for farm workers and thus gaining ownership of large amounts of fertile coastal farmland.
although the plantation system developed first in virginia south carolina planters turned to it as well.
they wanted large numbers of workers for rice plantations.
few white settlers were willing to work in rice paddies.
as in virginia planters turned to africa for slave labor.
by 1700 most people coming to charleston were african men and women brought against their will.
each time a planter bought an enslaved african the planter gained more land.
this system led to the expansion of slavery across the south.
tidewater plantations on the coast the southern colonies enjoyed warmer weather and a longer growing season than the colonies to the north.
parts of virginia maryland and north carolina near the coast all became major tobacco growing areas.
settlers in lowland south carolina and georgia raised rice indigo and cotton.
in these regions physical characteristics of the environment such as flat landscapes and fertile soils resulted in a relatively dense population during the 1600s and 1700s.
colonists soon found that it was most profitable to raise tobacco and rice on large plantations.
as you recall a plantation is a large estate farmed by many workers.
the earliest planters settled along rivers and creeks of the coastal plain.
because these rivers and enslaved africans such as these unloading rice barges made up the largest racial group in south carolina.
interactive illustration creeks rose and fell with ocean tides the region was known as the tidewater.
the tidewaters gentle slopes and rivers offered rich farmland for plantations.
farther inland planters settled along rivers.
rivers provided an easy way to move goods to market.
planters loaded crops onto ships bound for the west indies and europe.
on the return trip the ships carried english manufactured goods and other luxuries for planters and their families.
most tidewater plantations had their own docks along the river and merchant ships picked up crops and delivered goods directly to them.
for this reason few large seaport cities developed in the southern colonies.
large tidewater plantations often consisted of brick or framed mansions with nearby storehouses and quarters for enslaved workers.
the mansions overlooked fields or paddies and often the nearest river.
on these southern plantations anywhere from 20 to 100 enslaved africans and african americans did most of the work.
most of these enslaved workers worked in the fields.
others were skilled workers such as carpenters barrel makers or blacksmiths.
still other enslaved africans and african americans worked in the main house as cooks servants or housekeepers.
only a small percentage of white southerners owned large plantations.
yet planters set the style of southern european colonization of north america 78 2 5 the southern colonies is european colonization of north america 2 5 the southern colonies living.
life centered around the planters house or the great house.
there the planters family lived in elegant quarters including a parlor for visitors a dining room and guest bedrooms.
during the growing season planters decided which fields to plant what crops to grow and when to harvest the crops.
planters wives kept the household running smoothly.
they directed enslaved cooks maids and butlers in the house and made sure daily tasks were done such as milking cows.
in contrast to the lives of the planters enslaved workers faced daily hardship.
they were impoverished and denied basic rights.
their diets were often inadequate for the work they did.
their dwellings were rough and open to the weather.
they faced diseases and other dangers.
yet enslaved africans played a crucial role on plantations.
they used farming skills they had brought from west africa.
with their help english settlers learned how to grow rice.
africans also knew how to use wild plants unfamiliar to the english.
they made water buckets out of gourds and they used palmetto leaves to make fans brooms and baskets.
the backcountry farther inland west of the tidewater life and the local economy was very this print shows a southern plantation during the 1700s with enslaved workers assisting the lady of the house.
here at the base of the appalachians rolling hills and thick forests covered the land.
these physical characteristics of the environment would in turn influence population distribution settlement patterns and economic activity in the region during the 1600s and 1700s.
as in the middle colonies this inland area was called the backcountry.
attracted by rich soil settlers followed the great wagon road into the backcountry of maryland virginia and the carolinas.
among the settlers who moved into the backcountry were scotch irish and germans including german moravians.
the scotch irish tended to be presbyterian farmers and craftspeople.
many were escaping famine and harsh treatment under english rule in northern ireland or were the children of such immigrants.
they built churches and started schools in their backcountry settlements.
these immigrant groups transformed the environment by clearing the forests and creating fields where they grew crops such as wheat and fields and pens where they raised cattle and pigs.
the german immigrants to the backcountry mostly lutherans sought good land at low cost.
they often settled together in the same areas speaking german and retaining german culture.
the german moravians were members of a protestant group that sought to convert indians to christianity.
they allowed women to preach and were pacifists.
the moravians kept careful records of backcountry life including everything from the weather to fashions that historians still use today.
the backcountry was more democratic than the tidewater.
settlers there were more likely to treat one another as equals.
men tended smaller fields of tobacco or garden crops such as beans corn or peas.
they also hunted game.
the distance of the backcountry from the coastline made trade difficult and prevented the development of a plantation economy.
instead backcountry farmers had to be mostly self sufficient.
surplus goods were sold at local markets.
women cooked meals and fashioned simple rugged clothing out of wool or deerskins.
another major difference between the backcountry and the tidewater was slavery.
farms were smaller in the backcountry in part because of the hills and thick forests.
fewer enslaved africans worked on these smaller farms and most people were of european descent.
the hardships of backcountry life brought settlers closer together.
families gathered to husk corn or help one another build barns.
clustered in fertile valleys along the edge of the appalachians these hardy settlers felled trees and grew crops.
by changing the european colonization of north america 2 5 the southern colonies environment for the better they in turn encouraged further economic development in the region.
b identify supporting details why was there less slavery in the backcountry than the tidewater region.
debs elps 3 h 3 read the section titled tidewater plantations on the coast.
describe the plantations to a partner using as much detail as possible.
the slave trade expands in the early years africans in the english colonies included free people and indentured servants as well as enslaved persons.
during the 1600s even africans who were enslaved enjoyed some privileges.
the first enslaved africans arrived in virginia in 1619.
for the next fifty years since the african population was small the status of africans in the colony was not clearly established.
some enslaved africans purchased their freedom.
several africans during the 1600s such as anthony johnson became successful property owners.
in south carolina some enslaved africans worked without supervision as cowboys herding cattle to market.
by 1700 plantations in the southern colonies had come to rely heavily on slave labor.
eventually enslaved africans made up the majority of the population in south carolina and georgia.
they cleared the land worked the crops and tended the livestock.
in order to maintain the supply of enslaved africans southern planters relied on a system of slave trading that stretched halfway across the globe.
africans are enslaved in africa as you have learned as elsewhere around the world slavery had been part of the social and economic system since ancient times.
usually slaves were people who had been captured in war.
muslim merchants sometimes brought enslaved africans into europe and the middle east.
over a period of about 300 years as the transatlantic slave trade grew millions of africans were enslaved.
slave traders from european nations set up posts along the west african coast.
they offered guns and other goods in exchange for enslaved africans.
as the demand for cheap labor increased africans who lived along the coast made raids into the interior seeking captives to sell to the europeans.
they marched their captives to the coast.
there the africans were loaded aboard european ships headed for forced immigration to the americas.
planters in the southern colonies relied on the slave trade to maintain a supply of plantation labor.
summarize how does this poster present enslaved africans.
sailing across the middle passage in the 1700s english sailors began referring to the passage of slave trading ships west across the atlantic ocean as the middle passage.
below the decks of these ships enslaved africans were often crammed tightly together on shelves.
one observer noted that they were chained to each other hand and foot and stowed so close that they were not allowed above a foot and a half for each in breadth the captives were allowed above deck to eat and exercise in the fresh air only once or twice a day.
many enslaved africans resisted but only a few escaped.
some fought for their freedom during the trip.
they would stage a mutiny or revolt.
the slave traders lived in fear of this and were heavily armed.
other slaves resisted by refusing to eat or by committing suicide by jumping overboard to avoid a life of enslavement.
records of slave trading ships show that about 10 percent of africans loaded aboard a ship for passage to the americas died during the voyage.
many died of illnesses that spread rapidly in the filthy crowded conditions inside a ship s hold.
others died of mistreatment.
this slave trade lasted about 300 years.
during that time it may have caused the deaths of as many as 2 to 3 million africans.

the economies of the three colonial regions depended on different resources.
analyze charts what two resources did the southern colonies possess in great abundance that increased their wealth over that of the new england and middle colonies.
human rights are often ignored as the importance of slavery increased during the 1600s and particularly after bacons rebellion in virginia greater limits were placed on the rights of enslaved africans and african americans.
colonists passed laws that set out rules for slaves behavior and denied enslaved people basic human rights.
these slave codes treated enslaved africans and african americans not as human beings but as property.
most english colonists did not question the justice of owning enslaved africans.
they believed that black africans as a racial group were inferior to white europeans.
the belief that one race is superior to another is called racism.
some colonists believed that they were helping enslaved africans by teaching them christianity.
a handful of colonists spoke out against the evils of slavery.

summarize what the middle passage was like for most enslaved africans.
colonial society society in colonial times the upper and middle social classes at the top of society stood the gentry.
the gentry included wealthy planters merchants ministers successful lawyers and royal officials.
they could afford to dress in the latest fashions from london.
below the gentry were the middle class.
the middle class included farmers who worked their own land skilled craft workers and some tradespeople.
nearly three quarters of all white colonists belonged to the middle class.
they prospered because land in the colonies was plentiful and easy to buy and because skilled work was in high demand and paid relatively well.
the lower social classes the lowest social class included hired farmhands indentured servants and enslaved africans and african americans.
indentured servants signed contracts to work without wages for a period of four to seven years for anyone who would pay their ocean passage to the americas.
when their term of service was completed indentured servants received freedom dues a set of clothes tools and 50 acres of land.
because there were so few european women in the colonies female indentured servants often shortened their terms of service by marrying.

interactive gallery thousands of men women and children came to north america as indentured servants.
after completing their terms some became successful and rose into the middle class.
i working life in the countryside from new hampshire to georgia most colonists survived by farming.
men worked long hours planting crops tending the fields and raising livestock pigs cows and other farm animals.
anything beyond what the family needed to live was taken to markets to sell.
families also traded crops and livestock with their neighbors for additional goods.
while men typically did much of the agricultural work women often worked within the home.
they worked hard taking care of the household and the family.
by the kitchen fire they cooked the family s meals.
they milked cows tended chickens and a vegetable garden watched the children cleaned did laundry by hand and made candles cheese and i clothes.
life was different in the backcountry out beyond more settled lands.
life was difficult and wives and husbands often worked side by side in the fields at harvest time.
with so much to be done no one worried whether harvesting was proper womans work one surprised visitor described a backcountry woman s activities she will carry a gunn in the woods and kill deer turkeys c shoot down wild cattle catch and tye hoggs knock down cattle with an ax and perform the most manfull exercises as well as most men working life in cities in cities women sometimes worked outside the home.
a young single woman from a poorer family might work for one of the gentry as a maid a cook or a nurse.
other women were midwives who delivered babies.
still others sewed fine hats or dresses to be sold to women who could afford them.
learning such skills often required years of training.
some women learned trades from their fathers brothers or husbands.
they worked as butchers shoemakers or silversmiths.
quite a few women became printers.
a woman might take over her husbands business when he died.
men often worked in trades for example as coopers who made and repaired wooden barrels blacksmiths and silversmiths.
most large towns in the colonies were seaports where merchants and traders brought goods to and from europe.
as this trade grew more men also took on jobs as bankers lawyers and businessmen.
some educated men in the colonies became politicians.
others were pamphleteers who wrote and distributed small booklets informing people on a subject.
there were many doctors in the colonies where illness was common.
however medical training varied.
a surgeon might be a barber with little real medical training.
african influences in the colonies by the mid 1700s the culture of africans and african americans in the colonies varied greatly.
on rice plantations in south carolina enslaved africans used methods from west africa for growing and harvesting rice.
for example flat baskets holding the grains were shaken in the wind to separate the grains from leaves and other particles.
then a wooden mortar and pestle were used to clean the grains.
language is another area where african influences were strong.
in some coastal areas enslaved africans spoke a distinctive combination of english and west african languages known as gullah gull uh.
parents often chose african names for their children such as quosh or juba or cuff.
in charleston and other south carolina port towns some africans worked along the dock making rope or barrels or helping to build ships.
skilled crafts workers made fine wooden cabinets or silver plates and utensils.
many of their designs reflected african artistic styles.
although most africans in these towns were enslaved many opened their own shops or stalls in the market.
some used their earnings to buy their own and their familys freedom.
in the middle colonies and new england the african and african american population increased during the 1700s.
africans and african americans in the northern colonies included both free and enslaved people.
their numbers were much lower than in the southern colonies.
however they were still an important part of the population.
in some of the middle colonies such as new york there were even plantations that relied on slave labor.
often these plantations produced grains and meat for sale to feed enslaved workers in the southern colonies or the west indies.
define what was an indentured servant.
colonial art literature and music colonists brought with them the artistic traditions of their homelands.
new artistic styles also developed that reflected colonial society.
wealthy gentry decorated their homes with paintings of landscapes and religious art.
furniture houses and clothing were often decorated with intricate carvings or designs.
enslaved african amercians introduced new methods of harvesting and preparing different grains.
art reflects colonial society paintings that celebrated important people of the time were especially popular works of art.
those who could afford it hired artists to paint portraits of their family members.
these portraits showed off the familys importance and provided a valuable keepsake to be passed on for generations to come.
portraits also honored famous individuals and key events.
one of the oldest surviving colonial portraits is of new netherland governor peter stuyvesant painted in the 1660s.
prints were also popular in colonial families.
these were small engravings scratched into metal or carved into wood.
printmakers used the metal or wood with ink paper and a press to make a picture that could be easily reproduced.
many people had prints of famous figures such as politicians or clergymen.
many artists were self taught.
few became wealthy from their work.
they often traveled from town to town in search of people who wanted portraits done.
the paintings they left behind are like time capsules.
much like photographs do today they show how people dressed what their tastes were like and how their families lived.
american literature emerges literature also developed in the colonies.
the first colonial printing press was built in massachusetts in 1640.
it printed colonization of north america 84 2 6 colonial society european colonization of north america 85 2 6 colonial society religious books and books for harvard college.
with the spread of printing more colonists began to read.
colonists read reprints of european books and books by american writers.
one of the most popular and particularly american types of stories was the captivity tale.
in these stories a white settler was captured by native americans and had to overcome hardships in order to escape.
colonial music music was another popular art form in the colonies.
colonists brought popular folk music from europe.
they sang and danced at weddings and other celebrations.
enslaved africans brought musical traditions with them from africa.
these traditions combined with european traditions in musical forms such as work songs and spirituals or religious songs.
music was closely tied to religious life for many colonists.
new organs appeared in churches.
the hymns people sang grew especially popular during the great awakening.
b identify supporting details what clues can we find about colonial lives in artwork such as paintings.
with his fiery sermons jonathan edwards a new england preacher helped spark the religious movement known as the great awakening.
a new religious movement in the 1730s and 1740s a religious revival or movement known as the great awakening swept through the colonies.
it is sometimes also known as the first great awakening to distinguish it from later religious revivals.
its drama and emotion touched women and men of all races ethnic backgrounds and classes.
enthusiastic preachers a new england preacher jonathan edwards helped set off the great awakening.
in powerful sermons edwards called on colonists especially young people to examine their lives.
he preached of the sweetness and beauty of god.
at the same time he warned listeners to heed the bibles teachings.
otherwise they would be sinners in the hands of an angry god headed for the fiery torments of hell.
the powerful sermons of preachers such as edwards were one of the main causes of the great awakening.
in 1739 when an english minister named george whitefield arrived in the colonies the movement spread like wildfire.
whitefield drew huge crowds to outdoor meetings.
an enthusiastic and energetic preacher his voice would ring with feeling as he called on sinners to repent.
after hearing whitefield speak jonathan edwardss wife reported i have seen upwards of a thousand people hang on his words with breathless silence broken only by an occasional half suppressed sob the great awakenings impact the colonies were made up of many different religious groups.
there were quakers puritans catholics presbyterians and more.
each group had its own ideas about the proper relationship with god.
some groups like the anglicans disagreed strongly with whitefield.
others like the baptists and methodists found new opportunities to expand during the great awakening as people revisited their faith.
the great awakening aroused bitter debate.
people who supported the movement often split away from their old churches to form new ones.
opponents warned that the movement was too emotional.
still the growth of so many new churches forced colonists to become more tolerant of people with different beliefs.
also because the great awakening appealed to people in all of the colonies from different classes and ethnic backgrounds it brought colonists together for the first time.
ties formed during the great awakening helped form the groundwork for future bonds among the colonies.
in the colonies members of most churches controlled their parishes.
the role parishes played in local communities made people think about the importance of self rule a key factor in the development of american democracy.
the great awakening contributed in another way to the spread of democratic feelings in the colonies.
many of the new preachers were not as well educated as most ministers.
they argued that formal training was less important than a heart filled with the holy spirit.
such teachings encouraged a spirit of independence.
many believers felt more free to challenge authority when their liberties were at stake.
people began to think differently about their political rights and their governments.
they felt if they could figure out how to worship on their own and how to run their own churches then they could govern themselves with those same virtues.
eventually many of these colonists would challenge the authority of colonial governors and the english king.
b identify central ideas how did the great awakening change how people thought about themselves and their political rights.
colonial schools and colleges among the colonists new englanders were the most concerned about education.
puritans taught that all people had a duty to study the bible.
if colonists did not learn to read how would they fulfill this duty.
public schools in new england in 1642 the massachusetts assembly passed a law ordering all parents to teach their children to read and understand the principles of religion they also required all towns with 50 or more families to hire a schoolteacher.
towns with 100 or more families also had to set up a grammar school to prepare boys for college.
in this way massachusetts set up the first public schools or schools supported by taxes.
public schools allowed both rich and poor children to receive an education.
the first new england schools had only one room for students of all ages.
parents paid the schoolteacher with corn peas or other foods.
each child was expected to bring a share of wood to burn in the stove.
students who forgot would find themselves seated in the coldest corner of the room.
private education in other colonies in the middle colonies churches and individual families set up crowds of people gathered to hear sermons by english minister george whitefield as shown in a later print.

in the southern colonies people often lived too far from one another to bring children together in one school building.
some planters hired tutors or.
private teachers.
the wealthiest planters sent their sons to school in england.
as a rule enslaved african americans were denied education of any kind.
apprenticeships and dame schools boys whose parents wished them to learn a trade or craft served as apprentices uh pren tis ez.
an apprentice worked for a master to learn a trade or a craft.
for example when a boy reached the age of 12 or 13 his parents might apprentice him to a master glassmaker.
the young apprentice lived in the glassmakers home for six or seven years while learning the craft.
the glassmaker gave the boy food and clothing.
he was also supposed to teach his apprentice how to read and write and provide him with religions training.
in return the apprentice worked without pay in the glassmakers shop and learned the skills he needed to set up his own shop.
boys were apprenticed in many trades including papermaking printing and tanning making leather.
in new england most schools accepted only boys.
however some girls attended dame schools or private schools run by women in their own homes.
other girls though usually learned skills from their mothers who taught them to cook make soap and candles spin wool weave sew and embroider.
a few learned to read and write.
the growth of colleges in 1633 puritan john eliot spoke of the need for massachusetts to establish an official college.
institutions of higher learning were held up as a way to promote european culture in the americas.
as eliot cautioned if we no u rish not l e arning both church common wealth will sinke harvard college opened in 1638 with 10 students.
the goal of the college was to educate future ministers.
it was modeled after english schools where students studied six days a week in latin and greek.
it was open only to men.
by the late 1600s however harvard graduates were moving away from the ministry.
some became physicians public servants or teachers.
the college of william and mary opened in virginia to prepare men for the anglican ministry.
yale college in connecticut aimed to educate clergymen.
gradually however nine colleges opened over the following century and expanded their areas of study.
students could learn other subjects such as medicine and law.
b recall why were there private schools in many colonies.
a new world of ideas during the 1600s european scientists began to use reason and logic instead of superstition to understand the world.
they developed theories and then performed experiments to test them.
in doing so they discovered many of the laws of nature.
the english scientist isaac newton for example explained the law of gravity.
the ideas of the enlightenment european thinkers of the late 1600s and 1700s believed that reason and scientific methods could be applied to the study of society.
they tried to discover the natural laws that governed human behavior.
because these thinkers believed in the light of human reason the movement that they started is known as the enlightenment.
john locke an english philosopher wrote works that were widely read in the colonies.
he said people could gain knowledge of the world by observing and by experimenting.
in the english colonies the enlightenment spread among better educated colonists.
they included wealthy merchants lawyers ministers and others who had the leisure to read the latest books from europe.
urban craftsmen also heard and discussed these ideas.
benjamin franklin influences daily life the best example of the enlightenment spirit in the english colonies was benjamin franklin.
franklin was born in 1706 the son of a poor boston soap and candle maker.
although he had only two years of formal schooling he used his spare time to study literature mathematics and foreign languages.
at age 17 franklin made his way to philadelphia.
there he built up a successful printing business.
his most popular publication was poor richard s almanack.
published yearly it contained useful information and clever quotes such as early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise like other enlightenment thinkers franklin wanted to use reason to improve the world around him.
he invented practical devices that helped improve daily life.
for example franklin suffered from poor eyesight so he invented bifocal glasses to help himself and countless others see better.
franklin also invented a new kind of iron stove.
it was set in the middle of a room instead of in a wall and it kept houses warmer without filling them with smoke.
another one of franklins isaac newton analyzes the colors in a ray of light shining through his door.
newton was an important figure in the enlightenment a movement that emphasized reason logic and individualism.
founded in 1693 the college of william and mary educated young men to join the anglican clergy.

in 1704 john campbell founded the boston news letter the first regular weekly newspaper in the english colonies.
within 50 years each of the colonies except new jersey and delaware had at least one weekly paper.
john peter zengers libel trial the growth of colonial newspapers led to a dispute over freedom of the press.
john peter zenger published the weekly journal in new york city.
in 1734 he was arrested for publishing stories that criticized the governor.
zenger was put on trial for libel the act of publishing a statement that may unjustly damage a persons reputation.
zengers lawyer argued that since the stories were true his client had not committed libel.
the jury agreed and freed zenger.
at the time the case did not attract a great deal of attention.
however freedom of the press would become recognized as a basic american right.

the influence of colonial cities and towns while most colonists lived on farms towns and cities strongly influenced colonial life.
through the great ports of philadelphia new york boston and charleston merchants shipped products overseas.
towns and cities also served as centers of a busy trade between the coast and the growing backcountry.

colonial trade and government mercantilism and the english colonies according to this theory a nation could become strong by keeping strict control over its trade.
as one english gentleman put it whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world imports and exports mercantilists thought that a country should export more than it imported.
exports are goods sent to markets outside a country.
imports are goods brought into a country.
if england sold more goods than it bought abroad gold would flow into the home country as payment for those exports.
the navigation acts affect the colonies beginning in the 1650s the english parliament passed a series of navigation acts that regulated trade between england and its colonies.
the purpose of these laws was to ensure that only england benefited from trade with its colonies.
under the new laws only colonial or english ships could carry goods to and from the colonies.

all trade had to go through england.
the navigation acts also listed certain products such as tobacco and cotton that colonial merchants could ship only to england.
in this way parliament created jobs for english workers who cut and rolled tobacco or spun cotton into cloth.
the navigation acts helped the colonies as well as england.
for example the law encouraged colonists to build ships for their own use and for sale to england.
as a result new england became a prosperous shipbuilding center.
also because of the acts colonial merchants did not have to compete with foreign merchants because they were sure of having a market for their goods in england.
still many colonists resented the navigation acts.
in their view the laws favored english merchants.
colonial merchants often ignored the navigation acts or found ways to get around them.
h identify central ideas why did england pass the navigation acts.
trading across the atlantic the colonies produced a wide variety of goods and merchant ships sailed up and down the atlantic coast.
merchants from new england dominated colonial trade.
they were known as yankees a nickname that implied they were clever and hardworking.
yankee traders earned a reputation for profiting from any deal.
the triangular trade colonial merchants developed many trade routes.
one route was known as the triangular trade because the three legs of the route formed a triangle.
on the first leg ships from new england carried rum guns gunpowder cloth and tools from new england to west africa.
in africa yankee merchants traded these goods for slaves.
on the second leg of the journey ships carried enslaved africans to the west indies.
it was because enslaved africans traveled on the second leg of a three leg voyage that this leg was known as the middle passage.
with the profits from selling the enslaved africans yankee traders bought molasses a dark brown syrup made from sugar cane and sugar.
on the final leg ships then sailed back to new england where colonists used the molasses and sugar to make rum for sale in africa or europe.

and government merchants disregard the navigation acts many new england merchants grew wealthy from the triangular trade.
in doing so they often disobeyed the navigation acts.
traders were supposed to buy sugar and molasses only from english colonies in the west indies.
however the demand for molasses was so high that new englanders smuggled in cargoes from the dutch french and spanish west indies too.
bribes made customs officials look the other way.
b check understanding why did many traders ignore the navigation acts and buy sugar and molasses from non english colonies in the west indies.
the foundations of representative government although each colony developed its own government the governments had much in common.
a governor directed the colonys affairs and enforced the laws.
most governors were appointed either by the king or by the colonys proprietor.
in rhode island and connecticut however colonists elected their own governors.
representative government and institutions spread in the colonies for several reasons.
elected assemblies as you learned the virginia company decided to establish an elected assembly to attract more settlers.
for this reason and inspired by the english tradition of representative government outlined in the magna carta all of the colonies gained a legislature soon after they were founded.
a legislature is a group of people usually elected who have the power to make laws.
in most colonies the legislature had an upper house and a lower house.
the upper house was made up of advisers appointed by the governor.
the lower house was an elected assembly.
it approved laws and protected the rights of citizens.
just as important it had the right to approve or reject any taxes or budget items the governor asked for.
this power of the purse or right to raise or spend money was an important check on the governors power.
any governor who ignored the assembly risked losing his salary.
as colonial settlers spread inland and founded new cities and towns representative government and institutions grew.
most colonial cities and towns had their own city and town councils.
john archdale a governor of the early carolina colony addresses the carolina assembly in 1696.
each colony gained its own legislature or group of lawmakers.
interactive chart the right to vote each colony had its own rules about who could vote.
by the 1720s however all of the colonies had laws that restricted the right to vote to white christian men over the age of 21.
in some colonies only protestants or members of a particular church could vote.
all colonies restricted the vote to men who owned a certain amount of property.
colonial leaders believed that only property owners knew what was best for a colony.
william blackstone and common law the colonies followed english common law.
under common law laws develop from the past rulings of judges.
in applying laws courts followed the principle that like cases should be tried alike colonists brought the tradition of common law with them from england.
in the 1760s william blackstone published a four volume book commentaries on the laws of england.
in it blackstone reviewed the entire history of english law.
as a member of parliament and a judge in england he believed common law was the highest and best form of law.
blackstone supported parliament and opposed colonists moves toward self rule.
however his ideas about common law took hold in the colonies.
common european colonization of north america 93 2 7 colonial trade and government this illustration shows a colonial woman in court.
while unmarried women and widows had some legal rights married women were legally dependent on their husbands.
law was a body of laws that was valid independent of parliaments acts.
as such it provided a basis for self rule and an independent legal system once the colonies began to move toward independence.
the english bill of rights supports freedoms colonists took great pride in their elected assemblies.
they also valued the rights that the magna carta gave them as english subjects.
colonists won still more rights as a result of the glorious revolution of 1688.
parliament removed king james ii from the throne and asked william and mary of the netherlands to rule.
in return for parliaments support william and mary signed the english bill of rights in 1689.
a bill of rights is a written list of freedoms the government promises to protect.
the english bill of rights protected the rights of individuals and gave anyone accused of a crime the right to a trial by jury.
just as important the english bill of rights said that a ruler could not raise taxes or an army without the approval of parliament.
the bill of rights also strengthened the position of representative government and institutions in the colonies.
liberties are restricted english colonists in the americas often enjoyed more freedoms than did the f english themselves.
however the rights of english citizens did not extend to all colonists.
women had more rights in the colonies than in england but far fewer rights than did free white males.
a woman s father or husband was supposed to protect her.
a married woman could not start her own business or sign a contract unless her husband approved it.
in most colonies unmarried women and widows had more rights than married women.
they could make contracts and sue in court.
in maryland and the carolinas women settlers who headed families could buy land on the same terms as men.
african americans and native americans in the colonies had almost no rights.
while so many colonists enjoyed english liberties most african americans were bound in slavery.
the conflict between liberty and slavery would not be resolved until the 1860s.

the french and indian war europeans fight over north american land the most serious threat came from france.
it claimed a vast area that circled the english colonies from the st lawrence river west to the great lakes and south to the gulf of mexico.
to protect their land claims the french built an extensive system of forts.
these forts blocked the british colonies from expanding to the west.
the importance of the ohio river valley at first most settlers in the british colonies were content to remain along the atlantic coast.
by the 1740s however traders were crossing the appalachian mountains in search of furs.
pushing into the forests of the ohio valley which supported an abundance of wildlife settlers tried to take over the profitable french trade with the indians.
france was determined to stop the british from expanding westward.
the ohio river was especially important to the french because it provided a vital link between their claims along the great lakes and their settlements along the mississippi river.
ohio valley native americans choose allies native americans had hunted animals and grown crops in the ohio valley for centuries.
they did not want to give up the land to european settlers french or british.
one native american protested to a british trader you and the french are like the two edges of a pair of shears.
and we are the cloth which is to be cut to pieces between them still the growing conflict between britain and france was too dangerous to ignore.
some native americans decided that the only way to protect their way of life was to take sides in the struggle.
the french expected the indians to side with them.
most french in north america were trappers and traders.
generally they did not destroy indian hunting grounds by clearing forests for farms.
also many french trappers married native american women and adopted their ways.
as a result france had built strong alliances with such native american groups as the algonquins and the hurons.
many british settlers were farmers.
these settlers usually ignored indian rights by felling trees and clearing land for crops.
however an english trader and official william johnson helped gain iroquois support for britain.
the iroquois respected johnson.
he was one of the few british settlers who had an indian wife molly brant.

both joseph and molly brant became valuable allies for the british.
the british also won native american allies in the ohio valley by charging lower prices than the french for trade goods.
in the end britain managed to convince the powerful iroquois nations to join with them.
the british alliance was attractive to the iroquois because they were old enemies of the algonquin and the huron peoples.
the war reignited old conflicts in the ohio valley between the iroquois and the algonquins and hurons.
some tribes like the shawnees delawares and mingos formed alliances to push europeans off their lands.
more often however the alliances native americans formed with the british and the french pitted tribes against each other in the fighting to come.
