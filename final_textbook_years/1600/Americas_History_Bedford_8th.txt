continued on his way toward india.
others soon followed and changed the regions name to brazil after the indigenous tree that yielded a valuable red dye for several decades portuguese sailors traded with the tupi indians for brazilwood.
then in the 1530s to secure portugals claim king dom joo iii sent settlers who began the long painstaking process of carving out sugar plantations in the coastal lowlands.
for several decades native americans supplied most of the labor for these operations but african slaves gradually replaced them.
brazil would soon become the worlds leading producer of sugar it would also devour african lives.
by introducing the plantation system to the americas a form of estate agriculture using slave labor that was pioneered by italian merchants and crusading knights in the twelfth century and transplanted to the islands off the coast of africa in the fifteenth century the portuguese set in motion one of the most significant developments of the early modern era.
by the end of the sixteenth century the european colonization of the americas had barely begun.
yet several of its most important elements were already taking shape.
spanish efforts demonstrated that densely populated empires were especially vulnerable to conquest and were also especially valuable sources of wealth.
the portuguese had discovered the viability of sugar plantations in the tropical regions of the americas and pioneered the transatlantic slave trade as a way of manning them.
and contacts with native peoples revealed their devastating vulnerabilities to eurasian diseases one part of the larger phenomenon of the columbian exchange discussed in chapter 2.
summary native american european and african societies developed independently over thousands of years before they experienced direct contacts with one another.
in the americas residents of mesoamerica and the andes were fully sedentary with individual ownership of land and intensive agriculture but elsewhere societies were semisedentary with central fields and villages that were occupied seasonally or nonsedentary hunter gatherers.
west and central africa also had a mix of sedentary semisedentary and nonsedentary settlements.
western europe by contrast was predominantly sedentary.
all three continents had a complex patchwork of political organization from empires to kingdoms and chiefdoms to principalities duchies and ministates everywhere rulership was imbued with notions of spiritual power.
ruling classes relied on part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 warfare trade and tribute or taxes to dominate those around them and accumulate precious goods that helped to set them apart from ordinary laborers but they also bore responsibility for the well being of their subjects and offered them various forms of protection.
as portuguese and castilian later spanish seafarers pushed into the atlantic they set in motion a chain of events whose consequences they could scarcely imagine.
from a coastal trade with africa that was secondary to their efforts to reach the indian ocean from the miscalculations of columbus and the happy accident of cabral developed a pattern of transatlantic exploration conquest and exploitation that no one could have foretold or planned.
in the tropical zones of the caribbean and coastal brazil invading europeans enslaved native americans and quickly drove them into extinction or exile.
the demands of plantation agriculture soon led europeans to import slaves from africa initiating a transatlantic trade that would destroy african lives on both sides of the ocean.
and two of the greatest empires in the world the aztec and incan empires collapsed in response to unseen biological forces that acted in concert with small invading armies.

americans and shape much of american how did native americans adapt to history had been obsolete in england the growing presence of europeans for centuries and articulating its logic among them.
required lawmakers to reverse some of the most basic presumptions of english law.
for example in 1662 a virginia statute declared all children borne in this country shalbe held bond or free only according to the condition of the mother this idea that a childs legal status derived from the mother rather than the father ran contrary to the patriarchal foundations of english law.
the men who sat in virginias house of burgesses would not propose such a thing lightly.
why would they decide that the principle of patriarchal descent which was so fundamental to their own worlds was inappropriate for their slaves.
the question needed to be addressed according to the statutes preamble since doubts have arisen whether children got by an englishman upon a negro woman should be slave or free one such case involved elizabeth key a woman whose father was a free englishman and mother was an african slave.
she petitioned for her freedom in 1656 based on her fathers status.
her lawyer was an englishman named william greensted.
he not only took keys case but he also fathered two of her children and eventually married her.
key won her case and her freedom from bondage.
elizabeth key escaped her mothers fate a life in slavery because her father and her husband were both free englishmen.
the 1662 statute aimed to close keys avenue to freedom.
the process by which the institution of chattel slavery was molded to the needs of colonial planters is just one example of the way europeans adapted the principles they brought with them to the unfamiliar demands of their new surroundings.
in the showdown between people like elizabeth key and william greensted on the one hand and the members of virginias house of burgesses on the other we see how people in disorienting circumstances some in positions in power others in various states of subjection to their social and political superiors scrambled to make sense of their world and bend its rules to their advantage.
through countless contests of power and authority like this one the outlines of a new world gradually began to emerge from the collision of cultures.
by 1700 three distinct types of colonies had developed in the americas the tribute colonies created in mexico and peru which relied initially on the wealth and labor of indigenous peoples plantation colonies where sugar and other tropical and subtropical crops could be produced with bound labor and neo europes where colonists sought to replicate or at least approximate economies and social structures they knew at home.

part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 spains tribute colonies european interest in the americas took shape under the influence of spains conquest of the aztec and inca empires.
there spanish colonizers capitalized on preexisting systems of tribute and labor discipline to tap the enormous wealth of mesoamerica and the andes.
once native rulers were overthrown the spanish monarchs transferred their institutions municipal councils the legal code the catholic church to america the empire was centrally controlled to protect the crowns immensely valuable holdings.
the spanish conquest also set in motion a global ecological transformation through a vast intercontinental movement of plants animals and diseases that historians call the columbian exchange.
and the conquest triggered hostile responses from spains european rivals especially the protestant dutch and english figure 2 1.
a new american world after corts toppled moctezuma and pizarro defeated atahualpa see pages 34 35 leading conquistadors received encomiendas from the crown which allowed them to claim tribute in labor and goods from indian communities.
later these grants were repartitioned but the pattern was set early prominent men controlled vast resources and monopolized indian labor.
the value of these grants was dramatically enhanced by the discovery of gold and especially silver deposits in both mexico and the andes.
in the decades after the conquest mines were developed in zacatecas in guanajuato and most famously at potos high in the andes.
spanish officials co opted the mita system which made laborers available to the inca empire to force indian workers into the mines.
at its peak potos alone produced 200 tons of silver per year accounting for half the worlds supply.
the two great indigenous empires of the americas thus became the core of an astonishingly wealthy european empire.
vast amounts of silver poured across the pacific ocean to china where it was minted into money in exchange spain received valuable chinese silks spices and ceramics.
in europe the gold that had formerly honored aztec and inca gods now flowed into the countinghouses of spain and gilded the catholic churches of europe.
the spanish crown benefitted enormously from all this wealth at least initially.
in the long run it triggered ruinous inflation.
as a french traveler noted in 1603 everything is dear expensive in spain except silver a new society took shape on the conquered lands.
between 1500 and 1650 at least 350 000 spaniards migrated to mesoamerica and the andes.
about twothirds were males drawn from a cross section of spanish society many of them skilled tradesmen.
also arriving were 250 000 300 000 africans.
racial mixture was widespread and such groups as mestizos spaniard indian and mulattos spaniard african grew rapidly.
zambo indian african populations developed gradually as well.
over time a system of increasingly complex racial categories developed the casta system buttressed by a legal code that differentiated among the principal groups.
indians were always in the majority in mexico and peru but profound changes came as their numbers declined and peoples of spanish and mixed race descent grew in number.
spaniards initially congregated in cities but gradually they moved into the countryside creating large estates known as haciendas and regional networks of market exchange.
most indians remained in their native communities under the authority of native rulers and speaking native new netherland portuguese brazil spanish peru new spain new france new sweden english virginia rhode island plymouth colony massachusetts bay connecticut maryland figure 2 1 chronology of european colonies in the americas chapter 2 languages.
however spanish priests suppressed religious ceremonies and texts and converted natives to christianity en masse.
catholicism was transformed in the process catholic parishes took their form from indian communities indigenous ideas and expectations reshaped church practices and new forms of native american christianity emerged in both regions.
the columbian exchange the spanish invasion permanently altered the natural as well as the human environment.
smallpox influenza measles yellow fever and other silent killers carried from europe and africa ravaged indian communities whose inhabitants had never encountered these diseases before and thus had no immunity to them.
in the densely populated core areas populations declined by 90 percent or more in the first century of contact with europeans.
on islands and in the tropical lowlands the toll was even heavier native populations were often wiped out altogether.
syphilis was the only significant illness that traveled in the opposite direction columbuss sailors carried a virulent strain of the sexually transmitted disease back to europe with them.
the movement of diseases and peoples across the atlantic was part of a larger pattern of biological transformation that historians call the columbian exchange map 2 1.

the protestant challenge to spain beyond the core regions of its empire spain claimed vast american dominions but struggled to hold them.
controlling the caribbean basin which was essential for spains transatlantic shipping routes was especially difficult since the net of tiny islands spanning the eastern caribbean the lesser antilles provided many safe harbors for pirates and privateers.

protection but they were never sufficient to keep enemies at bay.
and spain had powerful enemies their animosity sharpened by the protestant reformation and the resulting split in european christendom see p 22.
in the wake of martin luthers attack on the catholic church the protestant critique of catholicism broadened and deepened.
gold and silver from mexico and peru made spain the wealthiest nation in europe and king philip ii r 1556 1598 an ardent catholic its most powerful ruler.
philip was determined to root out challenges to the catholic church wherever they appeared.
one such place was in the spanish netherlands a collection of dutch and flemishspeaking provinces that had grown wealthy from textile manufacturing and trade with portuguese outposts in africa and asia.
to protect their calvinist faith and political liberties they revolted against spanish rule in 1566.
after fifteen years of war the seven northern provinces declared their independence becoming the dutch republic or holland in 1581.
the english king henry viii r 1509 1547 initially opposed protestantism.
however when the pope refused to annul his marriage to the spanish princess catherine of aragon in 1534 henry broke with rome and placed himself at the head of the new church of england which promptly granted an annulment.
although henrys new church maintained most catholic doctrines and practices protestant teachings continued to spread.
faced with popular pressure for reform henrys daughter and successor queen elizabeth i r 1558 1603 approved a protestant confession of faith.
at the same time however elizabeth retained the catholic ritual of holy communion and left the church in the hands of anglican bishops and archbishops.

the seventeen provinces that constituted the dutch republic were in rebellion against spanish rule in the later decades of the sixteenth century and hoped for elizabeths support.
in 1585 she signed the treaty of nonsuch pledging her support for the dutch cause.
an undeclared war with spain ensued punctuated by the defeat of the spanish armada in 1588.

protestants but the independent anglican church was anathema to the spanish king philip ii.
elizabeth supported a generation of english seafarers who took increasingly aggressive actions against spanish control of american wealth.
the most famous of these elizabethan sea dogs was francis drake a rough hewn devoutly protestant farmers son from devon who took to the sea and became a scourge to philips american interests.
in 1577 he ventured into the pacific to disrupt spanish shipping to manila.
drakes fleet lost three ships and a hundred men but the survivors completed the first english circumnavigation of the globe and captured two spanish treasure ships.
when drakes flagship the golden hind returned to england in 1580 it brought enough silver gold silk and spices to bring his investors a 4 700 percent return on their investment.
at the same time elizabeth supported military expeditions that imposed english rule over gaelicspeaking catholic ireland.
calling the irish wild savages who were more barbarous and more brutish in their customs.
than in any other part of the world english soldiers brutally massacred thousands prefiguring the treatment of indians in north america.
to meet elizabeths challenges philip sent a spanish armada 130 ships and 30 000 men against england in 1588.
philip intended to restore the roman church in england and then to wipe out calvinism in holland.
but he failed utterly a fierce storm and english ships destroyed the spanish fleet.
philip continued to spend his american gold and silver on religious wars an ill advised policy that diverted workers and resources from spains fledgling industries.
the gold was like a shewer of raine complained one critic that left no benefite behind oppressed by high taxes on agriculture and fearful of military service more than 200 000 residents of castile once the most prosperous region of spain migrated to america.
by the time of philips death in 1598 spain was in serious economic decline.
by contrast england grew significantly during the sixteenth century its economy stimulated as colonial advocate richard hakluyt noted by a wounderful increase of our people as englands population soared from 3 million in 1500 to 5 million in 1630 its monarchs supported the expansion of commerce and manufacturing.

merchants bought why did spains economy wool from the owners of great deteriorate and englands estates and sent it out to land economy improve in the less peasants in small cottages sixteenth century.
to spin and weave into cloth.
the government aided textile entrepreneurs by setting low wage rates and helped merchants by giving them monopolies in foreign markets.
this system of state assisted manufacturing and trade became known as mercantilism.
by encouraging textile production elizabeth reduced imports and increased exports.
the resulting favorable balance of trade caused gold and silver to flow into england and stimulated further economic expansion.
increased trade part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 turn to survive the present and carve out pathways to the future.
with turkey and india also boosted import duties which swelled the royal treasury and the monarchs power.
by 1600 elizabeths mercantile policies had laid the foundations for overseas colonization.
now the english had the merchant fleet and wealth needed to challenge spains control of the western hemisphere.
brazils sugar plantations portuguese colonists transformed the tropical lowlands of coastal brazil into a sugar plantation zone like the ones they had recently created on madeira the azores the cape verdes and so tom.
the work proceeded slowly but by 1590 more than a thousand sugar mills had been established in pernambuco and bahia.
each large plantation had its own milling operation because sugarcane is extremely heavy and rots quickly it must be processed on site.
thus sugar plantations combined backbreaking agricultural labor with milling extracting and refining processes that made sugar plantations look like industrial revolution era factories.
initially portuguese planters hoped that brazils indigenous peoples would supply the labor required to plantation colonies as spain hammered out its american empire and struggled against its protestant rivals portugal england france and the netherlands created successful plantation settlements in brazil jamestown maryland and the caribbean islands map 2 2.
worldwide demand for sugar and tobacco fuelled the growth of these new colonies and the resulting influx of colonists diminished spains dominance in the new world.

but beginning with a wave of smallpox in 1559 unfamiliar diseases soon ravaged the coastal indian population.
as a result planters turned to african slaves in ever growing numbers by 1620 the switch was complete.
while spanish colonies in mexico and peru took shape with astonishing speed following conquest brazils occupation and development progressed more gradually it required both trial and error and hard work to build a paying colony.

the fate of roanoke the lost colony remains a compelling puzzle for modern historians.
the jamestown settlement merchants then took charge of english expansion.
in 1606 king james i r 1603 1625 granted to the virginia company of london all the lands stretching from present day north carolina to southern new york.
to honor the memory of elizabeth i the never married virgin queen the companys directors named the region virginia map 2 3.

he was willing to treat the english traders as potential allies who could provide valuable goods but just as the englishmen expected tribute from the indians powhatan expected tribute from the english.
he provided the hungry english adventurers with corn in return he demanded hatchets.
bells beads and copper as well as two great guns and expected jamestown to become a dependent community within his chiefdom.
subsequently powhatan arranged a marriage between his daughter pocahontas and john rolfe an english colonist thinking like a historian p 50.
but these tactics failed.
the inability to decide who would pay tribute to whom led to more than a decade of uneasy relations followed by a long era of ruinous warfare.
the war was precipitated by the discovery of a cash crop that like sugar in brazil offered colonists a way to turn a profit but required steady expansion onto indian lands.
tobacco was a plant native to the americas long used by indians as a medicine and a stimulant.
john rolfe found a west indian strain that could flourish in virginia soil and produced a small crop pleasant sweet and strong that fetched a high price in england and spurred the migration of thousands of new settlers.
the english soon came to crave the nicotine that tobacco contained.
james i initially condemned the plant as a vile weed whose black stinking fumes were baleful to the nose harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs but the kings attitude changed as taxes on imported tobacco thinking like a historian who was pocahontas.

a daughter of chief powhatan her interactions with colonists were important at the time and have been mythologized ever since.
pocahontas left no writings so what we know of her comes from others.
from these accounts we know that she acted as a mediator with the jamestown settlers she was the first native american to marry an englishman and she traveled to england with her husband and son.

having feasted smith after their best barbarous manner they could a long consultation was held but the conclusion was two great stones were brought before powhatan then as many as could layd hands on him dragged him to them and thereon laid his head and being ready with their clubs to beate out his braines pocahontas the kings dearest daughter when no entreaty could prevaile got his head in her armes and laid her owne upon his to save him from death whereat the emperour was contented he should live to make him hatchets and her bells beads and copper.

pocahontas visited jamestown regularly in the years following smiths capture.
smith returned to england in 1609 four years later captain samuel argall kidnapped pocahontas and held her captive in jamestown.
s he too james towne was brought.
a messenger forthwith was sent to her father that his daughter pocahontas he loved so dearely he must ransome with our men swords peeces tooles c he treacherously had stolen.
sent us word that when we would deliver his daughter he would make us satisfaction for all injuries done to us and give us five hundred bushels of corne and for ever be friends with us.
w e could not believe the rest of our armes were either lost or stolen from him and therefore till he sent them we would keep his daughter.
w e heard no more from him a long time after.
long before this master john rolfe an honest gentleman of good behavior had been in love with pocahontas and she with him.
t his marriage came soone to the knowledge of powhatan a thing acceptable to him as appeared by his sudden consent for within ten daies he sent opachisco an old uncle of hers and two of his sons to see the manner of the marriage and to do in that behalf what they were requested.
which was accordingly done about the first of april and ever since we have had friendly trade and commerce.

powhatan however now accused the english of coming not to trade but to invade my people and possess my country to foster the flow of migrants the virginia company allowed individual settlers to own land granting 100 acres to every freeman and more to those who imported servants.
the company also created a system of representative government the house of burgesses first convened in 1619 could make laws and levy taxes although the governor and the company council in england could veto its acts.
by 1622 landownership self government and a judicial system based on the lawes of the realme of england had attracted some 4 500 new recruits.
to encourage the transition to a settler colony the virginia company recruited dozens of maides young and uncorrupt to make wifes to the inhabitants the indian war of 1622 the influx of migrants sparked an all out conflict with the neighboring indians.
the struggle began with an assault led by opechancanough powhatans younger brother and successor.
in 1607 opechancanough had attacked some of the first english invaders subsequently he stood aloof from the english settlers and would not be drawn to any treaty in particular he resisted english proposals to place indian children in schools to be brought upp in christianytie upon becoming the paramount chief in 1621 opechancanough told the leader of the neighboring potomack indians before the end of two moons there should not be an englishman in all their countries opechancanough almost succeeded.
in 1622 he coordinated a surprise attack by twelve indian chiefdoms that killed 347 english settlers nearly one third of the population.

now the king and his ministers appointed the governor and a small advisory council retaining the locally elected house of burgesses but stipulating that the kings privy council a committee of political advisors must ratify all legislation.
the king also decreed the legal establishment of the church of england in the colony which meant that residents had to pay taxes to support its clergy.
these institutions an appointed governor an elected assembly a formal legal system and an established anglican church became the model for royal colonies throughout english america.
lord baltimore settles catholics in maryland a second tobacco growing colony developed in neighboring maryland.
king charles i r 1625 1649 jamess successor was secretly sympathetic toward catholicism and in 1632 he granted lands bordering the vast chesapeake bay to catholic aristocrat cecilius calvert lord baltimore.
thus maryland became a refuge for catholics who were subject to persecution in england.
in 1634 twenty gentlemen mostly catholics and 200 artisans and laborers mostly protestants established st marys city at the mouth of the potomac river.
to minimize religious confrontations the proprietor instructed the governor to allow no scandall nor offence to be given to any of the protestants and to cause all acts of romane catholicque religion to be done as privately as may be maryland grew quickly because baltimore imported many artisans and offered ample lands to wealthy migrants.
but political conflict threatened the colonys stability.
disputing baltimores powers settlers elected a representative assembly and insisted on the right to initiate legislation which baltimore grudgingly granted.
anti catholic agitation by protestants also threatened his religious goals.
to protect his coreligionists lord baltimore persuaded the assembly to enact the toleration act 1649 which granted all christians the right to follow their beliefs and hold church services.
in maryland as in virginia tobacco quickly became the main crop and that similarity rather than any religious difference ultimately made the two colonies very much alike in their economic and social systems.
the caribbean islands virginias experiment with a cash crop that created a land intensive plantation society ran parallel to developments in the caribbean where english french and dutch sailors began looking for a permanent toehold.
in 1624 a small english party under the command of sir thomas warner established a settlement on st christopher st kitts.
a year later warner allowed a french group to settle the other end of the island so they could better defend their position from the spanish.
chapter 2 american experiments 1521 1700 a sugar mill in the french west indies 1655 making sugar required both hard labor and considerable expertise.
field slaves labored strenuously in the hot tropical sun to cut the sugarcane and carry or cart it to an oxen or wind powered mill where it was pressed to yield the juice.
then skilled slave artisans took over.
they carefully heated the juice and at the proper moment added ingredients that granulated the sugar and separated it from the molasses which was later distilled into rum.

within a few years the english and french colonists on st kitts had driven the native caribs from the island weathered a spanish attack and created a common set of bylaws for mutual occupation of the island.
after st kitts a dozen or so colonies were founded in the lesser antilles including the french islands of martinique guadeloupe and st barts the english outposts of nevis antigua montserrat anguilla tortola and barbados and the dutch colony of st eustatius.
in 1655 an english fleet captured the spanish island of jamaica one of the large islands of the greater antilles and opened it to settlement as well.
a few of these islands were unpopulated before europeans settled there elsewhere native populations were displaced and often wiped out within a decade or so.
only on the largest islands did native populations hold out longer.
colonists experimented with a wide variety of cash crops including tobacco indigo cotton cacao and ginger.
beginning in the 1640s and drawing on the example of brazil planters on many of the islands shifted to sugar cultivation.
where conditions were right as they were in barbados jamaica nevis and martinique these colonies were soon producing substantial crops of sugar and as a consequence claimed some of the worlds most valuable real estate.
plantation life in north america and the caribbean plantations were initially small freeholds farms of 30 to 50 acres owned and farmed by families or male partners.
but the logic of plantation agriculture soon encouraged consolidation large planters engrossed as much land as they part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 could and experimented with new forms of labor discipline that maximized their control over production.
in virginia the headright system guaranteed 50 acres of land to anyone who paid the passage of a new immigrant to the colony thus by buying additional indentured servants and slaves the colonys largest planters also amassed ever greater claims to land.
european demand for tobacco set off a forty year economic boom in the chesapeake.
all our riches for the present do consist in tobacco a planter remarked in 1630.
exports rose from 3 million pounds in 1640 to 10 million pounds in 1660.
after 1650 wealthy migrants from gentry or noble families established large estates along the coastal rivers.
coming primarily from southern england where tenants and wage laborers farmed large manors they copied that hierarchical system by buying english indentured servants and enslaved africans to work their lands.
at about the same time the switch to sugar production in barbados caused the price of land there to quadruple driving small landowners out.
for rich and poor alike life in the plantation colonies of north america and the caribbean was harsh.
the scarcity of towns deprived settlers of community map 2 4.
families were equally scarce because there were few women and marriages often ended with the early death of a spouse.
pregnant women were especially vulnerable to malaria spread by mosquitoes that flourished in tropical and subtropical climates.
many mothers died after bearing a first or second child so orphaned children along with unmarried young men formed a large segment of the society.
sixty percent of the children born in middlesex county virginia before 1680 lost one or both parents before they were thirteen.
death was pervasive.
although 15 000 english migrants arrived in virginia between 1622 and 1640 the population rose only from 2 000 to 8 000.
it was even harsher in the islands where yellow fever epidemics killed indiscriminately.
on barbados burials outnumbered baptisms in the second half of the seventeenth century by four to one.
indentured servitude still the prospect of owning land continued to lure settlers.
by 1700 more than 100 000 english migrants had come to virginia and maryland and over 200 000 had migrated to the islands of the west indies principally to barbados the vast majority to both destinations traveled as indentured servants figure 2 2.
shipping registers from the english port of bristol reveal the backgrounds of 5 000 servants embarking for the chesapeake.
three quarters were young men.
they came to bristol searching for work once there merchants persuaded them to sign contracts to labor in america.
indentured servitude contracts bound the men and the quarter who were women to work for a master for four or five years after which they would be free to marry and work for themselves.
for merchants servants were valuable cargo their contracts fetched high prices from chesapeake and west indian planters.

from their riverfront plantations wealthy planter merchants could easily load heavy hogsheads of tobacco onto oceangoing ships and offload supplies that they then sold to smallholding planters.
consequently few substantial towns or trading centers developed in the chesapeake region.

as more women migrated to virginia and maryland and bore children the percentage of the population who worked in the fields daily fell dramatically from 75 percent to 46 percent.
the proportion of indentured servants in the labor force likewise declined from 30 percent to 10 percent.
voyage and their first year in a harsh new disease environment a process called seasoning during the chesapeakes tobacco boom a male servant could produce five times his purchase price in a single year.
to maximize their gains many masters ruthlessly exploited servants forcing them to work long hours beating them without cause and withholding permission to marry.
if servants ran away or became pregnant masters went to court to increase the term of their service.
female servants were especially vulnerable to abuse.
a virginia law of 1692 stated that dissolute masters have gotten their maids with child and yet claim the benefit of their service planters got rid of uncooperative servants by selling their contracts.
in virginia an englishman remarked in disgust that servants were sold up and down like horses few indentured servants escaped poverty.
in the chesapeake half the men died before completing the term of their contract and another quarter remained landless.
only one quarter achieved their quest for property and respectability.
female servants generally fared better.
because men had grown very sensible of the misfortune of wanting wives many propertied planters married female servants.
thus a few very american experiments 1521 1700 fortunate men and women escaped a life of landless poverty.
african laborers the rigors of indentured servitude paled before the brutality that accompanied the large scale shift to african slave labor.
in barbados and the other english islands sugar production devoured laborers and the supply of indentured servants quickly compare and became inadequate to planters contrast needs.

the first comprehensive slave legislation for the island adopted in 1661 was called an act for the better ordering and governing of negroes in the chesapeake the shift to slave labor was more gradual.
in 1619 john rolfe noted that a dutch man of warre.
sold us twenty negars slaves originally shipped by the portuguese from the port of luanda in angola.
for a generation the number of africans remained small.
about 400 africans lived in the chesapeake colonies in 1649 just 2 percent of the population.
by 1670 that figure had reached 5 percent.
most africans served their english masters for life.
however since english common law did not acknowledge chattel slavery it was possible for some africans to escape bondage.
some were freed as a result of christian baptism some purchased their freedom from their owners some like elizabeth key whose story was related at the beginning of the chapter won their freedom in the courts.
once free some ambitious africans became landowners and purchased slaves or the labor contracts of english servants for themselves.
social mobility for africans ended in the 1660s with the collapse of the tobacco boom and the increasing political power of the gentry.
tobacco had once sold for 30 pence a pound now it fetched less than onetenth of that.
the low price of tobacco requires it should bee made as cheap as possible declared virginia planter politician nicholas spencer and blacks can make it cheaper than whites as they imported more african workers the english born political elite grew more race conscious.
increasingly spencer and other leading legislators distinguished english from african residents by color white black rather than by religion christian pagan.
by 1671 the virginia house of burgesses had forbidden africans to part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 own guns or join the militia.
it also barred them tho baptized and enjoying their own freedom from owning english servants.
being black was increasingly a mark of inferior legal status and slavery was fast becoming a permanent and hereditary condition.
as an english clergyman observed these two words negro and slave had by custom grown homogeneous and convertible neo european colonies while mesoamerica and the andes emerged at the heart of a tribute based empire in latin america and tropical and subtropical environments were transformed into plantation societies a series of colonies that more closely replicated european patterns of economic and social organization developed in the temperate zone along north americas atlantic coast america compared opposite page.
dutch french and english sailors probed the continents northern coastline initially searching for a northwest passage through the continent to asia.
gradually they developed an interest in the region on its own terms.
they traded for furs with coastal native american populations fished for cod on the grand banks off the coast of newfoundland and established freehold family farms and larger manors where they reproduced european patterns of agricultural life.
many migrants also came with aspirations to create godly communities places of refuge where they could put religious ideals into practice.
new france new netherland and new england were the three pillars of neo european colonization in the early seventeenth century.
new france in the 1530s jacques cartier ventured up the st lawrence river and claimed it for france.
cartiers claim to the st lawrence languished for three quarters of a century but in 1608 samuel de champlain returned and founded the fur trading post of quebec.
trade with the cree speaking montagnais algonquianspeaking micmacs ottawas and ojibwas and iroquois speaking hurons gave the french access to furs mink otter and beaver that were in great demand in europe.
to secure plush beaver pelts from the hurons who controlled trade north of the great lakes champlain provided them with manufactured goods.
selling pelts an indian told a french priest makes kettles hatchets swords knives bread it also made guns which champlain sold to the hurons.
the hurons also became the first focus of french catholic missionary activity.
hundreds of priests most of them jesuits fanned out to live in indian communities.
they mastered indian languages and came to understand and sometimes respect their values.
many indian peoples initially welcomed the french black robes as spiritually powerful beings but when prayers to the christian god did not protect them from disease the indians grew skeptical.
a peoria chief charged that a priests fables are good only in his own country we have our own beliefs which do not make us die as his do when a drought struck indians blamed the missionaries.
if you cannot make rain they speak of nothing less than making away with you lamented one jesuit.
while new france became an expansive center of fur trading and missionary work it languished as a the fur trade luxuriant pelts like ermine and silver fox were always desirable but the humble beaver dominated the early trade between europeans and indians in the northeast.
it had thick coarse hair but beneath that outer layer was soft underfur those fine hairs were covered in microscopic barbs that allowed them to mat into a dense mass.

america c o m pa r e d plantation colonies versus neo europes the prospects for europeans who traveled to tropical plantations like barbados differed dramatically from those traveling to neo european colonies like massachusetts bay.
in the former planters employed small armies of servants and slaves in the latter the first generation of colonists worked hard often in cold climates and rocky soils to eke out a living.

william wood new englands prospect 1634 but it may be objected that it is too cold a country for our english men who have been accustomed to a warmer climate.
to which it may be answered.
there is wood farming settlement.
in 1662 king louis xiv r 1643 1714 turned new france into a royal colony and subsidized the migration of indentured servants.
french servants labored under contract for three years received a salary and could eventually lease a farm far more generous terms than those for indentured servants in the english colonies.
nonetheless few people moved to new france a cold and forbidding country at the end of the world as one migrant put it.
and some state policies good store and better cheap to build warm houses and make good fires which makes the winter less tedious.
t rue it is that some venturing too nakedly in extremity of cold being more foolhardy than wise have for a time lost the use of their feet others the use of their fingers but time and surgery afterwards recovered them.
some have had their overgrown beards so frozen together that they could not get their strong water bottles into their mouths.
w hereas many do disparage the land saying a man cannot live without labor in that they more disparage and discredit themselves in giving the world occasion to take notice of their dronish disposition that would live off the sweat of another mans brows.

questions for analysis 1.
henry whistler was a soldier who briefly visited barbados on a military expedition to the west indies while william wood lived for four years in massachusetts bay.
how might that difference influence the tone of these two descriptions.
what core values does each author ascribe to the colony he writes about.
what kinds of people are most likely to end up in each of these two colonies.
discouraged migration.
louis xiv drafted tens of thousands of men into military service and barred huguenots french calvinist protestants from migrating to new france fearing they might win converts and take control of the colony.
moreover the french legal system gave peasants strong rights to their village lands whereas migrants to new france faced an oppressive aristocracy and church dominated feudal system.
in the village of saint ours in quebec for example peasants paid 45 percent of their wheat crop part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 to nobles and the catholic church.
by 1698 only 15 200 europeans lived in new france compared to 100 000 in englands north american colonies.
despite this small population france eventually claimed a vast inland arc from the st lawrence valley through the great lakes and down the course of the ohio and mississippi rivers.
explorers and fur traders drove this expansion.
in 1673 jacques marquette reached the mississippi river in present day wisconsin then in 1681 robert de la salle traveled down the majestic river to the gulf of mexico.
to honor louis xiv la salle named the region louisiana.
by 1718 french merchants had founded the port of new orleans at the mouth of the mississippi.
eventually a network of about two dozen forts grew up in the great lakes and mississippi.
soldiers and missionaries used them as bases of operations while indians traders and their mtis mixed race offspring created trading communities alongside them.
new netherland by 1600 amsterdam had become the financial and commercial hub of northern europe and dutch financiers dominated the european banking insurance and textile industries.
dutch merchants owned more ships and employed more sailors than did the combined fleets of england france and spain.
indeed the dutch managed much of the worlds commerce.
during their struggle for independence from spain and portugal ruled by spanish monarchs 1580 1640 the dutch seized portuguese forts in africa and indonesia and sugar plantations in brazil.
these conquests gave the dutch control of the atlantic trade in slaves and sugar and the indian ocean commerce in east indian spices and chinese silks and ceramics map 2 5.
in 1609 dutch merchants dispatched the english mariner henry hudson to locate a navigable route to the riches of the east indies.
what he found as he probed the rivers of northeast america was a fur bonanza.
following hudsons exploration of the river that now bears his name the merchants built fort orange albany in 1614 to trade for furs with the munsee and iroquois indians.
then in 1621 the dutch government chartered the west india company which founded the colony of new netherland set up new amsterdam on manhattan island as its capital and brought in farmers and artisans to make the enterprise self sustaining.
the new colony did not thrive.
the population of the dutch republic was too small to support much emigration just 1 5 million people compared to 5 million in britain and 20 million in france and its migrants sought riches in southeast asia rather than fur trading profits in america.
to protect its colony from rival european nations the west india company granted huge estates along the hudson river to wealthy dutchmen who promised to populate them.
but by 1664 new netherland had only 5 000 residents and fewer than half of them were dutch.
new amsterdam c 1640 as the wooden palisade suggests new amsterdam was a fortlike trading post at the edge of a vast land populated by alien indian peoples feared by the dutch.
the city was also a pale miniature imitation of amsterdam with its many canals.
the first settlers built their houses in the dutch style with gable ends facing the street note the two middle houses and excavated a canal across lower manhattan island new york citys canal street today.

they also created two new trading connections.
the south atlantic system carried slaves sugar and manufactured goods between europe africa and the valuable plantation settlements in brazil and the caribbean islands.

to trace long term changes in trade and empires see map 1 4 on p 24 and map 5 1 on p.
like new france new netherland flourished as a fur trading enterprise.
trade with the powerful iroquois though rocky at first gradually improved.
but dutch settlers had less respect for their algonquian speaking neighbors.
they seized prime farming land from the algonquian peoples and took over their trading network which exchanged corn and wampum from long island for furs from maine.
in response in 1643 the algonquians launched attacks that nearly destroyed the colony.
almost every place is abandoned a settler lamented whilst the indians daily threaten to overwhelm us to defeat the algonquians the dutch waged vicious warfare maiming burning and killing hundreds of men women and children and formed an alliance with the mohawks who were no less brutal.
the grim progression of euro indian relations an uneasy welcome followed by rising tensions and war afflicted even the dutch who had few designs on indian lands or on their unregenerate souls and were only looking to do business.

consequently the residents of new netherland offered little resistance when england invaded the colony in part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 1664.
new netherland became new york and fell under english control.
the rise of the iroquois like other native groups decimated by european diseases and warfare the five nations of the iroquois suffered as a result of colonization but they were able to capitalize on their strategic location in central new york to dominate the region between the french and dutch colonies.
obtaining guns and goods from dutch merchants at fort orange iroquois warriors inflicted terror on their neighbors.
partly in response to a virulent smallpox epidemic in 1633 which cut their number by one third the iroquois waged a series of devastating wars against the hurons 1649 neutrals 1651 eries 1657 and susquehannocks 1660 all iroquoian speaking peoples.
they razed villages killing many residents and taking many more captive.
the conquered hurons ceased to exist as a distinct people survivors trekked westward with displaced algonquian peoples and formed a new nation the wyandots.
iroquois warriors pressed still farther eastward into new england south to the carolinas north to quebec and west via the great lakes to the mississippi dominating indian groups along the way.
collectively known as the beaver wars these iroquois campaigns dramatically altered the map of northeastern north america.
many iroquois raids came at the expense of frenchallied algonquian indians and in the 1660s new france committed to all out war against the iroquois.
in 1667 the mohawks were the last of the five nations to admit defeat.
as part of the peace settlement the five nations accepted jesuit missionaries into their communities.
a minority of iroquois perhaps 20 percent of the population converted to catholicism and moved to the st lawrence valley where they settled in mission communities near montreal where their descendants still live today.
the iroquois who remained in new york did not collapse however.
forging a new alliance with the englishmen who had taken over new netherland they would continue to be a dominant force in the politics of the northeast for generations to come.
new england in 1620 102 english protestants landed at a place they called plymouth near cape cod.
a decade later a much larger group began to arrive just north of plymouth in the newly chartered massachusetts bay colony.
by 1640 the region had attracted more than 20 000 migrants map 2 6.
unlike the early arrivals in virginia and barbados these were not parties of young male adventurers seeking their fortunes or bound to labor for someone else.
they came in family groups to create communities like the ones they left behind except that they intended to establish them according to protestant principles as john calvin had done in geneva.
their numbers were small compared to the caribbean and the chesapeake but their balanced sex ratio and organized approach to community formation allowed them to multiply quickly.
by distributing land broadly they built a society of independent farm families.
and by establishing a holy commonwealth they gave a moral dimension to american history that survives today.
the pilgrims the pilgrims were religious separatists puritans who had left the church of england.
when king james i threatened to drive puritans out of the land or else do worse some puritans chose to live among dutch calvinists in holland.
subsequently 35 of these exiles resolved to maintain their english identity by moving to america.
led by william bradford and joined by 67 migrants from england the pilgrims sailed to america aboard the mayflower.
because they lacked a royal charter they combined themselves together into a civill body politick as their leader explained.
this mayflower compact used the puritans self governing religious congregation as the model for their political structure.
only half of the first migrant group survived until spring but thereafter plymouth thrived the cold climate inhibited the spread of mosquito borne disease and the pilgrims religious discipline encouraged a strong work ethic.
moreover a smallpox epidemic in 1618 devastated the local wampanoags minimizing the danger they posed.
by 1640 there were 3 000 settlers in plymouth.
to ensure political stability they established representative self government broad political rights property ownership and religious freedom of conscience.
meanwhile england plunged deeper into religious turmoil.
when king charles i repudiated certain protestant doctrines including the role of grace in salvation english puritans now powerful in parliament accused the king of popery of holding catholic beliefs.
in 1629 charles dissolved parliament claimed the authority to rule by divine right and raised money through royal edicts and the sale of monopolies.

about half traveled to the new england colonies of plymouth massachusetts bay and connecticut where they created durable societies with deep religious identities.
migrants from the three major centers of puritanism in england yorkshire east anglia and the west country commonly settled among those from their own region.
often they named american communities after their english towns of origin and tried to live as they had in old england.
for example settlers from rowley in yorkshire transplanted their customary system of open field agriculture to rowley in massachusetts bay.
puritans protestants who did not separate from the church of england but hoped to purify it of its ceremony and hierarchy fled to america.
john winthrop and massachusetts bay the puritan exodus began in 1630 with the departure of 900 migrants led by john winthrop a well educated country squire who became the first governor of the massachusetts bay colony.
calling england morally corrupt and overburdened with people winthrop sought land for his children and a place in christian history for his people.
we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill winthrop told the migrants.
the eyes of all people are upon us like the pilgrims to see a longer excerpt of winthrops city upon a hill sermon along with other primary sources from this period see sources for americas history.
part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 the puritans envisioned a reformed christian society with authority in magistrates liberty in people purity in the church as minister john cotton put it.
by their example they hoped to inspire religious reform throughout christendom.
winthrop and his associates governed the massachusetts bay colony from the town of boston.
they transformed their joint stock corporation a commercial agreement that allows investors to pool their resources into a representative political system with a governor council and assembly.
to ensure rule by the compare and godly the puritans limited the contrast right to vote and hold office to what made new england different from new france men who were church memand new netherland.
rejecting the plymouth colonys policy of religious tolerance the massachusetts bay colony established puritanism as the state supported religion barred other faiths from conducting services and used the bible as a legal guide.
where there is no law they said magistrates should rule as near the law of god as they can over the next decade about 10 000 puritans migrated to the colony along with 10 000 others fleeing hard times in england.
the new england puritans sought to emulate the simplicity of the first christians.
seeing bishops as traitours unto god they placed power in the congregation of members hence the name congregationalist for their churches.
inspired by john calvin many puritans embraced predestination the idea that god saved only a few chosen people.
church members often lived in great anxiety worried that god had not placed them among the elect some hoped for a conversion experience the intense sensation of receiving gods grace and being born again other puritans relied on preparation the confidence in salvation that came from spiritual guidance by their ministers.
still others believed that they were gods chosen people the new israelites and would be saved if they obeyed his laws.
roger williams and rhode island to maintain gods favor the massachusetts bay magistrates purged their society of religious dissidents.
one target was roger williams the puritan minister in salem a coastal town north of boston.
williams opposed the decision to establish an official religion and praised the pilgrims separation of church and state.
he advocated toleration arguing that political magistrates had authority over only the bodies goods and outward estates of men not their spiritual lives.
williams also questioned the puritans seizure of indian lands.
the magistrates banished him from the colony in 1636.
williams and his followers settled 50 miles south of boston founding the town of providence on land purchased from the narragansett indians.
other religious dissidents settled nearby at portsmouth and newport.
in 1644 these settlers obtained a corporate charter from parliament for a new colony rhode island with full authority to rule themselves.
in rhode island as in plymouth there was no legally established church and individuals could worship god as they pleased.
anne hutchinson the massachusetts bay magistrates saw a second threat to their authority in anne hutchinson.
the wife of a merchant and mother of seven hutchinson held weekly prayer meetings for women and accused various boston clergymen of placing undue emphasis on good behavior.
like martin luther hutchinson denied that salvation could be earned through good deeds.
there was no covenant of works that would save the well behaved only a covenant of grace through which god saved those he predestined for salvation.
hutchinson likewise declared that god revealed divine truth directly to individual believers a controversial doctrine that the puritan magistrates denounced as heretical.
the magistrates also resented hutchinson because of her sex.
like other christians puritans believed that both men and women could be saved.
but gender equality stopped there.
women were inferior to men in earthly affairs said leading puritan divines who told married women thy desires shall bee subject to thy husband and he shall rule over thee puritan women could not be ministers or lay preachers nor could they vote in church affairs.
in 1637 the magistrates accused hutchinson of teaching that inward grace freed an individual from the rules of the church and found her guilty of holding heretical views.
banished she followed roger williams into exile in rhode island.
other puritan groups moved out from massachusetts bay in the 1630s and settled on or near the connecticut river.
for several decades the colonies of connecticut new haven and saybrook were independent of one another in 1660 they secured a charter from king charles ii r 1660 1685 for the selfgoverning colony of connecticut.
like massachusetts bay connecticut had a legally established church and an elected governor and assembly however it granted voting rights to most property owning men not just to church members as in the original puritan colony.
chapter 2 the puritan revolution in england meanwhile a religious civil war engulfed england.
archbishop laud had imposed the church of england prayer book on presbyterian scotland in 1637 five years later a rebel scottish army invaded england.
thousands of english puritans and hundreds of american puritans joined the scots demanding religious reform and parliamentary power.
after years of civil war parliamentary forces led by oliver cromwell emerged victorious.
in 1649 parliament beheaded king charles i proclaimed a republican commonwealth and banished bishops and elaborate rituals from the church of england.
the protestant almanack 1700 the conflict between protestants and catholics took many forms.
to reinforce the religious identity of english protestants a writer using the pseudonym philopretes published this almanac that charted not only the passage of the seasons and the influence of the pagan signs of the zodiack but also the pernicious revolutions of the papacy against the lord and his anointed cambridge university library.
american experiments 1521 1700 the puritan triumph in england was short lived.
popular support for the commonwealth ebbed after cromwell took dictatorial control in 1653.
following his death in 1658 moderate protestants and a resurgent aristocracy restored the monarchy and the hierarchy of bishops.
with charles ii r 1660 1685 on the throne englands experiment in radical protestant government came to an end.
for the puritans in america the restoration of the monarchy began a new phase of their errand into the wilderness they had come to new england expecting to return to europe in triumph.
when the failure of the english revolution dashed that sacred mission ministers exhorted congregations to create a godly republican society in america.
the puritan colonies now stood as outposts of calvinism and the atlantic republican tradition.
puritanism and witchcraft like native americans puritans believed that the physical world was full of supernatural forces.
devout christians saw signs of gods or satans power in blazing stars birth defects and other unusual events.
noting after a storm that the houses of many ministers had been smitten with lightning cotton mather a prominent puritan theologian wondered what the meaning of god should be in it puritans were hostile toward people who they believed tried to manipulate these forces and many were willing to condemn neighbors as satans wizards or witches people in the town of andover were much addicted to sorcery claimed one observer and there were forty men in it that could raise the devil as well as any astrologer between 1647 and 1662 civil authorities in new england hanged fourteen people for witchcraft most of them older women accused of being double tongued or of having an unruly spirit the most dramatic episode of witch hunting occurred in salem in 1692.
several girls who had experienced strange seizures accused neighbors of bewitching them.
when judges at the accused witches trials allowed the use of spectral evidence visions of evil beings and marks seen only by the girls the accusations spun out of control.
eventually massachusetts bay authorities tried 175 people for witchcraft and executed 19 of them.
the causes of this mass hysteria were complex and are still debated.
some historians point to group rivalries many accusers were the daughters or servants of poor farmers whereas many of the alleged witches were wealthier church members or their friends.
because 18 of those put to death were women other historians see the episode as part of a broader part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 puritan effort to subordinate women.
still others focus on political instability in massachusetts bay in the early 1690s and on fears raised by recent indian attacks in nearby maine which had killed the parents of some of the young accusers.
it is likely that all of these causes played some role in the executions.
whatever the cause the salem episode marked a major turning point.
shaken by the number of deaths government officials now discouraged legal prosecutions for witchcraft.
moreover many influential people embraced the outlook of the european enlightenment a major intellectual movement that began around 1675 and promoted a rational scientific view of the world.
increasingly educated men and women explained strange happenings and sudden deaths by reference to natural causes not witchcraft.
unlike cotton mather 1663 1728 who believed that lightning was a supernatural sign benjamin franklin 1706 1790 and other well read men of his generation would investigate it as a natural phenomenon.
a yeoman society 1630 1700 in building their communities new england puritans consciously rejected the feudal practices of english society.
many puritans came from middling families in east anglia a region of pasture lands and few manors and had no desire to live as tenants of wealthy aristocrats or submit to oppressive taxation by a distant government.
they had escaped out of the pollutions of the world the settlers of watertown in massachusetts bay declared and vowed to live close togither in self governing communities.
accordingly the general courts of massachusetts bay and connecticut bestowed land on groups of settlers who then distributed it among the male heads of families.
widespread ownership of land did not mean equality of wealth or status.
god had ordained different degrees and orders of men proclaimed boston merchant john saffin some to be masters and commanders others to be subjects and to be commanded town proprietors normally awarded the largest plots to men of high social status who often became selectmen and justices of the peace.
however all families received some land and most adult men had a vote in the town meeting the main institution of local government map 2 7.
in this society of independent households and selfgoverning communities ordinary farmers had much more political power than chesapeake yeomen and european peasants did.
although nathaniel fish was one of the poorest men in the town of barnstable he owned just a two room cottage 8 acres of land an ox and a cow he was a voting member of the town meeting.
each year fish and other barnstable farmers levied taxes enacted ordinances governing fencing roadbuilding and the use of common fields and chose the mason children this 1670 portrait of david joanna and abigail mason by an unknown painter illustrates the growing prosperity of well to do boston households.
all three wear white linen edged with fine lace and expensive ribbons.
eight year old david is dressed like a gentleman his slashed sleeves kid gloves and silvertipped walking stick represent the height of english fashion.
puritans with their plain style were uneasy about such finery.
as minister samuel torrey complained a spirit of worldliness a spirit of sensuality was gaining strength in the younger generation.

map 2 7 settlement patterns in new england towns 1630 1700 throughout new england colonists pressed onto desirable indian lands.
initially most puritan towns were compact families lived close to one another in village centers and traveled daily to work in the surrounding fields.
this 1640 map of wethersfield connecticut a town situated on the broad plains of the connecticut river valley shows this pattern clearly.
the first settlers in andover massachusetts also chose to live in the village center.
however the rugged topography of eastern massachusetts encouraged the townspeople to disperse.

instability war and rebellion everywhere in the colonies conflicts arose over the control of resources the legitimacy of colonial leaders claims to power and attempts to define social and cultural norms.
periodically these conflicts flared spectacularly into episodes of violence.
each episode has its own story its own unique logic and narrative but taken together they also illustrate the way that in their formative stages colonial societies pressured people to accept new patterns of authority and new claims to power.
when these claims were contested the results could quickly turn deadly.
new englands indian wars relations between colonists and indians in early new england were bewilderingly complex.
many rival indian groups lived there before europeans arrived by the 1630s these groups were bordered by the dutch colony of new netherland to their west and the various english settlements to the east plymouth massachusetts bay rhode island connecticut new haven and saybrook.
the regions indian leaders created various alliances for the purposes of trade and defense wampanoags with plymouth mohegans with massachusetts and connecticut pequots with new netherland narragansetts with rhode island.
puritan pequot war because of their alliance with the dutch the pequots became a thorn in the side of english traders.
a series of violent encounters began in july 1636 with the killing of english trader john oldham and escalated until may 1637 when a combined force of massachusetts and connecticut the hurons feast of the dead hurons buried their dead in temporary raised tombs so they could easily care for their spirits.
when they moved their villages in search of fertile soil and better hunting the hurons held a feast of the dead and reburied the bones of their own deceased and often bones from other villages in a common pit lined with beaver robes.
this solemn ceremony united living as well as dead clan members strengthening the bonds of the huron confederacy.
it also was believed to release the spirits of the dead allowing them to travel to the land where the first huron aataentsic fell from the sky made earth and man and lived with her son and assistant iouskeha.

in the months that followed the new englanders drove the surviving pequots into oblivion and divided their lands.
believing they were gods chosen people puritans considered their presence to be divinely ordained.
initially they pondered the morality of acquiring native american lands.
by what right or warrant can we enter into the land of the savages they asked themselves.
responding to such concerns john winthrop detected gods hand in a recent smallpox epidemic if god were not pleased with our inheriting these parts he asked why doth he still make roome for us by diminishing them as we increase experiences like the pequot war confirmed new englanders confidence in their enterprise.
god laughed at the enemies of his people one soldier boasted after the 1637 massacre filling the place with dead bodies like catholic missionaries puritans believed that their church should embrace all peoples.
however their strong emphasis on predestination the idea that god saved only a few chosen people made it hard for them to accept that indians could be counted among the elect.
probably the devil delivered these miserable savages to america cotton mather suggested in hopes that the gospel of the lord jesus christ would never come here a few puritan ministers committed themselves to the effort to convert indians.
on marthas vineyard jonathan mayhew helped to create an indian led community of wampanoag christians.

metacoms war 1675 1676 by the 1670s europeans in new england outnumbered indians by three to one.
the english population had multiplied to 55 000 while native peoples had diminished from an estimated 120 000 in 1570 to barely 16 000.
to the wampanoag leader metacom also known as king philip the prospects for coexistence looked dim.
when his people copied english ways by raising hogs and selling pork in boston puritan officials accused them of selling at an under rate and restricted their trade.
when indians killed wandering hogs that devastated their cornfields authorities prosecuted them for violating english property rights american voices p 68.

was that the case.
we have no firsthand indian accounts of its origins but three english accounts offer different versions of events.
given the variation among the accounts and their fragmentary character how can historians reconstruct what really happened.
john easton a relacion of the indyan warre john easton was the deputy governor of rhode island and a quaker.
like many quakers easton was a pacifist and tried to prevent the war.
he wrote this relacion shortly after the conflict ended.
in january 1675 an indian was found dead and by a coroner inquest of plymouth colony judged murdered.
the dead indian was called sassamon and a christian that could read and write.
the report came that.
three indians had confessed and accused philip of employing them to kill sassamon and that consequently.
the english would hang philip.
so the indians were afraid and reported that.
philip believed that the english.
might kill him to have his land.
so philip kept his men in arms.
plymouth governor josiah winslow required him to disband his men and informed him his jealousy his worry about land seizure was false.
philip answered he would do no harm and thanked the governor for his information.
the three indians were hung on june 8 1675.
and it was reported that sassamon before his death had informed the english of the indian plot and that if the indians knew it they would kill him and that the heathen might destroy the english for their wickedness as god had permitted the heathen to destroy the israelites of old.
so the english were afraid and philip was afraid and both increased in arms but for forty years time reports and jealousies of war had been very frequent that we did not think that now a war was breaking forth.
but about a week before it did we had cause to think it would then to endeavor to prevent it we sent a man to philip.
he called his council and agreed to come to us philip came himself unarmed and about forty of his men armed.
then five of us went over to speak to the indians.
three were magistrates.
we sat very friendly together june 14 18.
we told him our business was to endeavor that they might not.
they said that was well they had done no wrong the english wronged them.
we said we knew the english said that the indians wronged them and the indians said the english wronged them but our desire was the quarrel might rightly be decided in the best way and not as dogs decide their quarrels.
the indians owned that fighting was the worst way then they propounded how right might take place we said by arbitration.
they said all english agreed against them and so by arbitration they had had much wrong many square miles of land so taken from them for the english would have english arbitrators.
another grievance of the indians the english cattle and horses still increased and that.
they could not keep their corn from being spoiled by the english livestock.
so we departed without any discourtesies and suddenly c june 25 had a letter from the plymouth governor that they intended in arms to subjugate philip.
and in a weeks time after we had been with the indians the war thus begun.

his short narrative written in 1675 was a report to his superiors in london.
various are the reports and conjectures of the causes of the present indian war.
some impute it to an impudent zeal in the magistrates of boston to christianize those heathen before they were civilized and enjoining them the strict observation of their laws which to a people so rude and licentious hath proved even intolerable.
while the magistrates for their profit put the laws severely in execution against the indians the people on the other side for lucre and gain entice and provoke the indians.

some believe there have been vagrant and jesuitical french priests who have made it their business for some years past to go from sachem to sachem chief to chief to exasperate the indians against the english and to bring them into a confederacy and that they were promised supplies from france and other parts to extirpate the english nation out of the continent of america.
others impute the cause to some injuries offered to the sachem philip for he being possessed of a tract of land called mount hope.
some english had a mind to dispossess him thereof who never wanting one pretence or other to attain their end complained of injuries done by philip and his indians to their stock and cattle whereupon philip was often summoned before the magistrate sometimes imprisoned and never released but upon parting with a considerable part of his land.

the rumor of a war between the english and the natives gave a check to his projects.
philip according to his promise to his people permitted them to march out of the neck of the mount hope peninsula part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 massachusetts and rhode island and killed 1 000 settlers nearly 5 percent of the adult population for a time the puritan experiment hung in the balance.
but the natives losses from famine and disease death in battle and sale into slavery were much larger about 4 500 indians died one quarter of an already diminished population.
many of the surviving wampanoag narragansett and nipmuck peoples moved west intermarrying with algonquian tribes allied to the french.
over the next century these displaced indian peoples would take their revenge joining with french catholics to attack their puritan enemies.
metacoms war did not eliminate the presence of native americans in southern new england but it effectively destroyed their existence as independent peoples.
bacons rebellion at the same time that new england fought its war with metacom virginia was wracked by a rebellion that nearly toppled its government.
it too grew out of a conflict with neighboring indians but this one inspired a popular uprising against the colonys royal governor.
like metacoms war it highlighted the way that a landintensive settler colony created friction with native american populations in addition it dramatized the way that ordinary colonists could challenge the right of a new planter elite to rule over them.
by the 1670s economic and political power in virginia was in the hands of a small circle of men who amassed land slaves and political offices.
through headrights and royal grants they controlled nearly half of all the settled land in virginia what they could not plant themselves they leased to tenants.
freed indentured servants found it ever harder to get land of their own many were forced to lease lands or even sign new indentures to make ends meet.
to make matters worse the price of tobacco fell until planters received only a penny a pound for their crops in the 1670s.
at the top of virginias narrow social pyramid was william berkeley governor between 1642 and 1652 and again after 1660.
to consolidate power berkeley bestowed large land grants on members of his council.
the councilors exempted these lands from taxation and appointed friends as justices of the peace and county judges.
to win support in the house of burgesses berkeley bought off legislators with land grants and lucrative appointments as sheriffs and tax collectors.
but social unrest erupted when the burgesses took the vote away from landless freemen who by now constituted half the adult white men.
although property holding yeomen retained their voting rights they were angered by falling tobacco prices political corruption and grievous taxations that threatened the utter ruin of us the poor commonalty berkeley and his allies were living on borrowed time.
frontier war an indian conflict ignited the flame of social rebellion.
in 1607 when the english intruded 30 000 native americans resided in virginia by 1675 the native population had dwindled to only 3 500.
by then europeans numbered some 38 000 and africans another 2 500.
most indians lived on treaty guaranteed territory along the frontier where poor freeholders and landless former servants now wanted to settle demanding that the natives be expelled or exterminated.
their demands were ignored by wealthy planters who wanted a ready supply of tenants and laborers and by governor berkeley and the planter merchants who traded with the occaneechee indians for beaver pelts and deerskins.
fighting broke out late in 1675 when a vigilante band of virginia militiamen murdered thirty indians.
defying berkeleys orders a larger force then surrounded a fortified susquehannock village and killed five leaders who came out to negotiate.
the susquehannocks retaliated by attacking outlying plantations and killing three hundred whites.
in response berkeley proposed a defensive strategy a series of frontier forts to deter indian intrusions.
the settlers dismissed this scheme as a militarily useless plot by planter merchants to impose high taxes and take all our tobacco into their own hands challenging the government enter nathaniel bacon a young well connected migrant from england who emerged as the leader of the rebels.
bacon held a position on the governors council but he was shut out of berkeleys inner circle and differed with berkeley on indian policy.
when the governor refused to grant him a military commission bacon mobilized his neighbors and attacked any indians he could find.
condemning the frontiersmen as rebels and mutineers berkeley expelled bacon from the council and had him arrested.
but bacons army forced the governor to release their leader and hold legislative elections.
the newly elected house of burgesses enacted far reaching reforms that curbed the powers of the governor and council and restored voting rights to landless freemen.
these much needed reforms came too late.
poor farmers and servants resented years of exploitation by wealthy planters arrogant justices of the peace and chapter 2 american experiments 1521 1700 power and sway is got into the hands of the rich bacon proclaimed as his army burned jamestown to the ground and plundered the plantations of berkeleys allies.
when bacon died suddenly of dysentery in october 1676 the governor took revenge dispersing the rebel army seizing the estates of well to do rebels and hanging 23 men.
in the wake of bacons rebellion virginias leaders worked harder to appease their humble neighbors.
but the rebellion also coincided with the time when virginia planters were switching from indentured servants place events who became free after four in context years to slaves who labored for in what ways was bacons life.
in the eighteenth century rebellion symptomatic wealthy planters would make of social tensions in the common cause with poorer colony of virginia.
whites while slaves became the colonys most exploited workers.
that fateful change eased tensions within the free population but committed subsequent generations of americans to a labor system based on racial exploitation.
bacons rebellion like metacoms war reminds us that these colonies were unfinished worlds still searching for viable foundations.
summary nathaniel bacon condemned as a rebel and a traitor in his own time nathaniel bacon emerged in the late nineteenth century as a southern hero a harbinger of the confederate rebels of 1860 1865.
the association for the preservation of virginia antiquities founded in 1888 commissioned this stained glass window depicting bacon in dual guises of a well dressed gentleman and a rebel in body armor.
installing bacons portrait in a window of the powder magazine in williamsburg built by governor alexander spotswood in 1715 explained a leading member of the association would connect present virginia with her great and noble past and commemorate those who shed their blood for virginia and the south preservation virginia.
wicked pernicious counsellors as one yeoman rebel complained a poor man who has only his labour to maintain himself and his family pays as much in taxes as a man who has 20 000 acres backed by 400 armed men bacon issued a manifesto and declaration of the people that demanded the removal of indians and an end to the rule of wealthy parasites all the during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries three types of colonies took shape in the americas.
in mesoamerica and the andes spanish colonists made indigenous empires their own capitalizing on preexisting labor systems and using tribute and the discovery of precious metals to generate enormous wealth which philip ii used to defend the interests of the catholic church in europe.
in tropical and subtropical regions colonizers transferred the plantation complex a centuries old form of production and labor discipline to places suited to growing exotic crops like sugar tobacco and indigo.
the rigors of plantation agriculture demanded a large supply of labor which was first filled in english colonies by indentured servitude and later supplemented and eclipsed by african slavery.
the third type of colony neo european settlement developed in north americas temperate zone where european migrants adapted familiar systems of social and economic organization in new settings.
everywhere in the americas colonization was first and foremost a process of experimentation.
as resources part 1 transformations of north america 1450 1700 from the americas flowed to europe monarchies were strengthened and the competition among them sharpened by the schism between protestants and catholics gained new force and energy.
establishing colonies demanded political social and cultural innovations that threw europeans native americans and africans together in bewildering circumstances triggered massive ecological change through the c h a p t e r columbian exchange and demanded radical adjustments.

these external and internal crises were products of the struggle to adapt to the rigors of colonization.
