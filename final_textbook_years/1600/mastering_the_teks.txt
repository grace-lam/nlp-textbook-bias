these technological improvements in navigation made it possible for europeans to sail farther than ever before.
european sailors began to use the suns angle to determine their location allowing them to judge distances.
these innovations allowed them to sail into the open ocean instead of hugging the coastline.
exploration was fanned by the renaissance spirit of inquiry and a desire to find an all water route to the east.
in portugal prince henry the navigator 1394 1460 sponsored the exploration of the atlantic coast of africa by portuguese sailors.

chapter 5 european exploration and colonization 49 acting as an amateur historian captain john smith recorded what he later learned in his history of the colony the generali historie of virginia published in 1624.
these miserable and poor creatures were kept alive for the most part by roots herbs acorns walnuts berries and fish even the skins of horses.
so great was our famine that when an indian was killed and buried the poor dug him up and ate him and others boiled and stewed with roots and herbs one amongst us killed his wife powdered her and ate part of her before it was known for which he was executed what hardships did the first settlers at jamestown face.
how did some of the jamestown colonists survive the starving time.
despite these initial setbacks the colony at jamestown became profitable by growing tobacco for sale in europe.
by 1619 jamestown was exporting tons of tobacco to england for the new fashion of smoking.
jamestowns new tobacco economy created a labor shortage.
the need for laborers was so great that early settlers attempted to enslave the areas native american indians.
however these indians were unwilling to be used as forced laborers and often escaped into the surrounding forests.
the first enslaved people from africa arrived in the colony in 1619 as well as the first women.
as the success of tobacco planting spread using african slaves would grow to become the foundation of the southern agrarian economy.
later the area of colonial settlement spread from jamestown to other parts of virginia.
the capital of the colony was moved to williamsburg.
virginia eventually had both rich plantation owners and smaller farmers and grew to become one of the wealthiest colonies.
in a country without roads rivers played an important role.
the first colonists depended on rivers to ship crops from the farm to the marketplace.
the marshy coastal plain along the chesapeake bay contained many navigable streams.
land owners constructed their buildings along these streams while ocean going ships sailed up these streams for many miles stopping to load goods at each plantation.
these geographic conditions encouraged the development of independent farms and plantations in virginia and maryland.
at the same time land away from the rivers remained largely unsettled.
these colonies developed few large towns since buying and selling often took place at a farmer s dock.

among those who also fled to rhode island was anne hutchinson.
while living in massachusetts she had often met with friends after church and held religious discussions.
she expressed her belief that god revealed himself to individuals without the aid of clergy.

anne hutchinson was put on trial where she claimed god had spoken to her directly.
she was found guilty of lying.
in 1637 she was banished from massachusetts.
