essie parrish a native american spiritual leader and healer kept alive stories from a time when her people the kashaya porno flourished along the northern california coast.
one day in 1958 she invited robert oswalt an anthropologist at the university of california to time travel with her to the 1540s.
as parrish spoke the centuries rolled back.
a personal voice essie parrish in the old days before the white people came up here there was a boat sailing on the ocean from the south.
because before that the kashaya porno had never seen a boat they said our world must be coming to an end.
couldnt we do something.
this big bird floating on the ocean is from somewhere probably from up high t hey promised our father a feast saying that destruction was upon them.
when they had done so they watched the ship sail way up north and disappear.
they were saying that nothing had happened to them the big bird person had sailed northward without doing anything because of the promise of a feast consequently they held a feast and a big dance 99 quoted in kashaya texts dressed for a ceremony in the 1950s spiritual leader essie parrish wears a feathered headdress and holds two bead covered staffs.
in this chapter you will learn about three complex societies that met in north america in the late 1400s the european the west african and the native american.
however it is with the ancient peoples of the americas that american history actually begins.
ancient cultures in the americas no one knows for sure when the first americans arrived but it may have been as long as 22 000 years ago.
at that time the glaciers of the last ice age had frozen 4 chapter 1 exploration and the colonial era main idea analyzing effects what were the effects of agriculture on the hunting and gathering people of the americas.
vast quantities of the earth s water lowering sea levels and possibly creating a land bridge between asia and alaska across what is now the bering strait.
ancient hunters may have trekked across the frozen land known as beringia into north america.
hunting and gathering archaeologists believe that the earliest americans lived as big game hunters.
that way of life changed around 12 000 to 10 000 years ago when temperatures warmed glaciers melted and sea levels rose once again.
the land bridge disappeared under the bering sea bringing to an end land travel between the asian and north american continents.
as the climate grew warmer the large animals no longer thrived.
people gradually switched to hunting smaller game and fish and gathering nuts and berries.
agriculture develops while many ancient groups settled in north america others continued south into what is now mexico and south america.
between 10 000 and 5 000 years ago an agricultural revolution quietly took place in what is now central mexico.
there people began to plant crops.
eventually agricultural techniques spread throughout the americas.
the introduction of agriculture made it possible for people to settle in one place and to store surplus food.
from this agricultural base developed larger communities.
however some native american cultures never adopted agriculture and remained nomadic moving from place to place in search of food and water.
other tribes mixed nomadic and non nomadic lifestyles.
maya aztec and inca societies flourish the first empire of the americas emerged as early as 1200 b c.
in what is now southern mexico where the olmec people created a thriving civilization.
in the wake of the olmec s mysterious collapse around 400 b c the maya built a dynamic culture in guatemala and the yucatan peninsula between a d 250 and 900.
later the aztec settled the valley of mexico in the 1200s and developed a sophisticated civilization.
in south america the most prominent empire builders were the inca.
around a d 1400 the inca created a glittering empire that stretched nearly 2 500 miles along the mountainous western coast of south america.
complex societies arise in north america in time several north american groups including the hohokam and the anasazi a ne sa ze introduced crops into the arid deserts of the southwest.
later between 300 b c.
and a d 1400 each group had established its own culture.

to the east and west of the mississippi river another series of complex societies developed the adena the hopewell and the mississippian.
these societies excelled at trade and at building massive earthen mounds as tombs and as platforms for temples and other buildings.
bj these early peoples were the ancestors of the many native american groups that inhabited north america on the eve of its encounter with the european world.
native american societies of the 1400s the varied regions of the north american continent provided for many different ways of life.
the native groups that populated the continent s coasts deserts and forests 500 years ago were as diverse as their surroundings.
diverse peoples the inhabitants of california adapted to the region s varied environments.
the kashaya porno lived in marshlands along the central coast hunting waterfowl with slingshots and nets.
to the north of them the yurok and hupa searched the forests for acorns and trapped fish in mountain streams.
the waterways and forests of the northwest coast sustained large communities year round.
on a coastline that stretched from what is now southern alaska to northern california groups such as the kwakiutl nootka and haida collected shellfish from the beaches and hunted the ocean for whales sea otters and seals.
in the dry southwest the pueblo and pima tribes descendants of the anasazi and hohokam lived in multistory houses made of stone or adobe a sun dried brick of clay and straw and grew maize corn beans melons and squash.
beneath the forest canopy of the northeast members of the iroquois tr e kwof nation hunted fish and game such as wild turkeys deer and bear.
in the northeast where winters could be long and harsh northeast peoples relied heavily on wild animals for clothing and food.
in the warmer southeast groups lived mainly off the land growing such crops as maize squash and beans.

region what does this map reveal about north america in the 1400s.
location why do you think some regions had more trade routes than others.
review unit 7 common characteristics many of the native american cultures had in common certain patterns of trade attitudes toward land use religious beliefs and social values.
as in other parts of the world trade helped the spread of customs and beliefs.
tribes traded among each other both locally and over long distances.
so extensive was the network of forest trails and river roads that an english sailor named david ingram claimed in 1568 to have walked along native american trade routes all the way from the gulf of mexico to nova scotia.
native americans traded many things but land was not one of them.
land was regarded as the source of life not as a commodity to be sold.
we cannot sell the lives of men and animals said one blackfoot chief in the 1800s therefore we cannot sell this land.
nearly all native americans thought of the natural world as filled with spirits.
every object both living and nonliving possessed a voice that might be heard if one listened closely.
some cultures worshiped one supreme being variously called great spirit great mystery or the creative power.
the basic unit of organization among all native american groups was the family which included aunts uncles cousins and other relatives.
some tribes further organized the families into clans or groups of families descended from a common ancestor.
in the late 1400s on the eve of the first encounter with europeans the rhythms of native american family life were highly developed.
all phases of a person s life birth marriage and death were guided by traditions that often went back hundreds or perhaps thousands of years.
on the other side of the atlantic in west africa customs equally ancient guided another diverse group of people.
goods that passed through their realms.
in 1067 an arab geographer in spain named a1 bakri described the duties import and export taxes levied in ghana.
main idea making inferences why would native american attitudes toward land ownership lead to conflict with europeans.
a personal voice al bakri for every donkey loaded with salt that enters the country the king takes a duty of one golden dinar about one eighth ounce of gold and two dinars from every one that leaves.
from a load of copper the duty due to the king is five mithquals also about one eighth ounce of gold and from a load of merchandise ten mithquals.
the gold nuggets found in all the mines.
are reserved for the king only gold dust being left for the people.
quoted in africa in the days of exploration with such wealth the rulers who controlled the north south trade routes could raise large armies and conquer new territory.
they could also build cities administer laws and support the arts and education.
kingdoms of benin and kongo at its height in the 1500s songhai s power extended across much of west africa.
however it did not control the forest kingdoms along the southern coast.
in the 1400s one of these kingdoms benin dominated a large region around the niger delta.
leading the expansion was a powerful oba or ruler named ewuare who developed benin city.
within another stretch of rain forest in west central africa the powerful kingdom of kongo arose on the lower congo zaire river.
in the late 1400s kongo consisted of a series of small kingdoms ruled by a single leader called the manikongo who lived in what is today angola.
west african societies of the 1400s a desert caravan approaches the fabled songhai city of timbuktu.
like north america west africa in the 1400s was home to a variety of long established sophisticated societies.
from this region especially from the coasts originated most of the people who were enslaved and brought to the americas in the centuries that followed.
their african traditions and beliefs played a major role in forming american history and culture.
notable among west african societies in the late 1400s were three powerful kingdoms songhai benin and kongo.
the kingdom of songhai from about 600 to 1600 a succession of empires first ghana then mali and finally songhai gained power and wealth by controlling the trans sahara trade.
the rulers of these empires grew rich by taxing the main idea comparing what did the kingdoms of west africa have in common.
west african culture most west africans lived in small villages where life revolved around family the com munity and tradition.
bonds of kinship that is family ties formed the basis of most aspects of life.
political leaders claimed authority on the basis of religion.
although west africans might worship a variety of gods and ancestral spirits most believed in a single creator.
throughout west africa people supported themselves by farming herding hunting fishing and by mining and trading.
almost all groups believed in collective ownership of land.
individuals farmed the land but it reverted to family or village ownership when not in use.
trading patterns with the wider world by the 1400s west africa had long been connected to the wider world through trade.
the city of timbuktu was the hub of a well established trading network that connected most of west africa to the ports of north africa and through these ports to markets in europe and asia.
along trade routes across the sahara desert merchants carried goods from mediterranean cities and salt from saharan mines to exchange for gold ivory and dyed cotton cloth.
along with goods traders from north africa also brought across the sahara the islamic faith which increasingly influenced west african cultures.
islam is a monotheistic religion that is one based on the belief in a single god.
the religion of islam was founded in arabia in 622 by muhammad and spread quickly across the middle east and north africa.
spotlight historical islam islam was founded by muhammad about a d 570 632 who worked as a merchant in mecca a trading city on the arabian peninsula.
when he was about 40 he believed the angel gabriel appeared to him and told him to preach a new religion to the arabs.
this religion became known as islam which in arabic means surrender to allah allah is the arabic word for god.
the followers of islam are called muslims those who submit to gods will the words that muhammad claimed he had received from the angel were recorded by his followers in the quran the holy book of islam.
the quran teaches that there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet the quran also sets forth certain duties for righteous muslims including a series of daily prayers the giving of charity and a pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca.
review unit 9 play king isabella 1451 1504 queen isabella who played a central role in european exploration by sponsoring christopher columbuss voyages to the americas made her mark on the old world as well.
as co ruler of spain isabella actively participated in her countrys religious and military affairs.
in championing spains catholicism the queen often fought openly with the pope to make sure that her candidates were appointed to positions in the spanish church.
in addition isabella had tasted battle far more than most rulers either male or female.
the queen rode among her troops in full armor personally commanding them in ferdinands absence.
whenever isabella appeared on a horse her troops shouted castile castile for our king isabella the portuguese mariners from portugal made trading contacts along the west african coast starting in the 1440s.
these early contacts with portuguese traders had two significant consequences for west africa and the americas.
first direct trade between the portuguese and the coastal people of west africa bypassed the routes across the sahara and pulled the coastal region into a closer relationship with europe.
second the portuguese began the european trade m enslaved west africans.
european societies of the 1400s in the late 1400s most europeans like most native americans and most africans lived in small villages bound to the land and to rhythms of life that had been in place for centuries.
for the majority of europeans change came slowly.
the social hierarchy european communities were based on social hierarchy that is they were organized according to rank.
at the top of the hierarchy were monarchs and the aristocracy the landowning elite who held most of the wealth and power.
members of the clergy also ranked high in the social order.
at the bottom were agricultural laborers or peasants.
few individuals rose above the social position of their birth.
one group that did achieve mobility was the growing number of artisans and merchants the people who created and traded goods for money.
there were relatively few members of this group in the 1400s.
however the profit they earned from trade would eventually make them a valuable source of tax revenue to monarchs seeking to finance costly overseas exploration and expansion.
o christianity shapes the european outlook the dominant religion in western europe was christianity a religion based on the life and teachings of jesus.
the leader of the church the pope and his bishops held great political as well as spiritual authority.
as the influence of christianity and islam spread the two religions came into conflict.
in 1096 christian armies from all over western europe responded to the church s call to force the muslims out of the holy land around jerusalem.
over the next two centuries europeans launched the crusades a series of military expeditions to the middle east in the name of christianity.
in the end these bloody crusades failed to rescue the holy land but they resulted in two consequences that encouraged european exploration and expansion.
first the crusades opened up asian trade routes supplying europeans with luxuries from the east especially spices such as cinnamon cloves nutmeg and pepper.
second the crusades weakened the power of european nobles many of whom lost their lives or fortunes in the wars.
monarchs eventually took advantage of the nobles weakened ranks to consolidate their own power.
by the early 1500s many church leaders and ordinary people were eager for reforms.
this desire for change led to a movement called the reformation which criticized church practices and challenged the authority of the pope.
main idea making inferences why were merchants able to achieve social mobility.
background spices were important in the middle ages when european farmers preserved meat by packing it between layers of salt.
spices helped disguise the bad taste of the meat.
10 chapter 1 exploration and the colonial era history through arty june from les tres riches heures du duc de berry this miniature painting representing the month of june is a page from a prayer book calendar begun by the limbourg brothers around the year 1412.
the book was made for a younger son of the french king and tells us a great deal about the aristocratic view of the european social order.
in the background the walls of the city of paris protect a palace and the royal chapel buildings that represent the two most powerful institutions in medieval european society church and aristocracy.
in the foreground peasants mow the fields in an orderly world of peace and tranquility.
however the image is a fantasy an idealized vision painted to please the aristocracy.
there is no hint of the peasants grinding poverty or of the violence of the hundred years war that was at that moment devastating northern france.

what does the painting tell you about the importance of gender in the division of labor during the 1400s.
why might images of poverty have displeased the aristocracy.
main idea analyzing causes how did religious events in europe help spur exploration and settlement of new lands.
vocabulary medieval of or during the middle ages often dated from a d 476 to 1453 the reformation led to a religious schism or split throughout europe those who supported the reformation became known as protestants because of their opposition to the established catholic church.
this split deepened the rivalries among european nations during the period of north american colonization a century later and sent some protestants and some catholics across the atlantic to seek religious freedom.
european nations take shape during the 1400s four major nations were taking shape in europe portugal spain france and england.
ambitious monarchs extended their reach by collecting new taxes raising professional armies and forming stronger governments.
among their new allies were the merchants who paid taxes in exchange for the protection and expansion of trade.
the renaissance the 1400s also saw a cultural awakening in europe known as the renaissance rent sans a term meaning rebirth of the kind of interest in the physical world that had characterized ancient greece and rome.
in the arts this meant rejecting the flat two dimensional images of medieval painting in favor of the deep perspectives and fully rounded forms of ancient sculpture and painting.
starting in italy a region stimulated by commercial contact with asia and africa the renaissance soon spread throughout europe.
renaissance artists created works of lasting influence while european scholars reexamined the texts of ancient philosophers mathematicians geographers and scientists.
although their themes were still often religious in nature renaissance artists portrayed their subjects more realistically than had medieval artists using new review unit 11 the caravel the caravel the ship used by most early portuguese and spanish explorers had many advantages over earlier vessels p it was lighter swifter and more maneuverable than other ships.
techniques such as perspective.
leonardo da vinci investigating how things worked kept notebooks in which he made detailed drawings of human anatomy and of his inventions including a flying machine.
this energetic spirit of inquiry infused the early explorers and adventurers who like christopher columbus grew up during the renaissance.
the spread of the renaissance was advanced by johann gutenberg s introduction of printing from movable type in the 1450s.
this development made books easier and cheaper to produce which aided the spread of ideas.
the renaissance encouraged people to think of themselves as individuals to have confidence in their capabilities and to look forward to the fame their achievements might bring.
this attitude prompted many to seek glory through adventure discovery and conquest.
europe enters a new age of expansion the european interest in overseas expansion probably began in the 1200s with the journey of marco polo to china.
later the publication in 1477 of the first printed edition of polo s vivid and sometimes exaggerated account caused renewed interest in the east.
like other merchants polo traveled to asia by land.
the expense and peril involved in such journeys led europeans to seek alternative routes.
in the 1400s europeans used the work of ptolemy a second century scholar along with the work of arab and j main idea developing historical perspective how did renaissance attitudes encourage the european age of exploration.

the best ships that jewish scholars to revive the art of cartography or mapmaking.
although imper fect the new maps inspired europeans to start exploring for water routes to asia.
european monarchs had powerful motives to finance the search for new lands and trading routes they needed money to maintain their growing armies and administrative bureaucracies.
by the mid 1400s europe s gold and silver mines were running low.
so the monarchs of portugal spain france and england began looking overseas for wealth.
beginning in the 1300s monarchs invested some of their tax revenues in new weapons such as longbows and cannons which they used to limit the power of the independent nobles.
these new weapons along with the hand held firearms that were developed in the 1400s also gave them military advantages over the africans and native americans whom they later encountered.
sailing technology improves european ship captains in the 1400s experimented with new sailing vessels such as the car avel and navigating tools such as the compass and the astrolabe sailed the seas.
which helped sailors plot direction at sea.
they also took advan alvise da cadamosto of the caravel tage of sailing innovations like those that allowed caravels to sail against the wind.
one leader in developing and employing these innovations was prince henry the navigator of portugal who gathered mariners geographers and navigators to his court.
according to a contemporary chronicler gomes eanes de zurara the prince s driving motivation was the need to know.
for almost 40 years prince henry sent his captains sailing south along the west coast of africa.
exploration continued after the prince s death.
in 1488 portuguese sailor bartolomeu dias rounded the southern tip of africa fellow portuguese explorer vasco da gama reached india ten years later.
by sailing around africa to eastern asia via the indian ocean portuguese traders were able to cut their costs and increase their profits.
as cartographers redrew their maps to show this eastern route to asia an italian sea captain named christopher columbus believed there was an even shorter route one that headed west across the atlantic.

on august 3 1492 the genoese mariner christopher columbus set out on a bold expedition to find a route to asia by sailing west across the atlantic ocean.
it was a journey destined to change the course of world history.
a seeker of fame and fortune columbus began his travel journal by restating the deal he had struck with the spanish rulers financing his voyage.
a personal voice christopher columbus based on the information that i had given your highnesses about the land of india and about a prince who is called the great khan of china.
your highnesses decided to send me to the regions of india to see.
the peoples and the lands and to learn of.
the measures which could be taken for their conversion to our holy faith.
i was to go by way of the west whence until today we do not know with certainty that anyone has gone.
the log of christopher columbus columbus never reached asia.
he landed on an island he thought was off the christopher coast of asia but was actually in the caribbean sea.
instead of finding the great columbus from khan columbus set in motion a process that brought together the american a painting done european and african worlds.
columbus crosses the atlantic in october 1492 roughly two months after leaving spain columbus s small fleet of ships the nina the pinta and the santa maria reached land.
columbus went ashore where he encountered a group of people who would become known as the taino tfno from their word for noble ones.
he planted spanish banners and renamed their island san salvador holy savior claiming it for spain.
columbus spent 96 days exploring four coral islands in the bahamas and the coastlines of two larger caribbean islands known today as cuba and hispaniola.
chapter 1 exploration and the colonial era vocabulary colonize to establish settlements under the control of a parent country main idea analyzing events what did spain and portugal agree to do in the treaty of tordesillas.
convinced that he had landed on islands off asia known to europeans as the indies columbus called the people he met los indios.
thus the name indian came to be mistakenly applied to all the diverse peoples of the americas.
the spanish monarchs were thrilled with columbus s discoveries and funded three more of his voyages this time to colonize the lands he had claimed.
the impact on native americans by the time columbus set sail for his return to hispaniola in 1493 europeans had already developed a pattern for colonization.
they had glimpsed the profitability of the plantation system realized the economic benefits of using native or local peoples for forced labor and learned to use european weapons to dominate native peoples.
these tactics would be used in the americas.
the arrival of the europeans devastated native americans by another means disease.
the taino for example had not developed any natural immunity to measles mumps chickenpox smallpox typhus or other diseases europeans had unknowingly brought with them.
consequently the taino died by the thousands once they were exposed.
the impact on africans with the decline of the native work force the european settlers of the americas eventually turned to africa for slaves.
the atlantic slave trade devastated many african societies particularly in west africa.
starting in the 1500s african cultures lost many of their young and more able members.
before the atlantic slave trade ended in the 1800s it had drained africa of at least 12 million people.
the impact on europeans columbus s voyages had profound effects on europeans as well.
in search of new lives europeans began to cross the atlantic by the thousands in what would become one of the biggest voluntary migrations in world history.
overseas expansion inflamed national rivalries in europe.
in 1494 spain and portugal signed the treaty of tordesillas tor de se es in which they agreed to divide the western hemisphere between them.
the columbian exchange the voyages of columbus and those after him led to the discovery of plants and animals in the americas that were new to europeans and africans.
ships took items such as corn potatoes and tobacco from the americas to europe and to africa.
from these countries they brought back livestock grains fruit and coffee.
this global transfer of living things called the columbian exchange began with columbus s first voyage and continues today.

these explorers were lured by the prospect of vast lands filled with gold and silver.
known as conquistadors kong ke sta dorz conquerors they conquered much of the americas.
cortes subdues the aztec soon after landing in mexico in 1519 hernando cortes learned of the vast and wealthy aztec empire in the region s interior.
with a force of 600 soldiers 17 horses 10 cannons and numerous dogs the video the arrival of the spanish v y playfl hernando cortes 1485 1547 conquistador marched inland.
the spaniards marveled at tenochtitlan the aztec capital with its towering temples and elaborate engineering works including a system that brought fresh water into the city.
we were amazed one of cortes s soldiers said of his first glimpse of tenochtitlan.
some of our soldiers even asked whether the things we saw were not a dream.
while the aztec city astonished the spaniards the capital s glittering gold stock seemed to hypnotize them.
they picked up the gold and fingered it like monkeys one native witness recalled.
they hungered like pigs for that gold.
the aztec emperor montezuma convinced at first that cortes was an armor clad god agreed to give the spanish explorer a share of the empire s existing gold supply.
the conquistador was not satisfied.
cortes eventually forced the aztec to mine more gold and silver.
in the spring of 1520 the aztec rebelled against the spaniards intrusion.
regarding montezuma as a traitor the aztec are believed to have stoned their ruler to death before driving out cortes s forces.
while they had successfully repelled the spanish invaders the aztec were falling victim to the diseases that the spanish had brought with them.
by the time cortes launched a counterattack in 1521 the spanish and their native allies overran an aztec force that had been greatly reduced by smallpox and measles.
after several months of fighting the invaders sacked and burned tenochtitlan and the aztec surrendered.
while flames still flickered in the shattered capital cortes laid plans for the colony of new spain.
the spanish pattern of conquest in building their american empire the spaniards lived among the native people and sought to impose their own culture upon them.
the settlers mostly men tended to intermarry with native women.
this practice eventually created a large mestizo mestizo or mixed spanish and native american population in the spanish colonies.
nonetheless the spanish also oppressed the people among whom they lived.
in their effort to exploit the land for its resources they forced native american workers to labor in an encomienda eng ko myen da system.
under that system natives farmed ranched or mined for spanish landlords who received the rights to their labor from spanish authorities.
cortes made himself the enemy of thousands of native americans but the daring conquistador did not have many friends among spaniards.
spanish authorities on cuba where cortes owned land accused the conquistador of murdering his wife catalina juarez.
there were ugly accusations but none proved wrote juarezs biographer.
in addition the cuban governor diego velazquez who resented cortess arrogance relieved him of the command of a gold seeking expedition to the mainland.
cortes left cuba anyway.

they remain as lasting memorials to the great cultures reflected in their architecture.
resistance to the spanish the impact of the spanish missions on native american cultures has been a subject of much historical controversy.
recent his i i torians assert that the mission system negatively affected many native american communities in several ways.
the spanish required native americans who converted to christianity to live inside the missions separating them from their families and cultures.
native americans who tried to leave were punished.
the spanish also forced native americans to provide labor for farming and construction give up their self government and adopt european dress diet and living arrangements.
during the 1670s priests and soldiers around santa fe began forcing native americans to help support the missions by paying a tribute an offering of either goods or services.
the tribute was usually a bushel of maize or a deer hide but the spanish also forced native americans to work for them and sometimes abused them physically.
native americans who practiced their native religion or refused to pay a tribute were beaten.
spanish priests punished the pueblo religious leader pope for his worship practices which they interpreted as witchcraft.
in 1680 the angered leader led a well organized uprising against the spanish that involved some 17 000 warriors from villages all over new mexico.
the triumphant fighters destroyed catholic churches executed priests and settlers and drove the spaniards back into new spain.
for the next 12 years until the spanish regained control of the area the southwest region of the future united states once again belonged to its original inhabitants.
but spain would never again have complete control of the americas.

john smith craved adventure.
smith s father had urged him to be a merchant but the restless englishman wanted to see the world.
in 1606 he offered his services as a colonist to the virginia company a group of merchants charged with starting an english colony in north america.
he later recalled his vision of the opportunities that awaited those who settled the americas.

bbq taking notes use the graphic organizer online to take notes on the cause and effect relationships identified in the section.
the english settle at jamestown in april of 1607 nearly four months after the virginia company s three ships had left england they reached the north american shore.
sailing part way up a broad river leading into chesapeake bay the colonists selected a small defensible peninsula and built fort james to protect the settlement of jamestown named for their king.
a disastrous start unlike spanish colonies which were funded by spanish rulers the english colonies were originally funded by joint stock companies.
stock companies allowed several investors to pool their wealth in support of a colony that would they hoped yield a profit.
investors in the jamestown colony demanded a quick return on their investment and the colonists hoped to find gold to satisfy them.
consequently they neglected farming and soon review unit 21 n rediscovering fort james about ten feet from the forts walls.
houses measured sixteen by forty feet and several colonists lived in each.
erosion turned the jamestown peninsula into an island and for many years the site of the original fort james was assumed to be under water.
however in 1996 archaeologists from the association for the preservation of virginia antiquities discovered artifacts on what they concluded was the original site of the fort.
since then archaeologists have discovered armor weapons even games used by the first colonists.
archaeologists and historians are constantly learning more and more about this long buried treasure of american history this illustration re creates what historians and archaeologists now believe fort james looked like early in its history.

after several months one settler described the terrifying predicament thus we lived for the space of five months in this miserable distress.
our men night and day groaning in every corner of the fort most pitiful to hear.
smith held the colony together by forcing the colonists to farm and by securing food and support from the native powhatan peoples.
then smith was injured and returned to england.
without smith s leadership the colony eventually deteriorated to the point of famine.
the settlement was saved however by the arrival of new colonists and by the development of a highly profitable crop tobacco.
main idea analyzing issues why were virginias frontier settlers frustrated with their government.
tobacco requires a supply of labor in order to grow tobacco the virginia company needed field laborers.
immigration jumped in 1618 when the company introduced the headright system offering 50 acres of land to adventurers who would pay their own or another s transportation from england.
many of those who arrived in virginia however came as indentured servants.
in exchange for passage to north america and food and shelter upon arrival an indentured servant agreed to a limited term of servitude usually four to seven years.
indentured servants were main ly from the lower classes of english society and therefore had little to lose by leaving for a new world.
the first enslaved africans arrived in virginia aboard a dutch merchant ship in 1619.
after a few years most of them received land and freedom.
it would be several decades before the english colonists in north america began the systematic use of enslaved africans as laborers.
colonists clash with native americans the colonists desire for more land to accommodate their growing population and the demand for more crop space led to warfare with the original inhabitants of virginia.
unlike the spanish the english followed a pattern of driving away the people they defeated.
their conquest over the native peoples was total and complete which is one reason a large mestizo like population never developed in the united states.
economic differences split virginia the english colonists who migrated to north america in increasing numbers battled not only native americans but sometimes each other.
by the 1670s one quarter of the free white men in virginia were poor former indentured servants who lived mainly on the western frontier of virginia where they constantly fought with native americans for land.
although virginia s governor william berkeley proposed building forts to protect the settlers the settlers refused to pay taxes to maintain these forts.
the colonists under the leadership of a young planter named nathaniel bacon marched on jamestown in september of 1676.
bacon confronted colonial leaders with a number of grievances including the frontier s lack of representation in virginia s colonial legislature or law making body the house of burgesses.
although bacon s rebellion ultimately failed it exposed the restlessness of the colony s former indentured servants.
historical spotlight early representative government as the english settlers colonized north america they sowed the seeds of the representative style of government that would become the foundation of american democracy.
virginias house of burgesses served as the first representative body in colonial america.
the house first met in jamestown in 1619 and included two citizens or burgesses from each of virginias eleven districts.
the body claimed the authority to raise taxes and pass legislation subject to veto by the english governor.
the mayflower compact which the pilgrims crafted as they sailed to north america in 1620 created a civil government and pledged loyalty to the king.
it stated that the purpose of their government in america would be to frame just and equal laws for the general good of the colony created in 1639 the fundamental orders of connecticut extended voting rights to a greater number of white males in that colony.
it also declared that the colonial legislature could assemble without a call by the governor.

this bible belonged to governor william bradford of the plymouth colony.
puritans create a new england after king henry viii 1491 1547 broke with roman catholicism in the 1530s the church of england was formed.
although the new church was free of catholic control one religious group the puritans felt that the church had kept too much catholic ritual.
they wanted to purify or reform the church by eliminating all traces of catholicism.
some puritans called separatists wanted to separate from the english church.
they often met in secret to avoid the punishment inflicted upon those who did not follow the anglican form of worship.
jg one congregation of separatists known today as the pilgrims eventually migrated to america.
there in 1620 this small group of families founded the plymouth colony the second permanent english colony in north america.
their mayflower compact named for the ship on which they sailed to north america became an important landmark in the development of american democracy.
the massachusetts bay colony other puritans who were not separatists turned their thoughts toward new england in the 1620s.
they felt the burden of increasing religious persecution political repression and dismal economic conditions.
in 1630 a group of puritans established the massachusetts bay colony along the upper coast of north america.
the port town of boston soon became the colony s thriving capital.
settlers established other towns nearby and eventually incorporated the plymouth colony into the massachusetts bay colony.
the puritans believed they had a special covenant or agreement with god.
to fulfill their part they were to create a moral society that would serve as a beacon for others to follow.
puritan leader john winthrop expressed the sense of mission that bound the puritans together in a sermon delivered aboard the flagship arbella we in new england shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are on us.
although puritans made no effort to create a democracy the massachusetts bay company extended the right to vote to all adult male members of the puritan church 40 percent of the colony s men.
as their system of self government evolved so did the close relationship between the government and the puritan church.
the puritan view dominated massachusetts society taxes supported the puritan church and laws required church attendance jgy dissent in the puritan community the puritans came to america to follow their own form of worship and they were intolerant of people who had dissenting religious beliefs.
one such dissenter was roger williams an extreme separatist who expressed two controversial views.
first he declared that the english settlers had no rightful claim to the land unless they purchased it from native americans.
second he argued that every person should be free to worship according to his or her conscience.

when officials tried to deport williams back to england he fled massachusetts and traveled south.
he negotiated with a local native american group for a plot of land and set up a new colony which he called providence.
in providence later the capital of rhode island williams guaranteed religious freedom and separation of church and state.
another dissenter anne hutchinson taught that worshippers did not need the church or its ministers to interpret the bible for them.
banished from the colony hutchinson with her family and a band of followers fled first to rhode island and after her husband died to new netherland which later became part of new york where she died in a war with native americans.
native americans resist colonial expansion while williams and his followers were settling rhode island thousands of other white settlers fanned out to western massachusetts and to new colonies in new hampshire and connecticut.
from the beginning native americans had helped the colonists providing them with land and giving them agricultural advice.
soon however disputes between the puritans and native americans arose over land and religion.
as native americans saw their lands taken over by settlers they feared an end to their way of life.
in addition native americans resented the puritans efforts to convert them and bristled under puritan laws such as the prohibition of hunting and fishing on sunday.
king philips war great tension continued between native americans and settlers for nearly 40 years.
eventually the wampanoag chief metacom whom the english called king philip organized his tribe and several others into an alliance to wipe out the invaders.

finally food shortages disease and heavy casualties wore down the native americans resistance and they gradually surrendered or fled.
settlement of the middle colonies while english puritans were establishing colonies in new england the dutch were founding one to the south.
as early as 1609 henry hudson an englishman employed by the dutch had sailed up the river that now bears his name.
the dutch soon established a fur trade with the iroquois and built trading posts on the hudson river.
the dutch found new netherland in 1621 the dutch government granted the newly formed dutch west india company permission to colonize new netherland and expand the thriving fur trade.
new amsterdam now new york city founded in 1625 became the capital of the colony see map on page 25.
in 1655 the dutch extended their claims by taking over new sweden a tiny colony of swedish and finnish settlers that had established a rival fur trade along the delaware river.
to encourage settlers to come and stay the colony opened its doors to a variety of ethnic and religious groups.
in 1664 the english took over the colony without a fight.
the duke of york the new proprietor or owner of the colony renamed it new york.
the duke later gave a portion of this land to two of his friends naming this territory new jersey for the british island of jersey.
the quakers settle pennsylvania the acquisition of new netherland was one step in england s quest to extend its american empire after 1660 when the english monarchy was restored after a period of civil war and puritan rule.
the new king charles ii owed a debt to the father of a young man named william penn.
as payment charles gave the younger penn a large property that the king insisted be called pennsylvania or penn s woods after the father.
following this in 1682 penn acquired more land from the duke of york the three counties that became delaware.
william penn belonged to the society of friends or quakers a protestant sect that held services without formal ministers allowing any person to speak as the spirit moved him or her.
they dressed plainly refused to defer to persons of rank opposed war and refused to serve in the military.
for their radical views they were scorned and harassed by anglicans and puritans alike.
penn wanted to establish a good and fair society in keeping with quaker ideals of equality cooperation and religious toleration.
penn guaranteed every adult male settler 50 acres of land and the right to vote.
his plan for government called for a representative assembly and freedom of religion.
like roger williams before him penn believed that the land belonged to the native americans and he saw to it that they were paid for it.

the english civil war and restoration from 1642 to 1651 england was torn apart by great wars between loyalist supporters of king charles i and those who supported parliament many of whom were puritans.
the parliamentary armies were victorious and charles i was tried for treason and executed in 1649.
for a decade england became a commonwealth or republic headed first by oliver cromwell a puritan and then by his son richard.
however the english grew weary of the rather grim and sober puritan rule and in 1660 the monarchy was restored under charles ii.
the restoration would have a profound effect on america leading to the creation of new colonies and to more direct involvement by the crown in colonial affairs.
6 chapter 1 exploration and the colonial era history through colonial meetinghouses the puritans of the northeast the quakers of pennsylvania and the anglicans of the southern colonies held profound but often different convictions about community social responsibility and individual freedom.
these convictions were often expressed in the religious services of each group as well as the architecture of the places of worship where these services were held.
mens seats womens seats architecture a quaker meetinghouse quaker services which were called meetings relied on the inspiration of the inner light meetings reflected a respect for conscience and freedom of speech.

meanwhile his idealistic vision had faded but did not disappear.
the quakers became a minority in a colony thickly populated by people from all over western europe.
slavery was introduced and in fact many prominent quakers in pennsylvania owned slaves.
however the principles of equality cooperation and religious tolerance on which he had founded his vision would eventually become fundamental values of the new american nation.
england and its colonies prosper thirteen colonies throughout the 1600s and 1700s more british colonies in north america were founded each for very different reasons.
in 1632 king charles i granted land north of chesapeake bay to george calvert the first lord baltimore.
calvert s son cecil the second lord baltimore named the colony maryland after queen henrietta maria charles s wife.
in 1663 king charles ii awarded a group of key supporters the land between virginia and spanish florida a territory that soon became north and south carolina.
in 1732 an english philanthropist named james oglethorpe along with several associates received a charter for a colony he hoped could be a haven for those imprisoned for debt.
oglethorpe named the colony georgia after king george ii.
few debtors actually came to georgia and the british crown assumed direct control of the colony in 1752.
by that time the crown had begun to exercise more and more control over colonial economies and governments.
the thirteen british colonies existed primarily for the benefit of england.
the colonies exported to england a rich variety of raw materials such as lumber and furs and in return they imported the manufactured goods that england produced.
the thirteen colonies that became the original united states were founded over a period of 125 years.
together the colonies represented a wide variety of people skills motives industries resources and agricultural products.
mercantilism and the navigation acts beginning in the 16th century the nations of europe competed for wealth and power through a new economic system called mercantilism muf ken te liz em in which the colonies played a critical role.
according to the theory of mercantilism a nation could increase its wealth and power in two ways by obtaining as much gold and silver as possible and by establishing a favorable balance of trade in which it sold more goods than it bought.
a nation s ultimate goal was to become self sufficient so that it did not have to depend on other countries for goods.
the key to this process was the establishment of colonies.
colonies provided products especially raw materials that could not be found in the home country.
in 1651 england s parliament the country s legislative body moved to tighten control of colonial trade by passing a series of measures known as the navigation acts.
these acts enforced the following rules no country could trade with the colonies unless the goods were shipped in either colonial or english ships.
all vessels had to be operated by crews that were at least three quarters english or colonial.
the colonies could export certain products including tobacco and sugar and later rice molasses and furs only to england.
almost all goods traded between the colonies and europe first had to pass through an english port.
the system created by the navigation acts obviously benefited england.

colonial governments whatever their form of charter by the mid 1700s most colonies were similar in the structure of their governments.
in nearly every colony a governor appointed by the crown served as the highest authority.
the governor presided over an advisory council usually appointed by the governor and a local assembly elected by landowning white males.
the governor had the authority to appoint and dismiss judges and oversee colonial trade.
in addition to raising money through taxes the colonial assembly initiated and passed laws.
the governor could veto any law but did so at a risk because in most colonies the colonial assembly not the crown paid the governor s salary.
using this power of the purse liberally the colonists influenced the governor in a variety of ways from the approval of laws to the appointment of judges.
growing spirit of self determination the colonies were developing a taste for self government that would ultimately create the conditions for rebellion.
nehemiah grew a british mercantilist voiced one of the few early concerns when he warned his compatriots about the colonies growing self determination in 1707.

in particular the northern and southern colonies were developing distinct societies based on sharply contrasting economic systems.

plantations or large farms like the carters played a dominant role in the south s economy which had come to rely heavily on agriculture.
the development of this plantation economy led to a largely rural society in which enslaved africans played an unwilling yet important role.
a plantation economy arises in the south while there were cities in the south on the whole the region developed as a rural society of self sufficient plantations.
plantations sprang up along the rivers making it possible for planters to ship their goods directly to the northern colonies and europe without the need for public dock facilities.

while small farmers made up the majority of the southern population prosperous plantation owners controlled much of the south s economy as well as its political and social institutions.
at the bottom of southern society were enslaved africans.
in the 18th century southerners turned increasingly to slavery to fill the labor needs of their agricultural economy.
by 1690 about 13 000 slaves were working in the southern colonies.
by 1750 the number of slaves had increased to around 200 000.
the middle passage during the 17th century africans had become part of a transatlantic trading network described as the triangular trade.
this term refers to a trading process in which goods and enslaved people were exchanged across the atlantic ocean.
for example merchants carrying rum and other goods from the new england colonies exchanged their merchandise for enslaved africans.
africans were then transported to the west indies where they were sold for sugar and molasses.
these goods were then sold to rum producers in new england and the cycle began again.

slaves also resisted their position of subservience.
throughout the colonies planters reported slaves faking illness breaking tools and staging work slowdowns.
a number of slaves tried to run away even though escape attempts brought severe punishment.
some slaves even pushed their resistance to open revolt.
one uprising the stono rebellion began on a september sunday in 1739.
that morning about 20 slaves gathered at the stono river just south of charles town later charleston south carolina.
wielding guns and other weapons they killed several planter families and marched south beating drums and inviting other slaves to join them in their plan to flee to spanish held florida.
many slaves died in the fighting that followed.
those captured were executed.
despite the rebellion s failure it sent a chill through many southern colonists and led to the tightening of harsh slave laws already in place.
commerce grows in the north the development of thriving commercial cities and diverse economic activities gradually made the north radically different from the south.
grinding wheat harvesting fish and sawing lumber became thriving industries.
by the 1770s the colonists had built one third of all british ships and were producing more iron than england did.
many colonists prospered.
in particular the number of merchants grew.
by the mid 1700s merchants were one of the most powerful groups in the north.
in contrast to the south where charles town was the only major port the north boasted boston new york and philadelphia.
colonial cities and trade the expansion of trade caused port cities to grow.
philadelphia became the second largest port in the british empire after london.
toward the end of the 1700s yankee traders were sailing around cape horn at the tip of south america to trade with spanish missionaries as far away as california.
there they exchanged manufactured goods for hides tallow wine olive oil and grain raised with the help of the native american labor on the missions.
review unit 33 daily urban life in colonial times by the mid 18th century colonial cities were prosperous and growing.
brick rowhouses were replacing the wooden structures of the 17th century while large mansions and churches built of brick or stone were rising everywhere.
english colonists had brought with them a preference for houses as opposed to apartments which were the norm in the cities of other european countries.
as in britain the size of the house indicated the social position of its occupant.
in contemporary philadelphia elfreths alley preserves the scale and appearance of a mid 18th century city street.
narrow rowhouses like these were occupied by artisans and shopkeepers.
a neighborhood like this could have commercial and residential uses.
many people lived above the shops where they worked.
the house known as cliveden also in philadelphia was completed in 1767.
in contrast to the artisan or lower middle class housing of elfreths alley this large freestanding mansion shows the kind of building that the rich could afford.
the northern colonies attracted a variety of immigrants.
during the 18th century about 463 000 europeans migrated to america.
before 1700 most immigrants came as indentured servants from england but by 1755 over one half of all european immigrants were from other countries.
they included large numbers of germans and scots irish.
other ethnic groups included the dutch in new york scandinavians in delaware and jews in such cities as newport and philadelphia.
farming in the north unlike southern plantations a farm in new england and the middle colonies typically produced several cash crops rather than a single one.
because growing wheat and corn did not require as much labor as did growing tobacco and rice northerners had less need to rely on slave labor.
however slavery did exist in new england and was extensive throughout the middle colonies as was racial prejudice against blacks free or enslaved.
as in the south women in the north had extensive work responsibilities but few legal or social rights.
the enlightenment during the 1700s the enlightenment an intellectual movement that began in europe and the great awakening a colonial religious movement influenced people s thinking throughout the thirteen colonies.
european ideas inspire the colonists during the renaissance in europe scientists had begun looking beyond religious beliefs and traditional assumptions for answers about how the world worked.
careful observation and reason or rational thought led to the discovery of some of the natural laws and principles governing the world and human behavior.
the work of nicolaus copernicus galileo galilei and sir isaac newton established that the earth chapter 1 exploration and the colonial era bmaini ie ea analyzing effects what effects did the enlightenment have on political thought in the colonies.
vocabulary revival a time of reawakened interest in religion revolved around the sun and not vice versa.
this observation which challenged the traditional assumption that the earth was the center of the universe was at first fiercely resisted.
it was thought to contradict the bible and other religious teachings.
the early scientists also concluded that the world is governed by fixed mathematical laws rather than solely by the will of god.
these ideas about nature led to a movement called the enlightenment in which philosophers valued reason and scientific methods.
enlightenment ideas spread from europe to the colonies where people such as benjamin franklin embraced the notion of obtaining truth through experimentation and reason.
for example franklin s most famous experiment flying a kite in a thunderstorm demonstrated that lightning is a form of electrical power.
enlightenment ideas spread quickly through the colonies by means of books and pamphlets.
literacy was particularly high in new england because the puritans had long supported public education partly to make it possible for everyone to read the bible.
however enlightenment views were disturbing to some people.
the enlightenment suggested that people could use science and logic rather than the pronouncements of church authorities to arrive at truths.
as the english poet john donne had written the new philosophy calls all in doubt.
the enlightenment also had a profound effect on political thought in the colonies.
colonial leaders such as thomas jefferson reasoned that human beings are born with natural rights that governments must respect.
enlightenment principles eventually would lead many colonists to question the authority of the british monarchy.
lak history video did you know ben franklin i.
the great awakening by the early 1700s the puritans had lost some of their influence.
under the new massachusetts charter of 1691 puritans were required to practice religious tolerance and could no longer limit voting privileges to members of their own church.
furthermore as puritan merchants prospered they developed a taste for fine houses stylish clothes and good food and wine.
as a result their interest in maintaining the strict puritan code declined.
a series of religious revivals aimed at restoring the intensity and dedication of the early puritan church swept through the colonies.
these came to be known collectively as the great awakening.
the british minister george whitefield was a major force behind the great awakening.
in his seven journeys to the american colonies between 1738 and 1769 whitefield preached dramatic sermons that brought many listeners to tears.
review unit 35 1 key players benjamin franklin 1706 1790 a true student of the enlightenment benjamin franklin devised an orderly method to develop moral perfection in himself.
in his autobiography he records how he decided on a list of virtues he thought he should have.
then every night he reviewed whether his behavior lived up to those standards and recorded his faults in a notebook.
originally he concentrated on only 12 virtues until a quaker friend told him he was too proud.
franklin promptly added a 13th virtue to the list the virtue of humility which he felt he never quite achieved.
franklin took great pleasure in seeing his character improve.
he wrote i was surprisd to find myself so much fuller of faults than i had imagined but i had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish jonathan edwards 1703 1758 unlike benjamin franklin jonathan edwards did not believe that humans had the power to perfect themselves.
descended from a long line of puritan ministers he believed that however you may have reformed your life in many things all were sinners who were destined for hell unless they had a great change of heart edwards was a brilliant thinker who entered yale college when he was only 13.
his preaching was one of the driving forces of the great awakening.
ironically when the religious revival died down edwardss own congregation rejected him for being too strict about doctrine.
edwards moved to stockbridge massachusetts in 1751 where he lived most of his remaining years as a missionary to a native american settlement.
religious revivals among those clergy who sought to revive the fervor of the original puritan vision was jonathan edwards of northampton massachusetts.
one of the most learned religious scholars of his time edwards preached that it was not enough for people simply to come to church.
in order to be saved they must feel their sinfulness and feel god s love for them.
in his most famous sermon delivered in 1741 edwards vividly described god s mercy toward sinners.
a personal voice jonathan edwards the god that holds you over the pit of hell much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the fire abhors hates you and is dreadfully provoked his wrath towards you burns like fire he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire.
and yet it is nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment.
sinners in the hands of an angry god while the great awakening which lasted throughout the 1730s and 1750s restored many colonists christian religious faith the movement also challenged the authority of established churches.
preachers trav eled from village to village attracting thousands to outdoor revival meetings giving impassioned sermons and stirring people to rededicate themselves to god.
some colonists abandoned their old puritan or anglican congregations while independent denominations such as the baptists and methodists gained new members.
effects of the great awakening and enlightenment although the great awakening emphasized emotionalism and the enlightenment emphasized reason the two movements had similar consequences.
both caused people to question traditional authority.
moreover both stressed the importance of the individual the enlightenment by emphasizing human reason and the great awakening by de emphasizing the role of church authority.
because these movements helped lead the colonists to question britain s authority over their lives they were important in creating the intellectual and social atmosphere that eventually led to the american revolution.
main idea analyzing effects what effects did the great awakening have on organized religion in the colonies.
iapter 1 exploration and the colonial era background hats made from beaver skin were popular in europe beginning in the late 16th century.
because of the demand for beaver the fur trade was enormously successful.
main idea contrasting how was the french colony in north america unlike the british colonies.
the french and indian war amsaw awwwiibmbwaweabewamik9wwssa9sw r.
as 3bb as the french empire in north america expanded it collided with the growing british empire.
during the late 17th and first half of the 18th centuries france and great britain had fought three inconclusive wars.
each war had begun in europe but spread to their overseas colonies.
in 1754 after six relatively peaceful years the french british conflict reignited.
this conflict is known as the french and indian war.
rivals for an empire from the start the french colony in north america called new france differed from the british colonies.
typical french colonists were young single men who engaged in the fur trade and catholic priests who sought to convert native americans.
the french were more interested in exploiting their territories than in settling them.
however they usually enjoyed better relations with native americans in part because they needed the local people as partners in the fur trade.
in fact several military alliances developed out of the french native american trade relationship.
jf war erupts one major area of contention between france and great britain was the rich ohio river valley just west of pennsylvania and virginia.
in 1754 the french built fort duquesne in the region despite the fact that the virginia government had already granted 200 000 acres of land in the ohio country to a group of wealthy planters.
in response the virginia governor sent militia a group of ordinary citizens who performed military duties to evict the french.
this was the opening of the french and indian war the fourth war between great britain and france for control of north america.
in the first battle of the war the french delivered a crushing defeat to the outnumbered virginians and their leader an ambitious 22 year old officer named george washington.
a year after his defeat washington again headed into battle this time as an aide to the british general edward braddock.
braddock s first task was to relaunch an attack on fort duquesne.
as braddock and nearly 1 500 soldiers neared the fort french soldiers and their native american allies ambushed them.
the startled british soldiers turned and fled.

the weakness of the british army surprised washington who showed great courage.
as washington tried to rally the troops two horses were shot from under him and four bullets pierced his coat yet he escaped unharmed.
many other colonists began to question the competence of the british army which suffered defeat after defeat during 1755 and 1756.
britain defeats an old enemy angered by french victories britain s king george ii selected new leaders to run his government in 1757.
one of these was william pitt the elder an energetic self confident politician.
under pitt the british and colonial troops finally began winning battles.
these successes earned britain the support of the powerful iroquois giving britain some native american allies to counterbalance those of france.
in september 1759 the war took a dramatic and decisive turn on the plains of abraham just outside quebec.
under cover of night british troops scaled the high cliffs that protected the city and defeated the french in a surprise attack.
the british triumph at quebec brought them victory in the war.
the war officially ended in 1763 with the signing of the treaty of paris.
great britain claimed canada and virtually all of north america east of the mississippi river.
britain also took florida from spain which had allied itself with france.
the treaty permitted spain to keep possession of its lands west of the mississippi and the city of new orleans which it had gained from france in 1762.
france retained control of only a few islands and small colonies near newfoundland in the west indies and elsewhere.
38 chapter 1 exploration and the colonial era main idea making inferences how did great britains victory over france affect native americans.
changes for native americans others who lost ground in the war were the native americans who found the victorious british harder to bargain with than the french had been.
native americans resented the growing number of british settlers crossing the appalachian mountains and feared the settlers would soon drive away the game they depended on for survival.
in the spring of 1763 the ottawa leader pontiac recognized that the french loss was a loss for native americans.
a personal voice pontiac when i go to see the english commander and say to him that some of our comrades are dead instead of bewailing their death as our french brothers do he laughs at me and at you.
if i ask for anything for our sick he refuses with the reply that he has no use for us.
for all this you can well see that they are seeking our ruin.
therefore my brothers we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer.
quoted in red and white led by pontiac native americans captured eight british forts in the ohio valley and the great lakes area and laid siege to another.
in response british officers deliberately presented blankets contaminated with smallpox to two delaware chiefs during peace negotiations and the virus spread rapidly among the native americans.
weakened by disease and tired of fighting most native american groups negotiated treaties with the british by the summer of 1766.
to avoid further costly conflicts with native americans the british government prohibited colonists from settling west of the appalachian mountains.
the proclamation of 1763 established a proclamation line along the appalachians which the colonists were not allowed to cross.
however the colonists eager to expand westward from the increasingly crowded atlantic seaboard ignored the proclamation and continued to stream onto native american lands.

young people were considered either children or adults and as important as marriage was in the colonies sweethearts were older than one might suspect.
the practices of courtship and marriage varied among the different communities.
frontier or backcountry people andrew jackson depicted with his wife in the painting below stole his wife she was willing from her family.
jackson was following a custom of the backcountry people who lived along the western edge of the colonies.
these colonists mostly scots irish based their marriages on the old custom of abduction stealing the bride often with her consent.
even regular marriages began with the groom and his friends coming to steal the bride.
much drinking and dancing accompanied these wild and hilarious weddings.
quakers quaker couples intent on marrying needed the consent not only of the parents but also of the whole quaker community.
quakers who wanted to marry had to go through a 16 step courtship phase before they could wed quaker women however were known to reject men at the last minute.
is puritans for puritans marriage was a civil contract not a religious or sacred union.
although adults strictly supervised a couples courting parents allowed two unusual practices.
one was the use of a courting stick a long tube into which the couple could whisper while the family was in another room.
the other was the practice of bundling a young man spent the night in the same bed as his sweetheart with a large bundling board shown above between them.
before marrying the couple had to allow for puritan leaders to voice any objections to the marriage at the meeting house.
passing that the couple would marry in a very simple civil ceremony and share a quiet dinner.
chapter 1 data file who married.
puritans 98 of males and 94 of females married grooms were usually a few years older than brides discouraged marriages between first cousins virginians 25 of males never married most females married grooms nearly 10 years older than brides allowed first cousin marriages quakers 16 of women single at age 50 forbade first cousin marriages the south many african slaves married in a jumping the broomstick ceremony in which the bride and groom jumped over a broomstick to seal their union.
although there is disagreement among african american scholars some suggest that the above painting depicts a slave wedding on a south carolina plantation in the late 1700s.
frontier people almost all women and most men married ages of bride and groom about the same youngest group to marry virginia in virginia marriage was a sacred union.
since the marriage often involved a union of properties and love was not necessary parents were heavily involved in the negotiations.

life in the early american colonies slavery existed in all the colonies but it became a vital source of labor in the south during the 1600s enslaved africans were brought to north america through a network of transatlantic trade also known as the triangular trade.
through this trading network goods and enslaved africans were exchanged between three points england its colonies and africa.
by contrast the new england and middle colonies did not rely on slave labor or the production of a single commodity also called a single staple crop such as tobacco or rice.
most people were farmers but they grew a wide variety of crops the new england colonies traded actively with the islands of the west indies.
in addition to foods they ex ported all kinds of other items ranging from barrels to horses.
