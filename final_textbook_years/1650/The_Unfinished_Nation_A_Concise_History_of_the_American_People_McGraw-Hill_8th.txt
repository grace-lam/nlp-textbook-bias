26 chapter 2 john white created this illustration of life among the eastern woodland indians in coastal north carolina.
it shows the diversified agriculture practiced by the natives squash tobacco and three varieties of corn.
the hunters shown in nearby woods suggest another element of the native economy.
at bottom right indians perform a religious ritual which white described as strange gestures and songs private collection bridgeman images the indian village of secoton ca.
1585 by john white the tiny english populations had no choice but to learn from the indians.
they recognized the value of corn which was easy to cultivate and produced large yields.
the english also learned the advantages of growing beans alongside corn to enrich the soil.
like the natives the english quickly learned to combine the foods they grew and foods they hunted and fished.
they built canoes like the indians and gained the ability to navigate the local streams.
they learned from the indians how to build canoes by hollowing out a single log dugouts or sewing birchbark around a simple frame sealing it with resin.
without what they learned from the natives the early settlers would not have survived.
a few months after the first colonists arrived in virginia additional ships appeared with more men and supplies.
by then of the 144 men who had sailed to america only 38 were still alive the rest killed by diseases and famine.
jamestown survived largely because of two important events.
one was what they learned from the local indians.
the john smith other was the leadership of captain john smith who at age twenty seven was already a famous world traveler.
he imposed work and order on the community created transplantations and borderlands 27 a shaky relationship with the natives sometimes negotiating with the indians and at other times stealing food and kidnapping them.
jamestown was a tiny colony for more than a decade.
the natives were far more powerful than the english for years.
coastal virginia had numerous tribes the algonquians the sioux and the iroquois.
they had drawn together as part of the powhatan powhatan confederacy confederacy named after the great chief who controlled a large area near the coasts.
what the english called virginia the natives called tsenacommacah.
reorganization and expansion as jamestown struggled to survive the london company now renamed the virginia company was already dreaming of bigger things.
in 1609 it obtained a new charter from the king which increased its power and enlarged its territory.
it offered stock in the company to planters who were willing to migrate at their own expense.
and it provided free passage to virginia for poorer people who would agree to serve the company for seven years.
in the spring of 1609 two years after the first arrival of the english a fleet of nine vessels was dispatched to jamestown with approximately 600 people including some women and children.
nevertheless disaster followed.
one of the virginia bound ships was lost at sea in a hurricane.
another ran aground in the bermuda islands and was unable to sail for months.
many of the new settlers succumbed to fevers before winter came.
and the winter of 1609 1610 was especially severe a period known as starving time by then the the starving time natives realized that the colonists were a threat to their civilization and they blocked the english from moving inland.
barricaded in the small palisade unable to hunt or cultivate food the settlers lived on what they could find dogs cats rats snakes toadstools horsehides and even the corpses of dead men as one survivor recalled.
when the migrants who had run aground in bermuda finally arrived in jamestown the following may they found only about 60 emaciated people still alive.
the new arrivals took the survivors onto their ship and sailed for england.
but as the refugees proceeded down the james they met an english ship coming up the river part of a fleet bringing supplies and the colonys first governor lord de la warr.
the departing settlers agreed to return to jamestown.
new relief expeditions soon began to arrive and the effort to turn a profit in jamestown resumed.
new settlements began lining the river above and below jamestown.
the immigrants discovered a newly found crop tobacco which was already popular among the spanish colonies to the south.
it was already being imported to europe.
in 1612 the jamestown planter john rolfe began trying to cultivate the crop in virginia.
other planters followed suit up and down the james river.
tobacco became the first profitable crop in the new colony and its success encouraged tobacco planters to move deeper the tobacco economy inland intruding more and more into the native farmlands.
the emerging tobacco economy soon created a heavy demand for labor.
to entice new workers to the colony the virginia company established what it called the headright system headrights were fifty acre grants of land.
those who already the headright system lived in the colony received two headrights 100 acres apiece.
each new settler received a single headright for himself or herself.
this system encouraged family groups to migrate together since the more family members who traveled to america the more land the family would receive.
in addition anyone who paid for the passage of immigrants to virginia would receive an extra headright for each arrival.
as a result some colonists were quickly able to assemble large plantations.
28 chapter 2 tobacco plant this 1622 woodcut later hand colored represents the tobacco plant cultivated by english settlers in virginia in the early seventeenth century after john rolfe introduced it to the colonists.
on the right is an image of a man smoking the plant through a very large pipe.
mpi getty images the company also transported ironworkers and other skilled crafts workers to virginia to diversify the economy.
in 1619 it sent 100 englishwomen to the colony to become the wives of male colonists.
it also promised male colonists the full rights of englishmen an end to strict and arbitrary rule and even a share in self government.
on july 30 1619 house of burgesses delegates from the various communities met as the house of burgesses the first elected legislature within what was to become the united states.
in late august of 1619 john rolfe recorded that 20 and odd negroes arrived aboard a dutch ship.
it was actually the british war vessel the white lion which had recently raided a portuguese slave ship for its human cargo.
nevertheless rolfe provided the first recorded instance of africans arriving in north america though it is likely that the spanish had brought some earlier in the south.
historians are uncertain if white colonists in jamestown initially viewed the africans as a type of servant to be held for a term of years and then freed or as slaves.
likely it was the former as the majority of laborers at this time were bonded to a master or employer for a fixed period of time.
within about ten years however white colonists noted that it was customary practice to hold some negroes in a form of life service but they also indicated that some africans were still able to work for a period of time after which they were freed.
this variability in black life would not last long.
virginians began to depend on african laborers to farm tobacco and demanded more of them.
the judicial system began to codify what blacks could and could not do.
in 1639 a law forbade them from owning arms in 1640 virginia courts condemned a black runaway servant john punch to serve his said master.
for the time of his natural life and in 1662 the virginia general assembly declared that a negro womens children to serve according to the condition of the mother at the same time europeans began to arrive as indentured servants mostly english immigrants who were also held for a time and then released.
for a while indentured servants were by far the most populous workers in virginia and other colonies.
the european settlers in virginia built their society also on the effective suppression of the local indians.
for two years in the 1610s sir thomas dale de la warrs successor as governor commanded unrelenting assaults against the powhatan indians led by transplantations and borderlands 29 and named for their formidable chief powhatan.
in the process dale kidnapped powhatans young daughter pocahontas.
several years earlier pocahontas had pocahontas played a role in mediating differences between her people and the europeans.
but now powhatan refused to ransom her.
living among the english pocahontas gradually adapted many of their ways.
she converted to christianity and in 1614 married john rolfe and visited england with him.
there she stirred interest among many english in projects to civilize the indians.
she died shortly before her planned return to virginia.
by the time of pocahontass marriage powhatan had ceased his attacks on the english in the face of overwhelming odds.
but after his death several years later his brother opechancanough began secretly to plan the elimination of the english intruders.
on a march morning in 1622 tribesmen called on the white settlements as if to offer goods for sale then they suddenly attacked.
not until 347 whites of both sexes and all ages including john rolfe lay dead did the indian warriors finally retreat.
and not until over twenty years later were the powhatans finally defeated.
by then the virginia company in london was defunct.
in 1624 james i revoked the companys charter and the colony came under the control of the crown where it would remain until 1776.
the colony if not the company had survived but at a terrible cost.
in virginias first seventeen years more than 8 500 white settlers had arrived in the colony and nearly 80 percent of them had died.
countless natives died as well and s lavery became part of the colony.
maryland and the calverts the maryland colony ultimately came to look much like virginia but its origins were very different.
george calvert the first lord baltimore envisioned george and cecilius calvert establishing a colony in america both as a great speculative venture in real estate and as a refuge for english catholics like himself.
calvert died while he was still negotiating with the king in london for a charter to establish a colony in the chesapeake region.
but in 1632 his son cecilius the second lord baltimore finally received the charter.
lord baltimore remained in england but he named his brother leonard calvert governor of the colony.
in march 1634 two ships the ark and the dove bearing calvert along with 200 or 300 other colonists entered the potomac river turned into one of its eastern tributaries and established the village of st marys on a high dry bluff.
neighboring indians befriended the settlers and provided them with temporary shelter and with stocks of corn.
the calverts needed to attract thousands of settlers to maryland if their expensive colonial venture was to pay.
as a result they had to encourage the immigration of protestants as well as their fellow english catholics.
the calverts soon realized that catholics would always be a minority in the colony and so they adopted a policy of religious toleration the 1649 act concerning religion nevertheless politics in maryland remained plagued for years by tensions and at times violence between the catholic minority and the protestant majority.
at the insistence of the first settlers the calverts agreed in 1635 to the calling of a representative assembly the house of delegates.
but the proprietor retained absolute authority to distribute land as he wished and since lord baltimore granted large estates to his relatives and to other english aristocrats a distinct upper class soon established itself.
by 1640 a severe labor shortage forced a modification of the land grant procedure and maryland like virginia adopted a headright system a grant of 100 acres to each male settler another 100 for his wife and each servant and 50 for each of his children.
but the great landlords of the colonys earliest years remained powerful.
like virginia maryland became a center of tobacco cultivation planters worked their land with the aid first of indentured servants imported from england and then beginning late in the seventeenth century of slaves imported from africa.

note the several different kinds of colonial enterprises the royal colony of virginia controlled directly by the english crown after the failure of the early commercial enterprises there and the proprietary regions of maryland northern virginia and north carolina which were under the control of powerful english aristocrats.
did these political differences have any significant effect on the economic activities of the various chesapeake colonies.
bacons rebellion for more than thirty years one man sir william berkeley the royal governor of virginia dominated the politics of the colony.
he took office in 1642 at the age of thirty six and with but one brief interruption remained in control of the government until 1677.
in his first years as governor he helped open up the interior of virginia by sending explorers across the blue ridge mountains and crushing a 1644 indian uprising.
the defeated indians agreed to a treaty ceding to england most of the territory east of the mountains and establishing a boundary west of which white settlement would be prohibited.
but the rapid growth of the virginia population made this agreement difficult to sustain.
between 1640 and 1660 virginias population rose from 8 000 to over 40 000.
by 1652 english settlers had established three counties in the territory set aside by the treaty for the indians.
william berkeleys long tenure transplantations and borderlands 31 in the meantime berkeley was expanding his own powers.
by 1670 the vote for delegates to the house of burgesses once open to all white men was restricted to landowners.
elections were rare and the same burgesses representing the established planters of the eastern or tidewater region of the colony remained in office year after year.
the more recent settlers on the frontier were underrepresented.
resentment of the power of the governor and the tidewater aristocrats grew steadily in the newly settled lands of the west often known as the backcountry.
in 1676 this resentment helped create a major conflict led by nathaniel bacon.
backcountry resentment bacon had a good farm in the west and a seat on the governors council.
but like other members of the new backcountry gentry he resented the governors attempts to hold the territorial line.
bacons hostility toward berkeley was a result of the governors refusal to allow white settlers to move farther west.
berkeley forbid further settlement for fear of antagonizing indians.
adding to the resentment was that berkeley controlled the lucrative fur trade.
bacon wanted a piece of that trade.
the turbulence in virginia was not just the tension between berkeley and bacon both of them frontier aristocrats.
it was also a result of the consequences of the indentured servant system.
by the 1670s many young men had finished their term as indentures and had found themselves without a home or any money.
many of them began moving around the colony sometimes working sometimes begging sometimes stealing.
they would soon become a factor in what became bacons rebellion.
in 1675 a major conflict erupted in the west between english settlers and natives.
as the fighting escalated bacon and other concerned landholders demanded that the governor send the militia.
when berkeley refused bacon responded by offering to organize a volunteer army of backcountry men who would do their own fighting.
berkeley rejected that offer too.
bacon ignored him and launched a series of vicious but unsuccessful pursuits of the indian challengers.
when berkeley heard of the unauthorized military effort he proclaimed bacon and his men to be rebels.
bacon now turned his army against the governor and in what became known as bacons rebellion twice led his troops east to jamestown.
the first time he won a temporary pardon from the governor the second time after the governor repudiated the agreement bacon burned much of the city and drove the governor into exile.
but then bacon died suddenly of dysentery and berkeley soon regained control.
in 1677 the indians reluctantly signed a new treaty that opened new lands to white settlement.
bacons rebellion was part of a continuing struggle to define the indian and white spheres of influence in virginia.
it also revealed the bitterness of the consequences of bacons rebellion competition among rival white elites and it demonstrated the potential for instability in the colonys large population of free landless men.
one result was that landed elites in both eastern and western virginia began to recognize a common interest in quelling social unrest from below.
that was among the reasons that they turned increasingly to the african slave trade to fulfill their need for labor.
african slaves unlike white indentured servants did not need to be released after a fixed term and hence did not threaten to become an unstable landless class.
the growth of new england the northern regions of british north america were slower to attract settlers than those in the south.
that was in part because the plymouth company was never able to mount a successful colonizing expedition after receiving its charter in 1606.
it did however sponsor other explorations.
captain john smith after his departure from jamestown made 32 chapter 2 an exploratory journey for the plymouth merchants wrote an enthusiastic pamphlet about the lands he had seen and called them new england.
plymouth plantation a discontented congregation of puritan separatists in england unconnected to the plymouth company established the first enduring european settlement in new england.
in 1608 a congregation of separatists from the english hamlet of scrooby began emigrating quietly and illegally a few at a time to leyden holland where they believed they could enjoy freedom of worship.
but as foreigners in holland they had to work at unskilled and poorly paid jobs.
they also watched with alarm as their children began to adapt to dutch society and drift away from their church.
finally some of the separatists decided to move again across the atlantic there they hoped to create a stable protected community where they could spread the gospel of the kingdom of christ in those remote parts of the world in 1620 leaders of the scrooby group obtained permission from the virginia company to settle in virginia.
the pilgrims as they saw themselves sailed from plymouth england plymouth founded in september 1620 on the mayflower thirty five saints puritan separatists and sixty seven strangers people who were not part of the congregation were aboard.
in november after a long and difficult voyage they sighted land the shore of what is now cape cod.
that had not been their destination but it was too late in the year to sail farther south.
so the pilgrims chose a site for their settlement in the area just north of the cape a place john smith had labeled plymouth on a map he had drawn during his earlier exploration of new england.
because plymouth lay outside the london companys territory the settlers were not bound by the companys rules.
while still aboard ship the saints in the group drew up an agreement the mayflower compact to establish a government for themselves.
then on december 21 1620 they stepped ashore at plymouth rock.
the pilgrims first winter was a difficult one.
half the colonists perished from malnutrition disease and exposure.
but the colony survived in large part because of crucial pilgrim indian interaction assistance from local indians.
trade and other exchanges with the indians were critical to the settlers and attractive to the natives.
the tribes provided the colonists with furs.
they also showed the settlers how to cultivate corn and how to hunt wild animals for meat.
after the first autumn harvest the settlers invited the natives to join them in a festival the original thanksgiving.
but the relationship between the settlers and the local indians was not a happy one for long.
thirteen years after the pilgrims arrived a devastating smallpox epidemic a result of natives exposure to europeans carrying the disease wiped out much of the indian population around plymouth.
the pilgrims could not create rich farms on the sandy and marshy soil around plymouth but they developed a profitable trade in fish and furs.
new colonists arrived from england and in a decade the population reached 300.
the people of plymouth plantation chose as their governor william bradford who governed successfully for many years.
the pilgrims were always poor.
as late as the 1640s they had only one plow among them.
but they were on the whole content to be left alone to live their lives in what they considered godly ways.
motives of english separatists the massachusetts bay experiment events in england encouraged other puritans to migrate to the new world.
king james i had repressed puritans for years.
when he died in 1625 his son and successor charles i was even more hostile to puritans and imprisoned many of them for their beliefs.
the transplantations and borderlands 33 king dissolved parliament in 1629 it was not recalled until 1640 ensuring that there would be no one in a position to oppose him.
in the midst of this turmoil a group of puritan merchants began organizing a new colonial venture in america.
they obtained a grant of land in new england for most of the area now comprising massachusetts and new hampshire.
they acquired a charter from the king allowing them to create the massachusetts bay company and to establish a colony in the new world.
some members of the massachusetts bay company wanted to create a refuge in new england for puritans.
they bought out the interests of company members who preferred to stay in england and the new owners elected a governor john winthrop.
they then sailed for new england in 1630.
with 17 ships and 1 000 people it was the largest single migration of its kind in the seventeenth century.
winthrop carried with him the charter of the massachusetts bay company which massachusetts bay company meant that the colonists would be responsible to no company officials in england.
portrait of a boston woman anne pollard a member of the original winthrop expedition to boston was 100 years old when this portrait was painted in 1721.
when she died in 1725 she left 130 direct descendants.
the artist is unknown but it is assumed to be an american working in the primitive style common in new england before the arrival of academically trained portraitists from england.
massachusetts historical society boston ma usa bridgeman images 34 chapter 2 the massachusetts migration quickly produced several settlements.
the port of boston became the capital but in the course of the next decade colonists established several other towns in eastern massachusetts charlestown newtown later renamed cambridge roxbury dorchester watertown ipswich concord sudbury and others.
the massachusetts puritans strove to lead useful conscientious lives of thrift and hard work and they honored material success as evidence of gods favor.
winthrop and the winthrops city upon a hill other founders of massachusetts believed they were building a holy commonwealth a model a city upon a hill for the corrupt world to see and emulate.
colonial massachusetts was a theocracy a society in which the church was almost indistinguishable from the state.
residents had no more freedom of worship than the puritans themselves had had in england.
like other new settlements the massachusetts bay colony had early difficulties.
during the first winter 1629 1630 nearly 200 people died and many others decided to leave.
but the colony soon grew and prospered.
the nearby pilgrims and neighboring indians helped with food and advice.
incoming settlers brought needed tools and other goods.
the prevalence of families in the colony helped establish a feeling of commitment to the community and a sense of order among the settlers and it also ensured that the population would reproduce itself.
the expansion of new england it did not take long for english settlement to begin moving outward from massachusetts bay.
some people migrated in search of soil more productive than the stony land around boston.
others left because of the oppressiveness of the church dominated government of massachusetts.
the connecticut river valley about 100 miles west of boston began attracting english families as early as the 1630s because of its fertile lands and its isolation from massachusetts bay.
in 1635 thomas hooker a minister of newtown cambridge defied the massachusetts government led his congregation west and established the town of hartford.
four years later the people of hartford and of two other newly founded towns connecticut nearby adopted a constitution known as the fundamental orders of connecticut which created an independent colony with a government similar to that of massachusetts bay but gave a larger proportion of the men the right to vote and hold office.
women were barred from voting virtually everywhere.
another connecticut colony grew up around new haven on the connecticut coast.
unlike hartford the fundamental articles of new haven 1639 established a bible based government even stricter than that of massachusetts bay.
new haven remained independent until 1662 when a royal charter officially gave the hartford colony jurisdiction over the new haven settlements.
european settlement in what is now rhode island was a result of the religious and political dissent of roger williams a controversial young minister who lived for a time in salem massachusetts.
williams was a confirmed separatist who argued that the massachusetts church should abandon all allegiance to the church of england.
he also proclaimed that the land the colonists were occupying belonged to the natives.
the colonial government voted to deport him but he escaped before they could do so.
during the winter of 1635 1636 he took refuge with narragansett tribesmen the following spring he bought a tract of land from them and with a few followers created the town of providence.

the second much larger settlement began in boston in 1630 and spread rapidly through western massachusetts north into new hampshire and maine and south into connecticut.
why would the settlers of massachusetts bay have expanded so much more rapidly and expansively than those of plymouth.
g overnment similar to that of massachusetts but without any roger williams and rhode island ties to the church.
for a time rhode island was the only colony in which all faiths including judaism could worship without interference.
another challenge to the established religious order in massachusetts bay came from anne hutchinson an intelligent and charismatic woman from a substantial anne hutchinson boston family.
she argued that many clergy were not among the elect and were therefore entitled to no spiritual authority.
such teachings known as the antinomian heresy co ns ider t he s o urc e cotton mather on the recent history of new england 1692 reviewing the history of english settlers during the seventeenth century puritan cleric cotton mather in this excerpt from his history of new england saw the devil as the root of mishap and evil.
he demonstrated a real mistrust of indians and saw them as servants of the devil.
i believe there never was a poor plantation more pursued by the wrath of the devil than our poor new england and that which makes our condition very much the more deplorable is that the wrath of the great god himself at the same time also presses hard upon us.
it was a rousing alarm to the devil when a great company of english protestants and puritans came to erect evangelical churches in a corner of the world where he had reigned without any control for many ages and it is a vexing eye sore to the devil that our lord christ should be known and owned and preached in this howling wilderness.
wherefore he has left no stone unturned that so he might undermine this plantation and force us out of our country.
first the indian powwows used all their sorceries to molest the first planters here but god said unto them touch them not then seducing spirits came to root in this vineyard but god so rated them off that they have not prevailed much farther than the edges of our land.
after this we have had a continual blast upon some of our principal grain annually diminishing a vast part of our ordinary food.
herewithal wasting sicknesses especially burning and mortal agues have shot the arrows of death in at our windows.
next we have had many adversaries of our own language who have been perpetually assaying to deprive us of those english liberties in the encouragement whereof these territories have been 36 settled.
as if this had not been enough the tawnies among whom we came have watered our soil with the blood of many hundreds of our inhabitants.
desolating fires also have many times laid the chief treasure of the whole province in ashes.
as for losses by sea they have been multiplied upon us and particularly in the present french war the whole english nation have observed that no part of the nation has proportionately had so many vessels taken as our poor new england.
besides all which now at last the devils are if i may so speak in person come down upon us with such a wrath as is justly much and will quickly be more the astonishment of the world.
alas i may sigh over this wilderness as moses did over his in psalm 90 7 9 we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath we are troubled all our days are passed away in thy wrath and i may add this unto it the wrath of the devil too has been troubling and spending of us all our days.
let us now make a good and a right use of the prodigious descent which the devil in great wrath is at this day making upon our land.
upon the death of a great man once an orator called the town together crying out concurrite cives dilapsa cunt vestra moenia that is come together neighbors your town walls are fallen down but such is the descent of the devil at this day upon our selves that i may truly tell you the walls of the whole world are broken down.
the usual walls of defense about mankind have such a gap made in them that the very devils are broke in upon us to seduce the souls torment the bodies sully the credits and consume the estates of our neighbors with impressions both as real and as furious as if the invisible world were becoming incarnate on purpose for the vexing of us.
in as much as the devil is come down in great wrath we had need labor with all the care and speed we can to divert the great wrath of heaven from coming at the same time upon us.
the god of heaven has with long and loud admonitions been calling us to a reformation of our provoking evils as the only way to avoid that wrath of his which does not only threaten but consume us.
it is because we have been deaf to those calls that we are now by a provoked god laid open to the wrath of the devil himself.

were a serious threat to the spiritual authority of the established clergy.
hutchinson also challenged prevailing assumptions about the proper role of women in puritan society.
as her influence grew and as she began to deliver open attacks on members of the clergy the massachusetts hierarchy mobilized to stop her.
in 1637 she was convicted of heresy and sedition and was banished.
with her family and some of her followers she moved to a point on narragansett bay not far from providence.
later she moved south into new york where in 1643 she and her family died during an indian uprising.
new hampshire and maine were established in 1629 by two english proprietors.
but few settlers moved into these northern regions until the religious new hampshire and maine disruptions in massachusetts bay.
in 1639 john wheelwright a disciple of anne hutchinson led some of his fellow dissenters to exeter new hampshire.
others soon followed.
new hampshire became a separate colony in 1679.
maine remained a part of massachusetts until 1820.
settlers and natives the first white settlers in new england had generally friendly relations with the natives.
indians taught whites how to grow vital food crops such as corn beans pumpkins and squash.
european farmers also benefited from the extensive lands indians had already cleared and had either abandoned or sold.
white traders used indians as partners in some of their most important trading activities.
indeed commerce with the indians was responsible for the creation of some of the first great fortunes in british north america.
other white settlers attempted to educate the indians in european religion and culture.
protestant missionaries converted some natives to christianity and a few indians became at least partially assimilated into white society.
but the great majority continued to practice their traditional faiths.
as in other areas of white settlement however tensions soon developed primarily as a result of the white colonists insatiable appetite for land and uneven respect for indian culture and beliefs.
the religious leaders of new england came to consider the tribes a threat to their hopes of creating a godly community in the new world.
see consider the source cotton mather on the recent history of new england gradually the image of indians as helpful neighbors came to be replaced by the image of indians as heathens and barbarians.
37 38 chapter 2 king philips war and the technology of battle in 1637 hostilities broke out between english settlers in the connecticut valley and the pequot indians of the region a conflict known as the pequot war in which the natives were almost wiped out.
but the bloodiest and most prolonged encounter between whites and indians in the seventeenth century began in 1675 a conflict that whites called king philips war.
the wampanoag tribe under the leadership of a chieftain known to the metacomet white settlers as king philip and among his own people as metacomet rose up to resist the english.
for three years the natives terrorized a string of massachusetts towns killing over a thousand people.
but beginning in 1676 the white settlers gradually prevailed enlisting a group of mohawk allies who ambushed metacomet and killed him.
without metacomet the fragile alliance among the tribes collapsed and the white settlers were soon able to crush the uprising.
the conflicts between natives and settlers were crucially affected by earlier exchanges of technology between the english and the tribes.
in particular the indians made effective use of a relatively new european weapon that they had acquired from the english the flintlock muskets flintlock rifle.
it replaced the earlier staple of colonial musketry the matchlock rifle which proved too heavy cumbersome and inaccurate to be effective.
the matchlock had to be steadied on a fixed object and ignited with a match before firing.
the flintlock could be held up without support and fired without a match.
an english artist drew this view of a fortified pequot village in connecticut surrounded by english soldiers and their allies from other tribes during the pequot war in 1637.
the invaders massacred more than 600 residents of the settlement.
the library of congress a pequot village destroyed transplantations and borderlands 39 many english settlers were slow to give up their matchlocks but the indians recognized the advantages of the newer rifles right away and began purchasing them in large quantities.
despite rules forbidding colonists to instruct natives on how to use and repair the weapons the natives learned to handle the rifles and even to repair them very effectively on their own.
in king philips war the very high casualties on both sides were partly a result of the use of these more advanced rifles.
indians also used more traditional military technologies especially the construction of forts.
the narragansett allies of the wampanoag in king philips war built an enormous fort in the great swamp of rhode island in 1675 which became the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the war before english attackers burned it down.
after that a band of narragansett set out to build a large stone fort with the help of a member of the tribe who had learned masonry while working with the english.
when english soldiers discovered the stone fort in 1676 after the end of king philips war they killed most of its occupants and destroyed it.
in the end the technological skills of the indians were no match for the overwhelming advantages of the english settlers in both numbers and firepower.
the restoration colonies for nearly thirty years after lord baltimore received the charter for maryland in 1632 no new english colonies were established in america.
england was dealing with troubles of its own at home.
the english civil war after charles i dissolved parliament in 1629 and began ruling as an absolute monarch he alienated a growing number of his subjects.
finally desperately in need of money charles called parliament back into session in 1640 and asked it to levy new taxes.
but he antagonized the members by dismissing them twice in two years and in 1642 members of parliament organized a military force sparking the english civil war.
the conflict between the cavaliers the supporters of the king and the roundheads the forces of parliament who were largely puritans lasted seven years.
in 1649 the roundheads defeated the kings forces and shocked all of the restoration of the monarchy europe by beheading the monarch.
the stern roundhead leader oliver cromwell assumed the position of protector but when cromwell died in 1658 his son and heir proved unable to maintain his authority.
two years later charles ii son of the executed king returned from exile and seized the throne in what became known as the restoration.
among the results of the restoration was the resumption of colonization in america.
charles ii rewarded faithful courtiers with grants of land in the new world and in the twenty five years of his reign he issued charters for four additional colonies carolina new york new jersey and pennsylvania.
charles ii faced some of the same problems that his father had confronted mostly because of the popular belief that he was secretly a roman catholic.
the king supported religious toleration which would allow catholicism again in england to the dismay of many protestants.
the parliament refused to agree.
charles was prudent enough not to 40 chapter 2 fight for the right of catholics to worship openly.
but he himself made a private agreement with louis xiv of france that he would become a catholic which he did only on his deathbed.
his brother james ii faced many of the same problems.
the carolinas in charters issued in 1663 and 1665 charles ii awarded joint title to eight proprietors.
they received a vast territory stretching south from virginia to the florida peninsula and west to the pacific ocean.
like lord baltimore they received almost kingly p owers over their grant which they prudently called carolina a name derived from the latin word for charles.
they reserved tremendous estates for themselves and distributed the rest through a headright system similar to those in virginia and maryland.
although committed anglicans themselves the proprietors guaranteed religious freedom to all christian faiths.
they also created a representative assembly.
they hoped to attract settlers from the existing american colonies and to avoid the expense of financing expeditions from england.
but their initial efforts to profit from settlement in carolina failed dismally.
anthony ashley cooper however persisted.
he convinced the other proprietors to finance expeditions to carolina from england the first of which set sail with 300 people in the spring of 1670.
the 100 people who survived the difficult voyage established a settlement at port royal on the carolina coast.
ten years later they founded a city at the junction of charles town the ashley and cooper rivers which in 1690 became the colonial capital.
they called it charles town it was later renamed charleston.
with the aid of the english philosopher john locke cooper now the earl of shaftesbury drew up the fundamental constitution for carolina in 1669.
it divided the colony into counties of equal size and divided each county into equal parcels.
it also established a social hierarchy with the proprietors themselves who were to be known as seigneurs at the top a local aristocracy consisting of lesser nobles known as landgraves or caciques below them and then ordinary settlers leet men.
at the bottom of this stratified society would be poor whites who would have few political rights and african slaves.
proprietors nobles and other landholders would have a voice in the colonial parliament in proportion to the size of their landholdings.
in reality carolina developed along lines quite different from the carefully ordered vision of shaftesbury and locke.
for one thing the northern and southern regions of settlement were widely separated and socially and economically distinct from each other.
the northern settlers were mainly backwoods farmers.
in the south fertile lands and the good harbor at charles town promoted a more prosperous economy and a more stratified aristocratic society.
settlements grew up rapidly along the ashley and cooper rivers and colonists established a flourishing trade particularly beginning in the 1660s in rice.
southern carolina very early developed commercial ties to the large and overpopuclose ties with the caribbean lated european colony on the caribbean island of barbados.
during the first ten years of settlement in fact most of the new residents in carolina were barbadians some of whom established themselves as substantial landlords.
african slavery had taken root on barbados earlier than in any of the mainland colonies and the white caribbean migrants tough uncompromising profit seekers established a similar slave based plantation society in carolina.
carolina was one of the most divided english colonies in america.
there were tensions between the small farmers of the albemarle region in the north and the wealthy planters transplantations and borderlands 41 in the south.
and there were conflicts between the rich barbadians in carolina divided southern carolina and the smaller landowners around them.
after lord shaftesburys death the proprietors proved unable to establish order.
in 1719 the colonists seized control of the colony from them.
ten years later the king divided the region into two royal colonies north carolina and south carolina.
new netherland new york and new jersey in 1664 charles ii granted his brother james the duke of york all the territory lying between the connecticut and delaware rivers.
this land however was also claimed by the dutch.
the growing conflict between the english and the dutch was part of a larger commercial rivalry between the two nations throughout the world.
but the english particularly rejected the dutch presence in america because it served as a wedge between the northern and southern english colonies and because it provided bases for dutch smugglers evading english custom laws.
and so months after james received the grant an english fleet under the command of richard nicolls put in at new amsterdam the capital of the dutch colony of new netherland and extracted a surrender from the governor peter stuyvesant.
several years later in 1673 the dutch reconquered and briefly held their old provincial capital.
but they lost it again this time for good in 1674.
the duke of york renamed his territory new york.
it contained not only dutch and english but also scandinavians germans french and a large number of africans new york imported as slaves by the dutch west india company as well as members of several different indian tribes.
james wisely made no effort to impose his own roman catholicism on the colony.
he delegated powers to a governor and a council but made no provision for representative assemblies.
property holding and political power remained highly divided and highly unequal in new york.
in addition to confirming the great dutch patroonships already in existence james granted large estates to some of his own political supporters.
power in the colony thus remained widely dispersed among wealthy english landlords dutch patroons wealthy fur traders and the dukes political appointees.
by 1685 when the duke of york ascended the english throne as james ii new york contained about four times as many people around 30 000 as it had twenty years before.
shortly after james received his charter he gave a large part of the land south of new york to a pair of political allies both carolina proprietors sir john berkeley and sir george carteret.
carteret named the territory new jersey.
but the new jersey venture in new jersey generated few profits and in 1674 berkeley sold his half interest.
the colony was divided into two jurisdictions east jersey and west jersey which squabbled with each other until 1702 when the two halves of the colony were again joined.
new jersey like new york was a colony of enormous ethnic and religious diversity and the weak colonial government made few efforts to impose strict control over the fragmented society.
but unlike new york new jersey developed no important class of large landowners.
the quaker colonies pennsylvania was born out of the efforts of a dissenting english protestant sect the society of friends.
they wished to find a home for their own distinctive social order.
the society began in the mid seventeenth century under the leadership of george fox a nottingham 42 chapter 2 shoemaker and margaret fell.
their followers came to be known as quakers from foxs instruction to them to tremble at the name of the lord.
unlike the puritans quakers rejected the concept of predestination and original sin.
all people they believed had divinity within themselves and needed only learn to cultivate it all could attain salvation.
the quakers had no formal church government and no paid clergy in their worship they the quakers spoke up one by one as the spirit moved them.
disregarding distinctions of gender and class they addressed one another with the terms thee and thou words commonly used in other parts of english society only in speaking to servants and social inferiors.
as confirmed pacifists they would not take part in wars.
unpopular in england the quakers began looking to america for asylum.
a few migrated to new england or carolina but most quakers wanted a colony of their own.
as members of a despised sect however they could not get the necessary royal grant without the aid of someone influential at the court.
fortunately for the quaker cause a number of wealthy and prominent men had converted to the faith.
one of them was william penn an outspoken evangelist who had been in prison several times.
penn worked with george fox on plans for a quaker colony in america and when penns father died in 1681 charles ii settled a large debt he had owed to the older penn by making an enormous grant to the son of territory between new york and maryland.
at the kings insistence the territory was to be named pennsylvania after penns late father.
through his informative and honest advertising penn soon made pennsylvania the pennsylvania established best known and most cosmopolitan of all the english colonies in america.
more than any other english colony pennsylvania prospered from the outset because of penns successful recruiting his careful planning and the regions mild climate and fertile soil.
penn sailed to pennsylvania in 1682 to oversee the laying out of the city he named philadelphia brotherly love between the delaware and schuylkill rivers.
penns relatively good relations with the indians were a result in large part of his religious beliefs.
quakerism was a faith that included a refusal to participate in war or any violence and that believed that all people whatever their background were capable of becoming christian.
penn worked to respect the natives and their culture.
he recognized indians claim to the land in the province and he was usually scrupulous in reimbursing the natives for their land.
in later years the relationships between the english residents of pennsylvania and the natives were not always so peaceful.
by the late 1690s some residents of pennsylvania were beginning to resist the nearly absolute power of the proprietor.
pressure from these groups grew to the point that in 1701 shortly before he departed for england for the last time penn agreed to a charter charter of liberties of liberties for the colony.
the charter established a representative assembly consisting alone among the english colonies of only one house that greatly limited the authority of the proprietor.
the charter also permitted the lower counties of the colony to establish their own representative assembly.
the three counties did so in 1703 and as a result became in effect a separate colony delaware although until the american revolution it continued to have the same governor as pennsylvania.
borderlands and middle grounds the english colonies clustered along the atlantic seaboard of north america eventually united expanded and became the beginnings of a powerful nation.
but in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries their future was not at all clear.
in those years they were small frail settlements surrounded by other competing societies and transplantations and borderlands 43 settlements.
the british empire in north america was in fact a much smaller and weaker one than the great spanish empire to the south and in many ways weaker than the enormous french empire to the north.
the continuing contests for control of north america were most clearly visible in areas around the borders of english settlement the caribbean and along the northern southern and western borders of the coastal colonies.
in the regions of complex cultural interactions the borderlands emerged societies very different from those in the english seaboard colonies areas described as middle grounds in which diverse civilizations encountered one another and for a time at least shaped one another.
the caribbean islands the chesapeake was the site of the first permanent english settlements in the north american continent.
throughout the first half of the seventeenth century however the most important destinations for english immigrants were the islands of the caribbean and the northern way station of bermuda.
more than half of the english migrants to the new world in the early seventeenth century settled on these islands.
before the arrival of europeans most of the caribbean islands had substantial native populations.
but beginning with christopher columbuss first visit in 1492 and accelerating after 1496 the native populations were all but wiped out by european epidemics.
the spanish empire claimed title to all the islands in the caribbean but spain created substantial settlements only in the largest of them cuba hispaniola and puerto rico.
english french and dutch traders began settling on some of the smaller islands early in the sixteenth century despite the spanish claim to them.
after spain and the netherlands went to war in 1621 distracting the spanish navy and leaving the the english caribbean english in the caribbean relatively unmolested the pace of english colonization increased.
by midcentury there were several substantial english settlements on the islands the most important of them on antigua st kitts jamaica and barbados.
in their first years in the caribbean english settlers experimented unsuccessfully with tobacco and cotton.
but they soon discovered that the most lucrative crop was sugar for which there was a substantial and growing market in europe.
sugarcane could also be distilled into rum for which there was also a booming market abroad.
planters devoted almost all of their land to sugarcane.
because sugar was a labor intensive crop english planters quickly found it necessary to import laborers.
as in the chesapeake they began by bringing indentured sugar and slavery servants from england.
but the arduous work discouraged white laborers.
by midcentury therefore the english planters in the caribbean like the spanish colonists were relying more and more heavily on an enslaved african workforce which soon substantially outnumbered them.
on barbados and other islands where a flourishing sugar economy developed the english planters were a tough aggressive and ambitious people.
since their livelihoods depended on their workforces they expanded and solidified the system of african slavery there remarkably quickly.
by the late seventeenth century there were four times as many african slaves as there were white settlers.
masters and slaves in the caribbean fearful of slave revolts whites in the caribbean monitored their labor forces closely and often harshly.
planters paid little attention to the welfare of their workers.
many concluded that it was cheaper to buy new slaves periodically than to protect the well being of those 44 chapter 2 they already owned and it was not uncommon for masters literally to work their slaves to death.
few african workers survived more than a decade in the brutal caribbean working environment they were either sold to planters in north america or died.
even whites who worked far less hard than did the slaves often succumbed to the harsh climate most died before the age of forty.
establishing a stable society and culture was extremely difficult for people living in such harsh and even deadly conditions.
white landowners in the caribbean islands returned to england with their fortunes when they could and left their estates in the hands of overseers.
europeans in the caribbean lacked many of the institutions that gave stability to the north american settlements church family community.
africans in the caribbean faced much greater difficulties than did whites but because they had no chance of leaving they created what was in many ways a more elaborate culture than did the white settlers.
they started families although many of them were slave culture and resistance broken up by death or the slave trade they sustained african religious and social traditions and they blended them with church rituals to create their new signature expression of faith.
and within the rigidly controlled world of the sugar plantations they established patterns of resistance.
the caribbean settlements were an important part of the atlantic trading world in which many americans became involved a source of sugar and rum and a market for goods made in the mainland colonies and in england.
they were the first principal source of african slaves for the mainland colonies.
harsh conditions for slaves the southwest borderlands by the end of the seventeenth century the spanish had established a sophisticated and impressive empire.
their capital mexico city was the most dazzling metropolis in the americas.
the spanish residents well over a million enjoyed much greater prosperity than all but a few english settlers in north america.
but the principal spanish colonies north of mexico florida texas new mexico arizona and california were relatively unimportant economically to the empire.
they attracted religious minorities catholic missionaries and independent ranchers spanish outposts in north america fleeing the heavy hand of imperial authority.
spanish troops defended the northern flank of the empire.
but they remained weak and peripheral parts of the great empire to their south.
new mexico was the most prosperous and populous of these spanish outposts.
by the end of the eighteenth century new mexico had a non indian population of over 10 000 the largest european settlement west of the mississippi and north of mexico and it was steadily expanding through the region.
the spanish began to colonize california once they realized that other europeans among them english merchants and french and russian trappers were beginning to establish a presence in the region.
formal spanish settlement of california began in the 1760s when the governor of baja california was ordered to create outposts of the empire farther north.
soon a string of missions forts or presidios and trading communities were springing up along the pacific coast beginning with san diego and monterey in 1769 and eventually san francisco 1776 los angeles 1781 and california santa barbara 1786.
the arrival of the spanish in california had a devastating effect on the native population who died in great numbers from the diseases the colonists imported.
as the new settlements spread the spanish insisted that the transplantations and borderlands 45 remaining natives convert to catholicism.
that explains the centrality of missions in almost all the major spanish outposts in california.
but the spanish colonists were also intent on creating a prosperous agricultural economy and they enlisted indian laborers to help them do so.
californias indians had no choice but to accede to the demands of the spanish although there were frequent revolts by natives against the harsh conditions imposed on them.
the spanish considered the greatest threat to the northern borders of their empire to be the growing ambitions of the french.
in the 1680s french explorers french and spanish claims traveled down the mississippi valley to the mouth of the river and claimed those lands for france in 1682.
they called the territory louisiana.
fearful of french incursions farther west the spanish began to fortify their claim to texas by establishing new forts missions and settlements there including san fernando later san antonio in 1731.
much of the region that is now arizona was also becoming increasingly tied to the spanish empire and was governed from santa fe.
the spanish colonies in the southwest were the sparsely populated edges of the great spanish empire to the south created less to increase the wealth of the empire than to defend it from threats by other european powers in the north.
nevertheless these spanish outposts helped create enduring societies that were very unlike those being established by the english along the atlantic seaboard.
the spanish colonies did not displace the native populations.
rather they enlisted them.
they sought to convert them to catholicism to recruit them sometimes forcibly as agricultural workers and to cultivate them as trading partners.
the southeast borderlands the southeastern areas of what is now the united states posed a direct challenge to english ambitions in north america.
after spain claimed florida in the 1560s missionaries and traders began moving northward into georgia and westward into what is now known as the florida panhandle.
some ambitious spaniards began to dream of expanding their empire still farther north into what became the carolinas and beyond.
the founding of jamestown in 1607 dampened those hopes and replaced them with the spanish threat fears.
the english colonies the spaniards worried could threaten their existing settlements in florida and georgia.
as a result the spanish built forts in both regions to defend themselves against the increasing english presence there.
throughout the eighteenth century the area between the carolinas and florida was the site of continuing tension and frequent conflict between the spanish and the english and to a lesser degree between the spanish and the french who were threatening their northwestern borders with settlements in louisiana and in what is now alabama.
there was no formal war between england and spain in these years but that did not dampen the hostilities in the southeast.
english pirates continually harassed the spanish settlements and in 1668 actually sacked st augustine.
the english encouraged indians in florida to rise up against the spanish missions.
the spanish offered freedom to african slaves owned by english settlers in the carolinas if they agreed to convert to catholicism.
about 100 africans accepted the offer and the spanish later organized some of them into a military regiment to defend the northern border of new spain.
by the early eighteenth century the constant fighting in the region had driven almost all the spanish out of florida except for settlers in st augustine on the atlantic coast and pensacola on the gulf coast.
46 chapter 2 eventually after more than a century of conflict in the southeastern borderlands the english prevailed acquiring florida in the aftermath of the seven years war known in america as the french and indian war and rapidly populating it with settlers from their colonies to the north.
before that point however protecting the southern boundary of the british empire in north america was a continual concern to the english and contributed in crucial ways to the founding of the colony of georgia.
the founding of georgia georgia the last english colony to be established in what would become the united states was founded to create a military barrier against spanish lands on the southern border of english america.
it was also designed to provide a refuge for the impoverished a place where english men and women without prospects at home could begin anew.
its founders led by general james oglethorpe served as unpaid trustees of a society created to serve the needs of the british empire.
oglethorpe himself a veteran of the most recent spanish wars with england was keenly aware of the military advantages of an english colony south of the carolinas.
yet oglethorpes mission his interest in settlement rested even more on his philanthropic commitments.
as head of a parliamentary committee investigating english prisons he had been appalled by the plight of honest debtors rotting in confinement.
such prisoners this view of savannah by an english artist shows the intensely orderly character of early settlement in the georgia colony.
as the colony grew its residents gradually abandoned the plan created by oglethorpe and his fellow trustees.
historic map works getty images savannah in 1734 transplantations and borderlands 47 and other poor people in danger of succumbing to a similar fate could he believed become the farmer soldiers of the new colony in america.
in 1732 king george ii granted oglethorpe and his fellow trustees control of the land between the savannah and altamaha rivers.
their colonization policies reflected the vital military purposes of the colony.
they limited the size of landholdings to make the settlement compact and easier to defend against spanish and indian attacks.
georgia founded they excluded africans free or slave oglethorpe feared that slave labor would produce internal revolts and that disaffected slaves might turn to the spanish as allies.
the trustees strictly regulated trade with the indians again to limit the possibility of wartime insurrection.
they also excluded catholics for fear they might collude with their coreligionists in the spanish colonies to the south.
oglethorpe himself led the first colonial expedition to georgia which built a fortified town at the mouth of the savannah river in 1733 and later constructed additional forts south of the altamaha.
in the end only a few debtors were released from jail and sent to georgia.
instead the trustees brought hundreds of impoverished tradesmen and artisans from england and scotland and many religious refugees from switzerland and germany.
among the immigrants was a small group of jews.
english settlers made up a lower proportion of the european population of georgia than of any other english colony.
oglethorpe whom some residents of georgia began calling our perpetual dictator created almost constant dissensions and conflict through his heavy handed regulation of the colony.
he also suffered military disappointments such as a 1740 assault on the spanish outpost at st augustine florida which ended in failure.
georgias political evolution gradually as the threats from spain receded he lost his grip on the colony which over time became more like the rest of british north america with an elected legislature that loosened the restrictions on settlers.
georgia continued to grow more slowly than the other southern colonies but in other ways it now developed along lines roughly similar to those of south carolina.
middle grounds the struggle for the north american continent was not just one among competing european empires.
it was also a series of contests among the many different peoples who shared the continent the spanish english french dutch and other colonists on one hand and the many indian tribes with whom they shared the continent on the other.
in some parts of the british empire virginia and new england for example english settlers quickly established their dominance subjugating and displacing most natives until they had established societies that were dominated almost entirely by europeans.
but in other regions the balance of power shifted for many years.
along the western borders of english settlement in particular europeans and indians lived together in regions in which neither side was able to establish clear dominance.
in these middle grounds the two populations despite frequent conflicts carved out ways of living together with each side making concessions to the other.
see debating the past native americans and the middle ground these were the peripheries of empires in which the influence of formal colonial governments was at times almost invisible.
european settlers and the soldiers scattered in forts throughout these regions to protect them were unable to displace the indians.
so they had to carve out their own relationships with the tribes.
in those relationships debating the past native americans and the middle ground for many generations historians chronicling the westward movement of european settlement in north america portrayed native americans largely as weak and inconvenient obstacles swept aside by the inevitable progress of civilization indians were presented either as murderous savages or as relatively docile allies of white people but rarely as important actors of their own.
francis parkman the great nineteenth century american historian described indians as a civilization crushed and scorned by the march of european powers in the new world.
many subsequent historians departed little from his assessment.
in more recent years historians have challenged this traditional view by examining how white civilization victimized the tribes.
gary nashs red white and black 1974 was one of the important modern presentations of this approach and ramon guttierezs when jesus came the corn mothers went 1991 was a more recent contribution.
they and other scholars rejected the optimistic progressive view of white triumph over adversity and presented instead a picture of white brutality and futile indian resistance ending in defeat.
more recently however a new view of the relationship between the peoples of the old and new worlds has emerged.
it sees native americans and euro americans as uneasy partners in the shaping of a new society in which for a time at least both were a vital part.
richard whites influential 1991 book the middle ground was among the first important statements of this view.
48 white examined the culture of the great lakes region in the eighteenth century in which algonquian indians created a series of complex trading and political relationships with french english and american settlers and travelers.
in this borderland between the growing european settlements in the east and the still largely intact indian civilizations farther west a new kind of hybrid society emerged in which many cultures intermingled.
james merrells into the american woods 1999 contributed further to this new view of collaboration by examining the world of negotiators and go betweens along the western pennsylvania frontier in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
like white he emphasized the complicated blend of european and native american diplomatic rituals that allowed both groups to conduct business make treaties and keep the peace.
daniel richter extended the idea of a middle ground further in two important books the ordeal of the long house 1992 and facing east from indian country 2001.
richter demonstrates that the iroquois confederacy was an active participant in the power relationships in the hudson river basin and in his later book he tells the story of european colonization from the native american perspective revealing how western myths of first contact such as the story of john smith and pocahontas look entirely different when seen through the eyes of native americans who remained in many ways the more powerful of the two societies in the seventeenth century.
how did these important collaborations collapse.
what happened to the middle ground.
over time the delicate partnerships along the frontiers of white settlement gave way to the sheer numbers of europeans and in some places africans who moved westward.
joyce chaplins subject matter 2001 argues as well that old world americans at first admired the natives as a kind of natural nobility until european diseases ravaged the tribes.
their vulnerability to disease strengthened the sense of superiority among europeans that had been a part of their view of indians from the beginning.
jill lepores the name of war 1998 describes how the violence of king philips war in seventeenth century new england helped transform english views of the tribes.
that was because of the white victory over the indians and because of their success in turning this victory into a rationale for the moral superiority of europeans.
in fact europeans had used at least as much savagery against the natives as the natives had used against them.
as the pressures of white settlement grew as the indian populations weakened as a result of disease and war and as the relationship between the tribes and the european settlers grew more and more unequal the cultural middle ground that for many decades characterized much of the contact between the old and new worlds gradually disappeared.
by the time historians began seriously chronicling this story in the late nineteenth century the indian tribes had indeed become the defeated helpless obstacles that they portrayed.
but for generations before the relationship between white americans and native americans was much more equal than it later became.
understand analyze evaluate 1.
how have historians views of native americans and their role in the european colonization of north america changed over time.
why did the middle ground between native americans and european settlers disappear.
the europeans found themselves obligated to adapt to tribal expectations at least as much as the indians had to adapt to european ones.
to the indians the european migrants were both menacing and appealing.
they feared the power of these strange european people their guns their rifles their forts.
but they also wanted the french and british settlers to behave like fathers to help them mediate their own internal disputes to offer them gifts to moderate their conflicts.
europeans came from a world in which the formal institutional and military power of a nation or empire governed relationships between societies.
but the natives had no understanding of the modern notion of a nation and thought much more in terms of ceremony and kinship.
gradually europeans learned to fulfill at least some of their expectations to settle disputes among tribes to moderate conflicts within tribes to participate solemnly in indian ceremonies and to offer gifts as signs of respect.
in the seventeenth century before many english settlers had entered the interior the french were particularly adept at creating successful relationships with the tribes.
french migrants in the interior regions of the continent were often solitary fur traders and some of them welcomed the chance to attach themselves to even to marry within tribes.
they also recognized the importance of treating tribal chiefs with respect and channeling gifts and tributes through them.
but by the mid eighteenth century french influence in the interior was in decline and british settlers gradually became the dominant european group.
eventually the british learned the 49 50 chapter 2 lessons that the french had long ago absorbed that simple commands and raw force were ineffective in creating a workable relationship with the tribes that they too had to learn to deal with indian leaders through gifts and ceremonies and mediation.
in large western regions especially those around the great lakes they established a precarious peace with the tribes that lasted for several decades.
but as the british and after 1776 american presence in the region grew the balance of power between europeans and natives shifted.
newer settlers had difficulty adapting to the complex rituals that the earlier migrants had developed.
the stability of the relationthe shifting balance of power ship between the indians and whites deteriorated.
by the early nineteenth century the middle ground had collapsed replaced by a european world in which indians were ruthlessly subjugated and eventually removed.
nevertheless for a considerable period of early american history the story of the relationship between whites and indians was not simply a story of conquest and subjugation but also in some regions a story of difficult but stable accommodation and tolerance.
elements of a precarious peace the development of empire the english colonies in america had begun as separate projects and for the most part they grew up independent of one another and subject to only nominal control from london.
but by the mid seventeenth century the growing commercial success of the colonial ventures was producing pressure in england for a more uniform structure to the empire.
the english government began trying to regulate colonial trade in the 1650s when parliament passed laws to keep dutch ships out of the english colonies.
later parliament the navigation acts passed three important navigation acts.
the first of them in 1660 closed the colonies to all trade except that carried by english ships.
the british also required that tobacco and other items be exported from the colonies only to england or to english possessions.
the second act in 1663 required that all goods sent from europe to the colonies pass through england on the way where they would be subject to english taxation.
the third act in 1673 imposed duties on the coastal trade among the english colonies and it provided for the appointment of customs officials to enforce the navigation acts.
these acts formed the legal basis of englands regulation of the colonies for a century.
the dominion of new england before the creation of navigation acts all the colonial governments except that of virginia had operated largely independently of the crown with governors chosen by the proprietors or by the colonists themselves and with powerful representative assemblies.
officials in london recognized that to increase their control over the colonies they would have to increase british authority in order to enforce the new laws.
in 1675 the king created a new body the lords of trade to make recommendations lords of trade for imperial reform.
in 1679 the king moved to increase his control over massachusetts.
he stripped it of its authority over new hampshire and chartered a separate royal colony there whose governor he would himself appoint.
and in 1684 citing the colonial assemblys defiance of the navigation acts he revoked the massachusetts charter.
charles iis brother james ii who succeeded him to the throne in 1685 went further.
he created a single dominion of new england which combined the government of transplantations and borderlands 51 massachusetts with the governments of the rest of the new england colonies and later with those of new york and new jersey as well.
he appointed a single governor sir edmund andros to supervise the entire region from boston.
andross sir edmund andros rigid enforcement of the navigation acts and his brusque dismissal of the colonists claims to the rights of englishmen made him highly unpopular.
the glorious revolution james ii unlike his father was openly catholic.
in addition he made powerful enemies when he appointed his fellow catholics to high offices.
the restoration of catholicism in england led to fears that the vatican and the pope would soon overtake the country and that the king would support him.
at the same time james ii tried to control parliament and the courts making himself an absolute monarch.
by 1688 the opposition to the king was so great that parliament voted to force out james ii who showed no resistance to giving up the crown aware of his grandfathers execution.
he eventually left the country and spent the rest of his life in france.
his daughter mary ii and her husband william of orange of the netherlands both protestants replaced james ii to reign jointly.
no catholic monarch has reigned since.
this bloodless coup came to be known as the glorious revolution when bostonians heard of the overthrow of james ii they arrested and imprisoned the unpopular andros.
the new sovereigns in england abolished the dominion of new england and restored separate colonial governments.
in dominion of new england abolished 1691 however they combined massachusetts with plymouth and made it a single royal colony.
the new charter restored the colonial assembly but it gave the crown the right to appoint the governor.
it also replaced church membership with property ownership as the basis for voting and officeholding.
andros had been governing new york through a lieutenant governor captain francis nicholson who enjoyed the support of the wealthy merchants and fur traders of the province.
other less favored colonists had a long accumulation of grievances against nicholson and his allies.
the leader of the new york dissidents was jacob leisler a german merchant.
in may 1689 when news of the glorious revolution and the fall of andros reached new york leisler raised a militia captured the city fort drove nicholson into exile and proclaimed himself the new head of government in new york.
for two years he tried in vain to stabilize his power in the colony amid fierce factional rivalry.
in 1691 when william and mary appointed a new governor leisler briefly resisted.
he was convicted of treason and executed.
fierce rivalry between what became known as the leislerians and the anti leislerians dominated the leislerians and anti leislerians politics of the colony for years thereafter.
in maryland many people wrongly assumed that their proprietor the catholic lord baltimore who was living in england had sided with the catholic james ii and opposed william and mary.
so in 1689 an old opponent of the proprietors government the protestant john coode led a revolt that drove out lord baltimores officials and led to marylands establishment as a royal colony in 1691.
the colonial assembly then established the church of england as the colonys official religion and excluded catholics from public office.
maryland became a proprietary colony again in 1715 after the fifth lord baltimore joined the anglican church.
the glorious revolution of 1688 in england touched off revolutions mostly bloodless ones in several colonies.
under the new king and queen the representative assemblies 52 chapter 2 that had been abolished were revived and the scheme for colonial unification from above was abandoned.
but the glorious revolution in america did not stop the reorganization of the empire.
the new governments that emerged in america actually increased the crowns potential authority.
as the first century of english settlement in america came to its end the colonists were becoming more a part of the imperial system than ever before.
the crowns power conclusion the english colonization of north america was part of a larger effort by several european nations to expand the reach of their increasingly commercial societies.
indeed for many years the british empire in america was among the smallest and weakest of the imperial ventures there overshadowed by the french to the north and the spanish to the south.
in the british colonies along the atlantic seaboard new agricultural and commercial societies gradually emerged those in the south centered on the cultivation of tobacco and cotton and were reliant on slave labor those in the northern colonies centered on more traditional food crops and were based mostly on free labor.
substantial trading centers emerged in such cities as boston new york philadelphia and charles town and a growing proportion of the population became prosperous and settled in these increasingly complex communities.
by the early eighteenth century english settlement had spread from northern new england in what is now maine south into georgia.
but this growing british empire coexisted with and often found itself in conflict with the presence of other europeans most notably the spanish and the french in other areas of north america.
in these borderlands societies did not assume the settled prosperous form they were taking in the tidewater and new england.
they were raw sparsely populated settlements in which europeans including over time increasing numbers of english had to learn to accommodate not only one another but also the still substantial indian tribes with whom they shared these interior lands.
by the middle of the eighteenth century there was a significant european presence across a broad swath of north america from florida to maine and from texas to mexico to california only a relatively small part of it controlled by the british.
but changes were under way within the british empire that would soon lead to its dominance through a much larger area of north america.

most people in both england and america believed that the british colonies were outposts of the british world.
and it is true that as the colonies grew and became more prosperous they also became more english.
some of the early settlers had come to america to escape what they considered english tyranny.
but by the early eighteenth century many perhaps most colonists considered themselves english just as much as the men and women in england itself did.
at the same time however life in the colonies was diverging in many ways from england simply by the nature of the new world.
the physical environment was very different vaster and less tamed.
the population was more diverse as well.
the area that would become the united states was a magnet for immigrants from many lands other than england scotland ireland the european continent eastern russia and the spanish and french empires already established in america.
english north america became as well the destination for thousands of forcibly transplanted africans.
to the degree that the colonists emulated english society they were becoming more and more like one another.
to the degree that they were shaped by the character of their own regions they were becoming more and more different.
54 the colonial population after uncertain beginnings the non indian population of english north america grew rapidly and substantially through continued immigration and through natural increase.
by the late seventeenth century european and african immigrants outnumbered the natives along the atlantic coast.
a few of the early settlers were members of the english upper classes but most were english laborers.
some came independently such as the religious dissenters in early new england.
but in the chesapeake at least three fourths of the immigrants in the seventeenth century arrived as i ndentured servants.
indentured servitude the system of temporary or indentured servitude developed out of practices in england.
young men and women bound themselves to masters for fixed terms of servitude usually four to five years in exchange for passage to america food and shelter.
their passage to america was a terrible trial of want and hunger.
see consider the source gottlieb mittelberger the passage of indentured servants male indentures were supposed to receive clothing tools and occasionally land upon completion of their service.
in reality however many left service with nothing.
most women indentures who constituted roughly onefourth of the total in the chesapeake worked as domestic servants and were expected to marry when their terms of servitude expired.
by the late seventeenth century the indentured servant population had become one of the largest elements of the colonial population and was creating serious social problems.
some former indentures managed to establish themselves successfully as farmers tradespeople or artisans and time line americas first college harvard founded first printing press in colonies begins operation huguenots migrate to america salem witchcraft trials conclude cotton mather starts smallpox inoculation slave importations increase george whitefield arrives in america great awakening begins zenger trial great awakening intensifies stono slave rebellion 1740s indigo production begins 55 co ns ider t he s o urc e gottlieb mittelberger the passage of indentured servants 1750 gottlieb mittelberger a german laborer traveled to philadelphia in 1750 and chronicled his voyage.
both in rotterdam and in amsterdam the people are packed densely like herrings so to say in the large sea vessels.
one person receives a place of scarcely 2 feet width and 6 feet length in the bedstead while many a ship carries four to six hundred souls not to mention the innumerable implements tools provisions water barrels and other things which likewise occupy such space.
on account of contrary winds it takes the ships sometimes 2 3 and 4 weeks to make the trip from holland to.
but when the wind is good they get there in 8 days or even sooner.
everything is examined there and the custom duties paid whence it comes that the ships ride there 8 10 or 14 days and even longer at anchor till they have taken in their full cargoes.
during that time every one is compelled to spend his last remaining money and to consume his little stock of provisions which had been reserved for the sea so that most passengers finding themselves on the ocean where they would be in greater need of them must greatly suffer from hunger and want.
many suffer want already on the water between holland and old england.
when the ships have for the last time weighed their anchors near the city of kaupp cowes in old england the real misery begins with the long voyage.
for from there the ships unless they have good wind must often sail 8 9 10 to 12 weeks before they reach philadelphia.
but even with the best wind the voyage lasts 7 weeks.
but during the voyage there is on board these ships terrible misery stench fumes horror vomiting many kinds of sea sickness fever dysentery headache heat constipation boils scurvy cancer mouth rot and the 56 like all of which come from old and sharply salted food and meat also from very bad and foul water so that many die miserably.
add to this want of provisions hunger thirst frost heat dampness anxiety want afflictions and lamentations together with other trouble as.
the lice abound so frightfully especially on sick people that they can be scraped off the body.
the misery reaches the climax when a gale rages for 2 or 3 nights and days so that every one believes that the ship will go to the bottom with all human beings on board.
in such a visitation the people cry and pray most piteously.
children from 1 to 7 years rarely survive the voyage.
i witnessed.
misery in no less than 32 children in our ship all of whom were thrown into the sea.
the parents grieve all the more since their children find no resting place in the earth but are devoured by the monsters of the sea.
that most of the people get sick is not surprising because in addition to all other trials and hardships warm food is served only three times a week the rations being very poor and very little.
such meals can hardly be eaten on account of being so unclean.
the water which is served out of the ships is often very black thick and full of worms so that one cannot drink it without loathing even with the greatest thirst.
toward the end we were compelled to eat the ships biscuit which had been spoiled long ago though in a whole biscuit there was scarcely a piece the size of a dollar that had not been full of red worms and spiders nests.
at length when after a long and tedious voyage the ships come in sight of land so that the promontories can be seen which the people were so eager and anxious to see all creep from below on deck to see the land from afar and they weep for joy and pray and sing thanking and praising god.
the sight of the land makes the people on board the ship especially the sick and the half dead alive again so that their hearts leap within them they shout and rejoice and are content to bear their misery in patience in the hope that they may soon reach the land in safety.
when the ships have landed at philadelphia after their long voyage no one is permitted to leave them except those who pay for their passage or can give good security the others who cannot pay must remain on board the ships till they are purchased and are released from the ships by their purchasers.
the sick always fare the worst for the healthy are naturally preferred and purchased first and so the sick and wretched must often remain on board in front of the city for 2 or 3 weeks and frequently die whereas many a one if he could pay his debt and were permitted to leave the ship immediately might recover and remain alive.
the sale of human beings in the market on board the ship is carried out thus every day englishmen dutchmen and high german people come from the city of philadelphia and other places in part from a great distance say 20 30 or 40 hours away and go on board the newly arrived ship that has brought and offers for sale passengers from europe and select among the healthy persons such as they deem suitable for their business and bargain with them how long they will serve for their passage money which most of them are still in debt for.
when they have come to an agreement it happens that adult persons bind themselves in writing to serve 3 4 5 or 6 years for the amount due by them according to their age and strength.
but very young people from 10 to 15 years must serve till they are 21 years old.
many parents must sell and trade away their children like so many head of cattle for if their children take the debt upon themselves the parents can leave the ship free and unrestrained but as the parents often do not know where and to what people their children are going it often happens that such parents and children after leaving the ship do not see each other again for many years perhaps no more in all their lives.
it often happens that whole families husband wife and children are separated by being sold to different purchasers especially when they have not paid any part of their passage money.
when a husband or wife has died at sea when the ship has made more than half of her trip the survivor must pay or serve not only for himself or herself but also for the deceased.
when both parents have died over halfway at sea their children especially when they are young and have nothing to pawn or pay must stand for their own and their parents passage and serve till they are 21 years old.
when one has served his or her term he or she is entitled to a new suit of clothes at parting and if it has been so stipulated a man gets in addition a horse a woman a cow.
when a serf has an opportunity to marry in this country he or she must pay for each year which he or she would have yet to serve 5 or 6 pounds.

what do the ordeals of indentured servants tell us about prospects in europe.
what does it tell us about the concept of liberty in the colonies.
some of the women married propertied men.
others mostly males found themselves without land without employment without families and without prospects.
as a result there emerged in some areas particularly in the chesapeake a large floating population of young single men who were a source of social unrest.
