a dutch ship brought the first africans to virginia in 1619.
some africans were servants others had been enslaved.
some african servants became successful farmers when their contracts ended.
the demand for workers was soon greater than the supply of people willing to work as indentured servants.

maryland in the 1620s george calvert the first lord baltimore asked king charles i for a charter establishing a new colony in america for catholics.
in 1632 charles issued the charter to calvert s son cecilius who took over the planning of the colony.
cecilius known as the second lord baltimore named the colony maryland in honor of england s queen henrietta maria.
it was located just north of virginia in the chesapeake bay area.
calvert intended for the colony to be a refuge for english catholics.
it would also be a proprietary colony.
this meant that the colony s proprietors or owners controlled the government.
in 1634 a group of 200 english catholics came to maryland.
included in the group were wealthy landowners servants craftspeople and farmers.
settlers in maryland benefited from the lessons learned by the jamestown colonists.
they spent their time raising corn cattle and hogs so that they would have enough to eat.

at first carolina was a single colony.
however the settlements were far apart and it was hard to govern them.
in 1712 the colony separated into north and south carolina.
most of the colonists in north carolina were farmers who had moved south from virginia.
colonists primarily from europe settled south carolina.
those who paid their own way received large grants of land and some brought enslaved africans with them.
by 1730 about 20 000 enslaved africans were living in the colony compared to some 10 000 white settlers.

in 1733 oglethorpe and 120 colonists mostly from england founded the city of savannah.
oglethorpe did not want georgia to have large plantations owned by a few wealthy individuals.
he wanted many small farmers.
to reach this goal oglethorpe outlawed slavery and limited the size of land grants.

they also exported materials for building ships such as wood and tar.
some colonies traded with local indians for deerskins to sell.
the colonies had many small farms and some large plantations.
farms did well because the south enjoyed a warm climate and a long growing season.
many farms grew cash crops that were sold for profit.
tobacco rice and indigo a plant used to make blue dye were the most important cash crops.
the southern colonies cash crops required a great deal of difficult work to grow and harvest.
this meant a large workforce was needed.
by the 1700s enslaved africans rather than indentured servants had become the main source of labor.
african slaves brought with them knowledge that helped turn the wild environment into profitable farms.
many had previous experience raising cattle and knew the method for clearing brush using fire.
slavery was a viciously brutal condition for many inhabitants of the southern colonies.
one former slave named olaudah equiano recorded his experiences.
tortures murder and every other imaginable barbarity are practiced upon the poor slaves with impunity no punishment.
i hope the slave trade will be abolished olaudah equiano from the interesting narrative of the life of olaudah equiano or gustavus vassa the african most of the southern colonies passed slave codes or laws to control slaves.

pilgrims and puritans religious tensions in england remained high after the protestant reformation.
a protestant group called the puritans wanted to purify or reform the anglican church.
the puritans thought that bishops and priests had too much power over church members.
pilgrims on the move the most extreme english protestants wanted to separate from the church of england.
these separatists formed their own churches and cut all ties with the church of england.
in response anglican leaders began to punish separatists.
the pilgrims were one separatist group that left england in the early 1600s to escape persecution.
the pilgrims moved to the netherlands in 1608.
the pilgrims were immigrants people who have left the country of their birth to live in another country.
the pilgrims were glad to be able to practice their religion freely.
they were not happy however that their children were chapter 3 learning the dutch language and culture.
the pilgrims feared that their children would forget their english traditions.
the pilgrims decided to leave europe altogether.
they formed a joint stock company with some merchants and then received permission from england to settle in virginia.
on september 16 1620 a ship called the mayflower left england with more than 100 men women and children aboard.
not all of these colonists were pilgrims.
however pilgrim leaders such as william bradford sailed with the group.
the mayflower compact after two months of rough ocean travel the pilgrims sighted land far north of virginia.
the pilgrims knew that they would thus be outside the authority of virginia s colonial government when they landed.
their charter would not apply.
so they decided to establish their own basic laws and social rules to govern the colony they would found.
on november 21 1620 41 of the male passengers on the ship signed the mayflower compact a legal contract in which they agreed to have fair laws to protect the general good.
the compact represents one of the first attempts at self government in the english colonies.
in late 1620 the pilgrims landed at plymouth rock in present day massachusetts.
the colonists struggled through the winter.
nearly half died during this first winter from sickness and the freezing weather but the colony became the first permanent european colony in new england.
pilgrims and native americans in march 1621 a native american named samoset walked boldly into the colonists settlement.
he spoke in broken english.
samoset had learned some english from the crews of english fishing boats.

why do you think the colonists felt the need to establish a government for themselves.
how do you think the mayflower compact influenced later governments in america.
from squanto the pilgrims learned to fertilize the soil with fish remains.
squanto also helped the pilgrims establish relations with the local wampanoag indians.
conditions in the plymouth colony began to improve.
the pilgrims invited wampanoag chief massasoit and 90 other guests to celebrate their harvest.
this feast became known as the first thanksgiving.
for the event the pilgrims killed wild turkeys.
this event marked the survival of the pilgrims in the new colony.
the english colonies 79 pilgrim community although the pilgrims overcame many problems their small settlement still struggled.
most pilgrims became farmers but the farmland around their settlement was poor.
they had hoped to make money by trading furs and by fishing.
unfortunately fishing and hunting conditions were not good in the area.
some colonists traded corn with american indians for beaver furs.
the pilgrims made little money but were able to form a strong community.
the colony began to grow stronger in the mid 1620s after new settlers arrived and as in jamestown colonists began to have more rights to farm their own land.
the pilgrims settlement was different from virginia s in that it had many families.
the pilgrims taught their children to read and offered some education to their indentured servants.
families served as centers of religious life health care and community well being.
all family members worked together to survive during the early years of the colony.
women generally cooked spun and wove wool and sewed clothing.
they also made soap and butter carried water dried fruit and cared for livestock.
men spent most of their time repairing tools and working in the fields.
they also chopped wood and built shelters.
women in the colony in plymouth women had more legal rights than they did in england.
in england women were not allowed to make contracts to sue or to own property.
in america pilgrim women had the right to sign contracts and to bring some cases before local courts.
widows could also own property.
from time to time local courts recognized the ways women helped the business community.
widow naomi silvester received a large share of her husband s estate.
the court called her a frugal thrifty and laborious hardworking woman.
puritans leave england during the 1620s england s economy suffered.
many people lost their jobs.
the english king charles i made the situation worse by raising taxes.
this unpopular act led to a political crisis.
at the same time the church of england began to punish puritans because they were dissenters or people who disagree with official opinions.
king charles refused to allow puritans to criticize church actions.
great migration these economic political and religious problems in england led to the great migration.
between 1629 and 1640 many thousands of english men women and children left england.
more than 40 000 of these people moved to english colonies in new england and the caribbean.
in 1629 charles granted a group of puritans and merchants a charter to settle in new england.
they formed the massachusetts bay company.
in 1630 a fleet of ships carrying puritan colonists left england for massachusetts to seek religious freedom.
they were led by john winthrop.
the puritans believed that they had made a covenant or promise with god to build an ideal christian community.
a new colony the puritans arrived in new england well prepared to start their colony.
they brought large amounts of tools and livestock with them.
like the pilgrims the puritans faced little resistance from local american indians.
trade with the plymouth colony helped them too.
in addition the region around boston had a fairly healthful climate.
thus few puritans died from sickness.
all of these things helped the massachusetts bay colony do well.

analyzing visuals i what ways were plymouth colony and the indian village similar and different.
religion and government in new england massachusetts bay colony had to obey english laws.
however its charter provided more independence than did the royal charter of i virginia.
for example it created a general i court to help run the massachusetts colony t the puritan colonists turned this court into a type of self government to represent the needs of the people.
each town sent two or three delegates to the court.
after john winthrop served as the colony s first governor the general court elected the governor and his assistants.
in 1644 the general court became a two house or bicameral legislature.
politics and religion were closely linked in puritan new england.
government leaders were also church members and ministers often had a great deal of power in puritan communities.
male church members were the only colonists who could vote.
colonists became full members in the church by becoming what the puritans called god s elect or chosen.
reaching this status was a difficult process.
individuals had to pass a public test to prove that their faith was strong.
in 1636 minister thomas hooker and his followers left massachusetts to help found connecticut another new england colony.
the english colonies 81 ri biography anne hutchinson 1591 1643 in 1634 anne hutchinson emigrated with her family from england to the massachusetts bay colony.
after settling in boston she worked as a nurse and midwife.
she also hosted a bible study class that met in her home.
over time hutchinson began to question the teachings of the local ministers.
meanwhile her popularity grew.
after being banished from the colony hutchinson settled in rhode island and later long island.
she died in an american indian attack.
today we remember her as a symbol of the struggle for religious freedom.
drawing conclusions why do you think church leaders disliked hutchinson s ideas.
church and state crs religion affected government government leaders were church members.
ministers had great authority.
government affected religion government leaders outlawed certain religious views.
government leaders punished dissenters.
in 1639 hooker wrote the fundamental orders of connecticut.
this set of principles made connecticut s government more democratic.
for example the orders allowed men who were not church members to vote.
as a result some historians call hooker the father of american democracy.
the fundamental orders of connecticut also outlined the powers of the general courts.
not all puritans shared the same religious views.
minister roger williams did not agree with massachusetts leaders.
he called for his church to separate completely from the other new england congregations.
he also criticized the general court for taking land from american indians without paying them.
puritan leaders worried that williams s ideas might hurt the unity of the colony and they made him leave.
williams took his supporters to southern new england.
they formed a new settlement called providence.
this settlement later developed into the colony of rhode island.
in providence williams supported the separation of the church from the state.
he also believed in religious tolerance for all members of the community.
in boston an outspoken woman also angered puritan church leaders.
anne hutchinson publicly discussed religious ideas that some leaders thought were radical.
for example hutchinson believed that people s relationship with god did not need guidance from ministers.
hutchinson s views alarmed puritans such as john winthrop.
puritan leaders did not believe that women should be religious leaders.
puritan leaders put hutchinson on trial for her ideas.
the court decided to force her out of the colony.
with a group of followers hutchinson helped found the new colony of portsmouth later a part of the colony of rhode island.
although these differences among religious views caused some community conflicts they were also an important step in the development of religious freedom in the colonies.
chapter 3 reading check perhaps the worst community conflicts in new england involved the witchcraft trials of the early 1690s.
the largest number of trials were held in salem massachusetts.
in salem a group of girls had accused people of casting spells on them.
the community formed a special court to judge the witchcraft cases.
the court often pressured the suspected witches to confess.
before the trials had ended the salem witch trials led to 19 people being put to death.
identifying cause and effect what led to religious disagreements among the puritans and what was the result.
new england economy connecticut massachusetts new hampshire and rhode island were very different from the southern colonies.
the often harsh climate and rocky soil meant that few new england farms could grow cash crops.
most farming families grew crops and raised animals for their own use.
there was thus little demand for farm laborers.
although some people held slaves slavery did not become as important to this region.
merchants trade was vital to new england s economy.
new england merchants traded goods locally with other colonies and overseas.
many of them traded local products such as furs pickled beef and pork.
many merchants grew in power and wealth becoming leading members of the new england colonies.
fishing fishing became one of the region s leading industries.
the rich waters off new england s coast served as home to many fish including cod mackerel and halibut.
merchants exported dried fish.
colonists also began hunting for whales that swam close to shore.
whales were captured with harpoons or spears and dragged to shore.
whaling provided valuable oil for lighting.
shipbuilding shipbuilding became an important industry in new england for several reasons.
the area had plenty of forests that provided materials for shipbuilding.
as trade particularly in slaves in the new england seaports grew more merchant ships were built.
the fishing industry also needed ships.
new england shipyards made high quality valuable vessels.
ship owners sometimes even told their captains to sell the ship along with the cargo when they reached their destination.
skilled craftspeople the northern economy needed skilled craftspeople.
families often sent younger sons to learn skilled trades such as blacksmithing weaving shipbuilding and printing.
the young boys who learned skilled trades were known as apprentices.
apprentices lived with a master craftsman and learned from him.
in exchange the boys performed simple tasks.
apprentices promised to work for a master craftsman for a set number of years.
they learned trades that were essential to the survival of the colonies.
apprentices received food and often clothing from the craftsmen.
gabriel ginings for example was an apprentice in portsmouth rhode island.
he received sufficient food and raiment clothing suitable for such an apprentice as his 1663 contract stated.
after a certain amount of time had passed apprentices became journeymen.
they usually traveled and learned new skills in their trade.
eventually they would become a master of the trade themselves.
reading check categorizing what types of jobs were common in the new england colonies.
the impact today education in the colonies education was important in colonial new england.
mothers and fathers wanted their children to be able to read the bible.
the fishing remains an important industry in new england earning hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
the english colonies 83 massachusetts bay colony passed some of the first laws requiring parents to provide instruction for their children.
public education the impact today public schools are the main source of education for most children in the united states.
about 50 million students are enrolled in the nation s public elementary and secondary schools.
to be sure that future generations would have educated ministers communities established town schools.
in 1647 the general court of massachusetts issued an order that a school be founded in every township of 50 families.
schoolchildren often used the new england primer which had characters and stories from the bible.
they learned to read at the same time that they learned about the community s religious values.
the availability of schooling varied in the colonies.
there were more schools in new england than in the other colonies where most children lived far from towns.
these children had to be taught by their parents or by private tutors.
most colonial children stopped their education after the elementary grades.
many went to work either on their family farm or away from home.
higher education higher education was also important to the colonists.

slaves were somewhat more important to the middle colonies than they were to new england.
they worked in cities as skilled laborers such as blacksmiths and carpenters.
other slaves worked on farms onboard ships and in the growing shipbuilding industry.

you would like to move farther west into the ohio river valley.
but a new law says you cannot move west of the mountains because it is too dangerous.

why might you decide to break the law and move west.
f building background when they moved to america the eng i lish colonists brought their ideas about government.
they expected to j i have the same rights as citizens in england.
however many officials f in england wanted tight control over the colonies.
as a result some j colonists like this family were unhappy with the policies of colonial i governments.
i colonial governments the english colonies in north america all had their own governments.
each government was given power by a charter.
the english monarch had ultimate authority over all of the colonies.
a group of royal advisers called the privy council set english colonial policies.
colonial governors and legislatures each colony had a governor who served as head of the government.
most governors were assisted by an advisory council.
in royal colonies the english king or queen selected the governor and the council members.
in proprietary colonies the proprietors chose all of these officials.
in a few colonies such as connecticut the people elected the governor.
in some colonies the people also elected representatives to help make laws and set policy.
these officials served on assemblies.
each colonial assembly passed laws that had to be approved first by the advisory council and then by the governor.
established in 1619 virginia s assembly was the first colonial legislature in north america.
at first it met as a single body but it was later split into two houses.
the first house was known as the council of state.
the governor s advisory council and the london company selected its members.
the house of burgesses was the assembly s second house.
the members were elected by colonists.
it was the first democratically elected body in the english colonies.
in new england the center of politics was the town meeting.
in town meetings people talked about and decided on issues of local interest such as paying for schools.
in the southern colonies people typically lived farther away from one another.
therefore many decisions were made at the county level.
the middle colonies used both county meetings and town meetings to make laws.
political change in england in 1685 james ii became king of england.
he was determined to take more control over the english government both in england and in the colonies.
because the colonies were so distant from the seats of government they had developed many of their own systems of governing and felt a sense of separation from the british government.
james believed that the colonies were too independent.
in 1686 he united the northern colonies under one government called the dominion of new england.
james named sir edmund andros royal governor of the dominion.
the colonists disliked andros because he used his authority to limit the powers of town meetings.
english bill of rights parliament replaced the unpopular king james and passed the english bill of rights in 1689.
this act reduced the powers of the english monarch.
at the same time parliament gained power.

following these changes the colonies in the dominion quickly formed new assemblies and charters.
colonial courts colonial courts made up another important part of colonial governments.
whenever possible colonists used the courts to control local affairs.
in general the courts reflected the beliefs of their local communities.
for example many laws in massachusetts enforced the puritans religious beliefs.
laws based on the bible set the standard for the community s conduct.
sometimes colonial courts also protected individual freedoms.
for example in 1733 officials arrested john peter zenger for printing a statement that damaged the reputation of the governor of new york.
andrew hamilton zenger s attorney argued that zenger could publish whatever he wished as long as it was true.
jury members believed that colonists had a right to voice their ideas openly and found him not guilty.

analyzing information why were colonial assemblies and colonial courts created and what did they do.
english trade laws one of england s main reasons for founding and controlling its american colonies was to earn money from trade.
in the late 1600s england like most western european nations practiced mercantilism a system of creating and maintaining wealth through carefully controlled trade.
a country gained wealth if it had fewer imports goods bought from other countries than exports goods sold to other countries.
to support this system of mercantilism between 1650 and 1696 parliament passed a series of navigation acts limiting colonial trade.
for example the navigation act of 1660 forbade colonists from trading specific items such as sugar and cotton with any country other than england.
the act also required colonists to use english ships to transport goods.
parliament later passed triangular trade other acts that required all trade goods to pass through english ports where duties or import taxes were added to the items.
england claimed that the navigation acts were good for the colonies.
after all the colonies had a steady market in england for their goods.
but not all colonists agreed.
many colonists wanted more freedom to buy or sell goods wherever they could get the best price.
local demand for colonial goods was small compared to foreign demand.
despite colonial complaints the trade restrictions continued into the 1700s.
some traders turned to smuggling or illegal trading.
they often smuggled sugar molasses and rum into the colonies from non english islands in the caribbean.
parliament responded with the molasses act of 1733 which placed duties on these items.
british officials however rarely carried out this law.
by the early 1700s english merchants were trading around the world.
most american merchants traded directly with great britain or the west indies.
by importing and exporting goods such as sugar and tobacco some american merchants became wealthy.
triangular trade trade between the american colonies and great britain was not direct.
rather it generally took the form of triangular trade a system in which goods and slaves were traded among the americas britain and africa.
there were several routes of the triangular trade.
in one route colonists exchanged goods like beef and flour with plantation owners in the west indies for sugar some of which they shipped to britain.
the sugar was then exchanged for manufactured products to be sold in the colonies.
colonial merchants traveled great distances to find the best markets.
olaudah equiano 1745 1797 olaudah equiano claimed to have been born in africa in present day nigeria.
his autobiography told the story of his enslavement.
according to his autobiography equiano survived the middle passage traveling in a slave ship across the atlantic.
after arriving in the colonies a virginia planter purchased him and again sold him to a british naval officer.
while working as a sailor equiano eventually earned enough money to purchase his own freedom in 1766.
equiano later settled in england and devoted himself to ending slavery.
analyzing information how did equiano gain his freedom.
i received such a salutation smell in my nostrils as i had never experienced in my life j became so sick and low that i was not able to eat.
the groans of the dying rendered made the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable unbelievable.
olaudah equiano from the interesting narrative of the life of olaudah equiano or gustavus vassa the african iii 1 the english colonies 93 the great awakening george whitefield gives a powerful sermon during the great awakening.
ministers like whitefield emphasized personal religious experiences over official church rules.
they also allowed ordinary church members whatever their race class or gender to play a role in services.
the value placed on individuals of all types during the great awakening helped shape american political ideas about who should have a say in government.
how do you think religious freedom led to middle passage one version of the triangular trade began with traders exchanging rum for slaves on the west african coast.
the traders then sold the enslaved africans in the west indies for molasses or brought them to sell in the mainland american colonies.
the slave trade brought millions of africans across the atlantic ocean in a voyage called the middle passage.
this was a terrifying and deadly journey that could last as long as three months.
enslaved africans lived in a space not even three feet high.
slave traders fit as many slaves as possible on board so they could earn greater profits.
thousands of captives died on slave ships during the middle passage.
in many cases they died from diseases such as smallpox.
as farmers began to use fewer indentured servants slaves became even more valuable.
reading check identifying cause and effect what factors caused the slave trade to grow.
how did this affect conditions on the middle passage.
great awakening and enlightenment in the early 1700s revolutions in both religious and nonreligious thought transformed the western world.
these european movements affected life in the american colonies.
great awakening religious leaders wanted to spread religious feeling throughout the growing colonial population.
in the late 1730s ministers began holding revivals emotional gatherings where people came together to hear sermons.
many american colonists experienced a great awakening in their religious lives.
this great awakening a religious movement that swept through the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s changed colonial religion.
it also affected social and political life.
jonathan edwards of massachusetts was one of the most important leaders of the great awakening.
his dramatic sermons told sinners to seek forgiveness for their sins or face punishment in hell forever.
the great awakening drew people of different regions classes and races.
women members of minority groups and poor people often took part in services.
ministers from different colonies met and shared ideas with one another.
this represented one of the few exchanges between colonies.
the great awakening promoted ideas that may also have affected colonial politics.
sermons about the spiritual equality of all people led some colonists to begin m chapter 3 demanding more political equality.
revivals became popular places to talk about political and social issues.
people from those colonies with less political freedom were thus introduced to more democratic systems used in other colonies.
enlightenment during the 1600s european scientists began to better understand the basic laws that govern nature.
their new ideas about the universe began the scientific revolution.
the revolution changed how people thought of the world.
in 1675 for example anton van leeuwenhoek became the first to observe microorganisms through a microscope.
many colonists were also influenced by the enlightenment.
this movement which took place during the 1700s spread the idea that reason and logic could improve society.
enlightenment thinkers also formed ideas about how government should work.
they based many of their ideas on the concept of using reason to best achieve virtue and social order.
some enlightenment thinkers believed that there was a social contract between government and citizens.
philosophers such as john locke thought that people had natural rights such as equality and liberty.
one judge william blackstone published a book describing the system of english law.
his ideas about natural laws and rights became influential in colonial legal education.
ideas of the scientific revolution and the enlightenment eventually influenced colonial leaders desire for self government.
summarizing how did new ideas influence colonial society.
french and indian war by the 1670s tensions had arisen between new england colonists and the wampa noag.
metacomet a wampanoag leader also known as king philip opposed the colo reading check nists efforts to take his people s lands.
in 1675 these tensions finally erupted in a conflict known as king philip s war.
the colonial militia civilians serving as soldiers fought american indian warriors.
both sides attacked each other s settlements killing men women and children.
the fighting finally ended in 1676 but only after about 600 colonists and some 3 000 indians had been killed including metacomet.
native american allies some native americans allied with the colonists to fight against metacomet and his forces.
these indians had developed trade relations with colonists.
they wanted tools weapons and other goods that europeans could provide.
in exchange the colonists wanted furs which they sold for large profits in europe.
as a result each side came to depend upon the other.
french colonists traded and allied with the algonquian and huron.
english colonists traded and allied with the iroquois league.
this powerful group united american indians from six different groups.
many american indians trusted the french more than they did the english.
the smaller french settlements were less threatening than the rapidly growing english colonies.
no matter who their allies were many indian leaders took care to protect their people s independence.

british colonists wanted to settle in the ohio river valley where they could the english colonies 95 north american empires before and after the treaty of paris take advantage of the fur trade.
the french believed this settlement would hurt their profits.
a standoff developed in the ohio valley where the french had built three forts.
fighting erupted in 1753 as the british military moved to take over the valley.
when a young virginian named george washington arrived with more soldiers he found the area under french control.
washington and his troops built a small simple fort that he named fort necessity.
after his troops suffered many casualties captured injured or killed soldiers washington finally surrendered.
his defeat in 1754 was the start of the french and indian war.
leaders from the colonies met to discuss defense.
the convention produced a plan for uniting the colonies called the albany plan.
meanwhile in 1756 fighting began in europe starting what became known as the seven years war.
treaty of paris the turning point of the war came in 1759.
that year british general james wolfe captured quebec gaining the advantage in the war.
however the war dragged on for four more years.
finally in 1763 britain and france signed the treaty of paris officially ending the war.
the terms of the treaty gave canada to britain.
britain also gained all french lands east of the mississippi river except the city of new orleans and two small islands in the gulf of st lawrence.
from spain which had allied with france in 1762 britain received florida.
in an earlier treaty spain had received louisiana the land that france had claimed west of the mississippi river.
the treaty of paris changed the balance of power in north america.
soon british settlers began moving west to settle new lands.
western frontier most colonial settlements were located along the atlantic coast.
colonial settlers or pioneers slowly moved into the virgin ia and carolina backcountry and the ohio river valley.
indian leaders like chief pontiac opposed british settlement of this new land.
pontiac s rebellion began in may 1763 when his forces attacked british forts on the frontier.
within one month they had destroyed or captured seven forts.
pontiac then led an attack on fort detroit.
the british held out for months.
british leaders feared that more fighting would take place on the frontier if colonists kept moving onto american indian lands.
to avoid more conflict king george iii issued the proclamation of 1763.
this law banned british settlement west of the appalachian mountains.
the law also ordered settlers to leave the upper ohio river valley.
these limitations angered many colonists and some began to question british policies.

does this information give you any new ideas about the colony you ll use in your infomercial.
the english colonies 97 history and geography as you have read life differed from colony to colony.
the colonies were created with very different goals in mind.
many of the northern colonies were established with the goal of providing religious freedom to the people who lived there.
many of the middle and southern colonies were founded by companies and individual colonists who hoped to make a profit on the resources found there.
eventually however the northern colonies also became centers of business activity.
new england colonies middle colonies southern colonies 100 200 miles 100 200 kilometers 7a chapter 3 v comparing governments economic differences would have long lasting effects on the politics of the regions.
northern merchants and tradespeople began to favor policies that made imported goods more expensive because this increased demand for the goods they produced themselves.
agricultural colonies on the other hand preferred policies that kept the prices of imported goods down because this kept prices for all goods down.
because agricultural colonies did not produce many goods themselves they had to buy most of their household goods.
all colonies formed both local and county governments in order to provide services such as constables and fence inspectors.
both levels of government however had little power because of their limited ability to tax residents.
v k loiisswas ssil comparing economies economic activities were centered on trade in new england agriculture based on slavery in the south and a mix of farming and trade in the middle colonies.
these differences were a result of the contrast among the natural resources in each area.
the south had rich soil and warm temperatures while new england had more rocky soil and a colder climate.
northern colonies also had access to rich fishing grounds and to timber for shipbuilding.
because the merchants and tradespeople in the north needed to work near each other in order for their businesses to thrive the largest cities were in the north.
in every colony the majority of people focused on some type of business venture to earn a profit.
however some colonists especially in the rural areas developed barter economies.
r 7 similarities although there were many differences among the colonies there were also many similarities.
almost none of the colonists who arrived from england were members of the english aristocracy.
the colonies were seen as a place where anyone could become prosperous.
in addition each colony had small communities of non english colonists.
german irish scots irish welsh and dutch communities existed throughout the colonies.
each colony at one time or another bordered native american land.

british officials also tried harder to arrest smugglers.
colonial merchants were required to list all the trade goods they carried aboard their ships.
these lists had to be approved before ships could leave colonial ports.
this made it difficult for traders to avoid paying duties.
the british navy also began to stop and search ships for smuggled goods.
8 chapter 3 parliament also changed the colonies legal system by giving greater powers to the vice admiralty courts.
these courts had no juries and the judges treated suspected smugglers as guilty until proven innocent.
in regular british courts accused persons were treated as innocent until proven guilty.
taxation without representation parliament s actions upset many colonists who had grown used to being independent.
the rising merchant class thought the taxes were unfair and hurt business.
many believed that great britain had no right to tax the colonies at all without popular consent.
james otis argued that the power of the crown and parliament was limited.
otis said they could not take from any man any part of his property without his consent in person or by representation.
colonial assemblies had little influence on parliament s decisions.
in addition the colonists had no direct representatives in parliament.
the colonists were subjects of the crown instead of citizens of england.
at a boston town meeting in may 1764 local leader samuel adams agreed with otis.
he believed that parliament could not tax the colonists without their permission.
the ideas of otis and adams were summed up in the slogan no taxation without representation which spread throughout the colonies.
adams helped found the committees of correspondence each committee got in touch with other towns and colonies.
its members shared ideas and information about the new british laws and ways to challenge them.
a popular method of protest was the boycott in which people refused to buy british goods.
the first colonial boycott started in new york in 1765.
it soon spread to other colonies.
colonists hoped that their efforts would hurt the british economy and might convince parliament to end the new taxes.
the english colonies 99 stamp act the british government continued to search for new ways to tax the american colonies further angering many colonists.
for example prime minister grenville proposed the stamp act of 1765.
this act required colonists to pay for an official stamp or seal when they bought paper items.
the tax had to be paid on legal documents licenses newspapers pamphlets and even playing cards.
colonists who refused to buy stamps could be fined or sent to jail.
grenville did not expect this tax to spark protest.
after all in britain people already paid similar taxes.
but colonists saw it differently.
the stamp act was parliament s first attempt to raise money by taxing the colonists directly rather than by taxing imported goods.
protests against the stamp act began almost immediately.
colonists formed a secret society called the sons of liberty.
samuel adams helped organize the group in boston.
this group sometimes used violence to frighten tax collectors.
many colonial courts shut down because people refused to buy the stamps required for legal documents.
businesses openly ignored the law by refusing to buy stamps.
in may 1765 a virginia lawyer named patrick henry presented a series of resolutions to the virginia house of burgesses.
these resolutions stated that the stamp act violated colonists rights.
in addition to taxation without representation the stamp act denied the accused a trial by jury.
henry s speech in support of the resolutions convinced the assembly to support some of his ideas.
repealing the stamp act in boston the members of the massachusetts legislature called for a stamp act congress.
in october 1765 delegates from nine colonies met in new york.
they issued a declaration that the stamp act was a violation of their rights and liberties.
pressure on parliament to repeal or do away with the stamp act grew quickly.
a group of london merchants complained that their trade suffered from the colonial boycott.
parliament repealed the stamp act in 1766.
members of parliament were upset that colonists had challenged their authority.
thus parliament issued the declaratory act which stated that parliament had the power to make laws for the colonies in all cases whatsoever.
the declaratory act further worried the colonists.
the act stripped away much of their independence.
townshend acts in june 1767 parliament passed the townshend acts.
these acts placed duties on glass lead paints paper and tea.
to enforce the townshend acts british officials used writs of assistance.
these allowed tax collectors to search for smuggled goods.
colonists hated the new laws because they took power away from colonial governments.
the colonists responded to the townshend acts by once again boycotting many british goods.
women calling themselves the daughters of liberty supported the boycott.
in february 1768 samuel adams wrote a letter arguing that the laws violated the legal rights of the colonists.
the massachusetts legislature sent the letter to other colonies legislatures who voted to join the protest.
at the same time tax collectors in massachusetts seized the ship liberty on suspicion of smuggling.
this action angered the ship s owner and the sons of liberty.
they attacked the houses of customs officials in protest.
in response the governor broke up the massachusetts legislature.
he also asked troops to restore order.
british soldiers arrived in boston in october 1768.

a lone british soldier standing guard had an argument with a colonist and struck him.
a crowd gathered around the soldier throwing snowballs and shouting insults.
soon a small number of troops arrived.

the boston tea party to reduce tensions in the colonies parliament repealed almost all of the townshend acts.
however it kept the tax on tea.
british officials knew that the colonial demand for tea was high despite the boycott.
but colonial merchants were smuggling most of this imported tea and paying no duty on it.
the british east india company offered parliament a solution.
the company had huge amounts of tea but was not allowed to sell it directly to the colonists.
if the company could sell directly to the colonists it could charge low prices and still make money.
cheaper tea might encourage colonists to stop smuggling.
less smuggling would result in more tax money.
parliament agreed and passed the tea act in 1773 which allowed the british east india company to sell tea directly to the colonists.
many colonial merchants and smugglers feared that the british east india company s cheap tea would put them out of business.
three ships loaded with tea from the british east india company arrived in boston harbor in 1773.
members of the sons of liberty demanded that the ships leave.
but the governor of massachusetts would not let the ships leave without paying the duty.
unsure of what to do the captains waited in the harbor.
on the night of december 16 1773 colonists disguised as indians sneaked onto the three tea filled ships and dumped over 340 tea chests into boston harbor.
